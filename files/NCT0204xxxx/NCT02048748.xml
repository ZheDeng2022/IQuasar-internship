    <textblock>
      Remote monitoring of chronic heart failure can reduce deaths and hospitalisations, and may&#xD;
      provide benefits on health care costs and quality of life. Currently there is limited use of&#xD;
      remote monitoring for heart failure in Norway. The funding streams and the structure of the&#xD;
      norwegian health service is different from other countries that have tried remote monitoring&#xD;
      and therefore it is important to examine the utility of such services in Norway. The study is&#xD;
      a randomised controlled trial that will allow participants in the intervention group to use a&#xD;
      wireless weight scale and blood pressure monitor device that will send automatically the&#xD;
      measurements electronically and securely to the Heart Failure Outpatient Clinic of the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Providing patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) access to remote monitoring, for example&#xD;
      by telephone or telemonitoring using wireless technology, reduces deaths and hospitalisations&#xD;
      and may provide benefits on health care costs and quality of life. Remote monitoring of&#xD;
      patients can reduce pressure on resources, particularly for conditions like chronic heart&#xD;
      failure, which exert a large burden on health services. These are conclusions of a Cochrane&#xD;
      Systematic Review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway the costs for treatment of chronic heart failure are vast, both concerning hospital&#xD;
      treatment, daily use of medication over years, and loss of quality of life for patients and&#xD;
      their family caregivers. Generally there is little knowledge about what is gained for the&#xD;
      billions used. In Norway no telemonitoring services are established and hence no&#xD;
      investigations have yet been published. Thus it seems that current evidence of effectiveness&#xD;
      and quality is insufficient to recommend usage. The structure and funding streams in&#xD;
      Norwegian health services are different from other countries and the conventional services&#xD;
      that the intervention has been compared to in previous studies, are most likely&#xD;
      heterogeneous. It is thus important to investigate Norwegian conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced telemonitoring technology with electronic transfer of physiological data such as&#xD;
      blood pressure and weight is currently being used in research and established routine&#xD;
      services in several countries in Europe, amongst them the Netherlands, Germany and the United&#xD;
      Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project intends to introduce such a strategy as an avenue for exploring&#xD;
      promising new services that would not otherwise be available in Norway. The service consists&#xD;
      of daily monitoring the patients' weight and blood pressure directly from their home;&#xD;
      automatically and securely transmit the values to a server at UNN; and monitor the values by&#xD;
      a trained nurse at the Heart polyclinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is thus to explore whether, as compared to current care&#xD;
      from the heart polyclinic, the introduction of home telemonitoring will reduce hospital&#xD;
      readmissions and will, in addition, be cost-effective. This is in line with the recent&#xD;
      directions of European telemonitoring programmes for patients with chronic heart failure.&#xD;
      This result may define if the telemonitoring of heart failure patients is feasible for Norway&#xD;
      or not at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying successful innovations to be introduced into the Norwegian health care services&#xD;
      is a condition for more cost effectiveness and better treatment quality.&#xD;
