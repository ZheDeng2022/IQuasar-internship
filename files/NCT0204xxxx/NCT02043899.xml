  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to show that 3-dimensional PET/CT imaging with a new novel PET tracer (called&#xD;
      [124I]mIBG) can detect as many or more sites of neuroblastoma (a type of childhood cancer)&#xD;
      compared to the recommended 1-dimensional routine scans (called [123I]mIBG planar&#xD;
      scintigraphy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is the most common tumour of childhood after brain tumours. Approximately half&#xD;
      of cases are high risk and despite extensive treatments outcome is very poor. More than 60%&#xD;
      of high risk patients suffer relapse or further spread of their disease and long-term&#xD;
      survival is below 10%. Existing imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to accurately&#xD;
      assess the level of risk which is critical in determining the best choice of treatment. This&#xD;
      study will compare a new type of imaging against the existing imaging techniques. The new&#xD;
      scans use a new tracer called [124I]mIBG which is taken up by the cancer tissue much more&#xD;
      than by normal tissues. This tracer can be used with a 3D imaging technique called PET/CT to&#xD;
      pinpoint where the disease has spread and quantify the amount of disease. Patients will be&#xD;
      those scheduled to have an [123I]mIBG scan for routine care during a planned break in&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparison of the Number of Lesions Detected as Positive by [123I]mIBG Planar Scintigraphy Which Are Also Considered Positive With [124I]mIBG PET/CT.</measure>
    <time_frame>[124I]mIBG PET/CT imaging on Day 1, three to 21 days after routine [123I]mIBG imaging and before the start of any new anti-cancer therapy. A minimum interval of 72 hours was required between injection of [123I]mIBG tracer and the [124I]mIBG PET/CT scan.</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of [124I]mIBG PET/CT and [123I]mIBG planar scintigraphy was performed retrospectively by four specialist observers. The analysis was performed and observers were blinded to each others scores. The observers subsequently reviewed the lesions identified and, where there was a difference in their separate scores, they returned to the images in order to reach an agreed consensus score. The number of lesions identified as positive by this consensus scoring (all lesions with a SIOPEN score of 4 or 5) were used to meet the primary objective.</description>

The activity to paediatric patients will be scaled by weight based upon the EANM paediatric dose card (Lassmann et al., 2007).

          <description>[124I]meta-Iodobenzylguanidine: Single intravenous administration of [124I]mIBG Solution for Injection on Day 1 with a maximum radioactive dose of 1.42 MBq/kg (±10%) and a maximum injected dose of 50 MBq [124I]mIBG equating to a maximum chemical dose of 10 micrograms of stable mIBG. The activity to paediatric patients will be scaled by weight based upon the EANM paediatric dose card (Lassmann et al., 2007). This will result in an activity between 10 MBq and 50 MBq depending on the patient's weight.</description>

        <description>Analysis of [124I]mIBG PET/CT and [123I]mIBG planar scintigraphy was performed retrospectively by four specialist observers. The analysis was performed and observers were blinded to each others scores. The observers subsequently reviewed the lesions identified and, where there was a difference in their separate scores, they returned to the images in order to reach an agreed consensus score. The number of lesions identified as positive by this consensus scoring (all lesions with a SIOPEN score of 4 or 5) were used to meet the primary objective.</description>

          <description>[124I]meta-Iodobenzylguanidine: Single intravenous administration of [124I]mIBG Solution for Injection on Day 1 with a maximum radioactive dose of 1.42 MBq/kg (±10%) and a maximum injected dose of 50 MBq [124I]mIBG equating to a maximum chemical dose of 10 micrograms of stable mIBG. The activity to paediatric patients will be scaled by weight based upon the EANM paediatric dose card (Lassmann et al., 2007). This will result in an activity between 10 MBq and 50 MBq depending on the patient's weight.</description>
