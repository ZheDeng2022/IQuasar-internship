  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a worldwide trend to minimally invasive interventions, which results in increasing&#xD;
      numbers of interventions performed outside of the operating room. Currently, approximately 12&#xD;
      to 15% of total anaesthetic workload is non-operating room anaesthesia (NORA) and this&#xD;
      anaesthetic activity is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these interventions need supplementary comfort measures to have relaxed patients and&#xD;
      high success rates. Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is performed&#xD;
      &gt;50,000 times per year in the U.S.,and is a typical minimally invasive intervention that&#xD;
      needs patient sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a controversy about the optimal comfort intervention in minimally invasive&#xD;
      interventions and in particular in ERCP. Two different approaches to insure patients' comfort&#xD;
      have been proposed: general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation and mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation or sedation with spontaneous ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well-performed studies on sedation versus general anaesthesia using a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial design with observer blinding will contribute to improve the decision-making for the&#xD;
      optimal comfort measures in minimally invasive procedures. At our knowledge such a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial has not been reported before. The investigators hypothesize that deep&#xD;
      sedation without tracheal intubation will achieve similar success rates for ERCP as general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and will have similar rates of harmful postoperative effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to demonstrate that the success rate of ERCP is not inferior&#xD;
      in patients randomized to deep sedation without orotracheal intubation vs general anesthesia&#xD;
      with orotracheal intubation. Secondary aims include a comparison between randomization groups&#xD;
      of patient safety, patient and endoscopist satisfaction, duration of patient recovery and of&#xD;
      anesthesia procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      What may be the benefits of general anaesthesia? In one retrospective study of more than 1000&#xD;
      patients, the ERCP failure rate with general anaesthesia was half compared to that observed&#xD;
      with moderate sedation (7% versus 14%), with most failures resulting from inadequate&#xD;
      sedation. It has also been reported that complication rates associated with therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions during ERCP may be significantly lower when general anaesthesia is used,&#xD;
      perhaps because the absence of patient movement makes the procedure technically less&#xD;
      difficult. When general anaesthesia is administered for ERCP, the airway is protected by&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation which may decrease risk for broncho-aspiration in some patients,&#xD;
      although this measure has not been demonstrated to be effective in patients at risk during&#xD;
      digestive endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, aspiration at the time of in/ex-tubation as well as micro-aspiration of contaminated&#xD;
      upper airway secretions along leaks and defects of the tracheal cuff seal is not excluded if&#xD;
      standard endotracheal tubes are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What may be the harms of general anaesthesia? Intubation and extubation manoeuvres may&#xD;
      prolong endoscopic room occupation time, post-anaesthesia care unit stay may be longer and&#xD;
      about 30 to 70% of patients will suffer from sore throat (this is reduced if lidocaine is&#xD;
      used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, orotracheal intubation may induce short time hemodynamic changes related to&#xD;
      laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What may be the benefits of deep sedation? The main advantage of sedation is probably the&#xD;
      faster turnover in the intervention room. In the sole practice survey of anesthesiologists&#xD;
      for endoscopy that is available, 81% of anaesthesiologists stated that they were using&#xD;
      sedation, not general anesthesia, for ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep sedation with propofol during digestive endoscopy has been shown to be superior to&#xD;
      moderate sedation with a combination of benzodiazepine plus opioid in many aspects, including&#xD;
      better patient cooperation, shorter recovery time and lower number of desaturation events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Switzerland, sedation during ERCP is obtained using benzodiazepines or propofol in similar&#xD;
      proportions of cases and, when propofol is used, it is administered by the endoscopist or&#xD;
      nurse in two thirds of cases and by the anaesthesiologist in one third of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from prospective studies suggests that complex procedures, including therapeutic&#xD;
      ERCP, may be performed safely under deep sedation without tracheal intubation using propofol,&#xD;
      even in high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What may be harms of deep sedation? In a large study including nearly 10'000 patients,&#xD;
      adverse events were observed in 1.4% of patients sedated using propofol. In that study,&#xD;
      adverse events were defined as premature termination of the procedure due to sedation-related&#xD;
      events (most often related to hypoxemia) or the need for assisted ventilation or, very&#xD;
      rarely, admission to intensive care unit.&#xD;
