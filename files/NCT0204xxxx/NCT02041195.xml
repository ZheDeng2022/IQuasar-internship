  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a new daily subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injectable formulation of RM-493 in healthy obese subjects on mean percent body weight loss&#xD;
      and other weight loss parameters, as well as Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. The study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of RM-493 administered once or twice&#xD;
      daily. The study drug (RM-493 and placebo) will be administered in a blinded fashion.&#xD;
