    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and&#xD;
      efficacy of TPI 287 in combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) in subjects who have&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) that has progressed following prior radiation and temozolomide&#xD;
      (TMZ) therapy and that has progressed following prior bevacizumab therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center trial is a phase 2, dose-escalation study of the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      (MTD), and efficacy of TPI 287 in combination with bevacizumab in subjects who have GBM that&#xD;
      has progressed following prior radiation and TMZ therapy and that has progressed following&#xD;
      prior bevacizumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be administered TPI 287 as an intravenous (IV) infusion (target duration of&#xD;
      1 hour) once every 3 weeks (Days 1 and 22 of a 42-day cycle) and bevacizumab as a 30 to 90&#xD;
      minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, and 29 of the 42-day cycle). The&#xD;
      subsequent cycle will start 3 weeks after the last TPI 287 infusion and 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      last bevacizumab infusion, maintaining the once every 3 week and once every 2 week schedule,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of TPI 287 will be escalated in sequential dose cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects, while&#xD;
      the dose of bevacizumab remains constant (10 mg/kg). The initial cohort of 3 subjects will be&#xD;
      treated at a TPI 287 dose of 140 mg/m2 (dose level 0). The next dose level will be 160 mg/m2&#xD;
      (dose level 1). Subsequent dose levels will be increased in increments of 10 mg/m2 (i.e.,&#xD;
      dose level 2 = 170 mg/m2, dose level 3 = 180 mg/m2, etc.). If dose de-escalation below the&#xD;
      starting dose level is required, dose levels of 130 and 120 mg/m2 will be used. Twelve (12)&#xD;
      to 18 subjects are planned for enrollment during the dose escalation phase, depending on the&#xD;
      number of subjects that experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is identified, 6 additional subjects will be enrolled at the MTD (for a total of&#xD;
      12) to better characterize the toxicity profile at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose modifications and delays will be required as described in the protocol. Subjects may&#xD;
      continue on treatment unless they meet one or more of the discontinuation criteria outlined&#xD;
      in the protocol. Subjects who are discontinued prior to completing Cycle 1 for any reason&#xD;
      other than toxicity will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a diary to record any AEs or concomitant medications taken between&#xD;
      visits. Additional safety evaluations will include physical examination (including neurologic&#xD;
      examination), Karnofsky performance status (KPS), weight (body surface area, BSA), vital&#xD;
      signs, hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluations will include magnetic resonance imaging [MRI, including both pre and&#xD;
      post-gadolinium T1-weighted scans and T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images],&#xD;
      corticosteroid usage, and neurologic status (as measured by neurologic exam and KPS).&#xD;
