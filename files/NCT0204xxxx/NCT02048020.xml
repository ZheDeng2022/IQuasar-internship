  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel and carboplatin before radiation therapy with&#xD;
      paclitaxel works in treating human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive patients with stage III-IV&#xD;
      oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells. Giving paclitaxel and carboplatin before radiation therapy with paclitaxel may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival at 2 years in patients with HPV-positive head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who receive induction chemotherapy followed by dose&#xD;
      de-intensified chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall survival and local-regional control for patients with&#xD;
      HPV-positive HNSCC who receive induction chemotherapy and dose de-intensified&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the incidence of acute grade 3+ mucosal and esophageal toxicity associated&#xD;
      with attenuated concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the incidence of late toxicity in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC who&#xD;
      receive the dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the incidence of all toxicity (hematologic and non-hematologic) associated&#xD;
      with protocol treatment for all patients on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the response rate of HPV-positive to induction chemotherapy using carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the effect of reduced radiation dose on short-term and long-term quality of&#xD;
      life among patients treated by chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: At least 2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly and undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IMRT) daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, and 12 months, every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>The true 2-year progression-free survival rate will be estimated by the proportion of efficacy-evaluable patients on study without documentation of disease progression or death 2 years from registration. A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the true progression-free survival rate will be constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach. However, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the final 2-year progression-free survival rate and its 95% CI in case there are censored patients.</description>
