      Although regorafenib was approved for use in patients who had progressive GIST despite&#xD;
      imatinib and/or sunitinib on the basis of phase II and phase III data, it has not been&#xD;
      examined in a systematic fashion in patients with other forms of sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the activity of sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas, and&#xD;
      evidence of activity of sorafenib in osteogenic sarcoma and possibly Ewing/Ewing-like&#xD;
      sarcoma, there is precedent to examine SMOKIs (small molecule oral kinase inhibitors) such as&#xD;
      regorafenib in sarcomas other than GIST. It is also recognized that SMOKIs (small molecule&#xD;
      oral kinase inhibitors)such as regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and sunitinib have&#xD;
      overlapping panels of kinases that are inhibited simultaneously. While not equivalent, most&#xD;
      of these SMOKIs (small molecule oral kinase inhibitors) block vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor and platelet derived growth factors receptors (VEGFRs and PDGFRs), speaking to a&#xD;
      common mechanism of action of several of these agents.&#xD;
