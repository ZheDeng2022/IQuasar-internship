      1. Investigate the safety and effectiveness of a single dose of IV Ketamine for adolescents&#xD;
           with suicidal ideation and depression. It is hypothesize that Ketamine will be well&#xD;
           tolerated and significantly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore whether decision making as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task changes before and&#xD;
           after Ketamine infusion. It is hypothesize that IV Ketamine infusion will significantly&#xD;
           improve the decision making ability a measured by the Iowa Gambling Task in adolescents&#xD;
           that are suicidal.&#xD;

      This is an open prospective study of a single, low dose (0.5 mg/kg) intravenous (IV) Ketamine&#xD;
      in 10 adolescent subjects admitted to Nationwide Childrens Hospital following a serious&#xD;
      suicide attempt and who meet criteria for major depression or bipolar disorder I, current&#xD;
      episode depressed. Subjects will be recruited via the psychiatry consult service, evaluated&#xD;
      on the floor and if eligible and consent is obtained, transferred to the PACU for IV Ketamine&#xD;
      infusion. Following infusion and when PACU discharge criteria are met, subjects will be&#xD;
      transferred back to their floor for medical and psychiatric monitoring until they can be&#xD;
      transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for additional care. Subjects will be&#xD;
      transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for continued psychiatric care as part of their&#xD;
      routine psychiatric care via the consult team. The research team will follow-up by telephone&#xD;
      one week and four weeks after Ketamine injection to collect additional information about the&#xD;
      patient's overall course and response.&#xD;
