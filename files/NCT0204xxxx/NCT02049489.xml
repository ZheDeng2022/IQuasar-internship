      This study will evaluate a type of immunotherapy in which the patient's immune system will be&#xD;
      stimulated to kill tumor cells. ICT-121 dendritic cell (DC)vaccine is made from patient's&#xD;
      white blood cells. This vaccine will be tested in patients with recurrent glioblastoma to&#xD;
      assess safety, tolerability and clinical response. Patient's white blood cells (WBC) will be&#xD;
      collected from blood and cultured to yield autologous DC. The DC will be mixed with purified&#xD;
      peptides from the CD133 antigen. The DC vaccine will be given back to the patient over&#xD;
      several months. The goal is to stimulate the patient's immune system to CD133 to kill the&#xD;
      patient's glioblastoma tumor cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy holds promise in oncology for the potential to provide targeted anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapy with minimal adverse events. The goal of this study is to assess immunotherapy&#xD;
      directed to CD133 in an autologous dendritic cell product called ICT-121. CD133 antigen is&#xD;
      overexpressed on many types of cancer cells and is associated with shortened survival. CD133&#xD;
      positive cancer stem cells are resistant to chemotherapy. Patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma who have the HLA A2 phenotype will receive autologous vaccine of DC pulsed with&#xD;
      purified peptides from CD133.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 patients with any recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) will be&#xD;
      treated. After informed consent and screening, patients will undergo apheresis to collect&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Monocytes will be purified and cultured into&#xD;
      dendritic cells (DC) that are pulsed with purified peptides from CD133 antigen. The pulsed&#xD;
      dendritic cells will then be aliquoted and frozen. Patients will have the autologous DCs&#xD;
      reinfused intradermally. Patients will receive at least four intradermal injections of the&#xD;
      autologous DC vaccine and additional vaccines during a maintenance phase. The goal is to&#xD;
      induce a cytotoxic T cell response to CD133 positive cells. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to assess safety and tolerability. Clinical response rates will be monitored as well&#xD;
      as the immune responses to CD133.&#xD;
