  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intents to provide an initial evaluation of the utility of positron emission&#xD;
      tomography and magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging measures for the prediction of&#xD;
      immunological response to Sipuleucel T (SipT) therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies of treatments of prostate cancer through stimulation of adaptive immune&#xD;
      response have indicated the linear measurements by computed tomography (CT) and nuclear scans&#xD;
      used to assess tumor response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were&#xD;
      inadequate and the value of progression-free survival (PFS) as a predictive surrogate&#xD;
      endpoint of survival was lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to provide an initial evaluation of the utility of PET/MR&#xD;
      imaging measures for the prediction of immunological response to SipT therapy. Investigators&#xD;
      expect to identify an&quot;imaging-signature&quot; of response to SipT based on changes in metabolism,&#xD;
      perfusion, oxygenation and cellularity of metastasis and its correlation with immunological&#xD;
      and clinical response. This approach will help elucidate the mechanism of activity and&#xD;
      dynamics of immune antitumor responses to SipT in vivo and to identify new parameters of&#xD;
      tumor response and predictive value than current RECIST and PFS standards.&#xD;
