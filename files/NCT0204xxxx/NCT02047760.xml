  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that examining our eyes can tell us a lot of information about&#xD;
      our health, and systemic diseases. We want to study what eyes can reveal about serious&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis, and motor neurone disease, by analysing&#xD;
      the retinal images from a simple non-invasive eye scan, that is already being routinely used&#xD;
      to provide immediate clinical information in this group of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The identification of reliable biomarkers in multiple sclerosis (MS), and other&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases, has become increasingly important with the development of&#xD;
      disease-modifying treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of genetic, metabolic and imaging biomarkers exist, in correlations with diagnosis,&#xD;
      phenotypic expression, inflammation, degeneration and prognosis; although there is wide&#xD;
      variation in specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MS specifically, we know that whilst the primary pathological process is demyelination of&#xD;
      neurones (which can be accompanied by inflammation, and resolving symptoms), it is the&#xD;
      subsequent axonal loss - neurodegeneration - that gives rise to the permanent functional&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans are currently our primary source of objective&#xD;
      information in assessing MS disease status, in terms of neurodegeneration and possibly&#xD;
      prognosis. Measurements of brain atrophy have shown worsening rates are higher in untreated&#xD;
      MS patients compared with healthy controls and also correlate with subsequent disability&#xD;
      status eight years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, brain atrophy measures sometimes reveal paradoxical outcomes, particularly of white&#xD;
      matter atrophy, where normal or increased volume as a result of pathological processes, such&#xD;
      as tissue damage and repair, can impact upon the measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search then for other markers of neurodegenerative disease status and prognosis&#xD;
      continues, with renewed interest in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MS, early work has suggested certain retinal measures, particularly the width of the layer&#xD;
      that consists largely of retinal ganglion cell nerve axons, as candidate biomarkers, under&#xD;
      the hypothesis that neuroretinal tissue reflects global central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      pathology. Conceptually, this would seem reasonable, given the frequency for anterior visual&#xD;
      pathway involvement as the primary presentation of MS; and in addition, the unmyelinated&#xD;
      ganglion cell axons that form the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) are a direct extension of&#xD;
      the brain, and global neurodegeneration would be expected to involve these neurones -&#xD;
      particularly in MS, where the disease lesions have a predilection for the periventricular&#xD;
      regions, which are in close proximity to the optic radiations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the natural history of neuroretinal tissue integrity is poorly understood, and in&#xD;
      vivo measurement is a very new modality, requiring validation and context to any&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, retinal imaging permits the direct visualisation, and subsequent analysis, of&#xD;
      the retinal vasculature - shown in studies of stroke and hypertension to be an accurate&#xD;
      representation of brain vasculature, with diagnostic and prognostic potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, a combined score of neuroretinal integrity as measured by retinal imaging may&#xD;
      yield new insights into sever neurodegenerative disease.&#xD;
