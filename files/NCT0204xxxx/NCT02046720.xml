  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bispectral index (BIS) is commonly used in anesthesia to evaluate the depth of sedation.&#xD;
      Numerous studies in adults have shown good correlation between bispectral index values and&#xD;
      depth of sedation regardless of the hypnotic drug used. Requirements of intravenous and&#xD;
      inhalational hypnotic agents to suppress consciousness decrease with age. A study showed that&#xD;
      the loss of consciousness (LOC) was obtained with lower concentrations of sevoflurane in&#xD;
      elderly than in young adults, but at identical BIS values, so that BIS would predict depth of&#xD;
      sedation better than drug monitoring. This result incited the use of bispectral index&#xD;
      monitoring to overcome the significant pharmacological variability, especially in elderly.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, another research with a comparable methodology during propofol-induced&#xD;
      anaesthesia provided higher BIS values at LOC in elderly compared to younger patients. In&#xD;
      these two trials, LOC was defined differently: either by absence of verbal response&#xD;
      corresponding to loss of eyelash reflex (LOER) or by absence of response to prodding [(OAA/S)&#xD;
      &lt;2)]. Otherwise electromyographic activity (EMG) was not taken in account. As high EMG level&#xD;
      (greater than 50 decibels) could create subtle artifact signal pollution without necessarily&#xD;
      being displayed as artifacts, this would be misinterpreted by the BIS algorithm as EEG&#xD;
      activity and assigned a spuriously increased BIS value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study was to specifically evaluate BIS values according to age&#xD;
      during propofol-induced sedation. LOC was measured by obtaining an OAA/S score &lt;2 (OAA/S2),&#xD;
      or a deeper sedation criterion: loss of eyelash reflex (LOER). The secondary objective was to&#xD;
      specify the influence of EMG on the displayed BIS values and its age-related modifications.&#xD;

      The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Saint-Etienne University Hospital.&#xD;
      After informed consent, 70 patients over 18 years of age, ASA I to III, scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were the presence of heart, respiratory, hepatic or renal failure; a&#xD;
      psychiatric or neurological pathology, severe depression or dementia; gastro-oesophageal&#xD;
      reflux, hiatal hernia; drug addiction or chronic alcoholism; obesity with a body mass index&#xD;
      greater than 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients received no pre-medication. After insertion of a venous line, a Ringer's Lactate&#xD;
      perfusion was initiated. Oxygen therapy at a rate of 4 litres per minute was administered in&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation. In case of hypoventilation (saturation (SaO2) &lt;95% and/or end-tidal&#xD;
      carbon dioxide concentration (EtCO2) &gt;42 mmHg, manual ventilation with a mask at 10 l/min of&#xD;
      O2 was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol was administered using a commercially available target-controlled infusion with an&#xD;
      incorporated pharmacokinetic model developed by Schnider (Base Primea , Fresenius-Kabi,&#xD;
      Brezins, FRANCE). The initial effect-site target concentration of propofol (0.5 μg/ml) was&#xD;
      incremented by 0.5 μg/ml every 5 minutes to ensure equilibration between plasma concentration&#xD;
      and effect site, until LOER. From the beginning of infusion until LOER patients received no&#xD;
      other agent besides propofol for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOC was evaluated by an independent observer using two different criteria: OAA/S score &lt;2&#xD;
      (OAA/S2) corresponding to the absence of response to moderate prodding and LOER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize interactions between verbal or tactile stimulations and BIS values, BIS values&#xD;
      were collected before evaluation of the OAA/S score and eyelash reflex check. Time to OAA/S2&#xD;
      and time to LOER were measured as well as corresponding brain and plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalographic activity was monitored by BIS Quatro XP platform® electrodes and a&#xD;
      BIS VISTA™ 1.01 monitor (Aspect medical system, MA, USA). The impedance of each electrode was&#xD;
      kept below 5 kΩ. The sensor were reapplied if the quality of the detected signal was not&#xD;
      suitable to provide a reliable BIS score i.e a signal quality index (SQI) better than 50%.&#xD;
      The trace was displayed in real time and calculated data (BIS, SQI, and EMG) were recorded&#xD;
      continuously using the archiving function integrated in the monitor. A 30 second smoothing&#xD;
      period was set to minimize the variability and sensitivity of artifacts. BIS values were&#xD;
      validated throughout the trial by SQI values greater than 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before induction and at the end of each propofol concentration level, BIS, EMG and SQI values&#xD;
      were recorded. As soon as the OAA/S score was less than or equal to 4, the OAA/S score and&#xD;
      eyelash reflex were evaluated every 2 minutes independently of the increase in effect-site&#xD;
      concentration of propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial pressure, heart rate, SaO2, EtCO2 were measured before induction and then every 5&#xD;
      minutes until the end of trial. A decrease in systolic arterial pressure ≥20 was considered&#xD;
      as hypotension, and heart rate &lt;45 defined bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were included consecutively and assigned to one of the two groups according to their&#xD;
      age: &quot;young&quot; 18 to 64 years (G1) and &quot;elderly&quot; aged 65 years and over (G2). As previously&#xD;
      described, we considered that a difference of 15 units between the mean BIS values at LOC&#xD;
      according to age was clinically pertinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the required number of subjects was carried out to identify a difference of 15&#xD;
      units in the mean BIS value at LOC between both groups with a power of 90%, a 5% alpha risk,&#xD;
      and an identical variability for these 2 groups (SD = 20). Thirty-five patients have to be&#xD;
      included in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data were compared by a chi-squared test or when indicated by a Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test. After verification of the normality of their distribution by a Kolmogorov Smirnov&#xD;
      test, quantitative data were compared by a Student's t-test. A linear regression was used to&#xD;
      measure the effect of age on BIS and EMG values at OAA/S2 and LOER. All the statistical&#xD;
      analysis were performed using JMP 6 (SAS Institute Inc, Carry, NC, USA). Values p&lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
