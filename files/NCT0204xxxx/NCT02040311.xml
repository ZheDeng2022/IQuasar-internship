  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of topiramate (96 mg or 192&#xD;
      mg daily) as compared to placebo in maintaining weight loss in obese subjects who&#xD;
      participated in an eight week intensive non-pharmacologic weight loss program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percent change in body weight from enrollment visit&#xD;
      to week 60.&#xD;

      The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter&#xD;
      trial. It was originally designed to last a total of 74 weeks: an 8 week non.pharmacologic&#xD;
      low-calorie (800 to 1000 kcl/d) weight loss run-in phase, an 8 week titration phase, 52 week&#xD;
      maintenance phase, and 6 week drug taper and follow up phase.&#xD;
