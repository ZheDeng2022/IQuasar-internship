      The aim of this study is to study the safety and clinical efficacy of a novel Bioabsorbable&#xD;
      Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold System (BVS, Abbott Vascular) in subjects&#xD;
      with critical limb ischemia (CLI) following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of&#xD;
      the tibial arteries.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, DM foot admissions account for up to 2% of all admissions in CGH, with up to 50%&#xD;
      of patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). CGH Vascular service performs 100-150&#xD;
      peripheral angioplasties for limb ischaemia per 6 months, the majority of which are for limb&#xD;
      salvage procedures. The angioplasty procedure is performed below the knee (BTK) and the BTK&#xD;
      vessels are involved in more than 80% of the time. Restenosis is common in peripheral&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recently published DESTINY trial, the superiority of Everolimus DES (XIENCE, Abbott&#xD;
      Vascular) was proven over BMS (Bare Metal Stents). This landmark study suggests that for&#xD;
      short lesions in the BTK segment, DES improved patency rates and reduced the need for&#xD;
      re-interventions for restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-interventions for previously stented arteries are technically difficult. In the coronary&#xD;
      bed, the Bioabsorbable stents have been developed to provide the functions of a drug eluting&#xD;
      stent but yet provide a temporary scaffold to allow the vessel to heal. The absence of a&#xD;
      permanent metallic implant in the vascular tissue may facilitate any required&#xD;
      re-interventions on the target vessel / lesion or side branches either by percutaneous or&#xD;
      surgical means, thus enabling a broader range of treatment options after bioresorption of the&#xD;
      scaffold. In addition, unlike permanent metal implants, polymeric implants do not cause&#xD;
      imaging artifacts during non-invasive CT or MR evaluation providing additional benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationate and justification for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the BVS has already been demonstrated in man in the Coronary Bed. It is&#xD;
      currently CE marked for this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ABSORB Cohort A Study, it showed excellent long term clinical outcomes with low MACE&#xD;
      rates out to 4 years with absence of any target lesion revascularization, Q-wave myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, and scaffold thrombosis. Cohort B confirms these findings out to 1 year;&#xD;
      including patency comparable to XIENCE V. Absorb BVS thus performs all the functions of a&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent while offering future potential benefits resulting from the absence of a&#xD;
      permanent metallic implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optimal post procedural follow-up imaging technique is as yet uncertain for this stent.&#xD;
      Assessment of conventional stents with CT angiography has been limited by streak and&#xD;
      susceptibility artefact on MRA. Doppler Ultrasound is known to be time intensive. Hence, if&#xD;
      MRA or CTA proof to be accurate modalities for evaluation, it would be easier for follow-up&#xD;
      and evaluation of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to study which non-invasive imaging modality would be most appropriate in follow-up for&#xD;
           Bioabsorbable Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold System (BVS, Abbott&#xD;
           Vascular) patency deployed in subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI) following&#xD;
           percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the tibial arteries. The aim is to&#xD;
           establish stent patency as well as imaging features of the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using Bioabsorbable&#xD;
           Vascular Scaffold (BVS) in patients with Critical Limb Ischaemia CLI) and Below the Knee&#xD;
           (BTK) lesions in an Asian Population. One of the side arms of the study is to establish&#xD;
           imaging features of this new stent system with Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography and MR&#xD;
           angiography. The study aims to establish stent patency, as well as imaging features of&#xD;
           stent as it bio reabsorbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will prospectively collect consecutive cases treated with BVS for patients with CLI&#xD;
      and BTK lesions recruited over a 2 year period and followed up for 1 year. The results of&#xD;
      these patients will be compared to a similar historical cohort consecutively treated with&#xD;
      XIENCE DES (metallic Drug Eluting Stents, Abbott Vascular).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will involve recruitment of 12 patients x 1 year followed by another year of&#xD;
      post implantation follow-up. If feasible, the recruitment will be extended to another year&#xD;
      for another 12 patients giving a total of 24 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not on chronic antiplatelets therapy should receive a loading dose of Plavix 300 mg&#xD;
      and Aspirin 300 mg started 6 to 72 hours prior and not later than 1 hour after the procedure.&#xD;
      Pre procedure clinical assessment including pulses and Transcutaneous O2 measurement around&#xD;
      the affected wound. In the absence of a wound, this will be performed on the dorsum of the&#xD;
      foot. Demographic data including comorbidities, medication history, Rutherford class will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic patients would be screened with a duplex ultrasound prior to intervention. After&#xD;
      informed consent for a standard angiography/intervention, the patient will undergo a planned&#xD;
      intervention under general or local anaesthesia in an angiographic facility. Either antegrade&#xD;
      or retrograde approach is allowed. After common femoral artery sheath access, a diagnostic&#xD;
      angiogram will be performed as per any standard angioplasty procedure. 2 plane angiography of&#xD;
      the target lesions will be performed. Of note will be the lesion characteristics like length,&#xD;
      location, and degree of stenosis and calcification. Degree of runoff will also be assessed on&#xD;
      angiography. If the 2 plane angiography confirms &gt; 50% stenosis or occlusion, the patient&#xD;
      will be eligible for BVS. The target vessel chosen should preferably be but should not&#xD;
      limited to, the wound relate artery in accordance to the angiosome concept. There should at&#xD;
      least be one vessel runoff to the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After angiographic assessment for suitability for BVS, heparin 2500 to 5000 IU will be&#xD;
      administered intra-arterially as per standard angioplasty according to body weight. The&#xD;
      stenosis of occlusion will be crossed (true lumen or subintimal crossing is allowed) with a&#xD;
      guidewire of choice and pre-dilatation with a balloon catheter will be performed.&#xD;
      Pre-dilatation should be in accordance with manufacturer guidelines an should not extend&#xD;
      beyond the proposed treated segment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post intervention angiography will subsequently be performed to assess the success of&#xD;
      treatment repeat balloon inflation is allowed. Any residual stenosis and the degree of&#xD;
      stenosis at the end of the intervention will also be recorded. Post dilatation should be&#xD;
      confined to the previously scaffolded area and not exceed manufacturer recommendations with&#xD;
      respect to size. Subsequent treatment of the runoff tibial vessels is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post procedure, standard post angioplasty regimes will be followed. Patients will be started&#xD;
      on supplementary Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg once a day together with Aspirin 100mg once a day&#xD;
      i.e. dual antiplatelets for 6month post intervention followed by Aspirin for life unless&#xD;
      contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up will be performed immediately post procedure at 1 month, 6 months and 1&#xD;
      year post intervention. Assessment of the pulse, clinical patency will be performed at each&#xD;
      visit. TCOMs will be performed at 6 and 12 months. Duplex ultrasound to assess for&#xD;
      re-stenosis will be performed at 6 and 12 months, while CT angiography and MR angiography&#xD;
      will be performed at 12-month post-procedure.&#xD;
