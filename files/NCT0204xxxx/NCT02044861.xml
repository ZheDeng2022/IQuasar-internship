    <textblock>
      ACT-PFK-158 is a novel anti-cancer agent that inhibits glucose uptake in cancer cells. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to&#xD;
      describe any dose limiting toxicity. The secondary objectives of the study will be to&#xD;
      determine the safety profile of the drug, to determine the pharmacokinetic profile, to&#xD;
      identify any anti-tumor activity, and to determine the pharmacodynamic profile of&#xD;
      ACT-PFK-158.&#xD;
