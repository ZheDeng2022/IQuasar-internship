  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the treatment for adults with ADHD used in&#xD;
      our previous study (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT01659164). It will now be converted to therapist&#xD;
      supported, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) with an additional&#xD;
      smartphone application and evaluated through a randomized controlled trial during 12 weeks.&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to one of three conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an active treatment group where the intervention is based on cognitive - and dialectical&#xD;
           behavioral therapy (CBT and DBT) and the mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an active ICBT-treatment based on psychoeducation, a CBT stress-reduction program and&#xD;
           Applied Relaxation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment as usual (TAU) / waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate if both of the treatment conditions will show&#xD;
      better outcomes than TAU regarding decreased ADHD symptoms and increased functioning and life&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another objective is to evaluate if the group receiving the active iCBT treatment (based on&#xD;
      CBT and DBT) will show better outcomes in comparison to the control group regarding ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms, overall functioning and life quality.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of children with ADHD continue to be fully symptomatic into adulthood&#xD;
      and many of the remainders often retain some residual problems that require treatment. Thus&#xD;
      ADHD is a prevalent and chronic disabling disorder. Drugs provide first line treatment for&#xD;
      adults with ADHD but are not enough for everybody, while we still lack proper evidence for&#xD;
      promising psychological treatment. In addition to core symptoms of ADHD including regulatory&#xD;
      difficulties of attention, activity level and impulses, difficulties with emotional&#xD;
      regulation are common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up studies of adults with ADHD have shown that only a few patients were offered&#xD;
      sufficient treatment and support after the neuropsychiatric assessment and testing. The&#xD;
      majority of adults diagnosed with ADHD are offered pharmacological treatment (stimulant&#xD;
      medication) as the sole treatment. However, stimulant medication is not effective for up to&#xD;
      20-50 percent of adults as they may not experience symptom reduction or they are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the possible benefits of identifying and treating individuals with ADHD are&#xD;
      extensive. Treatment of ADHD is preferably multimodal, i.e. consisting of more than one&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although literature regarding psychological treatment is relatively limited, studies of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) show that&#xD;
      structured short-term therapies are promising in reducing ADHD related symptoms and&#xD;
      increasing life quality. The main treatment focus is to enhance executive and organizational&#xD;
      skills, improvement of consequence thinking and impulse control as well as emotion regulation&#xD;
      skills. However, the range of trained psychologist in this field is rather limited. Using&#xD;
      internet for delivering evidence-based psychological treatment can therefore be a innovative&#xD;
      treatment alternative in order to make inaccessible treatment available to a large group of&#xD;
      patients with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual treatment project aims to evaluate if adults with ADHD can benefit from&#xD;
      psychological treatment delivered through Internet. About 150-200 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      through several outpatient clinics in Stockholm. They will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      conditions - active psychological treatment (based on CBT and DBT), an active alternative&#xD;
      treatment where they undergo a psychoeducational support program (based on CBT) or to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) / waiting list. The patients in the treatment conditions will have a&#xD;
      personal contact via the internet with a psychologist within the 12 week treatment period.&#xD;
      Assessments will be done before, during and after treatment, and after 3 and 12 months. The&#xD;
      patients in the TAU condition will be offered iCBT treatment after they have filled out the&#xD;
      post assessments (after 12 weeks and at 3rd month after treatment).&#xD;
