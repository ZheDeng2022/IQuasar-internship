      Currently no ideal preventive modalities are available for reducing gastric-cancer caused&#xD;
      mortality in organized population-based application. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      determine if H.pylori screening followed by eradication of positive subjects and endoscopic&#xD;
      follow-up of those with serological evidence of atrophic gastritis reduces mortality from&#xD;
      gastric cancer in middle-aged people in high-risk areas. The GISTAR study is a multicenter&#xD;
      randomized study of H.pylori eradication and pepsinogen testing for prevention of gastric&#xD;
      cancer mortality. Altogether 30.000 individuals aged 40-64 years will be enrolled, providing&#xD;
      90% study power to detect at least 35% reduction in gastric cancer mortality at 15 years of&#xD;
      follow-up. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the active&#xD;
      investigation/management group those positive for H.pylori will be offered eradication&#xD;
      therapy and individuals with decreased pepsinogen I/II ratio will be invited for endoscopy.&#xD;
      The control group will receive standard health care. The primary endpoint for this trial will&#xD;
      be the mortality difference from gastric cancer between the two groups at 15 years or when&#xD;
      enough cases accumulate to demonstrate a statistical difference. The study is expected to&#xD;
      provide valuable information on the utility for reduction in gastric cancer mortality of: 1)&#xD;
      H.pylori eradication in adults on a population-basis, including subjects who may already have&#xD;
      pre-malignant lesions; and 2) pepsinogen testing in screening settings. A pilot study of&#xD;
      3,455 individuals prior to the main trial was conducted from October 2013 to December 2016.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is an important global public health issue in Eastern European regions, where&#xD;
      the burden of the disease is substantial. There is sufficient epidemiological and&#xD;
      experimental evidence that supports a causal link between H. pylori and gastric cancer.&#xD;
      However, there is still limited evidence from clinical trials to prove whether H. pylori&#xD;
      eradication with antimicrobial therapy is the approach of choice in entire infected&#xD;
      populations or only in selected groups to reduce the risk of gastric cancer and whether&#xD;
      eradication at advanced stages of atrophy is effective among these patients. The current&#xD;
      European and global guidelines are proposing screening with pepsinogen tests as the best&#xD;
      available tool to identify the individuals at increased risk for cancer development, yet&#xD;
      there is insufficient evidence available on how effective these tests are in organized cancer&#xD;
      screening settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial in Latvia, Belarus and&#xD;
      Russia, areas with high burden of the disease, with the main objective of evaluating if H.&#xD;
      pylori screening followed by eradication in participants with positive result and endoscopy&#xD;
      of those with serological evidence of atrophic gastritis can reduce gastric cancer mortality.&#xD;
      The proposed trial will also investigate retrospectively if groups with chronic atrophic&#xD;
      gastritis can select subjects who require treatment to achieve comparable gastric cancer&#xD;
      reduction. Ultimately, this study will have the potential to find effective prevention&#xD;
      strategies through identifying appropriate target groups that could get most benefits from&#xD;
      the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to search for new intervention strategies to decrease mortality from&#xD;
      gastric cancer in high-risk areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if H. pylori screening followed by&#xD;
      eradication of positive subjects and endoscopic follow-up of those with serological evidence&#xD;
      of atrophic gastritis reduces mortality from gastric cancer in a high risk population among&#xD;
      40-64 years old subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine retrospectively if biomarkers of chronic atrophic gastritis or others can&#xD;
           select the group of subjects who require treatment to achieve gastric cancer reduction&#xD;
           comparable to the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the rationale for volatile marker testing in exhaled breath for early&#xD;
           identification of lesions in the stomach as well as other conditions related to&#xD;
           increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the role of diet, lifestyle factors and environmental factors in the&#xD;
           development of gastric lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the impact of H. pylori eradication on selected medical conditions&#xD;
           potentially associated with the infection (e.g. obesity, inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
           dementia, circulatory diseases and esophageal diseases)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Approximately 30,000 men and women will be recruited into a randomized study.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects between 40-64 years of age at entry who are residents in high gastric&#xD;
      cancer incidence areas will be invited to participate in the trial by visiting one of the&#xD;
      study clinics set up specifically for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For eligible participants who agree to participate and sign informed consent, a risk factor&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered and a complete medical evaluation will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either Group 1 (50%) or Group 2 (50%). Among those&#xD;
      assigned to Group 1, H. pylori screening by detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) group antibodies&#xD;
      in plasma/serum and pepsinogen test will be performed. According to the results of the tests,&#xD;
      participants will be assigned to H. pylori eradication treatment or upper endoscopy.&#xD;
      Participants with serological evidence of atrophic gastritis (low pepsinogen I/II ratio) will&#xD;
      undergo upper endoscopy with appropriate biopsy sampling as well as further follow-up with&#xD;
      endoscopy according to MAPS (Management of precancerous conditions and lesions in the&#xD;
      stomach) guidelines. H. pylori positive individuals will be offered standard eradication&#xD;
      treatment as appropriate. From subjects in this group, breath samples will also be collected&#xD;
      for volatile markers study by research nurses or junior physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to Group 2 (50%) will constitute the control group, after having had a&#xD;
      medical evaluation at the time of recruitment. During the follow-up period this group will be&#xD;
      offered to consult a specialist when required due to clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Group 1 and Group 2 will be offered fecal occult blood test (FOBT) as a benefit of study&#xD;
      participation. Any participants who show a positive FOBT result will be referred to&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the trial participants including Group 2 will be followed up at least for 15 years to&#xD;
      collect systematic information on medical conditions, in particular gastric cancer and cause&#xD;
      of death. A follow-up telephone call /alternative communication will be made every 5 years&#xD;
      for outcome assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general study is preceded by a pilot-study that was conducted from October 2013 to&#xD;
      December 2016 to test the assumptions as well as the tools and functionality of the study&#xD;
      infrastructure. According to the results of the pilot study, required infrastructure and&#xD;
      tools planned in the general study will be adapted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: The primary endpoint for our trial will be the mortality difference from gastric&#xD;
      cancer between Group 1 and Group 2 at 15 years or when enough cases accumulate to demonstrate&#xD;
      a statistical difference between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the mortality difference from gastric cancer between the two groups, other&#xD;
      endpoints required to achieve the secondary objectives are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in gastric cancer incidence between Group 1 and Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The all-cause mortality difference between Group 1 and Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in incidence and mortality of medical conditions between Group 1 and&#xD;
           Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity and specificity of pepsinogen tests to detect atrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of gastric cancers arising in patients with non-atrophic vs. atrophic&#xD;
           gastritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of cancers arising in patients with atrophy, but negative for H. pylori&#xD;
           infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in incidence of gastric cancer in the group with successful eradication&#xD;
           when compared to those refusing/failing eradication within Group I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of gastric cancer cases being identified during scheduled follow-up&#xD;
           endoscopy out of the total number of cases in the follow-up group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The differences in the test performance and disease prevalence between ethnic groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The performance (sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy) of volatile marker testing&#xD;
           approach to diagnose gastric cancer as well as premalignant lesions in the stomach&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study with 3,455 participants was started in October 2013 and completed in December&#xD;
      2016 in Latvia.&#xD;
