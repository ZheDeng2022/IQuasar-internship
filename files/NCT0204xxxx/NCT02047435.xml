      Social relationships are important to people and it affects their quality of life, morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised controlled trial studying the effect of including older people with&#xD;
      impaired social relationships and a perception of loneliness at workshops, at The Storm P.&#xD;
      Museum - a museum about the well known Danish cartoonist Robert Storm Petersen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is, that by including older lonely people with a impaired social participation&#xD;
      in these workshops, they will increase the participants health related quality of life. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesis, that the intervention will improve the participants perception&#xD;
      of loneliness, social participation and physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consist of a series of workshops at the Storm P. Museum. At these workshops&#xD;
      the participants will create memory material for nursing home residents with dementia. The&#xD;
      museum staff will facilitate a process of storytelling, using events, significant stories and&#xD;
      artistic works by Storm P. and encourage the participants, by means of the &quot;narrative&#xD;
      interview&quot; method to share similar stories from their life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social relations are important to people and it affects their quality of life, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. This is especially true among older people and social relations are also important&#xD;
      for the management of chronic diseases. Those with strong social relations are less sick, and&#xD;
      recover faster if they become sick. There is also a connection between social relations and&#xD;
      death, as people with many social relations are more likely to live longer than people with&#xD;
      few social relations. In Denmark it is assumed that poor social relationships causes between&#xD;
      1000-1500 deaths per year, equivalent to about 2% of all deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised controlled trial studying the effect of including older people with poor&#xD;
      social relationships and a perception of loneliness at workshops, at The Storm P. Museum - a&#xD;
      museum about the well known Danish cartoonist Robert Storm Petersen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is, that by including older lonely people with a poor social participation in&#xD;
      these workshops, they will increase the participants health related quality of life. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesis, that the intervention will improve the participants perception&#xD;
      of loneliness, social participation and physical function as well as mortality and nursing&#xD;
      home placement at long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intervention and the comparison group will be invited to an event at the Storm P.&#xD;
      Museum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This event consist of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A guided tour of the collection with a presentation on Storm P. 's life and artistic&#xD;
           work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A representative from the municipal DaneAge Association will subsequently tell about the&#xD;
           municipality's activities for the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The museum will serve a refreshment and offer participants a season pass to the museum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the intervention group will be invited to participate in a series of workshops at&#xD;
      the Storm P. Museum with scheduled meetings twice a month. In collaboration with the museum,&#xD;
      participants at these workshops will create memory material for nursing home residents with&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The workshop will use narrative as a method to give participants a mutual relationship that&#xD;
      is perceived as meaningful and rewarding for each participant. Storytelling is central in&#xD;
      creating a cognitive, meaningful and holistic life. In our dialogues we create a mutual&#xD;
      understanding. Stories are central to people and is used in making sense in transitions and&#xD;
      essential decisions in your life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The museum facilitates the process of storytelling using events, significant stories and&#xD;
      artistic works by Storm P., and encourage the participants, via the method known as&#xD;
      &quot;narrative interview&quot;, to share similar stories from their life. This will not only benefit&#xD;
      the participants, but also act as crucial empirical data collected via journal keeping for&#xD;
      this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is planned to last for up to 12 months and outcome measures are collected at&#xD;
      baseline, 9 months and at 18 months.&#xD;
