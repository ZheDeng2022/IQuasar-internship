      The main objective is to show by a randomised controled therapeutic trial comparing in two&#xD;
      parallel open arms ( 50 infants x 2 = 100 infants) that the technique IIF decreases the&#xD;
      duration of non invasive respiratory support in the group treated by chest physiotherapy as&#xD;
      compared to the control group. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the duration of&#xD;
      oxygen dependence, the duration of hospitalisation and the proportional advent of&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These study will be conducted in patients less than 32 weeks post menstrual age, eutrophic,&#xD;
      treated by non invasive respiratory support after weaning off from mechanical endotracheal&#xD;
      ventilation benefitting form a social security system and for whom the appropriate parental&#xD;
      authority are non opposed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The treatment evaluated is the contribution of the chest physiotherapy technique of&#xD;
      increasing the inspiratory flow (IIF) administered 3 times per day for a duration of 3 to 10&#xD;
      minutes according to the tolerance of the infant and interrupted if required by periods of&#xD;
      rest. This technique utilises the exclusive nasal respiration and the increased thoracic&#xD;
      compliance of the premature infant. The physiotherapy practiced engenders a progressive&#xD;
      increase in the inspiratory flow until the physiological limits of the infant (expired volume&#xD;
      and clinical tolerance). After having assured that the system is well in place, during the&#xD;
      following inspiration we close the infant's mouth in a manner to add the following two&#xD;
      simultaneous parameters of ventilation: forced inspiration and the PEP delivered by the&#xD;
      ventilator. Regarding the Bi-phasic Positive Airway Pressure system of non invasive&#xD;
      ventilation which is triggered by a movement captor placed on the skin of the lower thoracic&#xD;
      cage, the physiotherapist will generate a first forced inspiration by following the&#xD;
      respiratory rhythm of the infant. The infant will thus trigger the inspiratory aid of his&#xD;
      machine simultaneously with the PEP delivered and the forced provoked inspiration.The&#xD;
      respiratory rate of the infant can however be underestimated by the machine as it may not&#xD;
      detect the ineffective respiratory efforts. The physiotherapy session shall be carried out by&#xD;
      a physiotherapist of the service trained in this technique assisted by a nurse and the&#xD;
      treatment shall start in the 24 hours following extubation/ weaning off form mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. The evaluation of clinical improvement will be done on a daily basis and the&#xD;
      mode of non invasive respiratory support adapted accordingly. The objective of the project is&#xD;
      to show that chest physiotherapy permits to decrease the duration of non invasive ventilation&#xD;
      in the treatment group as compared to a control group without the above treatment ( this&#xD;
      group will receive the usual care without the chest physiotherapy after extubation). Along&#xD;
      with the expected diminution of the duration of non invasive respiratory support , we will&#xD;
      also evaluate the efficiency of the IIF technique on the duration of oxygen dependence, the&#xD;
      duration of hospitalisation of the premature infant on the special care unit, the proportion&#xD;
      of infants diagnosed as having bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks post menstrual age as&#xD;
      established by the WALSH test as well as the presence of atelectasis on the chest X ray done&#xD;
      within the 7 days following extubation. Eventual nociceptive effect will be evaluated by a&#xD;
      pain score realised during the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised controled therapeutic trial comparing two open parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A treatment group benefitting from the chest physiotherapy technique increasing&#xD;
           inspiratory flow (IIF) 3 times per day along with the usual surveillance carried out&#xD;
           under non invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A control group having the usual surveillance carried out under non invasive ventilation&#xD;
           without any chest physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research shall be carried out in one center. A draw to assign or not to the treatment&#xD;
      group will be carried out by the physiotherapist present after having received the&#xD;
      eligibility for the infant. The randomisation will be done by the physiotherapist with the&#xD;
      aid of the electronic database CLEANWEB according to a list of pre established balanced&#xD;
      randomisation ( size of the blocks not divulged to the investigators or the physiotherapists)&#xD;
      after verification of the criteria of inclusion and information and explanation of the&#xD;
      protocol to the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of inclusion: 24 months Duration of participation of each infant: 4 months maximum&#xD;
      of treatment with follow up till discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the research: 28 months Randomisation shall be done in the 24 hours following&#xD;
      extubation. At all times the investigator can interrupt the study prematurely for a medical&#xD;
      or administrative reason. In all cases the early termination will be done only after mutual&#xD;
      discussion and appropriate documentation of the motives ( for example a letter of abandon for&#xD;
      the investigator) and the investigator will inform the CPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they want, the parental authority holders can at all times opt against the participation&#xD;
      of their child in the study. In that case unless specifically desired otherwise, the data&#xD;
      obtained during the inclusion of their child will be analysed This withdrawal from the study&#xD;
      will not change the quality of the clinical management of their infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A termination of the study can be considered in case of insufficient recruitment, unresolved&#xD;
      technical problems, expressed desire of the investigator or repeated and unjustified&#xD;
      violation of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of pathologies which might put at stake the vital prognostic of the patients a&#xD;
      Surveillance Committee has been established to be able to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow the distribution of these events in the two arms of the study to make sure that&#xD;
           there is no imbalance between the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Make appropriate recommendations if need be (Eg: modification of the protocol ;&#xD;
           continuation, suspension or early termination of the study etc. )&quot;&#xD;
