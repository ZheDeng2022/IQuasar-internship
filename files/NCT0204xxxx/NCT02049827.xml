    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end stage renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      improving the quantity and quality of life for dialysis patients. Although prolongation of&#xD;
      graft survival in the short term by preventing the release is observed by immunosuppression&#xD;
      (IS) powerful, the longer-term survival has not improved . Indeed, the IS can not only have a&#xD;
      direct deleterious effect on the kidney transplant , but too weak IS can promote rejection,&#xD;
      and too strong, promote the emergence of a viral disease polyomavirus BK ( BKV ) . BK&#xD;
      nephropathy (BKVAN ) virus is accompanied by an irreversible impairment of the renal function&#xD;
      , leading to a loss of the graft followed by a premature return to dialysis in at least 50 %&#xD;
      of cases. Plasma BKV reactivation was observed mainly during the first year of&#xD;
      transplantation in 15% of patients and complications annually BKVAN concern about 5 % of&#xD;
      recipients . Currently , treatment options are very limited , only the decrease in IS shows a&#xD;
      partially effective when care is early . There is no specific antiviral effective treatment&#xD;
      of this disease . In addition, there is no way to predict which patients will develop BKV&#xD;
      reactivation BKVAN despite lower tax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of interstitial nephritis BKV based on the detection of viral DNA by PCR and&#xD;
      plasma is confirmed by histological analysis of renal tissue . Plasma quantitative PCR (&#xD;
      qPCR) to measure the progression of the disease and therapeutic efficacy. Control of BKV&#xD;
      viremia is the direct antiviral immune response quality based primarily on a very effective&#xD;
      anti- T lymphocyte activity BKV reflection. In this context, the inhibition of lymphocyte&#xD;
      activation induced by IS blocks the establishment of T-cell responses anti- BKV in most&#xD;
      transplant, a very low presence of T lymphocytes is generally observed in these patients&#xD;
      anti- BKV (LYT - BKV) blood .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary studies have validated in vitro a sensitive test to measure the functionality&#xD;
      of blood LYT - BKV. This test is used to evaluate the concentration and functionality of LYT&#xD;
      - BKV present in small volume of blood by measuring their specific proliferation after&#xD;
      stimulation with peptide cocktails BKV. Proof of concept of the feasibility of this test was&#xD;
      established on a small series of samples and highlights significant differences in lymphocyte&#xD;
      anti-BKV different patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Put to good use during the post-transplant follow-up, this type of test can provide the&#xD;
      clinician with valuable data to assess the quality of anti- BKV T response compared to the&#xD;
      intensity and type of IS treatment. Early identification of patients at risk of reactivation&#xD;
      of BKV, or at risk of BKVAN if BKV viremia observed , would adapt the therapeutic response&#xD;
      and monitoring arrangements at the fair. The objective of this project is to conduct a&#xD;
      feasibility study to assess the relevance of post-transplant monitoring of anti- BKV T&#xD;
      response of BKV viremic patients during the first year post- transplant. Immunological data&#xD;
      will be analyzed in relation to virological data and bioclinical data.&#xD;
