      Objectives: The aim of this prospective, randomized, triple-blind cohort study was to assess&#xD;
      the longevity of repairs to localized clinical defects in composite restorations that were&#xD;
      initially scheduled to be treated with a restoration replacement Methods: 28 patients aged 18&#xD;
      to 80 years with 50 composite restorations were recruited.Restorations with clinically&#xD;
      diagnosed secondary caries (Charlie) or undercontoured anatomical form defects (Bravo) were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the Repair (n = 25) or Replacement (n = 25) group, the quality of the&#xD;
      restorations was scored according to the modified USPHS criteria. A Wilcoxon test was&#xD;
      performed for comparisons between the same groups (CI=0.05). A Friedman test was utilized for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons between different years of the same group.&#xD;

      A cohort of 28 patients aged 18 to 80 years of both females (58%) and males (42%) with 50&#xD;
      composite restorations were recruited at the Operative Dentistry Clinic at the Dental School&#xD;
      of the University of Chile. All participants presented with one or more clinical features&#xD;
      that deviated from the ideal and were rated Bravo or Charlie according to the modified United&#xD;
      States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria 6. The protocol was approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Research Ethics Committee of the Dental School at the University of Chile&#xD;
      (Project PRI-ODO-0207). All of the patients signed informed-consent forms and completed a&#xD;
      registration form. The selection criteria are summarized below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Treatment Group Criteria Initially, 356 restorations (28 patients) were evaluated and&#xD;
      assigned in accordance with the modified USPHS criteria, from which 50 were selected in&#xD;
      accordance with the inclusion criteria. Restorations with clinically diagnosed secondary&#xD;
      caries (Charlie) or undercontoured anatomical form defects (Bravo) were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the Repair (n = 25) or Replacement (n = 25) group (Figure 1). The randomization was performed&#xD;
      by the Power Analysis and Sample Size System (PASS software v. 2008, Keysville, UT, USA), and&#xD;
      diagnosis of active secondary caries was made based on Ekstrand criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Restoration Assessment The quality of the restorations was scored according to the&#xD;
      modified USPHS criteria. Two examiners underwent calibration exercises each year (JM and EF).&#xD;
      The Cohen's Kappa inter-examiner coefficient was 0.74 at the baseline and 0.87 at ten years.&#xD;
      Immediately after the treatment (baseline) and 10 years later, the examiners assessed the&#xD;
      restorations independently by direct visual and tactile examination with mouth mirror number&#xD;
      5 and explorer number 23 (Hu Friedy Mfg. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and indirectly by&#xD;
      radiographic examination (bite wing). The five parameters examined were marginal adaptation,&#xD;
      anatomic form, surface roughness, secondary caries, and lustre. If a difference was recorded&#xD;
      between the two examiners, and if they could not reach an agreement, a third clinician, who&#xD;
      also underwent the calibration exercises (GM), made the final decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Treatment Groups 2.4.1 Repair The clinicians (PV - GM) used carbide burs (330-010 Komet,&#xD;
      Brasseler GmbH Co., Lemgo, Germany) to explore the defective margins of the restorations,&#xD;
      beginning with the removal of part of the restorative material adjacent to the defect to act&#xD;
      as an exploratory cavity; this allowed a proper diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of the&#xD;
      defect. Provided that the defect was limited and localized, the clinician then removed any&#xD;
      defective tooth tissue. Once this material was removed, an exploratory cavity preparation was&#xD;
      done that included removal of any demineralized and soft tooth tissue. A self-priming resin&#xD;
      bonding system was used (Adper Prompt L-Pop; 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), followed by&#xD;
      restoration with a resin-based composite (RBC) restorative material (Filtek Supreme; 3M&#xD;
      ESPE). A rubber dam isolation was used for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4.2 Replacement The clinicians totally removed and replaced the defective restorations.&#xD;
      After completing the cavity preparations, it was restored with a new resin composite (RC;&#xD;
      Filtek Supreme; 3M ESPE). The elimination of the soft tooth tissue caries infection was done&#xD;
      using carbide burs at high speed under full water irrigation. During the cavity preparation,&#xD;
      no preventive extension or undercutting areas were created, and all of the cavity angles were&#xD;
      rounded. In the deep dentin, a glass-ionomer liner was used (Vitrebond; 3M ESPE; USA). Adper&#xD;
      Prompt L-Pop, (3M ESPE) was used per the manufacturer instructions, and RBC (Filtek Supreme;&#xD;
      3M ESPE) was applied by the incremental technique. The occlusion was checked, and the&#xD;
      restorations were finished and polished following the manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
