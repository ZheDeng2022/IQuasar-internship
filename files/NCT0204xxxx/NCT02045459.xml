      For part of this study, we are collecting information from patients that have been&#xD;
      experiencing the symptoms mentioned above. We are taking this information and creating a&#xD;
      chest pain registry to follow trends and compare different patients having similar symptoms.&#xD;
      We hope to gain insight into the quality of life, symptoms, and cardiac events of those who&#xD;
      are having similar symptoms. The type of information we will collect includes: demographics,&#xD;
      quality of life, levels of anxiety related to angina pain and cardiac events occurring within&#xD;
      a 2 year period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we are performing a cardiac stress MRI for research purposes to look at the&#xD;
      blood flow in the small vessels in your heart. During the stress cardiac MRI, we will give&#xD;
      you a medication called Regadenoson (Lexiscan) which &quot;stresses&quot; your heart by dilating the&#xD;
      blood vessels to your heart. This drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for this purpose. We will then be able to measure the myocardial perfusion reserve&#xD;
      (MPR) which is a measure of blood flow through the small blood vessels to see if an abnormal&#xD;
      MPR and small blood vessel disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events, such as heart attack. At this point, there is no specific therapy for small vessel&#xD;
      disease. In addition we have phase II of this study which is to determine if exercise and&#xD;
      intensive medical therapy together compared to intensive medical therapy alone improves pain&#xD;
      from the heart and improves overall quality of life.&#xD;

      Cardiac angina is a major source of morbidity, affecting more than 5% of the U.S.&#xD;
      population.2 It leads to more than 1.5 million hospitalizations and $190 billion in costs&#xD;
      yearly.3 Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of angina.&#xD;
      However, no obstructive CAD is found on elective coronary angiography in more than 50% of&#xD;
      cases.4, 5 These patients with angina but no obstructive CAD are a heterogeneous group. Some&#xD;
      have noncardiac explanations for their angina or nonobstructive epicardial abnormalities such&#xD;
      as coronary spasm. However, many patients with angina and no obstructive CAD have&#xD;
      microvascular dysfunction from endothelial dysfunction or microvascular obstructive disease&#xD;
      as the cause. These patients have microvascular angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronary microvasculature is responsible for more than 70% of coronary resistance and&#xD;
      thus plays a key role in regulating blood flow to match demand.6 Microvascular dysfunction&#xD;
      can occur in the setting of dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathies. However,&#xD;
      it is commonly seen in the setting of atherosclerotic risk factors or can be idiopathic.6, 7&#xD;
      Microvascular dysfunction is manifest as insufficient stress myocardial blood flow and/or&#xD;
      reduced myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR), the ratio of stress flow to rest flow, in&#xD;
      response to a stress such as vasodilator administration. Absolute myocardial blood flow and&#xD;
      MPR can be assessed noninvasively with high precision and accuracy by cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (CMR) imaging Reduced MPR in patients with angina is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity, including a high risk of cardiac events, high medical costs, and a decreased&#xD;
      quality of life.Despite the poor prognosis of this population, therapeutic options to reduce&#xD;
      angina and improve MPR have not been well studied. Preliminary analysis shows that statins&#xD;
      may improve endothelial function. ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers improve symptoms in&#xD;
      Syndrome X, a related disorder in which patients have angina, no obstructive CAD, and&#xD;
      ischemic changes but a better prognosis. Therapeutic exercise has also been used in the&#xD;
      Syndrome X population, improving exercise tolerance and endothelial function and reducing&#xD;
      symptom severity.Improvements in MPR could be expected with exercise due to the reduced&#xD;
      resting flow and increased MPR seen in healthy volunteers and improved endothelial function&#xD;
      from increased nitric oxide bioactivity in patients with probable microvascular dysfunction.&#xD;
      However, no studies have examined the effect of these medications or their synergism with&#xD;
      exercise on MPR, aerobic capacity, anginal symptoms, or quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      angina and reduced MPR. Identification of an effective therapy that improved symptoms and&#xD;
      prognosis would have dramatic impact on this highly prevalent patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to characterize which patients with angina but no&#xD;
      obstructive CAD have reduced MPR and test the effectiveness of intensive medical therapy plus&#xD;
      a 12-week supervised exercise program versus intensive medical therapy alone to improve MPR,&#xD;
      aerobic capacity, and the patient-centered outcomes of cardiac events, angina severity, and&#xD;
      quality of life in this population with microvascular angina.&#xD;
