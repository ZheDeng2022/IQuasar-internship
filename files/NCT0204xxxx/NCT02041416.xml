  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility, reliability, and validity of&#xD;
      administering the Geriatric Assessment Tool using these two different computer based survey&#xD;
      platforms, REDCap and Support Screen. The development of a computer based Geriatric&#xD;
      Assessment Tool has the potential to improve research and clinical practice by providing an&#xD;
      efficient user friendly means to collect and analyze data for geriatric oncology patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty percent of all cancer diagnoses and 70% of all cancer mortality occurs in patients age&#xD;
      65 and older. Patients older than age 65 years have an 11-fold increased cancer incidence and&#xD;
      a 16-fold increase in cancer mortality in comparison to those younger than 65 years. The&#xD;
      population at risk is growing rapidly: the number of adults age 65 years and older is&#xD;
      expected to double in the next 30 years. In order to adequately care for this growing&#xD;
      population of older adults, oncologists need an assessment tool that provides information&#xD;
      regarding an older individual's &quot;functional age&quot; rather than just &quot;chronological age.&quot; The&#xD;
      Geriatric Assessment Tool developed by Hurria and colleagues has been found to help identify&#xD;
      those older adults who are more vulnerable to complications from cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Geriatric Assessment Tool takes into account well validated measures of functional&#xD;
      status, co-morbid medical conditions, cognitive function, psychological state, nutritional&#xD;
      status, social activity, and social support. Pilot data demonstrates the feasibility of this&#xD;
      assessment which can be completed in less than 30 minutes; however, this assessment is&#xD;
      completed by pencil and paper, and therefore requires an interviewer to deliver, score, and&#xD;
      summarize the assessment results. The development of a computer based Geriatric Assessment&#xD;
      Tool would have practical importance for both research and clinical practice. It could&#xD;
      potentially allow more efficient data collection and analysis in the research setting. In&#xD;
      turn it would potentially influence clinical decision making by medical oncologists given its&#xD;
      ability to predict chemotherapy related toxicity among geriatric oncology patients across all&#xD;
      tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two electronic platforms have been developed for the Geriatric Assessment Tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a secure website designed by Vanderbilt&#xD;
           University that is used by 48 countries, and 511 institutions around the world including&#xD;
           research centers that comprise the Cancer and Aging Research Group. REDCap is a&#xD;
           web-based application that allows researchers to build and manage online surveys and&#xD;
           databases. It also provides a central web-based forum where data can be processed&#xD;
           uniformly and efficiently. Administering the Geriatric Assessment Tool through REDCap&#xD;
           would potentially improve data collection and analysis for elderly cancer patients&#xD;
           across multiple research centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Support Screen is a program developed by researchers and information technology&#xD;
           specialists at City of Hope utilizing touchscreen technology to deliver patient surveys.&#xD;
           The touchscreen platform has been used in previous studies as a means of assessing the&#xD;
           needs of cancer patients. Support Screen is an attractive technology given it is user&#xD;
           friendly for patients and has the unique capability of transferring information from the&#xD;
           touchscreen device directly into the City of Hope medical record system in a secure,&#xD;
           HIPPA-compliant manner, thereby providing clinicians and researchers real time access to&#xD;
           survey information. A pilot study looking at the feasibility of delivering the Geriatric&#xD;
           Assessment to elderly cancer patients using Support Screen has been performed at City of&#xD;
           Hope with promising results, but the reliability and validity of this modality have yet&#xD;
           to be studied.&#xD;
