  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (LEPAD) is a highly prevalent chronic disease.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular mortality of LEPAD patients at five years ranges between 18 to 30%. LEPAD is&#xD;
      primarily caused by atherosclerosis that induces an inadequate blood flow to meet the tissues&#xD;
      demand due to the narrowing of the arteries. An aggravation of the arterial lesions in LEPAD&#xD;
      patients induces a worsening of patients' symptoms and a severe limitation of their walking&#xD;
      capacity, contributing to an impairment of their quality of life. Despite maintaining a&#xD;
      sufficient walking activity is essential for these patients, LEPAD patients lower their&#xD;
      physical activity, which worsen the disease and potentially contribute to increase the risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular events and deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study in LEPAD patients, we showed, from a one hour GPS recording, a high&#xD;
      variability of the patients' walking capacity (i.e., walking distances between two stops&#xD;
      induced by lower limbs pain). Results suggested that in most patients previous stop duration&#xD;
      before each walk was a predictor parameter of this walking variability. Whether there is an&#xD;
      optimal or minimal recovery time influencing the walking capacity in LEPAD patients has never&#xD;
      been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, cross-sectional study in exercise pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to determine, following a walk that induces ischemia, the influence of the&#xD;
      recovery duration on the subsequent walking performance in LEPAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the nature of the relationship between the recovery duration and subsequent&#xD;
           walking performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the relationship between exercise ischemia, pain evolution and previous&#xD;
           recovery duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether the experimental procedure influence the determination of an&#xD;
           optimal of minimal recovery duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the influence of recovery duration on walking capacity from community-based&#xD;
           measurement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is expected to determine for the first time an optimal recovery duration that would&#xD;
      maximize the walking capacity of LEPAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the medium term :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To give indications to the LEPAD patients to manage their pain in the community without&#xD;
           lower their physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To limit the functional decline of LEPAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To influence the quality of life and cardiovascular mortality. This would deserve&#xD;
           furthers studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insured under the French social security system (according to French law)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of lower-extremity peripheral artery disease, defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) ≤ 0.90&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  OR if resting ABI &gt; 0.90 and &lt; 1.00, a decrease in recovery ankle systolic&#xD;
                  pressure or in recovery ABI from treadmill exercise higher than 30% or 20%,&#xD;
                  respectively (AHA recommendations).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  OR if resting ABI &gt; 1.40, a toe pressure index ≤ 0.70&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximal walking distance on treadmill (3.2 km/h, 10% grade) &lt; 500m (a)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complain of exertional lower limbs pain that can begin or not at rest, causes the&#xD;
             participant to stop walking and relieves or lessens within 10 minutes of rest&#xD;
             (assessed using the San Diego questionnaire AND confirmed during treadmill testing)&#xD;
             (b)&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. As assessed during the medical appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. According to our inclusion criteria, patients' leg symptoms that fell within the&#xD;
                  following leg symptom categories could be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) Intermittent claudication. Patients that experience exertional calf pain that does&#xD;
             not begin at rest and that forces them to stop walking and that relieves or lessens&#xD;
             within 10 minutes of rest; ii) Atypical exertional leg pain/stop. This category can&#xD;
             encompass diverse situations of exertional leg symptoms. In the present study,&#xD;
             patients in this category were included if they experience exertional pain that does&#xD;
             not begin at rest and that forces them to stop walking, but that do not involve only&#xD;
             the calf(s) but also thigh(s) and/or buttock(s). Further, the exertional leg pain&#xD;
             relieves or lessens within 10 minutes of rest; iii) Leg pain on exertion and rest. In&#xD;
             this category, patients sometimes experience exertional leg pain at rest when they are&#xD;
             standing still or sitting. On exertion, patients also experience a walking pain as&#xD;
             described above. As reminded by Criqui et al., this category of patients with &quot;pain at&#xD;
             rest&quot; should not be confused with patients that experience &quot;rest pain&quot;, which usually&#xD;
             refers to patients with such severe advanced PAD that ischemic pain is present even at&#xD;
             rest. Patients with ischemic rest pain were not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exercise limitation due to symptoms not related to an arterial insufficiency in the&#xD;
             lower limbs (e.g., dyspnea, angina pectoris)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication for walking (Abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt; 4 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction and no stroke in the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Critical limb ischemia, amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult subject to legal protection (guardianship or tutelage measure) and persons&#xD;
             deprived from their liberty (according to French law).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient living more than 50 km from the university hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient unable to understand the instructions of the study&#xD;
