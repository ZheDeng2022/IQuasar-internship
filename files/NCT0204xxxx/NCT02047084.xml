  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the propensity for venous leg ulcers to become refractory, long standing lesions,&#xD;
      incorporating active biologic grafts into the standard compression therapy, has shown to&#xD;
      accelerate wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two products to be compared in this study are both commonly used for the treatment of&#xD;
      venous leg ulcers. Apligraf is considered a medical device by the FDA, and was cleared for&#xD;
      the treatment of venous leg ulcers in 1998. It is a staple for the treatment of venous leg&#xD;
      ulcers, and is widely used throughout the United States. It is composed of a type 1 collagen&#xD;
      matrix in which human foreskin-derived neonatal fibroblasts are grown, and over which human&#xD;
      foreskin-derived neonatal keratinocytes are then cultured and allowed to stratify.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraSkin is composed of a split thickness skin graft harvested within 24 hours post-mortem,&#xD;
      from an organ donor who has cleared the standard safety screenings. It is classified by the&#xD;
      FDA as a donated tissue. Once harvested, the graft is sanitized according to FDA&#xD;
      specifications, and cryopreserved, until it is delivered to the clinic for application to the&#xD;
      foot ulcer. It is also a widely used treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY Chronic wounds of the lower extremities affect a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of the population. Venous leg ulcers (VLU) account for 40-70% of lower&#xD;
      extremity wounds. The standard of care for treatment of VLU's in wound centers in the United&#xD;
      States is compression therapy combined with application of biologic graft materials to the&#xD;
      wound bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may assist physicians who treat VLU's by comparing efficacy and costs of two&#xD;
      commonly used biologic graft materials for VLU's in a randomized prospective study. In&#xD;
      addition to standard compression therapy, this investigation will be a head-to-head study&#xD;
      comparing widely used bio-engineered skin substitute (Apligraf) to cryopreserved, human skin&#xD;
      allograft (Theraskin). There is no randomized, prospective data comparing these two graft&#xD;
      options in the treatment of VLU's.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The products to be considered will be Apligraf, which is a bioengineered skin substitute, and&#xD;
      TheraSkin, which is a cryopreserved split-thickness human skin allograft. This is a&#xD;
      head-to-head designed study to observe the performance of each product and compare the&#xD;
      results so that the clinician can readily see advantages in healing times, infection rates,&#xD;
      and costs associated with each product. The study sponsors are Soluble Systems and Life Net&#xD;
      Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study will have three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase will consist of a series of screening assessments designed to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. The prospective patients must meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of the two cohorts in equal numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, the study treatment will be administered and the patient will be&#xD;
      followed until the study ulcer has completely healed (i.e., 100% closure as determined by the&#xD;
      Investigator, for up to 12 weeks. During the Treatment Phase subjects will be evaluated on a&#xD;
      weekly basis. Efficacy evaluations each week will include Investigator assessment of wound&#xD;
      closure and evaluations of ulcer size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the third phase, which will immediately follow the initial 12 weeks of the second&#xD;
      phase, all patients remaining with non-healed study wounds will be treated and followed&#xD;
      through an additional 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments throughout the study will include assessment of adverse events and&#xD;
      measurement of clinical laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENROLLMENT This study will initially include 100 subjects, enrolled randomly into two&#xD;
      groups, to be treated with either Apligraf or TheraSkin. The sample size was determined with&#xD;
      a power calculation based on the anticipated difference in healing rate between Apligraf and&#xD;
      TheraSkin. The following parameters were used to calculate the sample size. The literature on&#xD;
      these two products predicts a closure rate of 68% with TheraSkin, and 47% for Apligraf within&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a 68% closure rate with TheraSkin, and a 47% closure rate, with a desired alpha&#xD;
      value of p&lt;0.05 and a power of 80%, 64 subjects would be needed. However, if a difference in&#xD;
      closure rate is assumed to be only 10%, with a closure rate of 68% with TheraSkin and 47%&#xD;
      with Apligraf, the power calculation predicts that 142 subjects would be needed. A compromise&#xD;
      difference of 13% was used to predict that 84 subjects would be needed. If we assume a 20%&#xD;
      dropout rate due to lack of compliance or adverse events, we will need to enroll a total of&#xD;
      100 subjects.&#xD;
