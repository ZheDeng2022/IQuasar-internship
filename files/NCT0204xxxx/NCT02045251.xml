    <textblock>
      Over the years, it has become clear that the first-line triple therapy is losing efficacy&#xD;
      worldwide. A capsule containing 3 agents (Pylera®) containing 125mg metronidazole, 140mg&#xD;
      bismuth subcitrate potassium, and 125mg tetracycline was made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the Pylera capsule was studied in a randomized control trial, in which a&#xD;
      quadruple Pylera therapy (Pylera capsule and a PPI) was evaluated against the standard triple&#xD;
      regimen. In the study, 3 three-in-one capsules were taken four times daily (after meals and&#xD;
      at bedtime).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, we aim at assessing the effectiveness of fewer pills per day of the Pylera&#xD;
      capsule (3 Pylera capsules supplemented with the addition of amoxicillin and esomeprazole&#xD;
      twice daily; sum of 10 pills/day for 10 days) in the eradication of H. pylori.&#xD;

      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection with H. pylori has been linked with chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer disease,&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the stomach. Eradication of this organism has&#xD;
      been recommended for patients with peptic ulcer disease, low-grade gastric mucosa-associated&#xD;
      lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, chronic&#xD;
      idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, as well as first-degree relatives of gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients. Guidelines still recommend using triple therapy regimen of PPI, clarithromycin and&#xD;
      amoxicillin/metronidazole twice daily for 7 to 14 days. Over the years, it has become clear&#xD;
      that the first-line triple therapy is losing efficacy worldwide with per protocol (PP) and&#xD;
      intent-to-treat (ITT) eradication rates of less than 80%. In light of the low eradication&#xD;
      rates of this regimen, quadruple regimens (bismuth and non bismuth based) or alternative&#xD;
      fluoroquinolones-based regimens evolved in an attempt to increase the eradication of H.&#xD;
      pylori. Most of the new quadruple regimens are clarithromycin-based. Quadruple therapies&#xD;
      improved eradication rates to 85-90% but the increasing resistance of H. pylori to&#xD;
      clarithromycin rendered the above-mentioned regimens suboptimal. Many attempts to increase&#xD;
      the number of antibiotics in treatment regimens were faced with intolerability by patients of&#xD;
      the large number of pills and increasing side effects (metallic taste, nausea, etc.).&#xD;
      Considering the above, a capsule containing 3 agents (Pylera®) containing 125mg&#xD;
      metronidazole, 140mg bismuth subcitrate potassium, and 125mg tetracycline was made available.&#xD;
      The importance of such capsule lies in the 3 in 1 packaging and in the avoidance of&#xD;
      clarithromycin use and hence the low risk of resistance. The efficacy of the Pylera capsule&#xD;
      was studied in a randomized control trial, in which a quadruple Pylera therapy (Pylera&#xD;
      capsule and a PPI) was evaluated against the standard triple regimen. In the study, 3&#xD;
      three-in-one capsules were taken four times daily (after meals and at bedtime). An omeprazole&#xD;
      capsule was taken with the three single three-in-one capsules after morning and evening&#xD;
      meals. Quadruple therapy (Pylera-based) provided superior eradication rates when compared to&#xD;
      the standard triple therapy (as high as 80% eradication rate versus 55% on ITT) with similar&#xD;
      safety and tolerability [1]. In the aforementioned study, patients on quadruple therapy were&#xD;
      taking the sum of 14 pills per day. This big number of pills per day is too high and may&#xD;
      threaten compliance and adherence in real life situations outside of controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials. This is evidenced by the difference in the PP and ITT eradication rates (93% and 80%&#xD;
      respectively) that can be attributed to the load of pill load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity of H. pylori to tetracycline and amoxicillin is very high and resistance is&#xD;
      approximately zero [2]. Our local data in Lebanon show essentially no resistance to&#xD;
      tetracycline or amoxicillin and a modest rate of metronidazole resistance, similar to Western&#xD;
      countries (Fig 1). The use of these antibiotics to treat H. pylori infection is promising. In&#xD;
      addition, we have recently shown in 2 separate randomized controlled trials that the reduced&#xD;
      or half-dose of antibiotics (including 500 mg bid of amoxicillin and 250 mg bid of&#xD;
      metronidazole) can achieve the same eradication of H. pylori at reduced cost and reduced side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      Agents 2000; 19:155-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our studies have shown a declining rate of H. pylori eradication with conventional triple&#xD;
      therapy over time (Fig2).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Given the above, we aim at assessing the effectiveness of fewer pills per day of the Pylera&#xD;
      capsule (3 Pylera capsules supplemented with the addition of amoxicillin and esomeprazole&#xD;
      twice daily; sum of 10 pills/day for 10 days) in the eradication of H. pylori. The total dose&#xD;
      of drugs is shown in Figure 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients from the outpatient department and the endoscopy unit at AUBMC will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this open-label single arm trial. Patients with positive CLO tests or urea breath&#xD;
      tests, or histological documentation of H. pylori infection, will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up by phone calls on day 10 for side effects and for pill&#xD;
      count. Patients will be assessed for the presence of these side effects at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment (Day 10). A urea breath test will be done for all patients after ≥ 4 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy completion and a minimum of 2 weeks of PPI therapy to evaluate eradication rates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eradication rate will be assessed periodically (every 10 patients) to confirm efficacy with&#xD;
      stop points as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 1-10: &lt;60% eradication Patients 1-20: &lt;65% eradication Patients 1-30: &lt;70%&#xD;
      eradication Patients 1-40: &lt;75%eradication Patients 1-50: &lt;80% eradication&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the 4 tablets (2 capsules&#xD;
      containing metronidazole, bismuth, and tetracycline) plus amoxicillin and esomeprazole) given&#xD;
      twice a day for 10 days in the eradication of H. pylori. The primary end point is H. pylori&#xD;
      eradication rate on ITT and PP analysis. Secondary endpoints include: (1) tolerability, (2)&#xD;
      adverse events of the drug regimen, (3) and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients from the outpatient department and the endoscopy unit at AUBMC will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this open-label trial.&#xD;

                effective i.e. alcoholism, drug addiction, and history of poor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C- Design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After documentation of the H. pylori infection, the primary physician will introduce the&#xD;
      patient to the research fellow who will give to the patients a clear explanation of the&#xD;
      purpose of the study, risks, and benefits. Those who agree to participate and sign the&#xD;
      informed consent will be enrolled in our study. All patients will take the treatment for ten&#xD;
      days. The patients will be assessed for side effects on days 5 and 10 of the treatment&#xD;
      regimen. The eradication rate will be assessed periodically (every 10 patients for the first&#xD;
      50 patients) for efficacy and the study will be stopped if the target rates are not met. The&#xD;
      Pylera tablets will be provided free to patients. However, the amoxicillin and esomeprazole&#xD;
      are not provided freely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be taking:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 Pylera capsules b.i.d (per capsule: 125mg metronidazole, 125mg tetracycline, 140mg&#xD;
           bismuth; i.e. 250mg metronidazole, 250 tetracycline, and 280mg bismuth b.i.d)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amoxicillin (Amoxil®) 500 g b.i.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PPI (Esomeprazole 20mg b.i.d)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and potential side effects will be evaluated by phone calls (day 10) during and&#xD;
      shortly after the treatment period. After a minimum of 4 weeks of therapy completion,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to present for a urea breath test free of charge in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the eradication rate of H. pylori. All patients should be off any PPI for at least two weeks&#xD;
      before testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D- Statistical Interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of eradication of each group will be evaluated directly from the quotient of the&#xD;
      patients with negative urea breath test over the total number of patients enrolled in that&#xD;
      group. Success of therapy will be evaluated according to intent-to treat and per-protocol&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
