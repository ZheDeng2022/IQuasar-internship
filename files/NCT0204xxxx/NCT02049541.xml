  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and the best dose of&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 when given together with rituximab in&#xD;
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade B-cell lymphoma. PI3K inhibitor&#xD;
      BKM120 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways.&#xD;
      Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with rituximab&#xD;
      may be an effective treatment for B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of&#xD;
      combined rituximab and BKM120 (PI3k inhibitor BKM120) in patients with previously treated&#xD;
      indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (including follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone&#xD;
      lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia), and mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined BKM120 and rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate for efficacy of BKM120 in combination with rituximab in these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and rituximab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on days 2, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on day 1 of courses 3, 5, 7, 9,&#xD;
      and 11. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients with asymptomatic progression may continue treatment for up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
