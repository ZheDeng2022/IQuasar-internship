  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highest treatment efficacy in patients with refractory myeloma may be achieved with regimens&#xD;
      combining novel agents and alkylating agents. However, in applying this approach the patients&#xD;
      are at substantial risks of a critical myelosuppression. Pomalidomide demonstrates&#xD;
      significant activity in combination with Dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. This trial is an attempt to further improve the efficacy of&#xD;
      Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone as well as to balance efficacy and toxicity. Integration of&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide in the treatment in case of suboptimal response or first evidence of&#xD;
      progressive disease has the aim to significantly increase duration of treatment that should&#xD;
      have a positive impact on PFS. It is furthermore an attempt to optimize the potential of&#xD;
      Pomalidomide in the antimyeloma efficacy. Based on the recent findings, that myeloma is a&#xD;
      disease with a wide clonal heterogeneity, combination treatment in case of suboptimal myeloma&#xD;
      control might lead to a more effective suppression especially of aggressive subclones and&#xD;
      might reduce early resistance. In addition, with the goal of keeping the individual patient&#xD;
      as long as possible under an effective IMiD treatment, the potential of the drug might be&#xD;
      optimized according to the current view of maintenance treatment resulting ideally in an&#xD;
      outgrowth of indolent clones in the bone marrow niche.&#xD;
