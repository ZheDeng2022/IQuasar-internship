  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2881078 to humans. The intention of this study&#xD;
      is to provide sufficient confidence in the safety of the molecule to inform progression to&#xD;
      further repeat dose and proof of concept studies. This study will include approximately 52&#xD;
      subjects and consist of 2 parts. Part A will consist of two cohorts of 8 subjects to assess&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) of ascending single oral doses of&#xD;
      GSK2881078. Cohorts 1 and 2 will include healthy male subjects. Part B (Cohorts 3, 4 and 5)&#xD;
      will include three cohorts of 12 healthy male subjects to examine the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) of repeated doses of GSK2881078 over 14 days. The total duration&#xD;
      of the study including screening and follow-up, is not expected to exceed 70 days.&#xD;
