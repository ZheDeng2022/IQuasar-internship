    <textblock>
      Rivaroxaban is a recently developed factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of thromboembolic disease. There are no data on dose adjustments in patients with&#xD;
      severe chronic renal failure. It's use is therefore not recommended in this patient&#xD;
      population. The present study aims to asses in 12 hemodialysis patients that require&#xD;
      prevention of deep vein thrombosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the AUC and Cmax of 10 mg rivaroxaban&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the effect of 10 mg rivaroxaban on coagulation assays&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the effect of a single dialysis session on plasma levels of rivaroxaban and on anti-Xa&#xD;
           levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the safety and tolerability of rivaroxaban&#xD;

      1. Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard anticoagulant treatment for decades,&#xD;
           despite their unpredictable pharmacology and their slow onset and offset of action,&#xD;
           requiring frequent monitoring and bridging with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH),&#xD;
           and resulting in a substantial risk of under- and overtreatment. Patients with end-stage&#xD;
           renal disease have an increased risk of bleeding due to their underlying disease.&#xD;
           Therefore, anticoagulants need to be used with caution in these patients. In addition,&#xD;
           the vitamin K antagonists are increasingly implicated in the development of vascular&#xD;
           calcifications in this already vulnerable population. A search for alternative&#xD;
           anticoagulants is therefore warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rivaroxaban is a recently developed factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor for the prevention and&#xD;
           treatment of thromboembolic disease (1). Rivaroxaban has a much lower pharmacokinetic&#xD;
           variability and little interaction with food and drugs, contributing to consistent and&#xD;
           predictable anticoagulation. As a consequence, routine monitoring is not required.&#xD;
           Rivaroxaban has been shown to be effective and safe in large trials on the prevention&#xD;
           and treatment of venous thromboembolism (2,3) and the prevention of stroke in atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rivaroxaban inhibits factor Xa in a concentration-dependent manner. Even though routine&#xD;
           monitoring is not required, there are clinical situations in which an evaluation of its&#xD;
           anticoagulant effect is desirable. Rivaroxaban prolongs prothrombin time (PT) and&#xD;
           activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTTT) in a concentration-dependent manner.&#xD;
           However, the extent of prolongation varies considerably with the type of reagent that is&#xD;
           used. This variation cannot be reduced by conversion of PT values given in seconds to&#xD;
           international normalized ratio values; therefore, PT and activated partial&#xD;
           thromboplastin time are not useful for measuring the pharmacodynamic effects of&#xD;
           rivaroxaban. Anti- Factor Xa activity is also influenced by rivaroxaban and is the most&#xD;
           reliable method to evaluate the clinical effect of rivaroxaban (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban is high (80 % - 100 %) for the 10 mg dose,&#xD;
           with maximum plasma concentration (Cmax). appearing 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake.&#xD;
           Intake with food does not affect rivaroxaban area under the curve (AUC) or Cmax.&#xD;
           Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily.&#xD;
           Plasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92 % to 95 %, with serum&#xD;
           albumin being the main binding component. Due to the high plasma protein binding&#xD;
           rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. There are, however, no data about plasma&#xD;
           protein binding in hemodialysis patients. Unchanged rivaroxaban is the most important&#xD;
           compound in human plasma, with no major or active circulating metabolites being present.&#xD;
           With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be classified as a&#xD;
           low-clearance drug. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the elimination&#xD;
           half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration of a 10 mg dose the elimination&#xD;
           becomes absorption rate limited with mean terminal half-lives of 7 to 11 hours (6,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rivaroxaban has a dual mode of elimination. Approximately 2/3 of the administered dose&#xD;
           is metabolized to inactive metabolites in the liver, with half then being eliminated&#xD;
           renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the&#xD;
           administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the&#xD;
           urine, mainly via active renal secretion (6,7). In individuals with mild (measured&#xD;
           creatinine clearance [CreaCl] 50-80 ml/min), moderate (CreaCl 30-49 ml/min) and severe&#xD;
           (CreaCl 15-29 ml/min) renal impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were&#xD;
           increased 1.4-, 1.5- and 1.6-fold respectively, as compared with control subjects,&#xD;
           whereas maximum plasma concentration was relatively unaffected (8). Corresponding&#xD;
           increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In individuals with mild,&#xD;
           moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa-activity was&#xD;
           increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively, as compared to healthy&#xD;
           volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4&#xD;
           respectively (8). There are no data in patients with CreaCl &lt; 15 ml/min. Based on these&#xD;
           data, dosing guidelines for patients with renal failure have been issued. No dose&#xD;
           adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CreaCl 50-80 ml/min) or&#xD;
           moderate renal impairment (CreaCl 30-49 ml/min). In patients with severe renal&#xD;
           impairment (CreaCl 15-29 ml/min), rivaroxaban is to be used with caution. Use is not&#xD;
           recommended in patients with CreaCl &lt; 15 ml/min (6,7).&#xD;
