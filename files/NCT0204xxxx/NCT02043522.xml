      This study is being done with a radioisotope, 123I-mIBG (Adreview), to develop a nuclear&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging test for patients with decreased heart function which can be used to&#xD;
      predict the progression of the heart disease and provide the appropriate clinical treatment.&#xD;
      The types of patients to be studied include patients who have had a heart attack where heart&#xD;
      muscle may be damaged and patients diagnosed with heart failure who have enlarged hearts.&#xD;
      Both conditions may cause poor muscle contraction and disturbances in electrical signal&#xD;
      conduction. There will also be a control group of participants with no evidence of heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      123I-mIBG has been shown to be effective in assessing the areas of the heart being activated&#xD;
      involuntarily by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). 123I-mIBG is an iodine based&#xD;
      radioisotope that is chemically similar to norepinephrine (NE) in the heart. NE is&#xD;
      responsible for the way the SNS regulates heart functions such as heart rate and the force of&#xD;
      heart contractions. NE acts automatically to maintain a homeostasis or balance within the&#xD;
      SNS. The amount of 123I-mIBG, mimicking NE, that appears on the nuclear image using the&#xD;
      heart-to-mediastinum ratio (H/M ratio), was predictive of the progression of heart failure,&#xD;
      arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different types of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging will be&#xD;
      used: standard SPECT and cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that CZT SPECT will have greater H/M ratios than standard SPECT imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      123I-mIBG (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy can be used to assess cardiac sympathetic activity and&#xD;
      predicts prognosis in patients with heart failure. The results of prognostic studies were&#xD;
      validated in the AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure (ADMIRE-HF)&#xD;
      trial, which was a large multi-centre prospective international study of 961 patients with&#xD;
      NYHA Class II - III Heart Failure and LV ejection fraction &gt; 35%2. This landmark study used&#xD;
      planar imaging for calculation of the heart-to-mediastinal ratio (H/M) as a quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of global uptake. The H/M on 4 hour delayed planar imaging was predictive of heart&#xD;
      failure progression, arrhythmic events and cardiac death and provided incremental value to&#xD;
      B-type natriuretic peptide and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study using quantitative MIBG SPECT, a new method for the calculation of the H/M ratio&#xD;
      was developed, compared several reconstruction methods and demonstrated that the H/M ratio&#xD;
      from SPECT was equivalent to the planar H/M ratio for differentiating normal participants&#xD;
      from heart failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of SPECT imaging to provide more accurate quantitative measurement of myocardial&#xD;
      activity may also provide more accurate measurements of MIBG washout, which has been shown to&#xD;
      be predictive of sudden cardiac death using planar imaging. SPECT imaging also can provide&#xD;
      information about the regional distribution of MIBG, which has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      predictive of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, mismatch of regional MIBG uptake and perfusion&#xD;
      reflecting deinnervation of viable tissue may identify myocardium with potential for&#xD;
      development of ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, SPECT MIBG imaging may provide much useful&#xD;
      prognostic information in addition to the H/M ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a single dose of the isotope and the H/M ratio will be measured using&#xD;
      3 types of imaging techniques with cameras and software currently used at the University of&#xD;
      Ottawa Heart Institute:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Planar (2D) imaging, as used in the ADMIRE-HF trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hawkeye Infinia 3D SPECT imaging, which is conventional SPECT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Discovery NM-530 CZT 3D SPECT imaging, a newer SPECT technology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images will be taken at predetermined time points over a 5 hour period on the study&#xD;
      /injection day. Participants will be monitored for any clinical changes with routine lab work&#xD;
      and physical observations during the study.&#xD;
