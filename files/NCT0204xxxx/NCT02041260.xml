      Phase II, non-randomized, open-label study to determine the efficacy of cabozantinib as a&#xD;
      firstline treatment for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Subjects will&#xD;
      receive drug at a starting dose of 60mg PO QD. Subjects can receive drug as long as they&#xD;
      continue to derive clinical benefit or until they experience unacceptable drug-related&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
