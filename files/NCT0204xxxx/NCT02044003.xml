  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using the Intact Vascular&#xD;
      (Innovasc) Tack-It Endovascular Dissection Repair System (Tack Intravascular Staple System)&#xD;
      in patients with vascular flaps in the infrainguinal due post-angioplasty dissection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of delivery and placement of the&#xD;
      Innovasc Tack Intravascular Staple System on vascular flaps in the SFA, created by&#xD;
      percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated as the 30-day (or hospital discharge date, whichever is longer) rate&#xD;
      of major adverse events defined as the composite endpoint of death, device embolization, the&#xD;
      occurrence of surgery related to the device, device related occlusion of the artery, or major&#xD;
      unplanned amputation of the ipsilateral lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Innovasc Tack&#xD;
      Intravascular Staple System to permanently secure vascular flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Evaluation of Feasibility (technical success) of the Innovasc Tack Intravascular&#xD;
      Staple System (procedure and device) will be evaluated acutely by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility is defined as the ability to accurately place the Plaque Tacks and resolve&#xD;
           post-PTA dissection flaps prior to the conclusion of the procedure, as demonstrated by&#xD;
           angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute technical success: Acute luminal patency during the revascularization procedure&#xD;
           using standard angiography which demonstrates that the lumen of the artery at the&#xD;
           location of tack implant remains patent at the conclusion of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional objectives of the study are to assess additional parameters as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term success will be assessed at one (1) month and three (3) months by evaluation&#xD;
           of post-implant stability of the Plaque Tack relative to vascular or external landmarks&#xD;
           at 30 days and 3 months via standard x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patency at 30 days and 3 months via duplex scanning or angiography, whichever deemed&#xD;
           most appropriate for follow up of each individual patient by the principal investigator.&#xD;
