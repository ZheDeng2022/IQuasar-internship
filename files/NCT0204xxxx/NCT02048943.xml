    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the highest and safest doses of dovitinib lactate, paclitaxel&#xD;
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, and gemcitabine hydrochloride when given&#xD;
      together. Dovitinib lactate disrupts the activity of fibroblast growth factor receptors and&#xD;
      reduces cancer growth and spread. Gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized&#xD;
      nanoparticle formulation are anti-cancer drugs for treating many cancer types.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of dovitinib&#xD;
      (dovitinib lactate) when administered concurrently with gemcitabine (gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride) and nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the safety profile of dovitinib, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      combination in patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of dovitinib, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and&#xD;
      their metabolites when administered concurrently in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the study combination in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors and pancreas adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore serum and tumor biomarkers predictive of efficacy to the study combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dovitinib lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) once daily (QD) 5 days per week, paclitaxel&#xD;
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, and&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
