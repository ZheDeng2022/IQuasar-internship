  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short and intermediate term outcomes of the&#xD;
      NanoKnife Irreversible Electroporation System when used to treat unresectable pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. In addition, the study will evaluate the efficacy of this device in treating symptoms&#xD;
      of unresectable pancreatic cancer. The NanoKnife, System has been commercially available&#xD;
      since 2009, and is FDA-approved to treat soft tissue tumors. The NanoKnife System has&#xD;
      received FDA clearance for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It has not received&#xD;
      clearance for the therapy or treatment of any specific disease or condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has the potential to dramatically widen the treatment&#xD;
      options for patients with pancreatic cancer. It provides a minimally invasive procedure that&#xD;
      could potentially avoid radical surgery for smaller lesions, and it could potentially offer&#xD;
      palliation of symptoms such as pain, gastric outlet obstruction and jaundice in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced unresectable disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is dismal, with a five-year survival rate of 4.9%.&#xD;
      Current treatment options include surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation. Only 15%&#xD;
      percent of pancreatic cancers are considered resectable at the time of diagnosis. Current&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic options are limited, as pancreatic adenocarcinoma is poorly responsive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Radiofrequency ablation of the pancreas in the setting of locally advanced&#xD;
      unresectable disease has been described in a few case series1-6, but implementation of that&#xD;
      technology is limited by concerns over thermal injury to adjacent organs and vessels. With&#xD;
      42,470 new cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed annually in the US and given that pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer is expected to claim 35,240 lives this year in the US7, it is the fourth leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer death in the Unites States. This information supports the notion that there is an&#xD;
      unquestionable need for novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has the potential to dramatically widen the treatment&#xD;
      options for patients with pancreatic cancer. It provides a minimally invasive procedure that&#xD;
      could potentially avoid radical surgery for smaller lesions, and it could potentially offer&#xD;
      palliation of symptoms such as pain, gastric outlet obstruction and jaundice in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced unresectable disease. Preliminary studies of IRE in the liver and prostate&#xD;
      have demonstrated that structures such as bile ducts, ejaculatory ducts, neurovascular&#xD;
      bundles, blood vessels, and the urethra heal normally after ablation, suggesting that vessels&#xD;
      and ducts within and around the pancreas may also be heal normally. Collagen matrix during&#xD;
      treatment with IRE is not destroyed thus allowing for a structure to heal normally. There is&#xD;
      no evidence that nerve ganglion are damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat based ablative therapy in the pancreas has the potential for unique complications.&#xD;
      Pancreatic necrosis is believed to play a role in creating a potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response in patients with severe acute pancreatitis8, 9 and the&#xD;
      presence of free active pancreatic enzymes is believed to contribute to the inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade of acute pancreatitis. Irreversible electroporation could potentially cause both&#xD;
      pancreatic necrosis and the release of active pancreatic enzymes. Additionally, the pancreas&#xD;
      surrounds or abuts several vital structures, including the common bile duct, the pancreatic&#xD;
      duct, the superior mesenteric artery and vein (SMA and SMV), the portal vein, the stomach,&#xD;
      and the duodenum. IRE as a non-thermic ablative modality has the potential to achieve&#xD;
      pancreatic ablation with respect of the surrounding vascular and ductal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroporation is a technique that increases cell membrane permeability by momentarily&#xD;
      changing the transmembrane potential and subsequently disrupting the lipid bi-layer integrity&#xD;
      to allow transportation of molecules across the cell membrane via nano-size pores. This&#xD;
      process - when used in a reversible fashion - has been used in research for drug or gene&#xD;
      delivery into cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a method to induce irreversible disruption of cell&#xD;
      membrane integrity (loss of cell homeostasis) resulting in cell death without the need for&#xD;
      additional pharmacological injury. Because IRE is a non-thermal technique, changes associated&#xD;
      with perfusion-mediated tissue cooling (or heating) are not relevant. While cells in the&#xD;
      ablation region are destroyed, the underlying extracellular matrix is not damaged thus&#xD;
      allowing tissues in the ablation zone to heal normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRE is administered under general anesthesia with administration of atracurium,&#xD;
      cis-atracurium, pancuronium or an equivalent neuromuscular blocking agent. This is mandatory&#xD;
      to prevent undesirable muscle contraction.&#xD;
