  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the impact of resistance training on the synthesis and release of&#xD;
      hormones and growth factors from the musculoskeletal system and the extent to which the&#xD;
      communicative capacity influences glucose homeostasis In turn, the contribution of glucose&#xD;
      regulation on the musculoskeletal system will also be evaluated. This small study will serve&#xD;
      as a pilot/feasibility study to define a protocol for implementation of a resistance training&#xD;
      intervention in the pediatric population. To establish feasibility, this study population is&#xD;
      limited to overweight African American boys ages 7-11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of well-established accolades of resistance training, historical recommendations for&#xD;
      avoidance among the pediatric population have deterred implementation of resistance training&#xD;
      interventions in young adolescents. However, contemporary data indicating a profound benefit&#xD;
      of resistance training to the skeletal system in pre-adolescents has led to the Academy of&#xD;
      Sports Medicine, as well as various other pediatric health interest groups, to support&#xD;
      supervised programs incorporating resistance training in young children, emphasizing large&#xD;
      muscle and core strengthening. To date, such trials have not been conducted in the pediatric&#xD;
      population&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early adolescence (pre-puberty) is associated with many physiological changes with the&#xD;
      intersection of metabolic pathways and body composition at the core. Lifestyle behaviors&#xD;
      provide substantial influence and the rise of sedentary behavior particularly among this&#xD;
      population can exert profound disruption. Metabolic dysfunction associated with limited&#xD;
      activity and thus limited strain on the muscles and bones is associated with poor&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health. Metabolic disturbance within the system during critical periods of&#xD;
      development such as pre-puberty confers long-term health consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication across systems is reliant upon various hormones which interact on the&#xD;
      regulation of glucose homeostasis, bone metabolism, and muscle development. While it is&#xD;
      well-established that bone and muscle growth are dependent upon fuel utilization, factors&#xD;
      secreted by bone and muscle have been recently shown to play an interactive role in glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis. Data derived primarily from animal models have demonstrated maintenance of&#xD;
      physiological levels promote optimal growth and development, whereas these hormones appear to&#xD;
      have adverse effects when levels are altered. While the data in animals is compelling,&#xD;
      translation in humans has not been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speculatively, impaired glucose homeostasis, much attributable to decreased strain on the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system, promotes impairments in physiological roles of these hormones. As a&#xD;
      result, disordered development may be of consequence, such that the bones grow bigger yet&#xD;
      have impaired quality, and delivery of fuel to muscle is compromised. Obesity-induced&#xD;
      perturbations in metabolism and tissue partitioning may be an added stress to the system,&#xD;
      impairing muscle function, power, performance and overall quality. Strategies that optimize&#xD;
      the protective effects of the musculoskeletal system may be encompassed by forced stress on&#xD;
      the system via resistance training, known to influence synthesis and release of hormones&#xD;
      involved in fuel delivery and utilization by muscle and bone. The strategy proposed will&#xD;
      target optimization of musculoskeletal health, promoting synthesis and release of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal-derived signals providing protection on metabolic health at a critical period&#xD;
      of development.&#xD;
