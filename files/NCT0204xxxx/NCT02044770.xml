  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to describe the initial clinical experience&#xD;
      with ENSEAL® G2 Articulating Tissue Sealer in laparoscopic colectomy, quantifying and/or&#xD;
      qualifying how its articulation feature enables optimization of vessel sealing through&#xD;
      improved access, approach, and visibility. This is an observational study of device usage&#xD;
      being conducted to report initial experience with the ENSEAL ART device. It is not intended&#xD;
      as hypothesis testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ENSEAL® G2 Tissue Sealer is a sterile, single-patient use surgical instrument used to&#xD;
      coagulate and transect vessels up to and including 7mm in diameter and tissue and/or vascular&#xD;
      bundles. In preclinical research using ENSEAL tissue sealers, burst pressures were 51% higher&#xD;
      for perpendicularly sealed vessels than for angled seals (p&lt;0.001) and the seal length was&#xD;
      the primary variable in determining burst pressure (Voegele AC, 2013). These results suggest&#xD;
      that the strongest possible seal may be obtained when vessels are approached perpendicularly&#xD;
      and not at an angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, desired angles for vessel sealing cannot always be obtained in the surgical field,&#xD;
      especially in laparoscopic surgery due mostly to the fixed nature of the abdominal wall&#xD;
      cannulas and the lack of adequate articulating hemostatic tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since strong vessel seals are important for adequate homeostasis, the value of an&#xD;
      articulating vessel-sealing device primarily resides in its ability to maneuver around&#xD;
      corners and behind structures in confined spaces. An articulating vessel-sealing device would&#xD;
      maximize the ability to approach vessels or bundles in a perpendicular manner to provide&#xD;
      greater seal strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENSEAL ART is the first articulating advanced bipolar device that can facilitate laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery through a 5mm port. The instrument shaft, can achieve up to 110 degrees of&#xD;
      articulation (which improves the visibility of the tip of the device's jaw) to gain access to&#xD;
      tissue in challenging anatomy, especially in deep/tight spaces, and facilitate additional&#xD;
      angles to transect and seal tissue, vessels, and vascular bundles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The articulation feature and improved ergonomics of the ENSEAL ART may provide the ability to&#xD;
      maneuver around corners and behind structures, while making it easier to capture the full&#xD;
      vessel in a single bite. These features may lead to a reduction of the number of ports, the&#xD;
      instrument exchanges between ports, the need to pass the energy device to an assistant, and&#xD;
      the number of times the surgical table tilt has to be changed during certain laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgical procedures (e.g., colectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses primarily in reporting initial user-centered interactions with the ENSEAL&#xD;
      ART device. The users of the device will be board-certified colorectal surgeons, who will use&#xD;
      it in an actual clinical setting (i.e., laparoscopic colectomies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, the study sites will begin recruitment&#xD;
      of study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of the participating study sites, 8 to 14 participants will undergo a laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy using the ENSEAL ART for vessel dissection and sealing, according to the&#xD;
      institution's standard approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video recordings from the laparoscope and external cameras will capture all device&#xD;
      activations completed with the ENSEAL ART device using articulation vs. straight (without&#xD;
      articulating). After each surgical case, PIs will complete a survey related to the perceived&#xD;
      advantages of the articulating features of ENSEAL ART in the context of their experience&#xD;
      using non-articulation tissue sealers. PIs will also complete an assessment (using a&#xD;
      validated tool) of the perceived workload of the use of the ENSEAL ART device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital video recording of the surgical procedure will be evaluated by a consultancy&#xD;
      group - Design Science Consulting Inc. (Philadelphia, PA), specializing in the conduct of&#xD;
      field research of the variables pre-established by the protocol. Design Science is a third&#xD;
      party reviewer, not associated with any of the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject-related data to be collected is limited to age, gender, diagnosis, Medical History,&#xD;
      and adverse events associated to the use of the device.&#xD;
