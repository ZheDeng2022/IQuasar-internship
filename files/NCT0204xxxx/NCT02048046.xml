    <textblock>
      Patients with heart and/or lung failure are some of the sickest patients in our hospital&#xD;
      systems. In severe cases they often need long periods of specialist care in Intensive Care&#xD;
      Units (ICU) in Australia and New Zealand. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is an&#xD;
      extremely specialised and costly form of life support, only being utilised when a patient is&#xD;
      close to death as a last resort to save their life. This form of life support has been used&#xD;
      for many years in babies and children but is relatively new for adults. Whilst there is&#xD;
      evidence emerging of the positive effects of ECMO in adults, there is a lot that is unknown&#xD;
      and further research is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another essential therapy that assists patients in their recovery from illness is the&#xD;
      provision of artificial nutrition. This liquid formula is delivered into the stomach or as a&#xD;
      nutritionally rich fluid provided into the vein. Until recently nutrition was&#xD;
      under-emphasised in the critically ill, however, it has now become clear that targeted&#xD;
      nutrition can positively affect a person's outcome and is vital during long periods of&#xD;
      intensive care hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is very limited data on how nutrition affects the outcomes of ECMO patients (positive&#xD;
      or negative). We know from limited studies that these patients receive less nutrition than&#xD;
      other patients, something that is particularly concerning given that less nutrition leads to&#xD;
      a longer hospital stay and has been linked a with higher hospital mortality. We also think&#xD;
      that adult patients on ECMO need more nutrition as they appear to lose more weight than&#xD;
      patients with other illnesses in intensive care; however this has not been confirmed. It is&#xD;
      thus essential that we understand the effects of this relatively simple but vital therapy on&#xD;
      these very sick patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to collect information on the current feeding practices in patients on&#xD;
      ECMO and describe the factors that inhibit or allow provision of nutrition so that we can&#xD;
      understand the issues that exist, develop strategies to improve delivery of nutrition and&#xD;
      determine areas for further research.&#xD;

      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. describe the current nutrition therapy practices and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. profile the barriers and enablers to successful feeding in patients requiring VV&#xD;
           (veno-venous) or VA (veno-arterial) ECMO whilst ECMO is insitu and for 7 days post ECMO&#xD;
           removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesise that patients who receive VA or VV ECMO receive inadequate amounts&#xD;
      of predicted nutrition requirements (including energy and protein) and are subject to&#xD;
      frequent episodes of nutritional delivery interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A 12 month prospective, observational study in approximately 10 sites across&#xD;
      Australia and New Zealand. Data will be collected from the commencement of ECMO until 7 days&#xD;
      after its removal. All patients who are eligible for the study will have data collected by&#xD;
      the primary dietitian or research coordinator at each site. Data collection has been confined&#xD;
      to variables available in routine practice and easily available to the dietitian.&#xD;
