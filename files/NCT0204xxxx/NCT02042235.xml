    <textblock>
      In studies of children born at term, language delay at the age of 2 years exhibits a&#xD;
      spontaneously favourable course in 30 to 50% by the age of 3 years. In France, there is no&#xD;
      recommendation for speech therapy before the age of 3 years. However, for term-born children,&#xD;
      parent-implemented language interventions conducted during the third year of life have&#xD;
      already shown a positive short-term effect on language skills. In these interventions, a&#xD;
      skilled interventionist, generally a speech therapist, teaches parents how to use specific&#xD;
      language strategies with their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that such parent-implemented interventions would be&#xD;
      particularly appropriate at short and medium term for the improvement of linguistic&#xD;
      performances in very preterm children, a population with a high prevalence of early language&#xD;
      delay. Currently, there is an opportunity to partly nest an intervention trial in a national&#xD;
      prospective population-based cohort of very preterm children, the EPIPAGE (Etude&#xD;
      EPIdémiologique sur les Petits Ages GEstationnels) 2 cohort, which has included 5 000 babies&#xD;
      born alive in France in 2011. This situation provides considerable methodological advantages.&#xD;

      EPILANG is an open randomized controlled study, in which the final assessment of the children&#xD;
      (endpoint) will be conducted by professionals blinded to the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some eligible children will first be screened using the parental questionnaire at 24 months&#xD;
      corrected age (CA) of the EPIPAGE 2 cohort. Children with language delay, defined as no words&#xD;
      combination and/or less than 30 words from Mac Arthur CDI - short version, and free of&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, will be invited to an inclusion visit at 30 months CA, if they are in an&#xD;
      EPIPAGE 2 centre participating in the EPILANG trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inclusion visit, inclusion criteria and the absence of exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      checked, data useful for the study will be collected, and the informed consent of the parents&#xD;
      collected. The child will then be randomized either in the control or the intervention group&#xD;
      if language delay is still present, defined by a score &lt; 10th percentile at the Mac Arthur&#xD;
      CDI. Twins, if both included, will be included in the same group, otherwise only the twin&#xD;
      with a language delay will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is organized in 15 weekly one-hour sessions with the child, one or both&#xD;
      parents and a speech therapist recruited and trained for the study. Maximum duration for the&#xD;
      intervention will be 6 months per child, because some sessions can be missed or delayed.&#xD;
      Parents' participation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual &quot;wait-and-see&quot; attitude will be provided to the control group, together with basic&#xD;
      advice to enhance the child's language at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, audition will be checked by an otolaryngology specialist, following&#xD;
      professional recommendations, and care will be provided in case of hearing deficit, if&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 years CA, a neuropsychological evaluation will be performed by trained psychologists for&#xD;
      both groups, blinded for the allocation group. Behaviour will be evaluated with a validated&#xD;
      parental questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be according to intention to treat.&#xD;
