  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cysts are fluid filled cavities located in the liver. They are present in 2-11% of the&#xD;
      general population, typically not causing any symptoms or complications. However, in a small&#xD;
      subset of patients complaints of pain, abdominal fullness and distension, dyspnea and nausea&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, aspiration and sclerotherapy is a treatment of choice in symptomatic patients with&#xD;
      a large dominant liver cyst. However, studies reported early fluid reaccumulation and&#xD;
      relative high recurrence rates of cyst growth after aspiration sclerotherapy ultimately&#xD;
      leading to re-interventions. In this respect, somatostatin analogues are promising agents&#xD;
      known for its volume reducing effect in patients with polycystic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to evaluate the effect of combining aspiration&#xD;
      sclerotherapy with the multi-receptor binding, long-acting somatostatin analogue Pasireotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that administrating pasireotide before and after aspiration&#xD;
      sclerotherapy could prevent early fluid reaccumulation and thereby result in a greater&#xD;
      reduction of cyst diameter. Moreover, the investigators expect a lower rate of cyst&#xD;
      recurrence and subsequently lower need for re-interventions.&#xD;
