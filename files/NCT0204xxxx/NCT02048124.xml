      Background: There is an ongoing interest in developing Endoscopic Ultrasound /Fine Needle&#xD;
      Aspiration (EUS-FNA) needles that can provide tissue core biopsies for a true histological&#xD;
      (rather than cytological) evaluation. By slightly modifying the traditional EUS-FNA needle, a&#xD;
      new needle named &quot;ProCor&quot; was developed in the hope of obtaining core samples and thus&#xD;
      increase diagnostic yield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: In this research project, we propose to conduct a prospective trial to compare the&#xD;
      results obtained with two types of needles: a 25g standard needle (25gS) and the 25g ProCor&#xD;
      needle (25gP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-FNA Biopsies will be obtained with both the 25S and 25P needles in each lesion; a&#xD;
      randomisation sequence will set in order to determine which of the two needles will first be&#xD;
      used (25S or 25P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytological or histological diagnoses will be made; . for histological diagnosis, the&#xD;
      pathologist will first establish the presence or absence of a tissue core (defined as a&#xD;
      measurable cylinder of tissue). The pathologist will assess the adequacy of each specimen:&#xD;
      cellularity (score 1 &quot;poor&quot;; score 2 &quot;good&quot;; score 3 &quot;excellent&quot;),[14] sample bloodiness&#xD;
      (score 1 &quot;minimal&quot;;score 2 &quot;moderate&quot;; score 3 &quot;significant&quot;, and the presence or absence of&#xD;
      malignancy(&quot;positive&quot; / &quot;negative&quot; / &quot;suspicious&quot; / inconclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results for continuous variables will be summarized using mean ± SD, . and categorical&#xD;
      variables using proportions. The 25S and 25P groups will be compared using Chi-square test&#xD;
      for categorical variables and, Student t test for continuous variablesTwo-sided p values less&#xD;
      than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Data will be analyzed using SPSS v&#xD;
      15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL) statistical software.&#xD;

      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the diagnostic yield of biopsies performed by EUS-FNA&#xD;
      using the 25d ProCor needle versus the standard 25g needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the diagnostic yield defined as: sensitivity for the presence of&#xD;
      cancer based on the analysis of EUS-FNA samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare the size of the &quot;core&quot; samples produced by the two types of needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to compare the incidence and severity of immediate complications associated with the two&#xD;
           types of needles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This a prospective clinical study for the validation of a new instrument (ProCor&#xD;
      biopsy needle) for application to clinical medicine, namely the diagnosis of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent by the patient will be obtained before each procedure by a single research&#xD;
      assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All EUS examinations will be performed under conscious sedation (midazolam, fentanyl) by one&#xD;
      two experienced endosonographers according to the standard procedures at the CHUM and using a&#xD;
      linear echoendoscope. , If the lesion is considered solid and EUS-FNA is considered&#xD;
      clinically indicated and safe, the patient will be enrolled and the randomisation envelope&#xD;
      will be opened. EUS-FNA Biopsies will be obtained with both the 25S and 25P needles in each&#xD;
      lesion; a randomisation sequence will set in order to determine which of the two needles will&#xD;
      first be used (25S or 25P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-FNA passes will be performed without stylet. One &quot;needle pass&quot; is defined as 5 strokes in&#xD;
      4 different areas of the lesion. The material from the first 2 needle passes (one 25S and the&#xD;
      other 25P) will be expressed into formalin to look for core samples. Material from the next 2&#xD;
      needle passes (again one 25S and the other 25P) will be expressed onto slides for cytological&#xD;
      analysis. Ease of puncture will be scored qualitatively as poor (scored 1), good (scored 2)&#xD;
      or excellent (scored 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate complications will be assessed and recorded by nurses and/or physicians during the&#xD;
      procedure as well after the procedure while the patients will be monitored in the recovery&#xD;
      room for at least 60 minutes before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The areas which will be investigated by biopsy will be the pancreas, the retroperitoneal&#xD;
      and/or the mediastinal lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytological and Histological analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from all needle passes will be stained using a standard Papanicolaou stain and&#xD;
      analyzed by one experienced pathologist who will be blinded as to needle type. The&#xD;
      cytological or histological diagnoses will be made; . for histological diagnosis, the&#xD;
      pathologist will first establish the presence or absence of a tissue core (defined as a&#xD;
      measurable cylinder of tissue). The pathologist will assess the adequacy of each specimen:&#xD;
      cellularity (score 1 &quot;poor&quot;; score 2 &quot;good&quot;; score 3 &quot;excellent&quot;),[14] sample bloodiness&#xD;
      (score 1 &quot;minimal&quot;;score 2 &quot;moderate&quot;; score 3 &quot;significant&quot;, and the presence or absence of&#xD;
      malignancy(&quot;positive&quot; / &quot;negative&quot; / &quot;suspicious&quot; / inconclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic yield Diagnostic yield is defined as sensitivity for the presence of cancer based&#xD;
      on the analysis of EUS-FNA samples. The gold standard will be the presence of cancer as&#xD;
      defined on the basis of at least one of the following two criteria: positive cytological or&#xD;
      histological results and malignant disease after clinical follow up (clinical worsening and&#xD;
      radiologic evidence of progression within the 6 months following FNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected prospectively and saved in a database. In addition to&#xD;
      demographics, these will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  size and location (pancreas, lymph node, liver, adrenal gland, others) of the target&#xD;
           lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  technical and procedure variables ( FNA path, , number of needle passes, needle&#xD;
           visibility, ease to puncture, needle failure, cellularity, bloodiness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cytological diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  final diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immediate complications. Research data and project-related documents will be preserved&#xD;
           during 15 year after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Results for continuous variables will be summarized using mean ±&#xD;
      (Standard Deviation) SD, . and categorical variables using proportions. The 25S and 25P&#xD;
      groups will be compared using Chi-square test for categorical variables and, Student t test&#xD;
      for continuous variablesTwo-sided p values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. Data will be analyzed using SPSS v 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL) statistical&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size is calculated as a study of non-inferiority. Assuming a&#xD;
      sensitivity for cancer of 85% for the 25S needle and a difference of sensitivity of 15% as&#xD;
      clinically significant, a sample size of 112 patients per group would be needed (α = 0.05 and&#xD;
      β = 0.2). Since we perform approximately 400 EUS-FNA biopsies for solid lesions annually,. it&#xD;
      is expected that this study could be completed within approximately 6 months.&#xD;
