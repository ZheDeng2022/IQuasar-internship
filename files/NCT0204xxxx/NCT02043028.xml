  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To perform chest compression (CC) in the kneeling posture in hospital, we designed a stage&#xD;
      with stairs, named the 'kneeling stool', on which a CC performer kneels beside a patient on a&#xD;
      bed.This work is the validation study to demonstrate that the kneeling stool could be used&#xD;
      for high quality hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with the kneeling posture. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that the quality of chest compression with a kneeling posture using the kneeling&#xD;
      stool is equal to or superior to CC with a standing posture using the height adjustment&#xD;
      mechanism of the bed.&#xD;

      We designed and implemented the kneeling stool to perform CPR with the kneeling posture for a&#xD;
      patient on a bed. The frame is constructed of an aluminum alloy. The size is 570 mm (width) x&#xD;
      598 mm (depth) x 600 mm (height). The weight is 9.3 kg, which is easily moved as needed. For&#xD;
      easy rotation between rescuers, a step plate was inserted. To prevent pain to the knees of&#xD;
      the kneeling CC performer, a 40mmthick sponge cushion was placed on the top plate and fixed&#xD;
      to the frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard hospital bed frame (Transport stretcher®, 760 x2110 mm, 228 kg, Stryker Co.,&#xD;
      Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA), a foam mattress (660 x 920 x 80 mm, soft foam with polyurethane&#xD;
      coverage, Stryker Co., USA), a backboard (450 ×600 ×10 mm, 3 kg Lifeline Plastic, Sung Shim&#xD;
      Medical Co., Bucheon, Korea), and a step stool (395 x 450 x 410 mm, Gunica Co.,&#xD;
      Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea) were used in the experiment. A Resusci Annie Modular System Skill&#xD;
      Reporter® manikin (Laerdal Medical, Orpington, UK) was used to perform CPR in the&#xD;
      evaluations. We added weight to the manikin to equal 34 kg for simulating the upper body&#xD;
      weight of an adult human as in a previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The participants were divided into two groups by random drawing. Each&#xD;
      performer in the first group knelt on the kneeling stool beside the manikin on a bed and&#xD;
      compressed the chest of the manikin (CCs with a kneeling posture, PK).Each performer in the&#xD;
      second group stood on a step stool beside the manikin on a bed and compressed the chest of&#xD;
      the manikin (CCs with a standing posture, PS). When the performer stood beside the manikin on&#xD;
      a bed, the height of the manikin's back was adjusted in height to the knee level of the&#xD;
      provider using the step stool and the bed height adjustment mechanism. All the participants&#xD;
      performed continuous CCs for 5 minutes without audio-visual feedback. After 2 weeks, the&#xD;
      posture used for the CCs by each group was changed. Each participant recorded his/her fatigue&#xD;
      and pain levels on a visual analogue scale (VAS, score 0 indicates &quot;no pain and fatigue&quot; and&#xD;
      score 10 indicates &quot;unbearable pain and fatigue&quot;) for each minute during 5 minutes of CCs.&#xD;
      After conclusion of the experiment, the participants selected a preferred CC posture in terms&#xD;
      of the safety and the quality of the CCs.&#xD;
