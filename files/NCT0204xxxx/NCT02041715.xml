      Phase 1, single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, first-in-human, single ascending&#xD;
      dose (SAD) study followed by a multiple-dose cohort in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 male and female healthy adult subjects, 18 to 50 years of age at the time of&#xD;
      dosing, will participate in this study. The SAD phase of the study is planned to have up to 4&#xD;
      cohorts with 4 subjects (3 receiving TKM-100802 and 1 receiving saline) in each cohort.&#xD;
      Additional cohorts may be enrolled in the SAD phase if a MTD is not established after the&#xD;
      initial 4 cohorts. In the multiple-dose phase, one cohort is planned with 4 subjects (3&#xD;
      receiving TKM-100802 and 1 receiving saline) at a maximum dose of 0.24 mg/kg TKM-100802.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be monitored for treatment-emergent and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If there are any adverse events (changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vitals and/or infusion reactions) during these monitoring periods, the Independent Safety Committee, will discuss the dosing of the remaining subjects.&#xD;
Before proceeding to the next dose cohort, the Independent Safety Committee will evaluate whether dose escalation will be permitted based on demonstration of adequate safety and tolerability.</description>
