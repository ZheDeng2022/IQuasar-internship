      We hypothesis that intake of probiotic yogurt reduces absorption of AFB1 in the gut and&#xD;
      subsequently reduce AFM1 and aflatoxins adduct, the biomarker in human urine and blood&#xD;
      respectively. We have demonstrated that yogurt made using weisella cibiria NN20 isolated from&#xD;
      fermented dough made from pearl millet in eastern part of Kenya sequestered upto 42% of&#xD;
      aflatoxin available in our invitro texts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both the developed and developing world, humans are continuously exposed to a plethora of&#xD;
      environmental toxins, both in nature and as the result of anthropomorphic activity. Aflatoxin&#xD;
      B1, one such example, is one of the most toxic substances known to man, but it is all around&#xD;
      us and can be found in our food, and especially cereals which form over 70% of Kenya staple&#xD;
      food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limiting cereal intake is not always easy, as it is one of the most plentiful and nutritious&#xD;
      food sources in Kenya and is the primary source of dietary energy for many societies in&#xD;
      Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently discovered a novel property of lactic acid bacteria in which aflatoxin B1,&#xD;
      is sequestered and/or detoxified by the microbes causing reduction of toxin levels in their&#xD;
      environment. We hypothesize that sequestration of toxins in the gastrointestinal tract by&#xD;
      ingested probiotic bacteria will cause a reduction in host toxin uptake by carrying them out&#xD;
      of the body in the feces preventing their passage from the gastrointestinal tract into the&#xD;
      host. Our primary objective is to test our hypothesis that consumption of a probiotic yogurt&#xD;
      will result in decreased levels of Aflatoxin B1 in a group of school-aged children. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to determine the baseline levels of aflatoxin B1 in a group of&#xD;
      school-aged children in eastern Kenya. The tertiary objective is to establish the baseline&#xD;
      gastrointestinal microbiota of these children and how consumption of a probiotic yogurt&#xD;
      affects the microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A class of 60 pupils from Identified primary school, approximately 7 years old, will be&#xD;
      randomized to two groups matching ages, sex and weight. They will receive a daily 100g&#xD;
      serving of the probiotic yogurt and a portion of local milk in between the trial period.&#xD;
      Before the first administration of the yogurt/milk, blood, urine and feces will be collected.&#xD;
      After 30 days; biological specimens will again be collected to observe potential reductions&#xD;
      in toxin levels.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Participants will be recruited from an identified primary school and&#xD;
        parental/ legal guardian consent will be required as well as assent from the child. The&#xD;
        primary school has been identified with the help of Ministry of agriculture home economics&#xD;
        extension officer. The criterion of selecting the primary school is accessibility from Embu&#xD;
        ATC where yogurt will be produced and the area which is prone to aflatoxin B1. Children&#xD;
        between the ages of 6 and 10 will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Children would be excluded if they are already consuming fermented milk&#xD;
        products or are lactose intolerant.&#xD;
