  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite an ongoing controversy in the scientific literature, the link between anesthesia and&#xD;
      dementia and/or cerebral atrophy remains unclear. Recent retrospective data suggests an&#xD;
      association of surgery with a reduction in brain volume. With the present prospective cohort&#xD;
      study, we would like to reproduce and verify these results, and investigate a possible&#xD;
      association with the postoperative cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure cerebral gray matter volumes in elderly patients before, 3 and 12 months&#xD;
      after major non-cardiac surgery and determine cognitive functions at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgery under general anesthesia in elderly patients is associated with a loss of gray&#xD;
           matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The degree of cognitive dysfunction is associated with the loss of grey matter in brain&#xD;
           areas relevant for cognitive functions.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia care for elective surgery of patients that are in their seventies or eighties is&#xD;
      an ever-growing entity in clinical practice, given the demographic development in many&#xD;
      countries of the Western world. Cognitive decline of variable degree is frequently observed&#xD;
      after major surgery in elderly patients. A potential association between anesthesia and the&#xD;
      development of dementia and brain atrophy in elderly patients is controversial. However, it&#xD;
      is not uncommon that during preoperative visits by the anesthesiologist, patients express&#xD;
      fear to suffer some sort of cognitive decline after the operation, and raise concerns about&#xD;
      psychological or neurological long-term adverse effects (e.g. memory loss) related to&#xD;
      anesthesia. Clinicians have identified this problem decades ago, and are adding postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) to the list of frequent complications of anesthesia in elderly&#xD;
      patients; yet, there is a lack of prospective clinical data and poor understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of POCD, and no preventive strategy or treatment has been described so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study reported an incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) of 41% in&#xD;
      surgical patients 60 years of age, or older. In a previous study conducted by our group, as&#xD;
      many as 47% of patients over 65 years presented with POCD one week after surgery. In many&#xD;
      patients, this is a transient problem, but some patients retain permanent deficits, with&#xD;
      increased mortality and important consequences on the socioeconomic situation. An association&#xD;
      between surgery and long-term cognitive decline has not been established yet; however,&#xD;
      patients who develop postoperative delirium (a transient, but particularly severe form of&#xD;
      POCD) have an increased risk of developing dementia in the years following surgery. However,&#xD;
      in a cohort follow-up study, the diagnosis of POCD itself did not represent a significant&#xD;
      risk factor for dementia. The pathophysiology of postoperative cognitive decline remains&#xD;
      unclear. However, studies in animals have shown that the systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      elicited by the surgical procedure is associated with microglial activation and postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Furthermore, volatile anesthetics have been shown to be neurotoxic in&#xD;
      cell cultures, and in some animal experiments exposure to clinical concentrations of volatile&#xD;
      anesthetics was associated with postoperative cognitive decline. A recent retrospective&#xD;
      analysis of cohort data suggests that surgery may be associated with a decrease in brain&#xD;
      volume in patients. However, due to methodological limitations in this study, no analysis of&#xD;
      a potential link between atrophy and cognitive functions was made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be investigated. Seventy patients undergoing major surgical&#xD;
      procedures will be recruited for this study, and 30 healthy study participants (no surgical&#xD;
      intervention) will be recruited to serve as controls. In all patients, baseline cognitive&#xD;
      functions and structural MRI imaging including determination of gray matter volumes relevant&#xD;
      for cognitive functions (hippocampus) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Surgery group Sevoflurane (n = 70)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Control group (n = 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants of the Surgery group Sevoflurane (Group 1) will be recruited as patients&#xD;
      of the Basel University Hospital, a tertiary medical care center in Basel, Switzerland,&#xD;
      associated with the University of Basel, Switzerland. Study participants of the Control group&#xD;
      (Group 2) will be recruited randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted primary endpoint of the study is the difference in change of hippocampal volume over&#xD;
      time between patients with POCD and patients without POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint is the correlation between change in cerebral volume and change in&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be standardized (general anesthesia using sevoflurane and fentanyl for&#xD;
      maintenance, thiopental for induction and atracurium or rocuronium for neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade). Intraoperatively, the dose of anesthetics will be controlled using an EEG derived&#xD;
      index (depth of anesthesia monitoring (Bispectral Index (BIS), Aspect Medical Systems), and&#xD;
      end-tidal sevoflurane concentration monitoring). Furthermore, intraoperative bilateral&#xD;
      cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring (NIRO-200, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan)&#xD;
      will be applied. Data will be downloaded directly from the monitors and the anesthesia&#xD;
      machine (Dräger Perseus) using ICM+ software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive assessment test battery CERAD-Plus consistent of the Consortium to Establish a&#xD;
      Registry for Alzheimer's Disease - Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-NAB), Trail&#xD;
      Making Tests A+B, and phonetic fluency (s-words), as well as the Test for Attentional&#xD;
      Performance (TAP) developed to analyze different aspects of attention, will be performed&#xD;
      preoperatively, at 7 days, 3 month and 12 months postoperatively. Training of all study&#xD;
      personnel and supervision of cognitive testing will be carried out by the Memory Clinic at&#xD;
      Basel University Hospital. Cognitive functions will be quantified using the CERAD total&#xD;
      score, in its demographically corrected form. A correction for short-term practice effects&#xD;
      will be carried out based on previous work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken from study participants preoperatively, 12h postoperatively, and&#xD;
      on day 2 and 7, to determine levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Blood samples will be stored for 1 year to allow&#xD;
      additional determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, Procedural and Subjective Patient Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, sex, and years of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive testing as outlined: CERAD-Plus (CERAD-NAB, Trail Making Tests A+B, phonetic&#xD;
           fluency (s-words)), Test for Attentional Performance (TAP), preoperatively, at 7 days, 3&#xD;
           months and 12 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Charlson Comorbidity Score preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year&#xD;
           postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA physical status, type and duration of anesthesia, type and duration of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative delirium (Confusion Assessment Method; CAM), repeat surgery and&#xD;
           postoperative infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective grading of cognitive functions on a VAS scale (0-10) preoperatively, at 7&#xD;
           days, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective grading of change in cognitive functions on a five-point Likert scale (much&#xD;
           worse, worse, equal, better, much better) at 7 days, 3 months and 1 year&#xD;
           postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective grading of successful surgery (Yes/No) at 7 days, 3 months and 1 year&#xD;
           postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective grading of pain on a VAS scale (0-10) preoperatively, 7 days, 3 months and 1&#xD;
           year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year postoperatively on the same day&#xD;
      as cognitive function testing. No intravenous contrast dye will be administered. Training of&#xD;
      all study personnel and MRI evaluation, and/or supervision of MRI evaluation, will be carried&#xD;
      out by the Division of Neuroradiology at the University Hospital Basel. High resolution&#xD;
      anatomic and diffusion MRI will be performed using the hospital's 3T MAGNETOM Prisma™ MRI&#xD;
      scanner (Siemens, Zurich, Switzerland). For our initial MRI analysis, we assume that the same&#xD;
      regions as those described in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#xD;
      are relevant to POCD. We will perform a region of interest (ROI) analysis during this part of&#xD;
      the analysis. In a second step, we will perform a whole brain analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole brain MRI protocol includes high resolution three-dimensional (3D)-T1 (MPRAGE&#xD;
      sequence, repetition time (TR) = 1620 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.48 ms, 192 slices), clinical&#xD;
      standard at the University Hospital Basel) and 3D-T2 (SPACE sequence, TR = 3200 ms, TE = 408&#xD;
      ms, 192 slices) imaging for segmentation. Furthermore, a diffusion sequence (DTI sequence, TR&#xD;
      = 5800 ms, TE = 77 ms, 50 slices, 64 directions, 8 B0) for quantitative imaging will be used.&#xD;
      We added a two-dimensional (2D)-PD/T2 weighted sequence (TSE sequence, TR = 4480 ms, TE1 = 9&#xD;
      ms, TE2 = 106 ms, 46 slices) for diagnostic purposes. The total acquisition time for the MRI&#xD;
      is approximately 24 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation will be performed with the FreeSurfer&#xD;
      image analysis suite, which is documented and freely available for download online&#xD;
      (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The technical details of these procedures are described&#xD;
      in prior publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons (preoperatively to 3 months postoperatively) of hippocampal volume and the&#xD;
      results of voxel-based volumetry of the medio-temporal lobe and lateral association areas of&#xD;
      the temporal and parietal lobes will be performed using region of interest (ROI) analysis.&#xD;
      The quantitative imaging results will be correlated to the CERAD total score performance&#xD;
      obtained on the same day as the MRI scans. The relationship of changes in volume (if present)&#xD;
      with intraoperative depth of anesthesia (BIS) and the administered dose of sevoflurane&#xD;
      expressed as age-corrected minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) equivalent multiplied by time&#xD;
      of administration will be calculated. We will also use multivariate approaches (voxel-wise&#xD;
      multivariate analysis (MANOVA) and classification/prediction procedure) on multi-parameter&#xD;
      MRI data in order to build optimal composite predictors of patients' neuropsychological&#xD;
      outcomes. In whole brain analysis, we will use a multiple regression and repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA whole brain voxel-wise analyses in FreeSurfer to correlate the estimated modulated gray&#xD;
      matter volume with the neuropsychological scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that 41% of operated patients develop POCD, and a standard deviation of the&#xD;
      hippocampal volume change of 0.45 in both patients with POCD and without POCD, a total sample&#xD;
      size of 56 subjects may detect a difference of 0.4 mm3 in hippocampal volume with a power of&#xD;
      90% at a two-sided significance level of 5%. To compensate for the high loss to follow-up&#xD;
      which is unfortunately typical for studies on POCD, and estimated at 20%, we will recruit 70&#xD;
      patients in the surgery group.&#xD;
