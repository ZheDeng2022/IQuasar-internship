  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study investigating the new treatment of surgery combined with&#xD;
      intraperitoneal mitomycin-C for patients with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
      peritoneal (abdominal cavity) surface. Mitomycin-C to be used in this procedure is approved&#xD;
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)for many different cancers including&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer. Giving mitomycin C via the intraperitoneal route is not FDA approved&#xD;
      and is an investigation therapy. Cytoreductive surgery plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy can&#xD;
      be offered as standard of care outside of a clinical trial. However, since this is an&#xD;
      unproven and potentially more effective but a more toxic approach, the investigators are&#xD;
      performing this procedure under an IRB approved clinical trial in order to better evaluate&#xD;
      the risks and benefits of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized, evidence-based approach is currently lacking for patients with peritoneal&#xD;
      surface malignancy from gastrointestinal origin. A clinical trial with surgical quality&#xD;
      assurance and modern hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy incorporating critical&#xD;
      assessment of disease burden, determinants of complete cytoreduction, treatment-related&#xD;
      toxicity, quality of life and survival is imperative. Theoretically, cytoreductive surgery is&#xD;
      performed to treat macroscopic disease, and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is used&#xD;
      to treat microscopic residual disease with the objective of removing disease completely in a&#xD;
      single procedure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with peritoneal surface malignancy from gastrointestinal (GI) cancers almost&#xD;
      uniformly succumb to advanced locoregional disease in the form of intractable ascites,&#xD;
      malignant visceral obstruction and cancer cachexia. The natural history of peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis from GI malignancies is inexorably lethal with median overall survival of&#xD;
      approximately 5 months 7, as patients with disease confined to the peritoneum remain at&#xD;
      increased risk of synchronous occult hematogenous metastases. While systemic therapy improves&#xD;
      outcome in patients with hematogenous disease spread, improvements are needed in the control&#xD;
      of peritoneal surface malignancy, which is known to be relatively resistant to systemic&#xD;
      agents owing principally to the presence of a peritoneal-plasma partition. Moreover, the&#xD;
      results of surgical resection alone for peritoneal dissemination of GI cancer have been&#xD;
      disappointing given the difficulty in clearing surgically all microscopic disease foci. The&#xD;
      infusion of chemotherapy into the peritoneal cavity provides distinct pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      advantages. The addition of hyperthermia potentiates the effect of intra-peritoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy through anti-tumor synergism, without systemic drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitomycin- C is the cytotoxic agent of choice for this purpose, one that has been studied&#xD;
      most extensively for hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis of gastrointestinal origin. Mitomycin- C has also been shown to demonstrate&#xD;
      consistent pharmacokinetics, favorable toxicity profile, and hyperthermia-facilitated tumor&#xD;
      cytotoxicity, which is enhanced under conditions of tumor hypoxia; furthermore, Mitomycin- C&#xD;
      contributes to improved outcomes after optimal cytoreduction. Hence, the delivery of&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal heated chemotherapy has the advantage of dose-dense regional delivery of&#xD;
      cytotoxic agents with relatively little systemic toxicity. Current clinical experience&#xD;
      suggests that adding cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy to&#xD;
      modern systemic chemotherapy regimens may significantly improve oncological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care has an on-going cooperative Cancer&#xD;
      Bio-specimen Repository and correlative/translational research program to identify prognostic&#xD;
      factors for patients with malignant tumors, as well as factors predictive of response to and&#xD;
      toxicity of treatment. To support this important scientific work, tissue block submission&#xD;
      [primary tumor and peritoneal surface malignancy] along with serum specimens will be&#xD;
      mandatory for all patients providing informed consent for bio-specimen submission so that&#xD;
      complete tissue microarrays (TMA) may be studied. These inquiries will establish molecular&#xD;
      profiles of biomarkers of prognostic and predictive value in patients with gastrointestinal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis undergoing treatment in the context of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for analysis is to evaluate the technical parameters including&#xD;
      completeness of cytoreduction, achievement of hyperthermia, morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis undergoing CRS and HIPEC with Mitomycin- C. Patients&#xD;
      who have satisfied the inclusion criteria will be taken to the operating room for exploration&#xD;
      and cytoreductive surgery. We will record the completeness of cytoreduction (CC 0 - CC 3) as&#xD;
      described below. Complete cytoreduction will be defined as a CC 0 or CC 1. Ability to achieve&#xD;
      adequate hyperthermia will be defined as target intraperitoneal temperature of 41-43ยบ C.&#xD;
      Adverse events will be assessed through enrollment following study treatment. The severity of&#xD;
      adverse events will be evaluated using NCI-CTCAE version 4. Adverse events which are assessed&#xD;
      as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment will be followed until the AE&#xD;
      is resolved or the subject is clinically stable. Other safety data including physical&#xD;
      examinations, vital signs, hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis will be collected&#xD;
      from time of informed consent signed up through subject discontinuation or 12 months after&#xD;
      initial study treatment, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every multi-modality (CRS-HIPEC) case, the following will be required in the context of&#xD;
      this clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient eligibility for the trial will be determined and cross-sectional imaging&#xD;
           reviewed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-operative Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) score will be determined by CT and/or&#xD;
           laparoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cytoreductive surgery will be undertaken involving any or all of the six principal&#xD;
           peritonectomy procedures, based on volume and distribution of peritoneal surface&#xD;
           disease, at the surgeon's discretion, in an effort to achieve complete resection of all&#xD;
           grossly apparent peritoneal surface disease. Intraoperative PCI will be determined at&#xD;
           the beginning of cytoreductive surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Heated intra-operative intra-peritoneal chemotherapy will be delivered;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At the completion of the perfusion, the abdomen will be re-explored, residual fluid&#xD;
           aspirated and reconstruction completed if not already completed prior to HIPEC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Post resection PCI will be determined and completeness of cytoreduction will be&#xD;
           estimated and using the CC and RR systems defined above in section 5.2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Intra-peritoneal tubes and drains will be placed and the incision will be left open or&#xD;
           closed in the usual fashion at the surgeon's discretion;&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Surgical quality assurance and control (QA/QC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.1 Surgical QA/QC strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every multi-modality (CRS-HIPEC) case, the following will be required in the context of&#xD;
      this clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient eligibility for the trial will be determined and cross-sectional imaging&#xD;
           reviewed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-operative PCI score will be determined by CT and/or laparoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cytoreductive surgery will be undertaken involving any or all of the six principal&#xD;
           peritonectomy procedures, based on volume and distribution of peritoneal surface&#xD;
           disease, at the surgeon's discretion, in an effort to achieve complete resection of all&#xD;
           grossly apparent peritoneal surface disease. Intraoperative PCI will be determined at&#xD;
           the beginning of cytoreductive surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Heated intra-operative intra-peritoneal chemotherapy will be delivered;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At the completion of the perfusion, the abdomen will be re-explored, residual fluid&#xD;
           aspirated and reconstruction completed if not already completed prior to HIPEC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Post resection PCI will be determined and completeness of cytoreduction will be&#xD;
           estimated and using the CC and RR systems defined above in section 5.2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Intra-peritoneal tubes and drains will be placed and the incision will be left open or&#xD;
           closed in the usual fashion at the surgeon's discretion; 5.5 Supportive care All&#xD;
           appropriate supportive care for any side effects or toxicity will be provided by the&#xD;
           physicians in the Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care of Montefiore Medical&#xD;
           Center. Patients may be admitted as necessary to manage issues related to study&#xD;
           treatment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Definitions for adverse event reporting Adverse event (AE) assessment, data collection&#xD;
      and reporting will be done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in this study. Adverse&#xD;
      events secondary to both cytoreductive surgery and the utilization of intraperitoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be monitored closely, recorded appropriately and reported as required. The&#xD;
      descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate&#xD;
      treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE&#xD;
      version 4.0 can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) web site&#xD;
      (http://ctep.cancer.gov).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timely reporting of serious and unexpected adverse events will be conducted throughout the&#xD;
      trial period. Only commercial agents (not provided under IND) will be utilized in this study.&#xD;
      The study subject will be informed of the indications, nature, alternatives, expected&#xD;
      outcome, risks and benefits of all procedures and therapies provided in the context of this&#xD;
      study. Clearly, there are potential, foreseeable risks or discomforts to participants in this&#xD;
      study. Detailed information on adverse events or complications, which may be related to HIPEC&#xD;
      or operative procedures provided in this trial, will be collected during the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTEP CTCAE version 4.0 will be used to identify the type, and to grade the severity of&#xD;
      adverse events in this trial. An adverse event will be considered a Serious Adverse Event&#xD;
      (SAE) if that event led to death, resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, resulted&#xD;
      in permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, required inpatient&#xD;
      hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or resulted in medical or&#xD;
      surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or body function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Unanticipated Adverse Event (UAE) will be considered any serious adverse effect on health&#xD;
      or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the&#xD;
      commercial agent and/or surgical procedure, if that effect, problem, or death is not&#xD;
      identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in this investigational plan or any&#xD;
      other unanticipated serious problem associated with the commercial agent and/or operation&#xD;
      that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Adverse event assessment The severity type and grade of the adverse events will be&#xD;
      identified using the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0. Attribution/treatment relation of adverse events&#xD;
      will be defined by the study doctor as Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, including an abnormal&#xD;
      laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an&#xD;
      investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. This includes&#xD;
      any occurrence that was new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline&#xD;
      condition. Adverse events (AEs) assessments will begin at time of signing of informed consent&#xD;
      and will continue until 30 days following study treatment. AEs which are assessed as&#xD;
      possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment must be followed until the AE is&#xD;
      resolved or until the patient is clinically stable. Other safety assessments, including&#xD;
      physical examinations, vital signs, hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis, will be&#xD;
      done through subject discontinuation or 12 months after initial study treatment, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition which is detected by the diagnostic procedure conducted to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      the investigational agent is not considered an AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms or clinically significant laboratory or instrumental abnormalities of a pre-existing&#xD;
      disease, such as cancer or other disease should not be considered an AE. However, occurrence&#xD;
      of new symptoms or laboratory or instrumental abnormalities, as well as worsening of&#xD;
      pre-existing ones, is considered AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities, are&#xD;
      considered adverse events if they result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment or any other therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same procedure to confirm&#xD;
           the abnormality).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associated clinical signs or symptoms that would have a significant clinical impact, as&#xD;
           determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any untoward medical event that occurs from the time of signed informed consent to the time&#xD;
      immediately prior to the first study treatment procedure will be reported as a &quot;pre-treatment&#xD;
      event&quot; in the Medical History case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events that occur following study treatment will be documented on the AE CRF with&#xD;
      indications of onset, duration, severity (NCI CTCAEs), presumed relationship to study&#xD;
      procedure /medication (not related, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely), remedial&#xD;
      actions taken, and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical complications will be defined as secondary events deviating from the ideal course of&#xD;
      convalescence that occurred during or following the operation, resulting in changes in&#xD;
      management (diagnostic or therapeutic intervention) and delay in complete recovery and/or&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy, or chronic disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical complications will be scored according to a five-tier surgical morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality scale (according to the intensity of therapy required for the treatment of the&#xD;
      defined complication):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade Intensity of Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral medications (e.g. oral antibiotics for surgical site infection or bedside care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intravenous medications or nutrition (e.g. antiarrhythmic therapy for supraventricular&#xD;
           tachycardia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endoscopy, interventional radiology or reoperation (e.g. operative drainage of an&#xD;
           abscess)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Chronic disability or major organ resection (e.g. reduction in performance status&#xD;
           following post respiratory failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Death 7.3 Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expedited adverse event reporting for patients receiving commercial agents is required&#xD;
           for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All Grade 4 and 5 unexpected adverse events that are possibly, probably or&#xD;
                definitely related to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All Grade 5 adverse events, regardless of attribution, occurring within 30 days of&#xD;
                the end of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expedited adverse event reporting will NOT be required for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Adverse events related to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse events related to radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse events that occur following the first cancer recurrence or second primary&#xD;
                cancer development 7.4 Routine Reporting of Adverse Events All Grade 3-5 AEs must&#xD;
                be recorded on the appropriate data form. Expedited reporting is in addition to,&#xD;
                and does not supplant, the reporting of AEs as part of the data submission&#xD;
                requirements for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events will be categorized by body system (such as cardiovascular-related,&#xD;
           renal-related, etc.) and will be reported to the Montefiore institutional review board&#xD;
           (IRB) as required by the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any serious event, including death from any cause that occurs through 30 days following&#xD;
           study treatment, whether or not related to the investigational drug, must be reported to&#xD;
           PI immediately (within 24 hours) via telephone, fax, or e-mail. If initially reported&#xD;
           via telephone or e-mail, this must be followed-up by a written faxed report to be&#xD;
           submitted within 24 hours of the initial report.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initial Reports&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 24 hours of the investigator's knowledge of a serious adverse event:&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Complete a Serious Adverse Event Report Form (SAER), sign it, and fax it to the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Place the initial version of SAER in the subject's file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-Up Reports&#xD;
&#xD;
           New information received spontaneously or by request of the Medical Monitor or Safety&#xD;
           Surveillance. Within 48 hours of the receipt of new information:&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Complete a new SAER with the new information. Sign and fax the form to PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Fax copies of supporting documents (e.g., hospital discharge summaries, lab test&#xD;
           results with normal ranges, autopsy or biopsy reports) to PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Place the follow-up version of the SAE and all supporting documentation in the&#xD;
                subject's file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Final Report&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 48 hours of the receipt of final information:&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Determine that there is no further information available and this update may be&#xD;
           considered final.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete a new SAER form with the new and final information. Sign and fax the form&#xD;
                to PI. As above, send copies of any additional supporting information.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Place this version of the final SAER into the subject's file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is imperative that IRB be informed within 24 hours of a serious adverse experience so&#xD;
           that reporting to the FDA can be met within the required time frame (7 or 15 calendar&#xD;
           days).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because of the need to report to health authorities all serious adverse experiences in a&#xD;
           timely manner, it is vitally important that an Investigator report immediately any&#xD;
           adverse experiences, which would be considered serious, even if the Investigator does&#xD;
           not consider the adverse experience to be clinically significant or drug-related.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should the Investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of relationship to study&#xD;
           treatment) that occurs while the subject is on the study, the SAE must be reported in&#xD;
           accordance with the procedures specified in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the subject is withdrawn less than 30 days after study treatment, any SAEs which&#xD;
           occur within 30 days after study treatment must be reported in accordance with the&#xD;
           procedures specified in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All serious adverse events that are assessed as possibly, probably, or definitely&#xD;
           related to study treatment are to be followed until either: the adverse event resolves,&#xD;
           the adverse event stabilizes, the adverse event returns to baseline values (if a&#xD;
           baseline value is available), or it is shown that the adverse event is not attributable&#xD;
           to the study treatment or study conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Bio-specimen collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Collection and submission of primary tumor (in cases of synchronous disease), peritoneal&#xD;
           surface malignancy, peritoneal cytology and perfusate, and serum samples are required&#xD;
           for patients who consent to participation in the correlative science studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Frozen tumor tissue or tumor tissue (primary cancer and peritoneal surface) blocks,&#xD;
           peritoneal fluid for cytology, peritoneal perfusate and serum samples will be used for&#xD;
           correlative science studies described below. Patients also may consent to storage of&#xD;
           unused samples for future research. Analysis results will not be reported to the study&#xD;
           subject and will not have any impact on how the study subject is treated and followed on&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The tumor samples, peritoneal fluid washings and perfusate samples will be processed by&#xD;
           Cancer Bio-specimen Repository (CBSR) in accordance with routine tissue banking policy&#xD;
           which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Safeguards to address medical-legal concerns of submitting pathologists&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Quality control of storage and sectioning of tissue and tissue blocks&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Quality assurance of stored/sectioned tissue and tissue blocks&#xD;
&#xD;
           โข Scientific review process for utilization of human biological specimens in CBSR&#xD;
           approved protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CBSR core laboratory is affiliated with Einstein-Montefiore Institute for Clinical&#xD;
           and Translational Research (ICTR) and is located at&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 IRB review The study will be conducted in the Montefiore&#xD;
           Medical Center, in compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),&#xD;
           Part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects), and Part 56 (Institutional Review Board) as well&#xD;
           as the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. The Montefiore&#xD;
           Institutional Review Board (IRB) will review the protocol and informed consent. The&#xD;
           study will not be initiated without IRB approval. All subjects will be required to give&#xD;
           written informed consent prior to participation in the study. This study will be&#xD;
           performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) by qualified Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study specifically incorporates the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Single arm study design&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prospectively stated objectives and analytical plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Accepted, pre-specified outcome measures for safety and efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP), with assessment via regular&#xD;
                monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality assurance procedures will be performed to assure that safety and efficacy data&#xD;
           were adequate and well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to maintain patient confidentiality, all case report forms, study reports and&#xD;
           communications relating to the study will identify subjects by initials and assigned&#xD;
           subject numbers; subjects should not be identified by name. In accordance with local,&#xD;
           national or federal regulations, the Investigator will allow the personnel of data&#xD;
           monitoring committee access to all pertinent medical records in order to verify the data&#xD;
           gathered on the case report forms. Regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration (FDA) may also request access to all study records, including source&#xD;
           documentation for inspection. Clinical information will not be released without the&#xD;
           written permission of the subject as outlined in the subject consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Researchers will ensure the confidentiality of the information gathered in the study by&#xD;
           using following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Paper based records will be kept in a secured location and only accessible to&#xD;
                personnel involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All study data will be kept in locked file cabinets and password protected files.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Computer based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study&#xD;
                through the use of access privileges and passwords.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prior to accessing any study-related information, personnel will be required to&#xD;
                sign statements agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of&#xD;
                identifiable health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study-related information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION 10.1 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target number of patients proposed for this protocol is based on our primary objective,&#xD;
      assessing completeness of cytoreduction. The achievement of hyperthermia as well as&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality will be important factors at the interim analysis also.&#xD;
      The latent goal is to utilize these estimates for generating future research hypotheses and&#xD;
      protocol development as well as to benchmark our data against published data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations are based on our primary objective. Our target sample size is 50&#xD;
      patients unless undue toxicity is encountered or the accrual is terminated at the interim&#xD;
      analyses. A sample size of n=50, would produce a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a&#xD;
      maximum width of 0.289 for a proportion of 0.5 and 0.267 for a proportion of 0.70.&#xD;
      Calculations are based on exact binomial distribution. In a large multi-institutional study,&#xD;
      75% of patients were classified as Complete continuous remission 0 (CCR) and 17% CCR-1 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Statistical Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered on an excel spreadsheet and analyzed with SAS v9.2. Data analysis will&#xD;
      be preceded by quality control of our data which will include checks for accuracy,&#xD;
      completeness and internal validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of completeness of cytoreduction, achievement of hyperthermia and postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality will be computed and reported with their 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
      Descriptive data analysis will be conducted and all adverse events and overall patient&#xD;
      characteristics will be described. Bivariate analysis will be conducted to examine factors&#xD;
      associated with complete cytoreduction and achievement of hyperthermia. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables whose distribution meets&#xD;
      normality assumptions will be analyzed with the t-test. Variables whose distribution does not&#xD;
      approximate normality will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our secondary endpoints to evaluate time to progression, progression-free survival and&#xD;
      overall survival we will use Kaplan-Meier methods. Progression-free survival will be&#xD;
      calculated from time of surgery to date of recurrence or censored at time patient is last&#xD;
      seen. Overall survival will be calculated from time of surgery to time of death or censored&#xD;
      at the time patient is last seen. Log-rank test will be used to compare survival of patients&#xD;
      who achieved complete cytoreduction with those who did not. We will compute 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals using Greenwood's formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QOL data will be collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment (FACT-C)&#xD;
      instrument. The feasibility of collecting QOL data will be assessed and rates of missing data&#xD;
      will be computed. Reasons for missing data will be characterized to the extent possible. In&#xD;
      addition to this, QOL data will be described using mean, standard deviation, median,&#xD;
      inter-quartiles and range as well as graphically. For exploratory analysis of QOL data over&#xD;
      time we will examine the use of hierarchical linear models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic and genomic data will be examined in an exploratory manner with the goal of&#xD;
      informing the formulation of new research hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2.1 Interim Analysis Decision Rules Interim analysis will be performed after the first&#xD;
      enrolled 20 cases to assess the safety of the proposed treatment. Stopping rules will be&#xD;
      based on 30-day postoperative mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall mortality rate reported by Glehen et al in the largest retrospective series of&#xD;
      patients with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC) treated with Cytoreductive Surgery in&#xD;
      combination with HIPEC was 4.1%. Based on Glehen's data, the upper limit of the 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval around the 4.1% mortality rate is 5.3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is anticipated a mortality rate of 5% - comparable to that reported by Glehen -&#xD;
      given the variability in origin of PC, given some variability in reports of mortality rates&#xD;
      as reported by Koppe eta! 58 and given that patients undergoing this approach have very&#xD;
      advanced disease and often progress through all other therapies- we will consider a 30-day&#xD;
      mortality rate (from the therapy) of greater than I 0% to be unacceptable since this rate is&#xD;
      higher than one would expect from the largest retrospective series available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30-day mortality will be evaluated after the first 20 patients have been enrolled. If no&#xD;
      more than 2 patients (I 0%) suffer a mortality within 30 days that is attributable to the&#xD;
      therapy and not the underlying disease or unrelated to the therapy, we will continue to 50&#xD;
      patients. If 3 or more patients suffer a mortality within 30 days of the therapy that is&#xD;
      directly attributable to the therapy, we will suspend accrual and will investigate the causes&#xD;
      of the higher mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the root cause of the operative mortality has been determined, the study team will&#xD;
      confer with the IRB and will make a determination as to whether accrual can be resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 Patient Accrual:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our experience at the Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care and based on&#xD;
      numbers of patients seen during the first half of the year, we expect to screen 30 patients&#xD;
      yearly. We estimate 2/3 of these patients will meet inclusion criteria into the study. We&#xD;
      expect high rates of participation into this protocol and estimate that it will take us 2-3&#xD;
      years to recruit the proposed sample of 50 patients. We will follow-up these patients until&#xD;
      evidence of progression or for a total study time of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4 Interim Reports&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim reports will be prepared every 12 months. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly patient accrual rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive patient's demographic characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive clinical data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency and severity of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING 11.1 Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete research records or medical records must be maintained on each patient treated on&#xD;
      the protocol for both scheduled and unscheduled evaluations. These records should include&#xD;
      primary documentation (e.g. laboratory reports, X-ray reports, scan reports, pathology&#xD;
      reports, physician's notes, etc.) which confirm that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient meet all eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent will be obtained prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be given according to protocol (dated notes about doses given,&#xD;
           complications, and clinical outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity will be assessed according to protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response will be assessed according to protocol (X-ray, CT-scan, MRI, lab reports, date&#xD;
           noted on clinical assessment, as appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MMC Drug Accountability Records will be kept for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient should use a diary to document daily adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Data Safety Monitoring Plan The PI and the research personnel will meet at least monthly&#xD;
      to review all adverse events. Unexpected adverse events and/or serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported to the MMC IRB. If trends are noted and /or risks warrant it, accrual will be&#xD;
      interrupted and /or the protocol and/or consent will be modified accordingly. The MMC IRB&#xD;
      will review submitted adverse events monthly to also evaluate trends and will require follow&#xD;
      up plans from the principal investigator whenever a trend is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. 3 Data Reporting All patients must have signed an informed consent form and an on-study&#xD;
      (confirmation of eligibility) form filled out and signed by a participating Investigator&#xD;
      before entering on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at least monthly during therapy for development of toxicity.&#xD;
      Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting. All&#xD;
      adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by the investigator or reported by the&#xD;
      patient, must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of each episode, the&#xD;
      action taken with respect to the study treatment, and the patient's outcome. The investigator&#xD;
      must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the study treatment and for its&#xD;
      seriousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.1 Routine Data Reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be captured in the MMC C3D web based reporting system. A minimum of 25% of the data&#xD;
      will be source data verified. Grade 1 and 2 lab toxicities and medications used to treat&#xD;
      adverse events will be maintained in the source documents but will not be captured in C3D.&#xD;
      Only the following outside labs will be captured in C3D:&#xD;
&#xD;
      โข Hemoglobin, WBC, ANC, Platelets, alanine aminotransferase/ aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
      (ALT/AST), total bilirubin, Creatinine {other labs associated with a serious adverse event&#xD;
      may be captured as appropriate}&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.2 Expedited Reporting of Deaths on Study and Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol PI will report to the MMC-IRB:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All deaths&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All grade 3 and 4 (CTCAE) events that are not listed in the consent form and that are&#xD;
           possibly, probably or definitely related to the research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All serious adverse events (SAEs) that are not listed in the consent form, but are&#xD;
           possibly, probably or definitely related to the research. An SAE is defined as an&#xD;
           untoward medical occurrence that:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resulted in death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Was life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Required or prolonged hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Caused persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resulted in congenital anomalies or birth defects&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is an important medical event&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Suspected positive Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.3 Adverse Event Reporting in the Continuing Review Report&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be submitted for review by the IRB annually. The MMC-IRB requires a summary report&#xD;
      of adverse events that have occurred on the protocol since the previous continuing review.&#xD;
      The method of presentation should provide the MMC-IRB with the information necessary to&#xD;
      clearly identify risks to participants and to make a risk: benefit determination. The summary&#xD;
      report is based on the following guidance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any unexpected severity and/or unexpected frequency of expected events needs to be&#xD;
           reported and interpreted in relation to the risk: benefit of study participants in the&#xD;
           narrative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 1 events are not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 2 unexpected related to the research events is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 and 4 expected and unexpected events related to the research are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All Serious Events regardless of attribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 5 (all) events are included regardless of attribution. Based on&#xD;
           protocol-associated risks to participants, the MMC-IRB retains the authority to&#xD;
           establish more frequent Continuing Review periods than the customary annual review&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
