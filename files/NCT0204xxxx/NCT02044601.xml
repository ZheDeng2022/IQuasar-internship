    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of onartuzumab that can be given with erlotinib and standard chemoradiation (paclitaxel&#xD;
      and carboplatin) to patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Phase II is to learn if onartuzumab plus erlotinib and chemoradiation can help to&#xD;
      control NSCLC. The safety of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and you have an EGFR mutation, you&#xD;
      will be enrolled in Arm A. If you have the wild-type EGFR, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to either Arm B or C. You will have an equal chance of being enrolled&#xD;
      in either arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm A, you will receive standard chemoradiation, erlotinib, and&#xD;
           onartuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm B, you will receive standard chemoradiation, erlotinib, and&#xD;
           onartuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm C, you will receive standard chemoradiation and onartuzumab only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Arm A or B, you will receive standard chemoradiation, erlotinib, and&#xD;
      onartuzumab. You will be assigned to a dose level of onartuzumab based on when you join this&#xD;
      study. After the first dose level of onartuzumab is given, you will be watched for 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the end of radiation treatment to check for any serious side effects at that dose&#xD;
      level. If any participants in this first group have intolerable side effects, a lower dose&#xD;
      combination of the study drugs may be tested. Once the highest tolerable dose is found, extra&#xD;
      participants will receive onartuzumab at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in Arms A and B will receive the same dose level of erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive onartuzumab by vein on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. The first&#xD;
      infusion should be given over about 60 minutes. If the infusion is tolerated, other doses&#xD;
      will be given over about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive paclitaxel and carboplatin by vein over about 6 hours 1 time a week for 7&#xD;
      weeks. You will receive a separate consent form for chemoradiation, which will describe the&#xD;
      procedure and risks in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking erlotinib, it should be taken by mouth with about 1 cup of water. You&#xD;
      should take erlotinib at about the same time every day, at least 1 hour before a meal and at&#xD;
      least 2 hours after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time each week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are taking Coumadin or&#xD;
           a similar drug, this blood will also be used to check how well your blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking onartuzumab until you complete radiation therapy. You will no longer&#xD;
      be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,&#xD;
      or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over 4 years after your last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up visits around 30 days after your last dose of study drug, every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and then every 4 months for the next 2 years. During these visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are taking Coumadin or a similar drug, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to&#xD;
           check how well your blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be called about every 4 weeks and asked how you are doing for as long as your doctor&#xD;
      thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Onartuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Erlotinib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel&#xD;
      are all FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of NSCLC, but their use in&#xD;
      this study is investigational. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and&#xD;
      commercially available methods. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed&#xD;
      to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 90 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC, including squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma (including bronchoalveolar cell), and large cell anaplastic carcinoma&#xD;
             (including giant and clear cell carcinomas) and poorly differentiated (not otherwise&#xD;
             specified, NOS) non-small cell lung cancer; totally resected tumors are excluded.&#xD;
             Patients should have tumor tissue for biomarker testing if available. Archival samples&#xD;
             may be used. Patients without tissue for biomarker testing may be enrolled at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator. The determination of MET status should be done by a&#xD;
             pathologist who is trained in using the SP44 antibody with the Ventana platform and&#xD;
             using the Ventana/Genentech algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with T1or T2 disease with N2 or T3N1-2 disease (Stage IIIA) are eligible if&#xD;
             they are deemed inoperable. Patients with T4 with any N or any T with N2 or N3 disease&#xD;
             are eligible if unresectable. Patients may have limited stage M1 disease, with a&#xD;
             maximum of 3 metastatic sites (including the single brain mets) only if the other&#xD;
             sites are to be treated with definitive intent, unless they are no longer clinically&#xD;
             present secondary to induction chemotherapy. Treatment to the other sites can be&#xD;
             delivered prior to or after this trial. Measurable disease is required. See Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) definitions of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be &gt;/=18 years of age.&#xD;

          4. Patients with Zubrod performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate hematologic function defined as: ANC &gt;/= 1,500/mm3, platelets &gt;/=&#xD;
             100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL (prior to transfusions); adequate hepatic&#xD;
             function defined as: total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dl, SGOT or SGPT &lt;/= 3 x ULN, adequate&#xD;
             renal function defined as a serum creatinine level &lt;/= 2.0 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patients with a pleural effusion that is a transudate, cytologically negative and&#xD;
             nonbloody are eligible if the radiation oncologists feel the tumor can still be&#xD;
             encompassed within a reasonable field of radiotherapy. If a pleural effusion can be&#xD;
             seen on the chest computed tomography (CT) but not on chest x-ray (CXR) and is too&#xD;
             small to tap, the patient is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If patients had exploratory thoracotomy, they must have recovered from the procedure&#xD;
             (&lt;/= grade 1 or baseline). Exploratory Thoracotomy and beginning of treatment should&#xD;
             be within one month.&#xD;

             within 48 hours prior to the start of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior induction chemotherapy will be allowed, as is prior target therapy. Patients&#xD;
             with progression on an EGFR targeting agent will also be allowed, but stratified&#xD;
             between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must sign a study-specific consent form prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             reduce blood pressure (BP) below a systolic of 160 or diastolic of 100), unstable&#xD;
             angina, uncompensated congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the past&#xD;
             2 months, or cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with &gt; grade 3 neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence of life threatening disease resulting in a life expectancy of less than 3&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding, as treatment involves unforeseeable risks to&#xD;
             the participant, embryo, fetus, or nursing infant; women with a positive pregnancy&#xD;
             test on enrollment or prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are unwilling or unable to&#xD;
             use an acceptable method of contraception (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with&#xD;
             spermicide; or vasectomized partner) throughout the study and for four weeks after&#xD;
             completion of treatment or those who are using a prohibited contraceptive method&#xD;
             (methods with unknown efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who currently are participating in other clinical trials and/or who have&#xD;
             participated in other clinical trials (These patient may be enrolled but radiation&#xD;
             must not start within 15 days of any previous experiment therapy).&#xD;
