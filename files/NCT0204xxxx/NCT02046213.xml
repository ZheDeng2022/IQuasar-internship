  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose study in healthy male subjects. The study will have 2&#xD;
      phases: Pretreatment and Treatment. The Pretreatment Phase will last up to 21 days and will&#xD;
      consist of a Screening Period and a Baseline Period, during which each subject's eligibility&#xD;
      will be determined and assessments will be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>Total radioactivity derived from [14C]E2006-related material, E2006, and metabolites will be analyzed in whole blood, plasma, and red blood cells. [14C]E2006 radiolabeled material will be quantified in whole blood, plasma, red blood cells for total radioactivity using a scintillation counting method and/or accelerator mass spectrometry.</description>

    <time_frame>Urine/Feces: Up to 35 days; Plasma: Up to 816 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolite profiling in plasma, urine, and feces will be performed by radio-high performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) methods. Metabolites will be identified on the radiochromatograms, and the amount of the each metabolite will be quantified based on the peak areas on the chromatograms. For metabolites detected on the radiochromatograms, LC/MS/MS analysis will be performed to estimate and identify their chemical structures.</description>
