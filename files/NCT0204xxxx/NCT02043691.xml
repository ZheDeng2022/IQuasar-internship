  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of three&#xD;
      investigational devices, the Cook Custom Aortic Endograft, the Zenith t-Branch Endovascular&#xD;
      Graft, and the Surgeon-Modified Endografts in the treatment of aortic pathologies involving&#xD;
      the visceral vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three investigational devices offer an endovascular approach to treat complex aortic&#xD;
      pathologies that cannot be treated with commercially available devices. This customized,&#xD;
      endovascular approach has the potential to decrease hospital length of stay, pulmonary&#xD;
      complications, and in-hospital mortality.&#xD;

      Once the participant has signed the approved informed consent the following tests will be&#xD;
      done to determine final subject eligibility and which device will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Exam, Blood Tests, CT Scans (with and without contrast), Abdominal Device X-ray, and&#xD;
      Angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed for 5 years.&#xD;

The Zenith t-Branch Endovascular Graft is a tubular graft with four branches and a covered stent at the proximal end that contains barbs for proximal fixation of the device. The graft is designed to be connected with celiac, superior mesenteric and two renal arteries via self-expanding covered bridging stents.</description>
