    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of training hand movement using&#xD;
      FINGER robot after stroke. FINGER is a robot that measures finger movements and allows users&#xD;
      to play computer games using those movements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robotic devices can be used to retrain movement after stroke. However, it is unclear how best&#xD;
      to assist in movement. Providing physical assistance may improve the flow of proprioceptive&#xD;
      information to the nervous system, which may help a person relearn to move a limb. On the&#xD;
      other hand, assisting movement with a robot may cause a person to &quot;slack&quot;, not trying as hard&#xD;
      during therapy. This study will test the effect of different levels of assistance on recovery&#xD;
      of finger function during robot-assisted therapy after stroke.&#xD;

    <measure>Motor and Strength Outcome Measure Using Box and Block Test Measured in Units of Blocks Placed</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-month post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was the change in Box and Blocks score, which measures how many blocks a subject can pick up and place in a box in 60 seconds, from baseline to 1-month post-therapy. The higher the scores, the better arm and hand function indicated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor and Strength Measure Using Action Research Arm Test Measured as a Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-month post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>We compared the change in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores from the baseline evaluation to 1-month post-therapy evaluation. The ARAT is a 57-point scale, 0 being the minimum scoreand 57 being the maximum score, that measures upper extremity function, coordination, and dexterity. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Motor, Strength and Sensory Using Fugl-Meyer Test Measured as a Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-month post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer score on a scale of 0 to 66 at one-month post-therapy. The higher the scores, the better arm and hand function indicated.</description>

          <population>The number of blocks participants able to pick up and place in a box in 60 seconds at one month follow up minus the number of blocks participants able to pick up and place in a box in 60 seconds at baseline.</population>

        <title>Motor and Strength Measure Using Action Research Arm Test Measured as a Score</title>
        <description>We compared the change in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores from the baseline evaluation to 1-month post-therapy evaluation. The ARAT is a 57-point scale, 0 being the minimum scoreand 57 being the maximum score, that measures upper extremity function, coordination, and dexterity. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

        <population>The ARAT score at one-month post-therapy minus ARAT score at baseline on a 57 point scale.</population>
