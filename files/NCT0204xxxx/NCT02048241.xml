  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with explosive aggression are often rejected by their peers, placed in special&#xD;
      classroom, and contribute to family discord. When psychotherapy and family therapy is&#xD;
      unsuccessful, medications are often used. Current medications are stimulants (e.g.&#xD;
      methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), anticonvulsants (e.g. Divalproex) and antipsychotics&#xD;
      (olanzapine, risperidone). At this time, the available medications are of limited usefulness,&#xD;
      either because they do not always work or because they have side effects such as weight gain&#xD;
      or insomnia. There is a clear need for new medications to treat explosive aggression when&#xD;
      psychotherapy is unsuccessful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is the medication Intuniv when combined with psychotherapy will&#xD;
      be more helpful to children with explosive aggression than placebo combined with&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Intuniv is a long acting form of guanfacine, a medication approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Intuniv is not a stimulant, nor is&#xD;
      it an anticonvulsant, nor is it an antipsychotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children in this study will be between the ages of 6 and 12 and meet Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Psychiatry Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for&#xD;
      Intermittent Explosive Disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive children are often alienated from parents, separated from peers, placed in special&#xD;
      education and segregated with other aggressive children. While predatory (i.e. planned, goal&#xD;
      directed, reward driven) aggression is not responsive to pharmacologic treatment, non&#xD;
      predatory (impulsive, paranoid, irritable) aggression (DSM-IV-TR &quot;Intermittent Explosive&#xD;
      Disorder&quot;) often is. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is characterized by discrete episodes of&#xD;
      failure to resist aggressive impulses resulting in serious assaults or destruction of&#xD;
      property. In children, due to their limited ability to damage or hurt others, the seriousness&#xD;
      of the aggressive impulses are indicated by (a) the frequency and severity of tantrums (b)&#xD;
      the fact that the severity is out of proportion to the provocation, and (c) the intent to&#xD;
      damage and hurt is present and (d) this pattern of events causes impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of aggression being studied is equivalent to that in moderate to severe&#xD;
      Oppositional Defiant Disorder with the severity due to the tantrums rather than passive&#xD;
      aggression (Modified Overt Aggression Score between 15-50). For 20 years a blood pressure&#xD;
      medication, guanfacine (Tenex), has also been used for impulse control (e.g. in Attention&#xD;
      Deficit Disorder, in Tourette's Syndrome) and to calm the sympathetic nervous system when it&#xD;
      is hyper-aroused (e.g. in opiate and nicotine withdrawal]. Both impulsivity and hyper arousal&#xD;
      can also promote intermittent explosive aggression. If guanfacine treats impulsivity and&#xD;
      hyper arousal, it is logical to ask if guanfacine can treat intermittent explosive&#xD;
      aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shire Pharmaceuticals modified the guanfacine molecule to create a long acting preparation&#xD;
      (Intuniv) that the FDA recently judged safe and effective for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity&#xD;
      Disorder (ADHD) in children ages 6-17. Secondary analysis of data from the pivotal studies&#xD;
      that led to this indication revealed that in ADHD children, Intuniv also reduced&#xD;
      oppositional-defiant symptoms. Better impulse control (these were all ADHD children) and/or&#xD;
      decreased sympathetic arousal (common to all intermittent explosive aggression) are plausible&#xD;
      explanations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Investigator Sponsor Protocol (ISP) seeks to replicate prospectively the anti-aggression&#xD;
      finding. Since Intuniv could benefit non-ADHD aggressive children, any child with mild to&#xD;
      moderate Intermittent Explosive Disorder is eligible. Anti-psychotic and anti-convulsant&#xD;
      medications (current treatments for Intermittent Explosive Disorder) have serious side&#xD;
      effects (weight gain, metabolic syndrome) and are not always effective. Intuniv is neither a&#xD;
      stimulant, nor an antipsychotic, nor an anticonvulsant. Intuniv is not FDA approved for&#xD;
      treatment of Intermittent Explosive Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to medication or placebo, all children will receive a modified form of Parent&#xD;
      Management Training, the standard psychotherapy for oppositional symptoms, administered by a&#xD;
      child psychiatrist. It addresses the coercive reciprocal social interactions that&#xD;
      characterize microenvironment of oppositional children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty children, ages 6-12 with Intermittent Explosive Disorder will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      eight weeks of double blind Intuniv plus Parent Management Training or placebo Parent&#xD;
      Management Training. Titrated over four weeks to a maximum dose of 4 mgs or .09-.12&#xD;
      mgs/kg/day, they will be maintained on that dose for four weeks. At the end of treatment, the&#xD;
      treating physician will break the blind and offer open label treatment for eight weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Overall response to treatment is defined as at least a 70% decline in both the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) score and the Symptom Checklist-6 (SCL-6) from randomization to end of study. The MOAS measures the severity of explosive overt aggression. The score can range from 0 (no overt aggressive) and it has no theoretical upper limit (incidents could be too many to count). The higher the score, the more serious the aggression; the lower the score, the less serious the aggression. Response to treatment is defined as a 70% or more reduction in the MOAS at the end of the study. The SCL-6 uses 6 subscale items from the larger SCL that measure hostility or irritability on a scale of 1 (not at all) - 5 (definitely). The raw score ranges from 6 (no irritability) to 30 (severe irritability). The lower the score is, the better the outcome. The % decline vary from 0%-100%. A 70% or more decline in the SCL-6 score at the end of study is a response.</description>

        <description>Overall response to treatment is defined as at least a 70% decline in both the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) score and the Symptom Checklist-6 (SCL-6) from randomization to end of study. The MOAS measures the severity of explosive overt aggression. The score can range from 0 (no overt aggressive) and it has no theoretical upper limit (incidents could be too many to count). The higher the score, the more serious the aggression; the lower the score, the less serious the aggression. Response to treatment is defined as a 70% or more reduction in the MOAS at the end of the study. The SCL-6 uses 6 subscale items from the larger SCL that measure hostility or irritability on a scale of 1 (not at all) - 5 (definitely). The raw score ranges from 6 (no irritability) to 30 (severe irritability). The lower the score is, the better the outcome. The % decline vary from 0%-100%. A 70% or more decline in the SCL-6 score at the end of study is a response.</description>
