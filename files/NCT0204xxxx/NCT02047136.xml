  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Histamine is a biologically active component that can be found in many foods and beverages.&#xD;
      Intake of excessive histamine from foods or beverages, can trigger symptoms including&#xD;
      urticaria. A low histamine diet has been recommended as one of the possible treatments for&#xD;
      patients with chronic urticaria. There are very few studies to confirm the effectiveness of&#xD;
      such diets and, to the investigators' knowledge, none from Asia where high histamine&#xD;
      containing meals are often eaten (personal observations). The objective of the present study&#xD;
      is to investigate the therapeutic effect of low histamine diet in relieving symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with chronic urticaria with or without angioedema, and / or pruritus (U/A/P). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that following a low histamine diet for 4 weeks, the symptoms of&#xD;
      patients with chronic U/A/P should improve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blinded parallel randomized control study over 4 weeks will be conducted to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a histamine-restricted diet. Neither the subjects nor the medical&#xD;
      investigator will know which diet is being prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will only be conducted after ethical approval has been granted and with informed&#xD;
      consent. If it is a child, informed consent will be obtained from a parent. Subject has to&#xD;
      pay his/her consultation fee for doctor's and dietitian's consultation and skin prick and/or&#xD;
      blood tests at the first visit as normal but there will be no charge for subsequent visits in&#xD;
      relation to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A period of 4 weeks on the low histamine diet has previously been shown to be sufficient to&#xD;
      determine whether dietary manipulation will help in the management of the urticaria symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection Criteria and sample size calculation 78 subjects who come to Allergy Centre for&#xD;
      treatment of idiopathic urticaria, with or without angioedema and pruritus (U/A/P), will be&#xD;
      randomized into two parallel groups; treatment group (TG) will be asked to follow a&#xD;
      histamine-restricted diet for 4 weeks and the control group (CG) will be asked to follow a&#xD;
      well-balanced diet instructed by a dietitian for 4 weeks. A well-balanced diet for the CG&#xD;
      subject is tailor-made by the dietitian according to subject's usual intake to ensure that&#xD;
      the subject's energy requirement is met and all food groups are consumed. Subjects in both&#xD;
      groups are also instructed to have adequate water intake during the study period. Both groups&#xD;
      are asked to record food diary and symptoms during the study period. Consent form will state&#xD;
      that it is a study to compare the efficacy of both diets. After the study period, subjects in&#xD;
      the CG will be able to follow a low histamine diet if this is proven to be beneficial, so&#xD;
      everyone will have the potential to benefit from the low histamine diet and vice versa for&#xD;
      the TG subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low Histamine Diet Histamine is present in almost all foods in small quantities. Its presence&#xD;
      increases with maturation of the food. High quantities of histamine are found mainly in&#xD;
      products of microbial fermentation, such as aged cheese, sauerkraut, wine, and processed&#xD;
      meat. Some oriental foods with high histamine content are also included.The current Low&#xD;
      Histamine Diet sheet of Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital will be used (Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Symptoms When a subject comes for the first consultation (randomization week),&#xD;
      he/she will be given a 4-point scale questionnaire (see Appendix II) to evaluate his/her own&#xD;
      symptoms (pruritus severity and number of wheals). This will be completed once every evening&#xD;
      for a week prior to the 4-week treatment period. The pruritus severity score and the number&#xD;
      of wheals during this run in week will be averaged and used as the mean baseline score. The&#xD;
      summation of mean pruritus score (MPS) and the mean number of wheals (MNW) will be the mean&#xD;
      total symptoms score (MTSS) for the baseline period. Medical investigator will also evaluate&#xD;
      the subject's global symptoms severity (GSS) at the first consultation (randomization week)&#xD;
      and second consultation (at the end of week 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPS and GSS is scored as 0 = none; 1 = mild (present but not disturbing); 2 = moderate&#xD;
      (disturbing but not hampering day time activities and/or sleep); and 3 = severe/intense&#xD;
      (disturbing and hampering day time activities and/or sleep). Number of wheals are scored as 0&#xD;
      = none; 1 = mild (less than 20 wheals per 24 hours); 2 = moderate (21-50 wheals); and 3 =&#xD;
      severe (more than 50 wheals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first consultation with the medical investigator, a skin prick test and/or blood&#xD;
      tests for specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to eight major food allergens will be tested,&#xD;
      namely cow's milk, egg, peanut, treenuts, wheat, soya, seafood, shellfish. Subject will&#xD;
      consult a dietitian for either a well-balanced diet (CG) or low histamine diet (TG) and&#xD;
      he/she is asked only to start the diet one week after the first consultation. The subject&#xD;
      will be asked to fax or email his/her completed questionnaire and food diary for checking&#xD;
      before he/she starts the diet. Dietitian will ensure that the questionnaire and the food&#xD;
      diary are completed correctly by the subject. Dietitian will then phone the subject not only&#xD;
      to remind him/her to start on the diet but also to make sure that the subject corrects any&#xD;
      errors in completing the questionnaire and food diary. If the diary during the run in period&#xD;
      is done very poorly it may have to be repeated before the formal diet begins. Dietitian will&#xD;
      conduct subsequent weekly phone follow up with each subject. Each subject will be reminded to&#xD;
      complete their questionnaires and food diaries every evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each symptom the scores for each week will be averaged. The sum of MPS and MNW is the&#xD;
      mean total symptoms score (MTSS) and this will also be averaged for each week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of compliance of low histamine diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will complete a food diary, in addition to the symptom score chart, where he/she&#xD;
      will record his/her dietary intake for each snack and meal during the 4-week study period.&#xD;
      The food diary will be evaluated by the Allergy Centre dietitians for adherence to the diet.&#xD;
      Diet compliance score (DCS) is scored as 0 = not comply at all; 1 = poor diet compliance&#xD;
      (intake of 2 or more high histamine foods daily); 2 = good compliance (intake of 1 or less&#xD;
      high histamine food daily); 3 = excellent diet compliance (intake of 3 or less high histamine&#xD;
      food per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding After provision of informed consent, subjects will be allocated by&#xD;
      a table of random numbers to either the TG or CG. The number sequence will be generated by&#xD;
      the computer list prepared by dietitians. Neither the subjects nor the medical investigator&#xD;
      will know which diet is being prescribed to which subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined based on a previous drug study13 as there is insufficient data on&#xD;
      low histamine diets. To detect a clinically significant mean difference of at least 1 point&#xD;
      between the active and control groups on the 4 point scale with 80% power at p&lt; 0.05 requires&#xD;
      35 subjects in each trial arm. Allowing for a 10% drop out rate, the total sample should be&#xD;
      78 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed by hospital statisticians using SPSS version 18.0.0&#xD;
      (2009). The primary outcomes will be the change in Mean Total Symptoms Score (MTSS) from&#xD;
      baseline between groups. Secondary outcome measures will include assessment of (1) the change&#xD;
      in MPS between groups; (2) the change in MNW between groups. (3) the change in GSS by medical&#xD;
      investigator between groups; (4) the comparison of area under the curve (AUC for the trend)&#xD;
      for MTSS, MPS, MNW, GSS and DCS between the groups during the 4-week period; and (5) the&#xD;
      comparison of total dose of anti-histamine used by each group compared to baseline within the&#xD;
      study period. All data will be analyzed using paired student's t-test.&#xD;
