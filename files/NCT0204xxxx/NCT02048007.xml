  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin&#xD;
      treatments as an intervention for reducing childhood morbidity and increasing growth, and for&#xD;
      the potential selection of antibiotic resistance. The investigators propose a set of 3&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trials in Malawi, Niger, and Tanzania comparing communities randomized to&#xD;
      oral azithromycin with those randomized to placebo. To assess the generalizability of the&#xD;
      intervention, investigators will monitor for antibiotic resistance, which could potentially&#xD;
      limit adoption of mass antibiotic treatments. The investigators will also assess several&#xD;
      measures of infectious diseases. The investigators hypothesize that mass azithromycin&#xD;
      treatments will reduce childhood morbidity and will be accompanied by an acceptable level of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess childhood infectious disease morbidity and macrolide resistance&#xD;
      over two years, comparing communities where children aged 1-60 months receive biannual oral&#xD;
      azithromycin to communities where the children receive biannual oral placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of Treatment Allocation. In each site, 30 communities within a contiguous area&#xD;
      of 300,000 to 600,000 individuals will be randomized into the azithromycin or placebo arm.&#xD;
      The investigators will use a simple random sample separately for each study site, but without&#xD;
      stratification or block randomization within the site. These communities are being randomized&#xD;
      from the same pool of communities eligible for a sister trial (Mortality Reduction After Oral&#xD;
      Azithromycin (MORDOR) - Morbidity Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess whether macrolide resistance is greater in a population-based&#xD;
      community sample of pre-school children, or in a clinic-based sample of ill pre-school&#xD;
      children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess whether biannual mass azithromycin treatments of pre-school&#xD;
      children can eliminate ocular chlamydia in a hypoendemic area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To assess the diversity of the microbiome of the nasopharynx, nares,&#xD;
      conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
