  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its ability to&#xD;
      prevent malaria infection or disease in a blood-stage challenge model (when volunteers are&#xD;
      infected with malaria parasites using malaria-infected red blood cells). The vaccine being&#xD;
      testing is a protein called FMP2.1, which is given with an adjuvant (a substance to improve&#xD;
      the body's response to a vaccination) called AS01B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to use this protein and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against&#xD;
      parts of the malaria parasite. This study will enable assessment of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ability of the vaccine to prevent malaria infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The safety of the vaccine in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The response of the human immune system to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done by giving participants three vaccinations and then exposing them to malaria&#xD;
      infection by transfusing a small number of red blood cells infected with malaria under&#xD;
      carefully regulated conditions. Participants will be followed closely to observe if and when&#xD;
      they develop malaria. If the vaccine provides some protection against malaria, participants&#xD;
      will take longer to develop malaria than usual or will not develop malaria at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enrol 15 participants to be vaccinated and then challenged with malaria in&#xD;
      addition to recruit 15 individuals to be control subjects.&#xD;
