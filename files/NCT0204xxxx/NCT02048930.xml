  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Easyhaler® (EH) device and other DPI devices commonly used in the UK in a UK primary care&#xD;
      asthma population of patients aged 6 to 80 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent observational study by Price et al carried out using the UK's General Practice&#xD;
      Research Database (CPRD) to compare asthma-related outcomes for different inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid (ICS) inhaler devices, using Easyhaler and dry powder inhalers (DPIs).&#xD;

    <description>The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) for ICS is defined using the following formula.&#xD;
Medication Possession Ratio = (no. of days supply of ICS/365)x 100% The numerator is truncated at 365 if greater than 365. The MPR is a measure of adherence to therapy and a cut-off of 80% has previously been used in categorising asthma patients as adherent or non-adherent; the MPR has therefore been categorised as a dichotomous variable: &lt; 80% and ≥ 80% for this analysis.</description>

        This will be a retrospective, observational study consisting of a one-year baseline period&#xD;
        immediately prior to an index prescription date (IPD), and a one-year outcome period&#xD;
        immediately following the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At the IPD, patients either:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiation cohort: receive their first prescription for ICS therapy as one of the&#xD;
             study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Step-up cohort: receive a prescription for one of the study drugs at a dose ≥50% that&#xD;
             of their prescribed ICS dose during baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Switch cohort: switch from BUD DPI (other) to BUD EH or continue on BUD DPI (other)&#xD;
             with no change in ICS dose&#xD;

             paediatrics and adolescent / adult sub analyses; and to allow for the exclusion of&#xD;
             elderly (aged 61+) smokers and ex-smokers if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (2) On-going asthma therapy: ≥2 prescriptions for asthma during the outcome period&#xD;
             (i.e. ≥1 prescription (for any asthma therapy) in addition to the prescription for ICS&#xD;
             at IPD (initiation / step-up/ switch).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (3) Evidence of active asthma:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Initiation - a diagnostic code for asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Step-up / Switch - ≥2 prescriptions for asthma (at least one of which is for ICS)&#xD;
                  at different points in time during the baseline year PLUS a diagnostic code for&#xD;
                  asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (4) Have at least one year of up-to-standard (UTS) baseline data and at least one year&#xD;
             of UTS outcome data (following the IPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded from the analysis if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) Had a COPD read code at any time; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (2) Had any chronic respiratory disease, except asthma, at any time; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (3) Patients on maintenance oral steroids during baseline year; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (4) Multiple ICS prescriptions at IPD.&#xD;
