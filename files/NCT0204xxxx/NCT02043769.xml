    <textblock>
      The Pediatric Enhanced Surveillance Study is a three part study of HIV-infected infants and&#xD;
      children in South Africa to examine, clinical, immunologic, virologic, metabolic,&#xD;
      psychosocial and behavioral outcomes. This study has two parts: (1) comprehensive&#xD;
      de-identiﬁed records review of all HIV-infected children enrolled in at the pediatric&#xD;
      Wellness and ART clinics at the ﬁve study sites; and (2) a prospective cohort surveillance&#xD;
      study with active consented enrollment with 12-24 months of follow-up. As part of the&#xD;
      prospective cohort, the study will aim to collect outcomes on children lost to follow-up,&#xD;
      including causes of death through review of death certiﬁcates in the clinical chart and&#xD;
      through verbal autopsy reports. The study will provide insights into overall outcomes for the&#xD;
      larger pediatric patient populations in the province and South Africa. This work is designed&#xD;
      in collaboration with the provincial health authorities of the Eastern Cape Department of&#xD;
      Health (EC), The International Center for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) Care and&#xD;
      Treatment Programs (ICAP) South Africa and Center of Disease Control (CDC)-South Africa in&#xD;
      support of the South African National ART Program for Children and aims to collect and&#xD;
      analyze accurate, relevant and useful information that will be available on children seen at&#xD;
      facilities. For the prospective cohort study, we will aim to enroll 400 children newly&#xD;
      initiated on ART at 5 health facilities in the Eastern Cape of South Africa who will be&#xD;
      actively followed for up to 24 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Africa is one of the countries hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. There are more&#xD;
      than 5 million people living with HIV in South Africa, including 280,000 children under the&#xD;
      age of 15. Most HIV positive children acquire infection through mother-to-child transmission;&#xD;
      in South Africa 29.3% of pregnant women attending antenatal services are HIV-infected.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is estimated that HIV is the cause of 35% of all deaths in children under&#xD;
      five in South Africa. The South African government began a national rollout of HIV treatment&#xD;
      for adults and children in 2003. As of 2007, an estimated 32,060 children under the age of 15&#xD;
      were receiving antiretroviral therapy (roughly 30% of those in need). There is an urgent need&#xD;
      to obtain more comprehensive, in-depth, profiles of children enrolled in HIV care with a&#xD;
      focus on documenting outcomes, particularly timing and causes of death, reasons for loss to&#xD;
      follow-up, timing and frequency of treatment failure, adverse events, metabolic complications&#xD;
      and psychosocial aspects of HIV disease.&#xD;

    <description>The prospective cohort surveillance will be built upon and support the routine clinical care, visit schedule and monitoring system at each study site. Eligible HIV-infected ART naïve children who are accessing care at study sites will be recruited sequentially for study enrollment. Children enrolled in the surveillance study will attend study visits co-scheduled to coincide with routine clinical visits. Study nurses will:&#xD;
review routinely collected information;&#xD;
conduct questionnaires with caregiver and child;&#xD;
conduct additional assessments of child;&#xD;
contact the caregiver by phone or through home visits for active follow-up for up to 24 months; and&#xD;
conduct active follow-up including appointment reminders by means of phone calls and defaulter tracking.</description>

      Small amounts of additional blood will be drawn at the same time as routine blood draws and&#xD;
      presents minimal risk to subjects (5cc of additional whole blood may be drawn from infants 1&#xD;
      month to 12 months of age or less than 10 kg in weight; 5 to 10 cc of additional blood may be&#xD;
      drawn from children older than 12 months of age or &gt;10 kg in weight); these risks usually&#xD;
      include bruising at the site of the venipuncture, transient pain and a negligible chance for&#xD;
      infection. No more than three attempts to obtain the blood specimens will be allowed per&#xD;
      patient per blood collection visit. If collection of a blood sample/s fails this may be&#xD;
      attempted at the next scheduled visit.&#xD;
