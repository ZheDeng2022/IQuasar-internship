      To evaluate the benefit economic and medical of self-monitoring of coagulation compared with&#xD;
      conventional follow-up of anticoagulation in a population recently fitted with mechanical&#xD;
      heart valves.&#xD;

      Rationale/context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term management of anticoagulant treatment is not straightforward, especially in&#xD;
      patients bearing mechanical heart valves due to the requirement of maintaining a high INR&#xD;
      over a narrow range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the narrow therapeutic window of AVK, undesirable events (hemorrhages, thromboembolic&#xD;
      accidents) tend to be both serious and common leading to frequent admissions to hospital The&#xD;
      self-monitoring of AVK, in addition to conventional monitoring of INR in the laboratory, is&#xD;
      now being introduced in several countries (USA and Europe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective To evaluate the benefit economic and medical of self-monitoring of coagulation&#xD;
      compared with conventional follow-up of anticoagulation in a population recently fitted with&#xD;
      mechanical heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare over one year the effect of self-monitoring of coagulation with conventional&#xD;
      follow-up of anticoagulation on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact of complications stemming from oral anticoagulant treatment (bleeding,&#xD;
           thromboembolic episodes or death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the proportion of monthly values of INR within the target range,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the inherent cost of each strategy of monitoring of anticoagulation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the incidence of death, bleeding and thromboembolic episodes (each studied separately)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of life and the satisfaction of the patient To evaluate the patients'&#xD;
           learning to be autonomous Diagram of the study Progress of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      A national, multicenter, randomized, blind trial, designed to examine the type of strategy&#xD;
      used for monitoring anticoagulation in two parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a conventional follow-up of anticoagulation (monthly checks and adjustment of INR by the&#xD;
           family doctor (GP))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a self-measurement of anticoagulation by the patient at home using a Roche Diagnostics&#xD;
           Laboratories test CoaguChek XS® or the Hemosense laboratories test INRatio® (weekly&#xD;
           measurements and adjustment of INR by the family doctor) + a monthly laboratory check of&#xD;
           INR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adults (age ≥ 18 years), either sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients fitted with one or more mechanical heart valves either alone or in combination&#xD;
           with myocardial revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  patients with social security cover&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  written informed consent signed by both patient and investigator Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  women pregnant or liable to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients unable to master the self-monitoring procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  individuals under judicial control or enquiry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol ((&gt;40g/j for men et &gt;30g/j for women&#xD;
           femmes ; 1 glass = 10g)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients on dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with incomplete understanding of instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blind patients and those unable to read&#xD;

        -  presence of circulating anticoagulant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments/Strategies/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Strategies of anticoagulation monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signature of informed consent and verification of criteria of eligibility, patients are&#xD;
      randomly allocated into the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.1. Conventional follow-up of anticoagulation In this group, the patients are instructed&#xD;
      in the use of oral anticoagulants. INR is measured once a month in the laboratory. INR must&#xD;
      lie in the therapeutic range designated by the investigative center as a function of the type&#xD;
      and the location of the valve and any associated risk factors. If necessary, the family&#xD;
      doctor adjusts INR on the day of the blood test and a new measurement is taken 48 hours later&#xD;
      if dosage has been changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This algorithm is applied until the INR comes into the designated range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2. Self-measurement of anticoagulation In this group, the patients are instructed in the&#xD;
      use and monitoring of oral anticoagulants. They are further trained in the use of the&#xD;
      self-monitoring test system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference INR will be INR labo during first post operatives weeks up to the return at home&#xD;
      because the self-measurement of anticoagulation maybe for lack of the fact of the anaemia,&#xD;
      the inflammatory syndrome and the residues of heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patients return at home, they take a measurement every week and if the result is&#xD;
      abnormal, inform their family doctor. The INR must lie within the therapeutic range&#xD;
      designated by the investigative center as a function of the type and the location of the&#xD;
      valve and any associated risk factors. If necessary, the family doctor adjusts the INR on the&#xD;
      same day as the self-measurement. A measurement is taken 48 hours later if the dosage has&#xD;
      been changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This algorithm is applied until the INR comes into the designated range. INR is measured in&#xD;
      the laboratory every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic and medical evaluation of self-monitoring of coagulation compared with conventional&#xD;
      follow-up of anticoagulation in a population recently fitted with mechanical heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main secondary evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact of complications stemming from oral anticoagulant treatment (bleeding,&#xD;
           thromboembolic episodes or death) within a population recently fitted with a mechanical&#xD;
           hear valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the proportion of monthly measurements of INR within the designated range,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the inherent cost of each strategy of anticoagulation monitoring,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact of death, bleeding and thromboembolic episodes (each studied separately),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of patients' learning of monitoring procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned population size: 1050 patients, i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  350 in the group &quot;Conventional follow-up of anticoagulation&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  700 in the group &quot;Self-measurement of anticoagulation&quot; :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  350 using the Roche Diagnostics laboratories test CoaguChek XS®&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  350 using the Hemosense laboratories test INRatio®&#xD;
&#xD;
