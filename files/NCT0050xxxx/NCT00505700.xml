  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish the maximally tolerated dose of VELCADE&#xD;
      that can be administered with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients with AML. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are assessment of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Velcade&#xD;
      when combined with Cytarabine and idarubicin. Various molecular markers associated with&#xD;
      response to Velcade, cytarabine, and idarubicin will be explored by utilizing microarray&#xD;
      analyses. The study endpoints are maximum tolerated dose and response to treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unequivocal histologic diagnosis of AML (&gt;20% blasts in the blood and/or bone marrow&#xD;
             based on the WHO and/or FAB classifications as described in Appendix 9.3), excluding&#xD;
             M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients less than 60, disease must have previously achieved CR and then relapsed&#xD;
             (&gt;20% blasts in the blood and/or bone marrow based on the WHO and/or FAB&#xD;
             classifications as described in Appendix 9.3), excluding M3 (acute promyelocytic&#xD;
             leukemia).). These patients must have a period of remission of &gt;3 months (beginning&#xD;
             with the time when the ANC &gt;1,500/ul, platelets &gt;100,000/ul and &lt; 5% marrow blasts are&#xD;
             present).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 60 years of age or older may have relapsed disease or may have previously&#xD;
             untreated AML (&gt;20% blasts in the blood and/or bone marrow based on the WHO and/or FAB&#xD;
             classifications as described in Appendix 9.3), excluding M3 (acute promyelocytic&#xD;
             leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have prior myelodysplasia. Patients may have prior treatment for&#xD;
             myelodysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had prior chemotherapy for another malignancy or an antecedent&#xD;
             hematologic disorder such as myelodysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status 0-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have all of the following pretreatment laboratory values within 21 days&#xD;
             of enrollment: total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 X the upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT and AST&#xD;
             &lt;= 2.5 X the ULN, creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients need to use an appropriate method of barrier contraception during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
