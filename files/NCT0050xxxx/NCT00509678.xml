      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of rituximab, with and without&#xD;
      methotrexate, in joints, enthesium and skin in psoriatic arthritis patients with inadequate&#xD;
      response to methotrexate who have either not tried anti-TNF therapy or have had inadequate or&#xD;
      failed response to anti-TNF therapy. To explore biologic mechanism of action via histological&#xD;
      and immunohistochemical evaluation of pre and post treatment biopsies of psoriatic plaques.&#xD;

    <description>1000mg (1gm) given as an IV infusion every two weeks for 2 doses (days 1 and 15). The first infusion of rituximab should be administered IV at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr. If a hypersensitivity or infusion related reaction does not occur, escalate the infusion rate by 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Receiving treatment on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient will have at least one evaluable skin plaque, 2 cm in diameter, that can&#xD;
             be followed with a target lesion score (scalp and groin lesions cannot be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of PsA per the CASPAR categories: Psoriasis, Nail Changes, Negative RF test,&#xD;
             Dactylitis or radiological evidence of juxta-articular new bone formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will have greater than or equal to 3 tender (out of 68 joints) and 3 swollen&#xD;
             (out of 66) joints at screening and baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy other than resolved squamous or basal cell or cervical carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a significant medical illness that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would potentially compromise the subject's ability to participate in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of another rheumatic or skin disease that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could confound the ability to discern response&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal&#xD;

             nail beds) or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment&#xD;
             with i.v. antibiotics within 4 weeks of screening or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychiatric disorder that, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this trial or would lead to poor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with any DMARD (except for MTX), any anti-TNF alpha therapy or&#xD;
             other biologic therapy. Topical medications to treat psoriasis are limited to class VI&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks of screening or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             of the investigational drug (whichever is longer).&#xD;

             Smallpox).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One intra-articular steroid joint injection is allowed, affected joint is excluded&#xD;
