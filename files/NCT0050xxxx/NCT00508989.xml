  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether niacin can improve blood flow in people with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease, in which abnormal red blood cells interfere with blood flow to cause the disease&#xD;
      symptoms. Niacin, a drug that has been used to increase HDL (good cholesterol) levels,&#xD;
      improves blood flow in people without sickle cell disease. This study will see if it can do&#xD;
      the same in people with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sickle cell disease between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      echocardiogram and 6-minute walk test of exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have the following baseline blood flow studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow-mediated dilation (FMD): An ultrasound picture of the artery in the forearm is&#xD;
           obtained. A blood pressure cuff is then placed on the upper arm and inflated for 5&#xD;
           minutes. After the pressure cuff is released, the ultrasound is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral artery tonometry (PAT): A sensor is placed on the subject s finger. The&#xD;
           sensor puts pressure on the finger and measures blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard forearm blood flow test: Small tubes are placed in the artery of the forearm at&#xD;
           the inside of the elbow. Saline is infused into one tube. Pressure cuffs are applied to&#xD;
           the wrist and upper arm. A strain gauge (rubber band device) is placed around the&#xD;
           forearm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain&#xD;
           gauge, and the flow measurement is recorded. Blood samples are collected from the tube&#xD;
           in the artery to measure blood counts, proteins and other chemicals. At various times,&#xD;
           small doses of the following drugs are administered through the tube in the vein:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and increases blood flow to the&#xD;
                heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acetylcholine causes blood vessels to dilate and slows heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LNMMA decreases blood flow by blocking the production of nitric oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood flow is measured after each dose of the different drugs. There are rest periods between&#xD;
      injections of the different drugs. Pictures of the forearm are taken during the studies using&#xD;
      an infrared camera and computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Drug Treatment. Participants are assigned to take three 4-week courses of niacin or placebo.&#xD;
      They return to the Clinical Center at the following intervals from the time they start the&#xD;
      test drug for followup:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 2, 6 and 10: Brief medical history, review of medication side effects and blood&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 4 and 8: Physical examination, brief medical history, review of medication side&#xD;
           effects and blood tests, repeat FMD and PAT blood flow studies and 6-minute walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 12: Same as weeks 4 and 8 plus standard blood flow studies and echocardiogram.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease&#xD;
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15 percent of African-Americans are homozygous&#xD;
      for sickle cell disease, and 8 percent have sickle cell trait. Hemoglobin S polymerization&#xD;
      leads to red cell rigidity, microvascular obstruction, inflammation, and end-organ ischemic&#xD;
      injury. Our published data indicate that up to 50 percent of sickle cell patients have&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction due to impaired bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide, due in large&#xD;
      part to scavenging of nitric oxide by cell-free hemoglobin. We recently have completed&#xD;
      studies that directly demonstrate endothelial dysfunction in patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease, characterized by decreased ACh dependent vasorelaxation in forearm blood flow&#xD;
      studies, distinct from the nitric oxide resistance above. Further, we have found in sickle&#xD;
      cell patients a new association between low levels of apoA-I, pulmonary hypertension and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. Raising levels of HDL, and therefore apoA-1, could have the effect&#xD;
      of ameliorating the endothelial dysfunction characteristic of sickle cell disease by&#xD;
      affecting endothelium dependent vasorelaxation. Therapies directed at restoring HDL in these&#xD;
      patients may be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDL is thought to promote vascular health in a variety of ways, some of which are unrelated&#xD;
      to lipid transport. One of the best-known mechanisms relates to efflux of cholesterol from&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque, yet HDL is thought to have several antithrombotic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro HDL attenuates formation of oxidized LDL and inhibits&#xD;
      endothelial cell expression of inflammatory cell adhesion molecules. It is also thought to&#xD;
      mediate NO production via stimulation of eNOS, thereby modulating endothelial function. In a&#xD;
      study of subjects with atherosclerosis, low HDL levels correlated with impaired vasomotor&#xD;
      relaxation via brachial artery FMD. Another study utilizing recombinant HDL cholesterol&#xD;
      infused into brachial arteries of hypercholesterolemic men resulted in increased&#xD;
      acetylcholine mediated blood flow that was inhibited by the infusion of L-NAME, an eNOS&#xD;
      inhibitor, suggesting that HDL increased blood flow via an eNOS dependent mechanism. This may&#xD;
      have implications not only for subjects with atherosclerosis, but also for those with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease and endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that niacin therapy could improve vascular reactivity in response to&#xD;
      acetylcholine. Several options for increasing HDL levels have been previously utilized in&#xD;
      forearm flow studies using venous occlusion plethysmography or flow-mediated dilation.&#xD;
      Reconstituted HDL (rHDL), apoA-1 mimetics and niacin therapy were all shown to improve&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, and proved safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will aim to 1) establish the effects of niacin treatment on raising HDL levels in&#xD;
      subjects with sickle cell disease, 2) investigate whether niacin treatment would result in&#xD;
      improvement of endothelial-dependent relaxation via venous occlusion plethysmography, and 3)&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of peripheral arterial tonometry measurements to venous occlusion&#xD;
      plethysmography and flow-mediated dilation as indicators of vascular dysfunction.&#xD;
