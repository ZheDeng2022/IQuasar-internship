    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, single center study of SCH&#xD;
      486757 in subjects with chronic cough. Subjects will be randomized to receive SCH 486757 or&#xD;
      placebo for 14 days. After a 2-week washout period, subjects will be crossed over to the&#xD;
      other treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of SCH 486757 in&#xD;
      reducing cough reflex sensitivity as determined by a challenge with capsaicin, an agent that&#xD;
      induces cough.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in cough reflex sensitivity as assessed by log10 C5 resulting from a capsaicin challenge. A capsaicin challenge will be performed on the first day (before dosing) and on the last day of each 2 week treatment period.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in hourly cough rate over 24 hours (using an automated cough counter). Baseline will be measured as the total no. of coughs on Day 1 of each treatment period and compared with the same value on the last day of each treatment period.</measure>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects, 18 to &lt;65 years old, with a history of a dry cough for &gt;6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  By history, evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease was done and ruled out by a&#xD;
             minimum of an 8-week trial of antacid therapy (with a proton-pump inhibitor [PPI]&#xD;
             given twice daily) with no clinical response in cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  By history, if there are clinical signs and symptoms of postnasal drip, these signs&#xD;
             and symptoms will have been treated with a combination of an antihistamine and&#xD;
             decongestant for a minimum of 8 weeks with no clinical response in cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  By history, if there are clinical signs and symptoms of asthma, these signs and&#xD;
             symptoms will have been treated with a combination of an inhaled steroid and a&#xD;
             short-acting beta-agonist for a minimum of 8 weeks with no clinical response in cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with current evidence of clinically significant pulmonary (especially&#xD;
             conditions that involve coughing), hematopoietic, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             neurologic, psychiatric, autoimmune, or other disease that precludes the subject's&#xD;
             participation in the study. In particular, diabetics, uncontrolled hypertensives, and&#xD;
             subjects with clinically significant cardiomyopathy, prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma,&#xD;
             seizure disorders, and psychiatric disorders are to be excluded from participation in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require chronic use&#xD;
             of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving concurrent prohibited medications unless they observe the washout&#xD;
             period prior to the baseline visit. These medications would include opioid- and&#xD;
             non-opioid-containing cough suppressants and potent CYP3A inhibitors, such as&#xD;
             ritonavir, ketoconazole, and clarithromycin. Subjects receiving ACE inhibitors or&#xD;
             MAOIs will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of allergies to more than two classes of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current smokers, ex-smokers who stopped smoking in the previous 6 months, or subjects&#xD;
             with a cumulative smoking history &gt;10 pack-years will be excluded. (Pack-years is a&#xD;
             way to measure the amount a person has smoked over a long period of time. It is&#xD;
             calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the&#xD;
             number of years the person has smoked, eg, a 10 pack-year history is equal to smoking&#xD;
             1 pack per day for 10 years or 2 packs per day for 5 years, etc.)&#xD;
