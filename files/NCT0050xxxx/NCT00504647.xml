  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition characterized by thickening&#xD;
      (hypertrophy) of the heart muscle. Many patients who have this condition have a reduced&#xD;
      ability to exercise because of breatlessness, which can in some cases be severe. This appears&#xD;
      in most cases to be due to an impairment of the filling of the heart, especially on exercise&#xD;
      this limits the amount of blood the heart is able to pump. Several factors may contribute to&#xD;
      this slow filling of the heart, including (1) The heart contracts and relaxes in an&#xD;
      incoordinate way (called 'dyssynchrony') which is inefficient, and (2) The filling of the&#xD;
      main pumping chamber (the left ventricle) may be impeded by high pressure in the other&#xD;
      ventricle(the right ventricle)- in other words the left ventricle is 'squashed' by the right&#xD;
      ventricle. This is known as diastolic ventricular interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although drugs can improve the filling of the heart and relieve symptoms, some patients&#xD;
      remain very symptomatic despite these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms responsible for the filling abnormality in patients with Hypertrophic&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy are similar to those seen in the much more common condition known as Heart&#xD;
      Failure. A special type of pacemaker technique called 'Biventricular Pacing' has been shown&#xD;
      to markedly improve symtoms in patients with heart failure. This form of pacing has been&#xD;
      shown to improve both 'dyssynchrony' ( incoordination) and 'ventricular interaction'&#xD;
      (squashed left heart) in patients with Heart Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that Biventricular pacing may similarly improve these abnormalities in patients&#xD;
      with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, resulting in an improvement of symptoms. The study will&#xD;
      focus on patients with the condition who have severe symtoms despite being on optimal&#xD;
      currently available drug therapy.&#xD;

      SUBJECTS Forty Participants, who fufil the entry criteria, will be selected. These&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Cardiomyopathy clinics run at two sites. These are the&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy Clinics at the Heart Hospital, University College London, and from the Queen&#xD;
      Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      A History will be taken and a Clinical Examination will be carried out. A validated Quality&#xD;
      of life questionaire will be completed ( Minnesota Living with Heart Failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal Cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be performed on a treadmill, with breath by&#xD;
      breath respiratory gas sampling, using a face mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 12 lead ECG will be obtained. 48hr Ambulatory Heart Rhythm Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDIAC ULTRASOUND SCAN ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the function of the Heart during its contraction and filling phases, including the&#xD;
      degree of incoordination of the Heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pacemaker capable of Biventricular pacing will be implanted, using a standard established&#xD;
      technique at one of three sites ( The Heart Hospital London, St Peters Hospital Chertsey, or&#xD;
      Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      24hr POST PACEMAKER IMPLANT. Assessment of mechanical dyssynchrony will be made using&#xD;
      Ultrasound techniques which will include 2D/ M mode Echocardiography, Doppler studies, and&#xD;
      Tissue doppler imaging. This assessment will be made with the Pacemaker off, and in Left and&#xD;
      Right heart pacing mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAEMODYNAMIC STUDIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be carried out approximately two weeks following pacemaker implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will involve Nuclear Heart Scans (Gated Equilibrium Radionuclide Ventriculography)&#xD;
      and Acute Volume Unloading of the right and left heart chambers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be carried out at the University Of Birmingham, Department of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Sciences We shall apply these techniques while the heart is paced in four different modes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nuclear heart scan is a method by which we can measure the volume of the left heart&#xD;
      chamber. The study will involve the placement of small needle into a vein of the patients&#xD;
      forearm. Through this we will inject a primer which will make participants red blood cells&#xD;
      very sticky. After twenty minutes we will take a blood sample from the same needle. This&#xD;
      sample of blood will be mixed with a radioactive tracer. The tracer will be re-injected&#xD;
      through the same needle into the participants' vein. This tracer will allow us to measure the&#xD;
      amount of blood inside the chambers of the participants' heart with a special camera, a gamma&#xD;
      camera. The pictures will be taken with the participants lying on a bed throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bed we will ask participants to lie on is called a Lower Body Negative Pressure Bed. When&#xD;
      lying on this bed the participants' legs will be inside a see through plastic dome. A belt&#xD;
      will be placed around the participants' waist in order to create an airtight seal around&#xD;
      their legs. The bed is attached to a vacuum that allows us to create a low pressure&#xD;
      environment around participants' legs. This causes blood to pool inside the veins of&#xD;
      participants' legs. This leads to Acute Volume unloading of the right and left heart&#xD;
      chambers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have received the injection of the radioactive tracer and are lying&#xD;
      comfortably in the Lower Body Negative Pressure Bed we will then take measurements of the&#xD;
      amount of blood in the participants' heart. We shall do this using the special camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We shall take measurements with the pacemaker in its four different pacemaker modes, and then&#xD;
      repeat these measurements but this time with a low pressure environment produced around&#xD;
      participants' legs in order to reduce the pressure on your heart. The test is painless apart&#xD;
      from mild discomfort from placing one needle at the beginning. The whole test will take&#xD;
      between one and one and half hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of administration has been performed safely by our team for a number of years now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 1 hour break the Participants will do Exercise component of the Nuclear Heart Scan.&#xD;
      This component of the study will involve no further doses of radiation, and no new needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to lie, semi-erect, on an exercise bed for up to 90 minutes. The&#xD;
      exercise will be in the form of a pedal bike. The pacemaker will be programmed into four&#xD;
      different modes of heart pacing. Whilst in each mode participants will be asked to exercise&#xD;
      to three different stages of exercise. Each stage will last 4 minutes. The levels of&#xD;
      difficulty will be worked out from a treadmill exercise test completed by the participants&#xD;
      prior to the pacemaker implantation. Participants will be allowed to rest between each stage&#xD;
      of exercise. If participants complete the whole study they will have cycled for a total of 48&#xD;
      minutes. During each stage 4ml of blood will be taken from the needle that will have been&#xD;
      placed in a vein during the earlier part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each stage of exercise an image of the heart will be taken with the gamma camera, as&#xD;
      done earlier in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these measurements we will be able to calculate the effect of the different pacing modes&#xD;
      on the ability of the heart to pump blood on exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are free to stop the exercise at any time they feel they cannot continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION AND FOLLOW UP. Following pacemaker implant, pressure studies, and Ultrasound&#xD;
      assessment, participants will be randomized in a double blind fashion to have their pacemaker&#xD;
      programmed to either one of the following (1) Pacemaker Off mode, ( 2 ) Left and Right Heart&#xD;
      chamber pacemaker mode. The Participants will be paced in that specific mode for four months&#xD;
      before repeat Clinical and Cardiac Ultrasound assessments. The mode of pacing will then be&#xD;
      changed, and maintained for a further four months, before repeat Clinical and Ultrasound&#xD;
      assessment. The pacing mode will be randomly selected, but no pacing mode will be repeated in&#xD;
      any one participant. The participant and the member of the research team performing the&#xD;
      Clinical and Ultrasound assessment of the participant, shall be blinded to the pacemaker&#xD;
      mode.&#xD;
