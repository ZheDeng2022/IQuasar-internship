    <textblock>
      Local study in China and Hong Kong to evaluate safety and efficacy in lapatinib +&#xD;
      capecitabine in women with Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objective of the study was to evaluate the overall clinical benefit response&#xD;
      (CBR) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single arm, open-label, multi-center study of lapatinib plus capecitabine in women&#xD;
      from mainland China and Hong Kong who had advanced or metastatic breast cancer that&#xD;
      progressed on prior chemotherapies with or without trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal for any other reasons.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. The maximum time participants were followed was approx. 90 months</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined by the percentage of participants achieving either a confirmed tumor response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a system for measuring tumor shrinkage or progression in terms of the longest dimensions of the tumor on imaging scans such as computerized tomography (CT). A &quot;partial response&quot; requires a decrease of 30% or more, &quot;complete response&quot; requires all target lesions disappear, &quot;Progression&quot; requires an increase of at least 20%, and &quot;Stable disease&quot; falls in between these two. All responses have a repeat assessment to confirm the response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. The maximum time participants were followed was 90.38 months.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dose date until the date of disease progression or death due to any reason, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six Months Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. The maximum time participants were followed up to 90.38 months, with 6 months PFS reported.</time_frame>
    <description>Six Months Progression-Free Survival is defined as the percentage of surviving participants who are progression-free longer than six months (greather than 180 days) after the first start date of study treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. The maximum time participants were followed was approx. 14.78 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response is defined as the time from first dose date until first documentation of disease response. TTR only applied to participants for whom best overall response was complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD). Participants who had not had a partial response, complete response or stable disease at the cut-off date for this endpoint analysis were censored for time to response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. The maximum time participants were followed was 88.80 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (complete response, partial response or stable disease) is defined as the time of first documentation of disease response until the date of disease progression or death due to breast cancer, whichever occurs first. DOR only applied to participants for whom best overall response was complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD). Participants who had not had a partial response, complete response or stable disease at the cut-off date for this endpoint analysis were censored for duration of response.</description>

        <title>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</title>
        <description>CBR is defined by the percentage of participants achieving either a confirmed tumor response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a system for measuring tumor shrinkage or progression in terms of the longest dimensions of the tumor on imaging scans such as computerized tomography (CT). A &quot;partial response&quot; requires a decrease of 30% or more, &quot;complete response&quot; requires all target lesions disappear, &quot;Progression&quot; requires an increase of at least 20%, and &quot;Stable disease&quot; falls in between these two. All responses have a repeat assessment to confirm the response.</description>
