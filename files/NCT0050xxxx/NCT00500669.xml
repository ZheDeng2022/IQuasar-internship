      Introduction. Varicose vein surgery is common. Worldwide, the commonest indication for this&#xD;
      type of surgery is cosmesis. However, there are also some medical indications, including&#xD;
      venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulceration. The surgery is usually straight&#xD;
      forward and can in most instances be done as a day case. Patient and medical practitioner&#xD;
      expectations are therefore high. Surgery in the groin is notorious for its risk of wound&#xD;
      infection. In primary varicose vein surgery, the groin wound infection can rate can be as&#xD;
      high as 20% 1. A more realistic figure might be approximately 10% (Sains PS, Reddy KM, Jones&#xD;
      HJS and Derodra JK. Audit of varicose vein surgery: the patients perspective. Phlebology 2005&#xD;
      20(4) 179 - 182.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small prospective study has been conducted at the Royal Hobart Hospital to establish the&#xD;
      wound infection rate in this hospital. All procedures were performed under the care of a&#xD;
      single surgeon who routinely soaks the groin wound in Betadine. Patients were followed up on&#xD;
      a weekly basis for six weeks and had wound inspections by an independent nurse consultant. Of&#xD;
      the 11 patients (five female, mean age 50.3years, range 31 - 74 years, mean weight 92kg,&#xD;
      range 60 - 130kg, mean body mass index 41) who have now completed six weeks of follow up,&#xD;
      there were a total of 17 groin wounds. Only one of these (6%) has had an infection.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this study was terminated prematurely as the independent nurse who was&#xD;
      performing the wound assessments has been replaced and there was a lag interval of at least 6&#xD;
      weeks before her replacement was due to start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major problems with varicose vein surgery is the risk of recurrence. Recurrent&#xD;
      varicose veins are more difficult to deal with than primary varicose veins and thus every&#xD;
      effort must be made at the time of the primary surgery to perform an operation with the&#xD;
      lowest recurrence rate. Despite adequate surgery, recurrence can develop via&#xD;
      neovascularisation in the groin. This may be part of the normal wound healing process. If&#xD;
      neovascularisation can be prevented, this may reduce the recurrence rate. However, this&#xD;
      should not be at the detriment of healing of the groin wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous in vitro studies have looked at the effect of povidone-iodine on some of the&#xD;
      components of wound healing. It can be toxic to granulocytes, monocytes and keratinocytes 2,&#xD;
      3 . Dilute Povidone-Iodine solutions are also known to inhibit human skin fibroblast growth&#xD;
      in vitro 4, 5. In vivo studies, however, have failed to show any clinically significant delay&#xD;
      in wound healing when wounds are irrigated with povidine iodine 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Povidine-iodine has bacteriocidal effects 6. Could it be that those groin wounds which&#xD;
      develop an infection develop neovascularisation as part of the inflammatory response? Topical&#xD;
      antimicrobial agents are commonly used in wound management. This is based on the premise that&#xD;
      reduction of bacterial contamination aids wound healing. Sindelar showed that the incidence&#xD;
      of superficial infections of surgical wounds irrigated with povidone-iodine solution prior to&#xD;
      closure was less than wounds irrigated with saline (2.9% vs. 15.1%) 7 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      No toxicity has been reported with povidone-iodine used as a brief rinse or soak, as planned&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the effect of Betadine (10% povidone-iodine) in the groin wound on&#xD;
      infection rates and recurrence rates in patients undergoing primary varicose vein surgery we&#xD;
      will conduct a prospective, randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following injury and haemostasis, hypoxia, high lactate levels and acidosis stimulate&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Under the influence of factors such as bFGF and VEGF, endothelial cells&#xD;
      proliferate and form capillary buds. These cells secrete matrix metalloproteases which allow&#xD;
      vascular buds to dissect through the wound matrix while EGF and PDGF recruit pericytes which&#xD;
      stabilise the new vessel formation (Betsholtz C, Lindblom P, Gerhardt H. Role of pericytes in&#xD;
      vascular morphogenesis. EXS9422005; 115 - 125&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators. Mr. S. R. Walker - Staff Specialist, Vascular Surgery. Prof. Sinha - Associate&#xD;
      Professor of Surgery Mr. David Cottier - Visiting Medical Officer - Vascular Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol. Inclusion criteria - Patients undergoing primary saphenofemoral ligation for&#xD;
      varicose veins (can be combined with short saphenous surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria - Allergy to iodine Redo groin dissections Patients having multiple&#xD;
      avulsions only or saphenopopliteal ligation only Patients unable to return to outpatients for&#xD;
      6 weeks to undergo assessment with the wound care nurse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted under the care of Prof. Sinha or Mr. S. R. Walker are to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suitable for the study will be recruited from the outpatient department. If the&#xD;
      patient agrees to be included in the study, they should undergo a pre-operative venous duplex&#xD;
      scan. This may alter the operative plan. If patients have had a duplex scan prior to a&#xD;
      decision on surgery, this scan does not need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission for surgery the patient should undergo the usual pre-operative work up,&#xD;
      including weight and height. Their past medical history should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should receive a pre-operative dose of low molecular weight heparin (Clexane&#xD;
      20mg) as thromboembolic prophylaxis. The groin area is shaved immediately before the&#xD;
      operation. The groin and legs are prepared for surgery in the usual way using aqueous&#xD;
      Betadine. No prophylactic antibiotics are to be given. The surgical procedure in the groin is&#xD;
      then performed in a standard manner to expose the saphenofemoral junction. The junction and&#xD;
      all tributaries are ligated. In all cases the long saphenous vein should be pin stripped to&#xD;
      the level of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, patients are randomized via a sealed envelope to either a saline soaked gauze&#xD;
      or a Betadine soaked gauze placed in the groin wound. This is left in place for a minimum of&#xD;
      one minute. Some surgeons may then chose to close the groin wound before proceeding to the&#xD;
      avulsions while others may choose to leave the soaked swab in place while any avulsions are&#xD;
      dealt with. The length of time the swab is left in the groin wound should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groin wound is then closed with vicral to the fascia and monocryl to the skin. The groin&#xD;
      wound is dressed with a non occlusive dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative protocol - Patients will be booked to see the wound care consultant on a&#xD;
      weekly basis for 6 weeks. The patients will be booked into Prof. Sinha and Mr. Walker's&#xD;
      outpatient clinic on Thursday morning. The wound care consultant will attend these clinics to&#xD;
      assess the wounds. The wound care consultant will be blinded as to whether saline or Betadine&#xD;
      was used in the groin. The wounds will be classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - normal post operative wound, no signs of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - erythema of the wound not extending for more than 5mm from wound edge&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - erythema more than 5mm but no wound discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - discharge of pus from wound&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - wound dehiscence with infection, presence of pus and necrotic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the six week follow up, the patient should undergo a venous duplex scan. This scan is&#xD;
      performed to ensure an adequate surgical procedure has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year following the surgical procedure, patients undergo a final venous duplex scan to&#xD;
      assess for signs or recurrence, and in particular, a recurrence in the groin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both post operative duplex request forms should be completed at the time of the original&#xD;
      operation with dates on the request forms for the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points. Primary end point - groin wound infection Secondary end point - groin recurrence&#xD;
      of varicose veins&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics. If use of Betadine can reduce the infection rate (from 20%) and recurrence rate&#xD;
      by 50%, for a study with 90% power, we would require at least 100 patients in each group.&#xD;
      This number could be more readily recruited in a multicentre study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is envisaged that approximate&#xD;
