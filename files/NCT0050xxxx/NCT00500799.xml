  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of certain areas of the brain in blepharospasm, a type of&#xD;
      dystonia (abnormality of movement and muscle tone) that causes unwanted or uncontrollable&#xD;
      blinking or closing of the eyelids. The study will compare brain activity in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and in people with blepharospasm to find differences in the brain that may lead to&#xD;
      better treatments for dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and people with blepharospasm who are 18 years of age and older may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. All candidates are screened with a medical history. People with&#xD;
      blepharospasm also have a physical examination and blepharospasm rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electromyography (EMG) in&#xD;
      two 4-hour sessions, separated by 1 to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the&#xD;
      coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may&#xD;
      feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in muscles of the&#xD;
      face, arm or leg. During the stimulation, subjects may be asked to tense certain muscles&#xD;
      slightly or perform other simple actions. Repetitive TMS involves repeated magnetic pulses&#xD;
      delivered in short bursts of impulses. Subjects receive 60 pulses per minute over 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface EMG is done during TMS to measure the electrical activity of muscles. For this test,&#xD;
      electrodes (small metal disks) are filled with a conductive gel and taped to the skin of the&#xD;
      face....&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will evaluate the role of an increase in excitability of the orbicularis oculi&#xD;
      (OO) muscle representation in the medial frontal areas (supplementary motor areas, SMA) and&#xD;
      anterior rostral cingulate: M3) in excessive blinking in patients with benign essential&#xD;
      blepharospasm (BEB). We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at rest, the decrease of the MEP after 15 minutes of 1Hz rTMS, targeting the SMA-M3, is&#xD;
           more prominent in patients with BEP than in healthy control subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at rest, the decrease of the MEP after 15 minutes of 1Hz rTMS targeting M1, is almost&#xD;
           the same in patients with BEP and in healthy control subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. at rest, sICI of OO muscle will be decreased and ICF increased after stimulation of the&#xD;
           SMA-M3 facial cortical area, in patients with BEP compared to healthy control subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. at rest sICI and ICF of the OO muscle will be the same after stimulation of the M1&#xD;
           facial area in patients with BEP and healthy control subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. in healthy control subjects facilitation of the MEPs evoked from M1 is more prominent&#xD;
           during voluntary blinking,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. in healthy control subjects facilitation of the MEP evoked from SMA-M3 is more prominent&#xD;
           during involuntary blinking,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. in patients with BEB there is facilitation of MEPs evoked from M1 and SMA-M3 during&#xD;
           voluntary and involuntary blinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. it is possible to evoke consistent and reproducible motor evoked responses (MEP) in the&#xD;
           orbicularis oculi (OO) muscles by stimulating the two main cortical representations of&#xD;
           upper facial region: in the medial frontal wall (SMA and cingulate cortex - its rostral&#xD;
           part, M3) and in the primary motor cortex (M1) with transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
           (TMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 patients with BEB but without severe forceful closure of eyelids, 36 normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have 3 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: screening and blepharospasm score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: stimulation of the OO muscle representation in SMA-M3 using low frequency rTMS (1Hz)&#xD;
      with the Hesed coil (designed to stimulate deep brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: stimulation of the OO muscle representation in M1 using low frequency rTMS (1Hz)&#xD;
      using a standard eight-shaped coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3: single pulse TMS will be used to evoke MEPs from OO muscles. Paired pulse TMS&#xD;
      will be used to assess sICI from OO muscles. The order of visits 2 and 3 will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures will be the sizes of OO muscle MEPs and the amount of sICI assessed&#xD;
      before and after 15 minutes of low frequency rTMS. The secondary outcome measures will be the&#xD;
      sizes of OO muscle MEPs assessed before and during voluntary and involuntary blinks.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers (aged 18 or older) who are willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients (aged 18 and older) with benign essential blepharospasm&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of neurological or psychiatric disorder, current use or a&#xD;
             history of alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric disorders requiring hospitalization or&#xD;
             prolonged treatment, head injury with loss of consciousness, or epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving drugs acting primarily on the central nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of neurological disorders other than blepharospasm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of a psychiatric disorder, current use or a history of alcohol&#xD;
             or drug abuse, psychiatric disorders requiring hospitalization or prolonged treatment,&#xD;
             head injury with loss of consciousness, or epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving drugs acting primarily on the central nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been treated with botulinum toxin injections within 3 months prior&#xD;
             to their participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are taking any medication for dystonia at the time of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with severe forceful closure of eyelids, subjects scoring more than 20 on the&#xD;
             Blepharospasm Disability scale (Lindeboom et al., 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom participation in the study would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, cause undue stress or excessive apprehensiveness will also be excluded.&#xD;
             The reason for that is that, in some patients, any stressful situation (like a medical&#xD;
             exam or experiment) may cause a strong increase in the involuntary blink rate leading&#xD;
             to a severe functional discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following exclusion criteria are due to the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
        and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation up to 1Hz (Hallett 1999) for healthy&#xD;
        volunteers and patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with cardiac pacemakers, intracardiac lines, implanted medication pumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with eye, blood vessel, cochlear, or eye implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with increased intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical means&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with metal in the cranium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with dental braces (but dental fillings are not a problem), metal fragments&#xD;
             from occupational exposure or surgical clips in or near the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a personal or family history of hearing loss&#xD;
