    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively identify blood markers that identify chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients at risk for early (&lt;90 days) and late (&gt;= 1 year) mortality&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The annual incidence of patients initiating chronic hemodialysis (HD) will double&#xD;
      (~100Kâ†’~200K) over the next decade. Despite several advances, HD mortality rates remain&#xD;
      extremely high and have not dramatically changed over the past several years. The United&#xD;
      States Renal Data System (USRDS) is the largest epidemiological database of patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) throughout the US, and studies utilizing the USRDS and similar&#xD;
      studies emanating from large dialysis providers have served as the benchmark for guiding the&#xD;
      care of all dialysis patients in the US While these databases have been an excellent resource&#xD;
      for testing hypotheses, lack of concomitant blood samples has prevented a large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trial testing of hypotheses necessitating biological samples. To overcome this&#xD;
      limitation, we established a 'USRDS-like' clinical trial with the largest US dialysis&#xD;
      provider to prospectively acquire research quality demographic data and concomitant&#xD;
      biological samples to test two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: HD patients are profoundly vitamin D deficient, yet ~60% of incident hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients in the US are not treated with active vitamin D. Vitamin D is linked with&#xD;
      cardiovascular health, and although higher serum vitamin D levels are associated with&#xD;
      improved survival in different settings (e.g., cancer, infection), no large study has&#xD;
      examined whether baseline vitamin D levels are associated with HD mortality. Measuring serum&#xD;
      vitamin D levels among HD patients is sporadic since the utility of this measurement as it&#xD;
      relates to dialysis mortality is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Higher vitamin D levels at initiation of HD are associated with lower risk of&#xD;
      90-day and 1-year mortality among patients who do not receive vitamin D therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Among diabetic non-HD patients, blood levels of HbA1c predict all cause and&#xD;
      cardiovascular related mortality. Diabetes is the leading cause of ESRD in the US (~50% of&#xD;
      all ESRD patients) and mortality rates of diabetics on HD are ~10-20% higher than&#xD;
      non-diabetics. Leading Nephrology thought leaders and regulatory bodies (tied to&#xD;
      reimbursement and quality control) suggest HbA1c levels must be routinely checked in diabetic&#xD;
      HD patients. Importantly, the association between HbA1c levels and all-cause and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality among HD patients is unclear (in contrast to non-HD data), and&#xD;
      erythropoietin therapy and shortened red-cell survival (common in HD patients) render&#xD;
      measurements of HbA1c less meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Elevated HbA1c levels (among diabetics) at the initiation of HD are associated&#xD;
      with increased 90 day mortality, however, HbA1c measurements performed thereafter, e.g., at&#xD;
      90 days following the initiation of HD, are not associated with subsequent 1 year survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims are examined in a prospective cohort study (of incident HD patients living&#xD;
      throughout the US (&gt;1000 centers) with detailed demographic data updated daily, and research&#xD;
      quality blood samples collected every 3 months from the initiation of chronic HD. We&#xD;
      initiated this &quot;USRDS-like&quot; study to overcome one of the largest limitations of existing&#xD;
      epidemiological dialysis datasets - lack of concomitant biological samples in a nationally&#xD;
      representative cohort. The study will be available for data sharing and patient protection&#xD;
      measures are in place.&#xD;
