  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arnica in a topical gel formulation will be compared to a placebo to determine whether it&#xD;
      decreases muscle soreness following leg exercise when applied to the legs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: The design is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Each participant&#xD;
      will receive 2 containers of gel. One container will be marked &quot;LEFT&quot; and one &quot;RIGHT.&quot; One&#xD;
      container will contain a commercially available arnica gel formulation, and the other will&#xD;
      contain a placebo gel, identical in appearance to the arnica. Subjects will not know which&#xD;
      container contains which product. Each participant will also be given a form containing an&#xD;
      analog pain scale for each leg. The participant will rate his or her pain in each leg&#xD;
      separately on the day before exercise. Each subject will then be asked to perform calf raises&#xD;
      using the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant removes shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active range of motion of the ankle is measured bilaterally using a goniometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  He or she places the metatarsal portion of his or her foot on a step that is 7 inches&#xD;
           above the floor. Handrails are provided for safety and comfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  He or she then performs heel lifts by rising up on the stair using the foot on the&#xD;
           stair, holds this for 2 seconds, then maximally dorsiflexes the foot for a count of 2&#xD;
           seconds. A metronome set to generate a tone every 2 seconds guides the pace of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is repeated 25 times, or until the subject is unable to complete a full cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  He or she then performs the same sequence using the other leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second set of 20 repetitions is performed in each leg, followed by a final 15&#xD;
           repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gel is applied immediately after exercise to both lower legs. Subjects are&#xD;
           instructed not to wash off the leg for at least one hour after application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pain score is completed for each leg 24 hours later, and the gel is applied to each&#xD;
           leg. Again, subjects are instructed to leave the gel undisturbed for at least one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 48 hours later the subject returns for measurement of ankle range of&#xD;
           motion, again completes a pain score and applies the gel for a final time. Subjects are&#xD;
           instructed to leave the gel on the legs for at least one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure muscle tenderness, a 1cm sphere is placed on the subject's mid-calf, and&#xD;
           compressed by a standardized 5 pound weight. The subject provides a tenderness score for&#xD;
           each leg using the same pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final pain score is completed by each subject at approximately 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither subjects nor the researchers doing the data collection or analysis will know which&#xD;
      gel is associated with which formulation (placebo vs. Arnica). Controls are within-subjects.&#xD;
