      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of fiducial implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the extent/rate of migration of radio-opaque fiducials placed in lung&#xD;
           tumors and adjacent normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare real-time portal imaging-based fiducial tracking with measurement of&#xD;
           three-dimensional motion by four-dimensional CT scanning to determine how many fiducials&#xD;
           are needed to track a tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if intra-fractional lung tumor motion changes during a course of treatment,&#xD;
           and when during the treatment this occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the position of internal fiducials with the position of the external&#xD;
           patient surface during respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the residual motion of the clinical target volume during radiotherapy gated&#xD;
           using external fiducials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the adequacy of the treatment portal margins in encompassing the residual&#xD;
           motion of the clinical target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if radio-opaque fiducial placement adjacent to the trachea (which does not&#xD;
           move) can reduce daily setup inaccuracies, and so spare normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the motion of hilar adenopathy (if any), and whether it correlates with&#xD;
           motion of the primary tumor.&#xD;

      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will have pulmonary (lung) function&#xD;
      testing. This testing will involve your breathing through a mouthpiece and measuring the&#xD;
      amount of air you breathe. This will provide information on how well your lungs work, and how&#xD;
      your chest wall moves when you breathe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then begin the normal treatment planning process. A bean-bag &quot;cast&quot; will be made for&#xD;
      you to lie in during planning and treatment. This is done to lower day-to-day changes in your&#xD;
      position. A CT scan will be taken with you breathing quietly, and possibly several X-rays&#xD;
      will be performed as well. You will be marked with magic marker, and possibly have several&#xD;
      permanent tattoos placed to help with daily positioning. These procedures normally take 1-2&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small metal markers (up to 5) will then be placed near your tumor. A thin, flexible tube with&#xD;
      a camera, called a bronchoscope, will be used to place these markers in your lungs. You will&#xD;
      be given a sedative through one of your veins and a local anesthetic will be sprayed in your&#xD;
      nose and mouth before introducing the bronchoscope. The bronchoscope is introduced through&#xD;
      one of your nostrils and then passed into your windpipe and bronchial tubes. This will allow&#xD;
      the doctor to examine your lungs and place the small metal markers. These markers will be&#xD;
      used to track the tumor during treatment. In this way the radiation treatment can be given to&#xD;
      the tumor even if it moves while you breathe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have studies to measure how much the tumor moves. This will be done with&#xD;
      several additional CT scans, typically taken on a weekly basis. Additional pulmonary function&#xD;
      measurements will be taken during the CT scans. These measurements will allow researchers to&#xD;
      monitor the movement of your tumor when you breathe. These procedures will normally take&#xD;
      between 1 and 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on this study for the duration of your radiation treatments. You will be followed&#xD;
      up an for an additional 4 - 6 weeks to make sure there are no complications from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY. A total of up to 30 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
