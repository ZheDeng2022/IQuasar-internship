      The purpose of this study is to examine the anti inflammatory effect of high complex&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet, supplemented by omega-3 fatty acids.&#xD;

      Background: Atherosclerosis is the main cause for premature morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      western world. It becomes evident that one of the main causes for development of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis is the presence of low grade, internal inflammation. The inflammatory process&#xD;
      leads to endothelial dysfunction, the early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The&#xD;
      inflammatory process is known to be induced by several factors such as obesity, recurring&#xD;
      infections, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle. It was found that weight reduction decreased&#xD;
      sub clinical inflammation. It was also found that the composition of the diet affects the&#xD;
      inflammatory process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis and aims: Our preliminary results show that high complex carbohydrate diet&#xD;
      (HCCD) has beneficial effect on several markers of inflammation. The aims of this study are&#xD;
      to reinforce our preliminary results by measuring the effect of HCCD on additional markers of&#xD;
      inflammation (TNFÎ±, IL6) and of endothelial dysfunction (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), and to identify the&#xD;
      genes affected by HCCD in monocytes. In addition the aim of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether consumption of omega-3 oil actually increase the anti-inflammatory effect obtained by&#xD;
      HCCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 150 healthy overweight volunteers will be divided into 2 groups; HCCD group and HCCD&#xD;
      supplemented with the omega-3 fatty acids. Blood sample will be taken following an overnight&#xD;
      12 hour fast, before and after 8 weeks diet, for the following analysis: total cell count,&#xD;
      plasma lipids, glucose and insulin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, white blood&#xD;
      cell count, and CRP. Markers of leukocyte activation will be determined using FACS analysis.&#xD;
      In addition, using ELISA, the following pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and markers for&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction will be analyzed: VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Micro array analysis for genes&#xD;
      transcription differences induced by HCCD will be performed in monocytes using Affymetrix&#xD;
      chips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: We assume that HCCD consumption may improve the inflammatory markers as&#xD;
      well as markers of endothelial dysfunction and affect expression of genes involved in&#xD;
      inflammation in monocytes. In addition we assume that omega-3 fatty acids will strengthen the&#xD;
      positive effect of HCCD on parameters of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance and probable implications to Medicine: The results of this study may establish&#xD;
      scientific basis for guiding people for healthy lifestyle, including the consumption of diet&#xD;
      composed of components with anti inflammatory effects, as well as nutritional supplements&#xD;
      enhancing anti-inflammatory properties of the diet. This work will also be able to establish&#xD;
      the influence of the diet and supplementations on gene expression for inflammatory reaction&#xD;
      in monocytes.&#xD;
