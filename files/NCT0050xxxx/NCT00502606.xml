      The effect of Antibacterial Nanoparticles, Incorporated in cement, on S.mutans in the margins&#xD;
      of provisional restorations is going to be examined clinically by using two kinds of&#xD;
      provisional cement 1. cement with out antibacterial nanoparticles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.cement with small addition of IABN. after one week in the mouth the crowns are to be&#xD;
      removed and examined for the presence and quantity of s. mutans. in vitro tests of the same&#xD;
      has shown significant reduction in bacterial population around the provisional cement as&#xD;
      compared to the regular cement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Provisional cement withholding antibacterial properties may be useful in preventing caries in&#xD;
      the margins of provisional restorations. Covalently attached antibacterial polymers are a&#xD;
      possible solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The provisional restoration is important in determine the success of the therapy. The&#xD;
      provisional restoration protects the pulp and the dentin, and is used for diagnostic&#xD;
      purposes. Sometimes provisional restoration can stay in the oral cavity for a long period.&#xD;
      Through this time, the abutments must get the best biological and mechanical defense. The&#xD;
      cement should have good mechanical properties, low solubility and good adhesion. The&#xD;
      finishing line is a place prone to caries development due to the existence of a potential gap&#xD;
      between the provisional restoration and the tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This in vivo study will evaluate the antibacterial effect of alkylated polyethylenimine&#xD;
      nanoparticles (IPN) incorporated to temporary cement, against S.mutans. We will compare 2&#xD;
      temporary cement, one with, and the other without the nano particles, using the direct&#xD;
      technique for making provisional restoration with polymethyl methacrylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baldissara et.al tested 4 kinds of temporary cements in 30 acryl resin crowns, prepared on&#xD;
      extracted teeth. They authors found that in all 4 kinds of cements there was always a micro&#xD;
      leakage, to some degree, in the margins of the restoration. These gap and micro leakage in&#xD;
      restorations, contribute to restoration's failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composites releasing Fluoride do not have antibacterial effect after light curing. This fact&#xD;
      can explain why plaque tends to accumulate on composites. Polymethl metacrylate resin, the&#xD;
      material used in direct provisional crown preparation, has a low antibacterial activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past there was an attempt to create resin composites with antibacterial activity,&#xD;
      through incorporation of an antibacterial agent= Chlorhexidine. This agent is released from&#xD;
      the composite, and by doing so, can cause toxicity and a decrease in the mechanical&#xD;
      properties and in effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several reports have described incorporation of a methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide&#xD;
      (MDPB) monomer in composite resins that showed no release of the incorporated monomer but&#xD;
      still exhibited antibacterial properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beith et.al tested the effect of the IPN on S.mutans. This in vitro study evaluated the&#xD;
      antibacterial effect of alkylated polyethylenimine nanoparticles incorporated into 3 kinds of&#xD;
      composite resins. The IPN were mixed in a low concentration of 1% w/w and cured by light&#xD;
      polymerization. The cured samples were tested for antibacterial and mechanical properties.&#xD;
      The addition of 1% w/w of nanoparticles did not affect significantly the flexural modulus and&#xD;
      the flexural strength of the materials. The results indicate the IPN immobilized in resin&#xD;
      based materials have a strong antibacterial activity on cariogenic bacteria upon contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between caries development and bacteria was based in the past. The disease&#xD;
      occurs due to specific bacteria, especially from the group of mutans streptococci,&#xD;
      ו-lactobacilli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumption is that the IPN have antibacterial activity against S.mutans. Today, there is&#xD;
      no dental material that can solve the problem of caries development in margins of provisional&#xD;
      restorations. Many people stay with the provisional restoration for a long period in the oral&#xD;
      cavity, in which the risk for caries development rises. Therefore there was a need to test&#xD;
      the in vivo activity of the nanoparticles in provisional cement, on S.mutans in the margins&#xD;
      of provisional restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage of the experiment, an in vitro test using the direct contact test (DCT)&#xD;
      will be performed. The nanoparticles will be incorporated to the cement in 3 concentrations:&#xD;
      0.5%, 1%, 2% , and the affect on S.mutans will be testes after 24 h, and after 14 days. The&#xD;
      concentration will be compare to 0%. The purpose of the test is to make sure that the&#xD;
      temporary cement with the nanoparticles supplement has an antibacterial affect against&#xD;
      S.mutans, and that the cement without the supplement has no such activity. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      dosages for use in vivo, will be decided based on this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next stage, an in vivo test will be performed. The temporary cement without the&#xD;
      supplement will be placed under the provisional restoration. After a week an impression of&#xD;
      the finishing line, And the mesial and distal walls will be taken upon a gum with sugar. The&#xD;
      cement will be replaced with the same kind of cement, but with the IPN supplement, and will&#xD;
      be impressed in the same manner a week later. After each appointment (2 for each patient),&#xD;
      the gum impression will be placed on a selective S.mutans media (Mitis salivarius&#xD;
      bacitracin,MSB( for 48h, at °37 C. Using the image-pro program, the concentration of the&#xD;
      bacteria per area will be determined. In this way we will estimate the antibacterial activity&#xD;
      of the supplement in the cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for exclusion; Appearance of allergy to the cement. Using antibiotic drug during the&#xD;
      experiment. Mouth rinse with antibacterial properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no. of participants in the experiment and the methods of analyzing the data, will be&#xD;
      determined by a statistician after a pilot will be performed on 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients who need provisional restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients who got antibacterial therapy in the past 3 months. Patients&#xD;
      using chlorhexidine gluconate. Pregnant women.&#xD;
