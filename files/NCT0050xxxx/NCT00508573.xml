  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to create a registry of information about women who have or are at&#xD;
      risk for Lynch syndrome, in order to study gynecologic cancer risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 1000 patients will take part in this study. All&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Lynch Syndrome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC), also called Lynch&#xD;
      syndrome, the lifetime risk for endometrial cancer increases to 40-60%, and the risk for&#xD;
      ovarian cancer increases to 12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, basic medical and family information will be&#xD;
      collected. You will be asked to fill out a baseline (starting) questionnaire, which will ask&#xD;
      personal information such as age, ethnic background, medical and family history, and health&#xD;
      habits. All information will be kept confidential. Some information may be gathered from your&#xD;
      medical record. It should take about 30 minutes to complete this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year for 20 years, you will be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire. The&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaire provides researchers with an opportunity to study possible health&#xD;
      issues and/or changes that may have occurred since your last visit. This questionnaire should&#xD;
      only take about 15 -20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have a history of endometrial or ovarian cancer, or develop endometrial or ovarian&#xD;
      cancer while on study, researchers will collect copies of the diagnostic and surgery reports&#xD;
      from your medical record and will ask you to fill out an additional questionnaire about&#xD;
      symptoms of endometrial cancer. This should only take about 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will also collect several leftover tissue samples from your surgery if you have&#xD;
      had surgery. These samples will be stored and used to perform molecular studies to&#xD;
      characterize Lynch syndrome tumors. The samples will be kept securely in a lab at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your leftover tissue samples can be used for research, the people doing the research&#xD;
      must get specific approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB&#xD;
      is a committee made up of doctors, researchers, and members of the community. The IRB is&#xD;
      responsible for protecting the participants involved in research studies and making sure all&#xD;
      research is done in a safe and ethical manner. All research done at MD Anderson, including&#xD;
      research involving your leftover tissue samples must first be approved by the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, you may be invited to participate in a follow-up study. During your&#xD;
      participation in this registry study, researchers will inform you about related studies for&#xD;
      which you might be eligible. You will have the option to take part or not to take part in&#xD;
      them. Your active participation in this study will continue for up to 20 years total.&#xD;
