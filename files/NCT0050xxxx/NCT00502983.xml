  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the epidemiologic risk factors associated with the development of acute&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia (AML), and less is known about the role that genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      plays in the development of AML. We propose to conduct a population-based study to&#xD;
      investigate genetic susceptibility in adult AML patients, both de novo and treatment-related&#xD;
      in a well-defined geographical area. Using a case-control design, we will prospectively&#xD;
      enroll 400 patients from Texas and 800 healthy controls. Controls will be recruited using&#xD;
      random digit dialing, and will be matched to the cases by age, gender, and ethnicity.&#xD;
      Epidemiological and demographic information will be obtained through personal interviews, and&#xD;
      will be integrated with clinical information, cytogenetic data, and genotypic markers. Blood&#xD;
      specimens will be collected on all participants, who will be genotyped for markers associated&#xD;
      with activation and detoxification of chemical carcinogens, including chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
      Polymorphisms in genes such as cytochrome p450 (CYP2E1), glutathione S-transferases (GSTT1,&#xD;
      GSTM1, GSTP1), epoxide hydrolase (HYL1), NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase (MPO) will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide insight into the role that these susceptibility markers, along with&#xD;
      clinical epidemiological, and cytogenetic factors, play in the identification of people at&#xD;
      risk of developing AML. Understanding how genetic predisposition and exogenous exposures&#xD;
      interact to determine AML susceptibility will allow the development of prevention strategies&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;

      INFORMED CONSENTS FOR AML PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, participant will be asked to complete a personal interview. During the&#xD;
      interview, participant will be asked questions about participant's demographics (age, sex,&#xD;
      etc.), any chemicals participant may have been exposed to, participant's medical history,&#xD;
      family history of cancer, participant's diet, and participant's smoking and alcohol use&#xD;
      histories. It should take around 50 minutes to complete the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will also have around 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for special tests. These tests&#xD;
      will look for any biologic factors associated with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview and the blood draw may be done during a regularly scheduled visit to M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson, or may be scheduled at the time and place of participant's convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may be contacted at home by phone so that researchers can collect information&#xD;
      about any changes in participant's health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 1,200 participants will take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT FOR CONTROL SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, participant will be asked to complete a personal interview. During the&#xD;
      interview, participant will be asked questions about participant's demographics (age, sex,&#xD;
      etc.), any chemicals participant may have been exposed to, participant's medical history,&#xD;
      family history of cancer, participant's diet, and participant's smoking and alcohol use&#xD;
      histories. It should take around 50 minutes to complete the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will also have around 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for special tests. These tests&#xD;
      will look for any biologic factors associated with AML. The interview and blood draw will be&#xD;
      scheduled at the time and place of participant's convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 1,200 participants will take part in this study.&#xD;
