    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of a combination of dasatinib, cetuximab, and FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], leucovorin&#xD;
      [LV], and Eloxatin [oxaliplatin]) that can be given to patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. The safety of these drugs in combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the Phase II part of this clinical research study is to learn if dasatinib given&#xD;
      in combination with FOLFOX with or without cetuximab can help to control metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cetuximab is a drug designed to block the activity of EGFR, a protein on the surface of some&#xD;
      tumor cells that may cause the cells to grow. Blocking EGFR may stop or slow the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells. Dasatinib is a drug that inhibits a protein called c-Src. High levels of c-Src&#xD;
      may make it harder for chemotherapy to work against the cancer. If dasatinib can inhibit&#xD;
      c-Src, the chemotherapy may be more effective against the cancer. FOLFOX is a drug&#xD;
      combination frequently used to treat colon or rectal cancer that has spread to other parts of&#xD;
      the body. FOLFOX is designed to kill rapidly dividing cells by preventing DNA (the genetic&#xD;
      material of cells) from duplicating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have found that cetuximab, when given alone or in combination with other&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs, was not effective when given to patients with colorectal cancer that had&#xD;
      a KRAS gene mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take part in the Phase I part of this study, your tumor tissue from a previous biopsy&#xD;
      or surgery will be used to test for KRAS mutation. If you have the KRAS gene mutation, you&#xD;
      will not take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take part in the Phase II part of this study, your tumor tissue from a previous biopsy&#xD;
      or surgery will be used to test for KRAS mutation. If you have the KRAS gene mutation, you&#xD;
      may take part in the study but you will not receive cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group (Phase I or Phase II) based on when you join this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of dasatinib you will receive will&#xD;
      depend on when you joined the study. Three (3) to 6 participants will be entered at each dose&#xD;
      level. Each new group of participants will receive a higher dose, until the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose is found. Once the highest tolerable dose is found, 12 participants will be enrolled at&#xD;
      that dose level. Your doctor will tell you what dose level you will be receiving and how this&#xD;
      dose compares to the doses other participants have received. The starting dose of cetuximab&#xD;
      and FOLFOX will be the same for all participants. The dose of dasatinib will be increased&#xD;
      with the next group of 3-6 participants. Every 14 days is considered 1 study &quot;cycle&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive the dose of dasatinib found to&#xD;
      be best tolerated in the Phase I portion. You will also receive FOLFOX. If you do not have&#xD;
      the KRAS gene mutation, you will also receive cetuximab. Every 14 days is considered 1 study&#xD;
      &quot;cycle&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before receiving the study drugs, you will have a CVC placed. A CVC is a sterile flexible&#xD;
      tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor&#xD;
      will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a&#xD;
      separate consent form for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take dasatinib by mouth once a day, every day during this study. Your study doctor&#xD;
      and research nurse will tell you how many pills you will take. Dasatinib should be taken at&#xD;
      the same time each day, with or without meals. If you miss a dose of dasatinib, you should&#xD;
      not double the next dose. It is important to take dasatinib with water, and not fruit juices.&#xD;
      You should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit while you are on this study.&#xD;
      Dasatinib should not be touched by children, pregnant women, or women who are breastfeeding.&#xD;
      If a caregiver must handle the drug, a protective glove should be worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are taking dasatinib, you will be given a drug diary. In this diary, you will write&#xD;
      down the date, the time, and the number of dasatinib tablets taken. Certain drugs and herbal&#xD;
      supplements may not be taken while you are receiving dasatinib. These drugs could affect how&#xD;
      your body breaks down dasatinib, which could have a bad effect on you. Your doctor will give&#xD;
      you a list of drugs and herbal supplements that you must not take while on this study. You&#xD;
      must tell your doctor before taking any new drugs while on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle, you will receive oxaliplatin and LV through the CVC over about 2&#xD;
      hours. On Day 1, you will receive 5-FU through a portable pump for the next 46 hours. If you&#xD;
      are receiving cetuximab in the Phase I portion of the study, you will receive it on Days 1&#xD;
      and 8 through the CVC over about 2 hours. If you are receiving cetuximab in the Phase II&#xD;
      portion of the study, you will receive it on Day 1 through the CVC over about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits for Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled at the highest tolerable dose level, you will have 2 core liver biopsies.&#xD;
      The liver tissue will be studied to learn the effect of the study drugs on stopping the&#xD;
      protein c-Src. You will have 2 liver biopsies collected. The first liver biopsy will be&#xD;
      collected before you start the study drugs, and the second will be performed in either Cycle&#xD;
      2 or 3. Before the liver biopsy, you will receive fluids and drugs for relaxation and/or pain&#xD;
      through an needle in your arm or hand. You will be awake during the biopsy. A radiologist&#xD;
      will find the tumor in the liver with the help of radiographic imaging procedures such as an&#xD;
      ultrasound or CT scan. Your skin around this area will be cleansed, and a local anesthetic&#xD;
      will be given. A long, hollow needle will be inserted through the skin into the liver tumor,&#xD;
      and a tissue sample(s) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have extra blood samples drawn (1 tablespoon each time) before receiving the study&#xD;
      drugs and on Day 8 of Cycles 2 and 4. This blood will be drawn at the same time as your&#xD;
      routine blood tests are drawn. These blood samples will be used to develop tests that may&#xD;
      help doctors be able to predict who will best benefit from dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the group that receives the highest tolerable dose level, the Day 8&#xD;
      blood draw during cycle 2 will not be performed. Instead, blood will be collected at the time&#xD;
      of the liver biopsy that is to be performed between Days 8-14 of cycle 2 or 3 about 2 to 6&#xD;
      hours after taking the daily dose of dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits for Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have extra blood samples drawn (1 tablespoon each time) before receiving the study&#xD;
      drugs and at the end of every 4 cycles. This blood will be drawn at the same time as your&#xD;
      routine blood tests are drawn. These blood samples will be used to develop tests that may&#xD;
      help doctors be able to predict who will best benefit from dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of each new cycle and when you stop study treatment, you will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire about any symptoms you may be experiencing. The questionnaire will&#xD;
      take up to 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you stop receiving study drugs, the study team will contact you by telephone every 3&#xD;
      months to check how you are doing. Each phone call will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I and Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each new cycle, you will be asked questions about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
      At each visit, it is important to tell the study staff about any drugs you are currently&#xD;
      taking. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
      You will have a performance status evaluation. Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn&#xD;
      for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood or urine pregnancy test every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience severe side effects, the study drugs may be delayed, stopped, or you may&#xD;
      receive smaller doses of the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on this study for as long as you are benefiting. You will be taken off this&#xD;
      study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, blood (about 3&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will be asked questions about any side&#xD;
      effects you may have had and about any drugs you are currently taking. You will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will have a&#xD;
      performance status evaluation. If not performed recently, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan&#xD;
      of your chest, abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease. If you are having side&#xD;
      effects after you stop receiving the study drugs, you will be contacted by phone to check how&#xD;
      you are feeling, or you will have follow-up visits until the side effects have gone away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved for the treatment of leukemia.&#xD;
      Its use in this study, for this disease, is considered to be investigational. Cetuximab,&#xD;
      5-FU, LV, and oxaliplatin are all FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment&#xD;
      of colorectal cancer. Up to 83 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
