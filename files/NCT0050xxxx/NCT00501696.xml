  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, crossover-design of the&#xD;
      effects of low dose naltrexone on the multiple sclerosis quality of life inventory (MSQLI54)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the impact of LDN compared to placebo on quality of life as measured&#xD;
      by the composite score of the MSQOL54 in adult subjects with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also we plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the 10 scales of the MSQOL54 during the active treatment and placebo cycles&#xD;
           between active treatment and placebo groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare each individual's composite response to LDN versus placebo during the active&#xD;
           treatment and placebo cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare each individual on the 10 scales of the MSQOL54 during the active treatment&#xD;
           and placebo cycles&#xD;

      Immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies are known to modify the course of the&#xD;
      disease. Interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b and glatiramer acetate are immunomodulators&#xD;
      whereas mitoxantrone and natalizumab are immunosuppressants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease modifying therapies decrease the frequency of relapses and are associated with&#xD;
      improved neurological outcomes relative to placebo. However, these medications are only&#xD;
      partially effective, are expensive, require either frequent self injections or intravenous&#xD;
      infusion and have significant side effects. None are proven in the progressive forms of MS&#xD;
      and none of alleviate the symptoms associated with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endogenous Opioid peptides and Naltrexone:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low dose naltrexone (LDN) is proposed to adjust the level of endorphins in the body thereby&#xD;
      enhancing immune function and is anecdotally beneficial in MS. LDN is inexpensive, easily&#xD;
      administered (one capsule a day at bedtime), and virtually has no serious side effect (during&#xD;
      the first weeks of LDN use, some patients complain of some difficulty sleeping, that rarely&#xD;
      persists after the first week). Although use of LDN is popular within the MS community&#xD;
      efficacy is not proven because clinical trials have not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naltrexone, is an opioid antagonist approved by the FDA in 1984 in a 50mg dose for the&#xD;
      treatment of opioid and alcohol abuse. By blocking opioid receptors, naltrexone also blocks&#xD;
      reception of the endogenous opioid peptides: beta-endorphin, metenkephalin and dynorphin.&#xD;
      Virtually every cell of the immune system has receptor for these mediators. These peptides&#xD;
      regulate a wide range of biological activities, including immune responses through&#xD;
      interaction with G-protein coupled transmembrane opioid receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1985, Bernard Bihari, MD, described the effects of low dose Naltrexone (1.5-4.5 mg&#xD;
      Naltrexone) on the body's immune system. He discovered that people with HIV had less than&#xD;
      twenty percent of the normal level of endorphins. He began looking for ways to raise&#xD;
      endorphin without blocking its receptors and found that 1.75-4.5 mg Naltrexone (Low Dose&#xD;
      Naltrexone, LDN) at bed time raises the endorphin level up to 100 to 300 percent during the&#xD;
      night. Dr. Bihari has reported beneficial effects of LDN on a variety of diseases such as&#xD;
      cancers (e.g. Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, GI cancers, non&#xD;
      small cell cancer of lung, malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, prostate&#xD;
      cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and uterine cancer), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, Behçet's disease, celiac disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      emphysema, fibromyalgia, HIV/AIDS, Irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's disease, pemphigoid,&#xD;
      psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic Lupus erythematosus, ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and Wegner's granulomatosis . Despite these anecdotal claims there are no published&#xD;
      studies demonstrating efficacy of LDN in any disease state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its low cost and ease of administration and anecdotal reports of efficacy LDN has&#xD;
      gained a significant gross-roots following among patients and doctors. There are some&#xD;
      striking reports about beneficial effects of LDN on relapse reduction and disability and in&#xD;
      general patients treated with LDN report improvements in a sense of well being, fatigue, as&#xD;
      well as bowel, bladder and sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological Mechanisms Involved in MS and effects of LDN β-endorphin is an opioid peptide,&#xD;
      synthesized by cells of the central nervous system (arcuate nucleus) and immune system&#xD;
      (lymphocytes, thymocytes, monocytes and splenocytes). This peptide is decreased in&#xD;
      concentration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of MS patients, with the lowest&#xD;
      concentrations linked to the progressive forms of the disease. Furthermore increased&#xD;
      concentrations of β-endorphin are found during interferon beta treatment and following&#xD;
      clinical relapses. In the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalitis,&#xD;
      β-endorphin blockade worsens disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions in MS may be the result of oligodendroglial apoptosis and microglial activation&#xD;
      rather than neuroinflammatory processes. Activated microglia secrete proinflammatory and&#xD;
      neurotoxic factors (nitric oxide and peroxynitrites) that could cause neurodegeneration. In&#xD;
      theory, inhibition of microglia would be protective in MS. Naltrexone, is capable of reducing&#xD;
      microglial cytokine (IL-1β) and nitric oxide in glial cultures. If naltrexone is beneficial&#xD;
      in MS, a possible mechanism of action is through reduction in microglial nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthase activity resulting in decreased peroxynitrites production. Peroxynitrites are&#xD;
      thought to inhibit glutamate transporters thereby increasing the synaptic concentrations of&#xD;
      glutamate resulting in excitatory neurotoxicity.&#xD;
