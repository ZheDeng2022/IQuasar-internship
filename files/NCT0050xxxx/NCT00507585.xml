      PRIMARY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicity and tolerability of intra-arterial hepatic oxaliplatin every&#xD;
           three weeks administered in combination with systemic intravenous Fluorouracil,&#xD;
           Leucovorin and bevacizumab to patients with advanced solid tumors metastatic to the&#xD;
           liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document in a descriptive fashion the antitumor efficacy of this combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an alternate radiographic assessment tool&#xD;
           and compare with available tumor markers and RECIST guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate in a descriptive fashion the development of extrahepatic tumor recurrences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells (which slows their&#xD;
      growth and spreading), eventually destroying them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil is designed to interfere with the growth of cells that reproduce rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leucovorin is designed to strengthen the effect of 5-fluorouracil by reducing tumor cell&#xD;
      resistance to the 5-fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to interfere with blood flow to your tumors, which may cause tumors&#xD;
      to be &quot;starved&quot; of the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests will help&#xD;
      the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will have your complete&#xD;
      medical history recorded and a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs&#xD;
      (blood pressure, temperature, breathing rate, and heart rate). You will have a neurological&#xD;
      evaluation (a test to evaluate your strength and nerve functioning). You will have blood&#xD;
      drawn (about 1 teaspoon or less) and urine collected for routine tests. Women who are able to&#xD;
      have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be hospitalized to&#xD;
      receive the study drug combination. On the day of your admission to the hospital, you will&#xD;
      have a catheter in your hepatic artery placed in your right groin. After your catheter has&#xD;
      been placed, you will receive the study drugs. The catheter will be placed and removed during&#xD;
      each cycle. A catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while&#xD;
      you are under local anesthesia. Your physician will explain this procedure to you in more&#xD;
      detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You must lay in bed for the entire time that the catheter is in place. In some cases, the&#xD;
      catheter will be removed immediately after your chemotherapy is complete. In some cases, the&#xD;
      catheter may remain in overnight. Therefore, you must remain in bed until the catheter is&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each cycle (on Days 1 and 2), you will receive 5-fluorouracil by vein continuously&#xD;
      over 24 hours, leucovorin by vein over 1 hour, oxaliplatin by your hepatic artery over 2&#xD;
      hours, and bevacizumab by vein (only on Day 1) over about 1 1/2 hours. This study drug&#xD;
      combination will be repeated about every 3 weeks, which is considered 1 cycle (about every 21&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the highest tolerable dose of oxaliplatin when given in combination with the other&#xD;
      study drugs, there will be a dose escalation process that will go as follows. The dose of&#xD;
      oxaliplatin that you receive will depend on when you are enrolled in this study. The dose of&#xD;
      the other 3 study drugs that you receive will be the same for each participant on this study.&#xD;
      At first, 6 participants will be enrolled at the first dose level of oxaliplatin. If their&#xD;
      disease does not get worse and no intolerable side effects occur, there will be another 6&#xD;
      patients enrolled at the next higher dose level. This dose escalation process will continue&#xD;
      in this way until 8 dose levels have been reached without intolerable side effects occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons each) for blood counts and liver function tests&#xD;
      before each dose of the study drug combination. This is so your doctor can check the safety&#xD;
      of the drug combination. You will also have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons each) before each&#xD;
      cycle. The doctor will evaluate your disease and health before you receive the study drugs.&#xD;
      Your tumors will be evaluated by the imaging scans (such as computed tomography [CT] and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) needed for your type of cancer. Imaging scans will be&#xD;
      performed every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive the study drug combination indefinitely as mentioned above unless&#xD;
      your disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects. If your disease gets&#xD;
      worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be removed from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your participation ends for any reason on this study (such as those mentioned above), you&#xD;
      will have imaging scans (CT and MRI) to see if your tumors are growing or shrinking. You will&#xD;
      have blood drawn (about 3 teaspoons) for routine tests. These end-of-study tests can be&#xD;
      performed at your regular doctor's office, and the results will be sent to the study's&#xD;
      research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Oxaliplatin is authorized by the FDA for systemic use only.&#xD;
      (Systemic therapies affect the body as a whole.) Giving oxaliplatin directly into the liver&#xD;
      is investigational. 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and bevacizumab are FDA-approved for&#xD;
      treatment of colorectal cancer. The use of these drugs in combination is authorized by the&#xD;
      FDA for use in research only. Bevacizumab is not FDA-approved for all cancer types included&#xD;
      in this study. Up to 163 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
