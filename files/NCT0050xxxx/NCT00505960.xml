      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally-tailored,&#xD;
      comprehensive behavioral intervention program specially designed for linguistically&#xD;
      challenged ethnic minority immigrant populations (Korean Americans) with type 2 DM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Korean American immigrants (KAI), one of the most underserved and understudied minority&#xD;
      populations in the U.S., suffer from diabetes, which goes under-diagnosed, inadequately&#xD;
      treated and has a potential to result in costly and tragic consequences. Language barriers,&#xD;
      the lack of self-confidence, and diminished social support that accompany the acculturation&#xD;
      process prevent KAI from improving their health-seeking behaviors. Our previous research has&#xD;
      indicated that overwhelming numbers of KAI suffer not only from uncontrolled hyperglycemia&#xD;
      but also from a loss of self-confidence and social isolation because of language and cultural&#xD;
      barriers. They are in urgent need of an intervention to assist them in their efforts to&#xD;
      achieve better glycemic control and restore their self-confidence in diabetes and health&#xD;
      management so that they are able to adjust successfully in this new environment. Therefore,&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally-tailored,&#xD;
      comprehensive behavioral intervention program specially designed for linguistically&#xD;
      challenged KAIs with type 2 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot project will test the hypothesis: Compared to KAI in the control group, KAI with&#xD;
      type 2 DM who receive a comprehensive DM management intervention through structured&#xD;
      psycho-behavioral education, home glucose monitoring with a telephone transmission system,&#xD;
      and interaction with a bilingual nurse case manager will show: (1) a greater level of glucose&#xD;
      control; and (2) a greater level of self-help skills including knowledge related to glucose&#xD;
      control, problem-solving skills, heightened confidence and mood/affect, adherence to&#xD;
      treatment recommendations, and quality of life. An additional outcome will be to measure and&#xD;
      obtain an ideal BP as the proposed intervention focuses on management of multiple risk&#xD;
      factors with which many KA DM patients often struggle.&#xD;
