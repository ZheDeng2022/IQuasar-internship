  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of BIO 300 capsules when&#xD;
      administered orally to healthy male and female volunteers. BIO 300 is expected to be safe for&#xD;
      use starting at 500 mg.&#xD;

      This clinical trial will assess the safety and PK of BIO 300 capsules at doses expected to&#xD;
      deliver a radioprotective or therapeutic effect in humans. Humanetics is planning to conduct&#xD;
      this Phase I, single dose, dose-escalation (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 milligrams) study of&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BIO 300 by recruiting approximately 24&#xD;
      healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 64 to be enrolled in cohorts of 6 subjects&#xD;
      per group. The first cohort will receive one 500 mg BIO 300 capsule and pharmacokinetic blood&#xD;
      sampling will be conducted over the first 4 days in an outpatient setting at a clinic skilled&#xD;
      in this type of Phase I trial. Blood samples will be analyzed for BIO 300 levels, hematology,&#xD;
      chemistry, lipid profiles, phosphorus, clotting factors and fibrinogen as well as pancreatic&#xD;
      lipase and amylase. Urinalysis will assess kidney function as well as creatinine clearance&#xD;
      and BIO 300 clearance. All subjects will be monitored for adverse events and the safety of&#xD;
      BIO 300 capsules will be evaluated in this setting. After review of all safety information&#xD;
      and provided no clinically significant negative findings are revealed, the second cohort will&#xD;
      be treated with 1000mg BIO 300 (two 500mg capsules) using the same PK sampling program. Again&#xD;
      safety concerns will be reviewed and provided no clinically significant negative findings are&#xD;
      revealed, the third and fourth cohort will be treated with 1500 and 2000 mg, respectively, of&#xD;
      BIO 300 using the same PK sampling program.&#xD;
