  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the objective of this study is to determine if the use of The Harmonic™ (an ultrasonic&#xD;
      surgical instrument) in abdominolipectomy (tummy tuck)reduces volume and duration of wound&#xD;
      drainage after surgery when compared to electrocautery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominolipectomy is performed to correct abdominal skin and fat redundancy and muscle&#xD;
      diastases. Persistent serous wound drainage and seromas are the most common complications in&#xD;
      abdominolipectomy. The rate of serous fluid collection determines the time drains need to&#xD;
      remain in place. Although suction drains reduce seroma formation, prolonged use can delay&#xD;
      healing, cause injury, and increase the risk of retrograde infection and patient discomfort.&#xD;
      Wound drainage has a direct correlation with seroma formation. The loss of protein nutrients&#xD;
      and minerals in the serum drained is also a concern with prolonged drainage that can result&#xD;
      in healing delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Harmonic™ technology uses ultrasonic energy that allows both cutting and coagulating at&#xD;
      the precise point of application. The Harmonic™ has been used since 1992 predominantly in&#xD;
      urology and gastro-intestinal surgery (laparoscopic surgery). Significantly reduced serous&#xD;
      drainage in a number of general surgery procedures such as superficial and total&#xD;
      parotidectomy; thyroidectomy; tonsillectomy; pectoralis major myocutaneous flap dissection;&#xD;
      axillary dissection; and lymphadenectomy have been reported with the use Harmonic™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Harmonic™ has also been used in parotidectomy and maxillofacial surgery, but its use has&#xD;
      been seldom mentioned in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. Recent use of the&#xD;
      Harmonic™ has shown promise in plastic and reconstructive surgery in dissection of the&#xD;
      pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and total body lifts.&#xD;
