      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of a study that would describe changes of certain&#xD;
           circulating inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1, 6, 8, 10, 12, and tumor necrosis&#xD;
           factor-alpha [TNF] and symptoms related to chemoradiation therapy (pre-therapy, during&#xD;
           therapy and up to 3 months post-therapy) among patients with lung, esophageal, gastric,&#xD;
           colorectal and anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of studying neurocognitive function in patients with&#xD;
           non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at presentation and during chemoradiation therapy to&#xD;
           determine the prevalence, severity, and pattern of cognitive symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the ways to learn about the symptoms of chemoradiation therapy is by looking at how&#xD;
      certain proteins called cytokines (found in the blood) change during therapy. Another way is&#xD;
      to look at how thinking and memory may be changed because of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before therapy starts, you will be asked to complete several questionnaires during a visit to&#xD;
      the Radiation Oncology clinic at M. D. Anderson. These questionnaires measure physical and&#xD;
      emotional symptoms. These questionnaires should take about 30 minutes to finish. Lung cancer&#xD;
      patients will also complete some cognitive (mental) questionnaires. During this visit, the&#xD;
      research nurse will teach you how to use the telephone system for measuring symptoms. You&#xD;
      will tell the system the most convenient times for the telephone calls. The date of the call&#xD;
      will be at the same or close to the date of your weekly clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you begin your chemoradiation treatments, you will have a sample of blood drawn&#xD;
      (around 2½ tablespoons). The sample of blood will be used to measure levels of cytokines in&#xD;
      your blood pre treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have about 2½ tablespoons of blood drawn again when you start chemoradiation, and&#xD;
      then once a week while you are receiving treatment. These cytokines may be related to&#xD;
      symptoms experienced while having treatment for cancer. These blood tests are being done to&#xD;
      study the levels of cytokines in your blood during, and after treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms will be monitored weekly using an interactive voice response telephone system.&#xD;
      During chemoradiation, the automated telephone system will call you once a week to ask you to&#xD;
      rate your symptoms and how much the symptoms interfere in your daily life. The information&#xD;
      collected by these calls is only being used for this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the chemoradiation, lung cancer patients will again be given questionnaires to&#xD;
      measure cognitive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For lung cancer patients who are post-chemotherapy, your symptoms will be monitored weekly&#xD;
      for 3 months after therapy using the interactive voice response telephone system. For&#xD;
      esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and anal patients who are post-therapy, your symptoms will&#xD;
      be monitored weekly for 6 weeks after therapy using the interactive voice response telephone&#xD;
      system. About 30 days after chemoradiation, you will have 2½ tablespoons of blood drawn at&#xD;
      your regularly scheduled clinic visit. If you are not scheduled for a 3 month clinic visit,&#xD;
      we will contact your local physician for blood lab results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. About 225 evaluable patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
