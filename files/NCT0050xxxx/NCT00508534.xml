&#xD;
          -  The subject has a body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 31 kg/m2 where BMI= (weight in&#xD;
             kg)/(height in meters)2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be genotyped as poor metabolizers or heterozygous extensive metabolizers&#xD;
             for CYP2C19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genotyped homozygous extensive metabolizers for CYP2C19 (Section 6.1.1 CYP2C19&#xD;
             Polymorphism Genotyping).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening history and physical&#xD;
             or laboratory examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or 24 hour Holter,&#xD;
             including QTc &gt; or = 450 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine drug screen at screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Positive for HIV at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic hepatitis B and C, as evidenced by positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or&#xD;
             Hepatitis C antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of smoking or use of nicotine containing products within one year of the study&#xD;

          -  History of drug abuse within 6 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new&#xD;
             chemical entity with 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological&#xD;
             effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of the current study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;

             if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of study medication, unless, in the opinion of the Investigator and&#xD;
             Sponsor, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of red wine, grapefruit, grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing&#xD;
