      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the performance of the new T-SPOT.TB test and the conventional TST for&#xD;
      screening of Latent Tuberculosis infections in patients with cancer and those undergoing&#xD;
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the factors associated with positive response to T-SPOT.TB and the TST&#xD;
           (tuberculin skin test) in patients with anergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the impact of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapy on the screening&#xD;
           performance of T-SPOT.TB and the TST in cancer patients.&#xD;

      TB AND TB TESTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cancer are considered &quot;immunocompromised.&quot; This means that, because of the&#xD;
      cancer and the cancer treatment, the immune system does not function normally, which&#xD;
      decreases its ability to fight off infection and disease. This immunocompromised condition&#xD;
      places these patients (who probably had been in contact with the TB bacteria, resulting in&#xD;
      latent, or inactive, TB) at risk for active TB. Latent TB does not cause symptoms or signs of&#xD;
      active TB infection. It is very important to identify patients who are at risk for developing&#xD;
      active TB, so that they can receive timely treatment for TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tuberculin skin test (TST) is currently used to detect latent TB. The TST is considered&#xD;
      to have low detection sensitivity, which means that it may not always detect latent TB, which&#xD;
      may then turn into an active TB infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T-SPOT.TB is a new test that researchers want to study to see whether it may be more&#xD;
      effective and accurate than the TST at identifying patients at risk for developing active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PARTICIPATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following tests done and steps&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have extra blood (about 1 to 2 teaspoons) drawn. It will be done at the same&#xD;
           time as your routine clinic visit to M. D. Anderson or as a regular blood draw if you&#xD;
           are already admitted in the hospital. This blood will be used to perform the T-SPOT. TB&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have had a TST (or tuberculin skin test) performed at M. D. Anderson in the past 45&#xD;
      days, it may probably not be necessary to repeat the TST. However, the research staff will&#xD;
      decide if you need to have a new TST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may have the TST performed before or after your blood is drawn. In any case, you will&#xD;
      rest for 10 minutes after the blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a fluid called tuberculin in order to have the TST performed.&#xD;
           Tuberculin will be injected just beneath the surface of the skin on your forearm. You&#xD;
           should then see a very small raised area of skin where the injection was given. This&#xD;
           reaction will wear off in a few days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 2-3 days (48-72 hours later), you will return to M. D. Anderson (if you are not in&#xD;
           the hospital), and a health care professional will look at and measure any swelling or&#xD;
           redness at the site of TST. The doctor will then learn if your TST result is positive or&#xD;
           negative. If your TST is positive the study doctor will discuss it with , your primary&#xD;
           doctor for further evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although you will be informed about the TST result, you will not be informed about the&#xD;
      T-SPOT. TB test result because the T-SPOT. TB test is just used for investigational purposes&#xD;
      in this study and will not be used for diagnostic purposes. The study doctor will use the&#xD;
      results of the T-SPOT. TB test to make research comparisons with the TST test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LENGTH OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation will be over in this study once both TB tests have been performed and the&#xD;
      TST has been checked by a health care professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The TST is FDA approved and commercially available. The&#xD;
      T-SPOT.TB test is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is authorized for use in&#xD;
      research only. Up to 200 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
