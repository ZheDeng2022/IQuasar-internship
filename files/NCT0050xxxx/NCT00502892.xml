      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Topotecan when added to a fixed dose&#xD;
           regimen of Ifosfamide and Carboplatin in children and young adults with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicity associated with the administration of Topotecan with Ifosfamide&#xD;
           and Carboplatin (TIC) in children and young adults with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the duration of neutropenia (ANC&lt;500/micro L) and thrombocytopenia (PLT&#xD;
           50,000/ micro L and 20,000/ micro L) and the number of days of platelet transfusion&#xD;
           during each course of TIC chemotherapy when used in conjunction with G-CSF and NEUMEGA&#xD;
           in children and young adults with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the median number of apheresis collections as well as the CD34/kg, CD41/kg,&#xD;
           CD61/kg and CD34:41/kg and CD34:61/kg per collection in patients electively undergoing&#xD;
           concurrent apheresis for peripheral blood stem cell collection in courses 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the median number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and ex-vivo&#xD;
           expanded myeloid dendritic cells (DC) in patients electively undergoing concurrent&#xD;
           apheresis for PBMC collection in courses 2 or 3.&#xD;

      All of the chemotherapy drugs used in this study are FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      drugs designed to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests&quot;. These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the&#xD;
      study. You will have a physical exam and routine blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine tests.&#xD;
      You will have electrocardiogram (ECG - test to measure the electrical activity of the heart).&#xD;
      You will have a chest x-ray and other scans (such as CT, MRI, Bone, Ultrasound or&#xD;
      radionucleotide scans ). You physician will decide which scans are appropriate based on the&#xD;
      disease and clinical situation. You will also have a bone marrow aspirate. To collect a bone&#xD;
      marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small&#xD;
      amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a&#xD;
      specific dose of topotecan. The first group of participants will receive a smaller dose of&#xD;
      topotecan. If patients in that group are able to recover a sufficient number of platelets by&#xD;
      Day 22 and no severe side effects are experienced, the next group of participants will be&#xD;
      treated with a larger dose topotecan. The dose will continue to be increased for each new&#xD;
      group of participants until all the participants in a dose group are unable to recover a&#xD;
      sufficient number of platelets by Day 22, or until severe side effects are experienced. There&#xD;
      will be 3 patients in each group. The doses of all the other drugs used on this study will be&#xD;
      the same for every participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan, ifosfamide, and carboplatin will be given for the first three days of each course.&#xD;
      Ifosfamide and carboplatin will be given into a vein for one hour each day along with the&#xD;
      drug mesna. Mesna is not an anti-cancer drug but a drug to help protect the bladder from the&#xD;
      potential damaging effects of ifosfamide. After the first dose of mesna, participants will&#xD;
      receive 3 more doses (one every three hours) over 15-30 minutes . Topotecan is given directly&#xD;
      into a vein for one-half hour beginning one hour after treatment with ifosfamide,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and the first dose of mesna is completed. Participants who are 22 years or older&#xD;
      will only receive Day 1 and 2 of carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on the fourth day of each course, you will be given a daily injection of the drug&#xD;
      Filgrastim. Filgrastim is a growth factor naturally produced in the body to stimulate the&#xD;
      production of white blood cells (infection fighting cells). Filgrastim can now be produced in&#xD;
      the laboratory and given to patients at higher doses than the body makes. Filgrastim should&#xD;
      help the body recover from treatment. Filgrastim will be given as an injection under the skin&#xD;
      once a day until an acceptable number of white blood cells are detected in the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second course of chemotherapy will begin as soon as 21 days after the start of treatment as&#xD;
      long as you have recovered enough white blood cells and platelets. If the white blood cells&#xD;
      and platelets have not recovered by 21 days, you will begin the next course when they do&#xD;
      recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each of the first three courses, you will have a re-evaluation of the disease.&#xD;
      Re-evaluation will require the same scans to be performed as were done at study entry. If the&#xD;
      tumor shows a complete or partial response to the treatment after the second course, then&#xD;
      continuation on the study will be at the discretion of the treating physician. If the disease&#xD;
      is stable, meaning there is no change in the size or degree of the tumor, then treatment can&#xD;
      continue for a total of 3 courses overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur, you will be taken off study and&#xD;
      other treatment options will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may need to be hospitalized during the first three days of each chemotherapy course and&#xD;
      will require visits as an outpatient at other times during treatment to receive laboratory&#xD;
      follow-up and evaluation. Participants may also require hospitalization because of side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, you will have a physical exam and routine blood (about 2 teaspoons) and&#xD;
      urine tests. You will also have an ECG, a chest x-ray, and other scans as thought necessary.&#xD;
      The physical exam will be done once a week for Courses 1 - 3. The blood tests will be done on&#xD;
      Days 1, 3, 5; then twice weekly and on Day 22 of each course. Urine tests will be done on Day&#xD;
      1 of each course and at the end of Course 2. The scans and ECG will be performed at the end&#xD;
      of each course or sooner if it is suspected that the disease has gotten worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The drugs on this study are FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. However, their use together in this study is experimental. Up to 78 patients will&#xD;
      take part in this study. About 15 patients will be enrolled at UTMDACC.&#xD;
