    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease, is associated with&#xD;
      elevated IgE levels and Th2 responses. It is currently believed that non-pathogenic bacteria&#xD;
      modulate intestinal immune responses avoiding the development of allergic diseases. However,&#xD;
      effects of oral probiotics on AD could not be reproduced in all studies and direct&#xD;
      immuno-modulation of the skin associated immune response by non-pathogenic bacteria has not&#xD;
      been investigated so far. We therefore performed a double blind placebo controlled clinical&#xD;
      study on the effects of an ointment containing 5% extracts of the non-pathogenic bacteria&#xD;
      Vitreoscilla filiformis on AD. Seventy-five AD patients (6-70 years of age) were randomized&#xD;
      to receive either Vitreoscilla filiformis ointment 5% or vehicle ointment daily for 30 days.&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluations, including the &quot;Score of Atopic Dermatitis&quot; (SCORAD), transepidermal&#xD;
      water loss, assessement of microflora, and the patient assessment of itch and loss of sleep&#xD;
      occurred at baseline, day 15, and day 29.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease and often&#xD;
      coexists with other atopic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and asthma&#xD;
      (Biedermann and Röcken 1999, Biedermann et al. 2001, 2004, 2006; Leung et al., 2000, 2003a,&#xD;
      2003b). Even though the immune pathology of AD is not precisely understood, today the new&#xD;
      concept of atopic dermatitis pathology is based on a large set of data. In most patients with&#xD;
      AD, dry skin and dysfunction of the epidermal barrier is found. As an important prove of&#xD;
      concept, the loss of function mutation of the epidermal protein filaggrin impairing skin&#xD;
      barrier function was found and can be detected in about 15% of kaukasian AD patients (Palmer&#xD;
      et al., 2006). As a consequence, patients with AD are predisposed to develop sensitizations&#xD;
      dominated by a Th2 immune phenotype (Hudson, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently of the filaggrin study, it was demonstrated earlier that a disrupted barrier&#xD;
      function of the stratum corneum is present in atopics not only in involved skin, but also in&#xD;
      uninvolved dry skin facilitating permeation of various environmental substances into the skin&#xD;
      (Berardesca et al., 1990; Werner et al., 1985; Watanabe et al., 1991; Loden et al, 1992). As&#xD;
      a biomarker, an increased level of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) can be demonstrated&#xD;
      (Tagami et al., 1985; Ghadially et al., 1996). Various functional and morphological studies&#xD;
      on atopic xerosis that clinically appeared without inflammation demonstrated that cellular&#xD;
      inflammation is already present in atopic skin and a key and initial step in the development&#xD;
      of atopic dermatitis (Watanabe et al., 1991; Uehara et al., 1984). In fact, barrier&#xD;
      dysfunction, atopic immune dysregulation, and atopic dermatitis pathogenesis are not&#xD;
      independent events, but closely linked (Biedermann 2006; Hudson 2006). Th2 lymphocytes&#xD;
      dominate the atopic immune phenotype and are the underlying cell type responsible for the&#xD;
      induction if IgE antibodies (Biedermann et al. 1999, 2004). Barrier dysfunction predisposes&#xD;
      for the development of Th2 lymphocytes and Th2 cells are the first cell type invading atopic&#xD;
      skin initiating inflammation and the inflammatory vicious circle of inflammation (Biedermann&#xD;
      2002; 2004; Lametschwandtner et al. 2004; Günther et al. 2005). Next to Th2 lymphocytes, in&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis skin lesions, infiltrates of eosinophils and cells of the mononuclear&#xD;
      phagocyte lineage are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The altered skin structure of people with atopic predisposition allows increased penetration&#xD;
      of allergens and irritative substances (Roll et al., 2004; Hudson 2006). Many studies have&#xD;
      shown that the extent of S. aureus colonization correlates with AD disease activity (Cho et&#xD;
      al., 2001; Biedermann 2006). In more than 90% of AD patients, a massive skin colonization&#xD;
      with S. aureus (up to 107cfu/cm2 of lesional skin) can be found (Matsui et al., 2000). A&#xD;
      prerequisite for bacterial colonisation are the genuine barrier dysfunction, mechanical&#xD;
      disruption of the barrier and trigger of inflammation (scratching), alkaline pH, decreased&#xD;
      IgA secretion through sweat production, predominant Th2 cells inhibiting anti-infectious&#xD;
      immune responses, and reduced antimicrobial peptides, all representing important&#xD;
      pathophysiological features leading to the disruption of the primary skin defense system&#xD;
      (Biedermann et al. 2001; Biedermann&amp;Röcken 2001,; Biedermann et al. 2002; Biedermann 2006;&#xD;
      Howell, 2005; Rieg 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among several microbes colonising the skin, the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)&#xD;
      may play the most important role in the pathogenesis of dermatitis of atopic people&#xD;
      (Biedermann 2006). This colonization is observed not only in the involved inflammatory skin&#xD;
      but also in the non involved dry skin. The ratio Staphylococcus aureus / Staphylococcus&#xD;
      epidermidis is inverse in comparison to healthy skin. Many studies have shown that the extent&#xD;
      of S. aureus colonization correlates with AD disease intensity (Cho et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced expression of antimicrobial peptides was demonstrated for AD skin and favours&#xD;
      colonization with S. aureus (Ong et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; Howell et al.. Immunity.&#xD;
      2006;24:341-8; Rieg et al. JI 2006). In addition, dry skin may by itself allow colonization&#xD;
      with bacteria such as S. aureus. Decreased levels of sphingosine, which has antimicrobial&#xD;
      properties and the fact that S. aureus itself stimulates the hydrolysis of ceramides by&#xD;
      bacterial derived ceramidase in atopic skin add the dysfunction of the immune barrier in AD&#xD;
      (Arikawa et al., 2002; Kita et al, 2002). The cell membrane of S. aureus contains adhesins&#xD;
      for epidermal and dermal laminin and fibronectin allowing attachemment of S. aureus. to the&#xD;
      skin and these docking positions for S. aureus are uncovered in lesional skin (Cho et al,&#xD;
      2001). The precise mechanism by which S. aureus gains access to the dermis is unknown, but it&#xD;
      is suggested that again IL-4, produced by T helper type 2 cells, induces fibronectin&#xD;
      synthesis, which in combination with plasma exsudation of fibrinogen, allows S. aureus to&#xD;
      bind to the skin. Moreover, S. aureus is able to encase itself in a kind of biofilm composed&#xD;
      of a hydrated matrix of polysaccharides (glycocalix) and proteins, which supports cell&#xD;
      adhesion (Akiyama et al., 2003). After colonization, S. aureus contributes to skin&#xD;
      inflammation e.g. by secreting toxins and an array of so called pathogen associated molecular&#xD;
      pattern (PAMP) that bind their pathogen recognition receptors such as Toll- like receptors&#xD;
      and directly triggering inflammation (Biedermann 2006). Moreover, S. aureus PAMPs also&#xD;
      influence T cell mediated skin inflammation by indirectly regulating skin homing of T cells&#xD;
      and orchestrating chronic inflammation in AD skin (Biedermann 2006; Biedermann et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitreoscilla filiformis (Vf) (ATCC15551) used in this study is a non-photosynthetic,&#xD;
      non-fruiting gliding bacteria as defined according to the classification of Bergey's (1989).&#xD;
      This filamentous bacterium belongs to the order of Beggiatoales. It is a micro-organism found&#xD;
      in sodic sulphuretted thermal springs recognized for their local anti-pruriginous and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The micro-organism Vitreoscilla filiformis (Vf) was cultivated on a defined and sterile&#xD;
      medium, expanded and isolated to constitute a biomass called &quot;pure extract of thermal&#xD;
      plankton&quot;. The term plankton describes the zooplankton (chemiotrope microorganisms) in&#xD;
      contrast to the phytoplankton (phototrope microorganisms). At the end of culturing, the&#xD;
      biomass is concentrated by stabilized centrifugation and autoclaved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technical preparation is a sterile aqueous suspension of the plankton. In vitro studies&#xD;
      show that this plankton supports the production of collagen by fibroblasts and reinforces the&#xD;
      antioxidants systems; it prevents Langerhans cell alterations (reconstructed skin or&#xD;
      organotypic skin culture) exposed to UVB. It exhibits non-specific immunomodulatory effects&#xD;
      on cellular immunity and in particular on macrophages (Patent US, 6,190,671 B1; US, 6,242,229&#xD;
      B1; WO-94/02158).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies showed that this extract has anti-inflammatory activities (decreases ear&#xD;
      oedema after acid arachidonic treatment and modulates contact hypersensitivity reaction with&#xD;
      oxazolone). Moreover, this new compound promotes healing of epidermis and dermis (scaring&#xD;
      following suction blister or following incision in preclinical studies; Patent US, 6,190,671&#xD;
      B1). Therefore, this new compound promises to alleviate infections usually found on the skin&#xD;
      after skin burning, protects skin against ultraviolet alterations and displayss moisturizing&#xD;
      properties for the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials showed that the bacterial extract Vitreoscilla filiformis is effective&#xD;
      against acne and seborrhoeic dermatitis and promotes moisturization of the skin (studies in&#xD;
      Seoul, Korea and in Nice, France and patent FR-2,283, 223) and has been shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial for sensitive skin (clinical trial by Dr Desruelle F in Nice, France) Moreover, a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a formulated 5% extract of&#xD;
      Vitreoscilla filiformis on symmetric active lesions of AD according to a split-body design&#xD;
      was performed with Prof. J. F. Nicolas in Lyon, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the treatment (applied twice daily) with the cream containing 5% Vitreoscilla&#xD;
      filiformis extract was found to be safe and well tolerated. Moreover, this extract&#xD;
      significantly alleviated AD in older children (from 7 years old) and adults compared with&#xD;
      vehicle treatment (p=0.008; Wilcoxon signed ranks test). The therapeutic effects of the&#xD;
      extract were observed within the second week of the application and steadily increased&#xD;
      thereafter. This effect of the cream containing 5% Vitreoscilla filiformis extract appeared&#xD;
      to have a rapid onset especially in regard to pruritus as demonstrated using the mEASI index.&#xD;
      Paired testing confirmed a significant difference in the decrease of pruritus on the 5%&#xD;
      Vitreoscilla filiformis extract treated side at day 28 (p=0,046, Wilcoxon exact signed ranks&#xD;
      test). (Gueniche et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our task was to perform a double blind randomized prospective study comparing 5% Vitreoscilla&#xD;
      filiformis extract (cream B) whith its vehicle (cream A) including measurements of biometric&#xD;
      changes occurring during the use of the two creams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study biometrical and clinical measurements including the transepidermal water&#xD;
      loss, the qualification and quantification of skin microflora and the clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      the skin findings before, during and after the use of the creams was documented. Further the&#xD;
      proband's experiences with the use of the creams were assessed. Biometric variables of the&#xD;
      skin are determined before, during and after the use of cream A and cream B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transepidermal water loss as biometrical value was estimated to assess the skin barrier&#xD;
      function at all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We evaluated if topical application of cream A and cream B influenced the microflora of skin&#xD;
      of atopic volunteers. Qualification and quantification of several bacteria (S. aureus, S.&#xD;
      epidermis, P. acnes, Streptococci, E. coli) was performed before, during and at the end of&#xD;
      the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the intensity of pruritus and the clinical aspect of the skin was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study each volunteer filled out a questionnaire asking about oiliness,&#xD;
      distribution, consistency and adsorption of the creams.&#xD;
