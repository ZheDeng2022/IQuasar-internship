  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED or impotence) is a common medical condition affecting many men world&#xD;
      wide. The most commonly used treatment for ED are oral medications like Viagra (sildenafil),&#xD;
      Levitra (vardenafil) and Cialis (tadalafil). If these are not effective the use of an&#xD;
      injection into the penis (intracavernosal injection or ICI) is necessary. However in some men&#xD;
      neither of these therapies is successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An adequate erection may be achieved in men with difficult-to-treat erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction, when they are treated with a therapy of combination of tablet and penile&#xD;
      injection, when a single treatment therapy has failed for these men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of a combination of Viagra and Caverjet&#xD;
      Impulse in a group of men who had failed to achieve an adequate response to the maximum&#xD;
      recommended dose of either Viagra, Cialis or Levitra and Caverjet Impulse, when these&#xD;
      treatments were used alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 men with difficult to treat ED will be given oral medication, intracavernosal therapy or&#xD;
      the combination in a single-blind randomised study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be signed prior to any study procedures being carried out. All&#xD;
      participants are 'blinded' to their study treatments. Participants who have satisfactory&#xD;
      response to any of the tablets or penile injections, will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
