      This pilot study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of once daily T2000 when used to treat&#xD;
      patients with Myoclonus Dystonia over a 12 week period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myoclonus Dystonia (M-D) is a rare, inherited movement disorder in which patients experience&#xD;
      myoclonus - sudden, brief, jerky involuntary motions, often in association with dystonia -&#xD;
      involuntary sustained contractions causing twisting or abnormal posture. While most M-D&#xD;
      patients respond significantly to alcohol, there are no approved medications for M-D. A&#xD;
      variety of medications are currently used to treat M-D, but these treatments work in a small&#xD;
      proportion of patients and provide only partial improvement in symptoms; their use is also&#xD;
      limited by side-effects in many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2000 is a medication currently under development for the treatment of movement disorders,&#xD;
      including essential tremor (ET). Although T2000 is a new medication, it belongs to a class of&#xD;
      medications that has been used for many years for the treatment of a variety of medical&#xD;
      conditions. In previous studies, T2000 appeared to be effective in controlling symptoms of ET&#xD;
      and some patients with severe ET had major improvements in tremor. As would be expected for&#xD;
      medications in this class, T2000 can cause sedation at high blood levels, such as may be seen&#xD;
      when large doses are given to older individuals. In younger patients, T2000 caused only&#xD;
      minimal side effects even when administered at high doses and for periods of several weeks to&#xD;
      several months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of T2000 in patients with M-D.&#xD;
      Patients will receive doses of T2000 beginning at 200 mg a day and increasing every other&#xD;
      week by an additional 200 mg a day up to a maximal dose of 1000 mg a day. The total duration&#xD;
      of treatment will be 12 weeks. Patient's symptoms of myoclonus and dystonia, as well as&#xD;
      overall neurological examination, will be monitored throughout the study. The response to&#xD;
      T2000 will be determined by comparing the severity of myoclonus and dystonia while patients&#xD;
      are receiving T2000 compared to the symptoms observed without active medication.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should meet diagnostic criteria for M-D based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  myoclonus is the primary feature; focal or segmental dystonia of any severity may&#xD;
                  also be present&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  symptoms began by age 20&#xD;
&#xD;

                  condition&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  investigations such as imaging, EEG and evoked potential tests should be normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible for this study if they are symptomatic on their current&#xD;
