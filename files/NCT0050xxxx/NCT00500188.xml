      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether induction of apoptosis or inhibition of angiogenesis are involved&#xD;
           in the antitumor activity of (Gleevec, Formerly STI-571) in patients with&#xD;
           gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) as assessed by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
           scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether dynamic computed tomography (CT), PET scan, molecular and&#xD;
           histopathologic responses in GIST tumors from patients treated with Gleevec predict&#xD;
           Disease-Free Survival (DFS) time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the disease free survival of patients with resectable or partially&#xD;
           resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with Gleevec preoperatively and&#xD;
           continued for 2 years after resection of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of Gleevec given to patients with GI stromal&#xD;
           tumors 3, 5, or 7 days preoperatively and continued postoperatively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Imatinib mesylate is a drug that may help to kill gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 3 weeks before your scheduled surgery, you will have a PET scan, a CT scan and two to&#xD;
      three tablespoons of blood will be collected. These are imaging tests and are being done to&#xD;
      check on the status of the disease. These tests will be repeated the day before your&#xD;
      scheduled surgery. If your doctor feels it is necessary, you will have a chest x-ray and 2 to&#xD;
      3 tablespoons of blood will be collected for routine tests. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, you will also have a biopsy procedure of the tumor performed. This biopsy&#xD;
      is being done to study the effect of imatinib mesylate on the tumor cells. The tissue that is&#xD;
      collected during the biopsy procedure will be compared to the tumor that is taken out at the&#xD;
      time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of three groups. One group&#xD;
      will begin taking imatinib mesylate two times a day by mouth starting 7 days before surgery.&#xD;
      The second group will start taking imatinib mesylate 5 days before surgery. Participants in&#xD;
      the third group will begin taking imatinib mesylate 3 days before surgery. After your&#xD;
      surgery, the removed tumor will be studied and compared to the tissue collected before&#xD;
      surgery to see what effect (if any) imatinib mesylate had on the tumor. All patients will&#xD;
      then continue imatinib mesylate for 2 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take imatinib mesylate two times a day for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you develop any side effects to the study drug, treatment may be temporarily stopped or&#xD;
      the dose of the drug changed until the symptoms are gone. If the disease gets worse or you&#xD;
      experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off the study and your doctor will&#xD;
      discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be seen by a physician regularly after surgery. Two to three tablespoons of blood&#xD;
      will be collected once a month for routine tests, and a you will have a CT scan done every 3&#xD;
      months. These tests will help us determine if your cancer has come back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY. Imatinib mesylate is FDA approved and is commercially&#xD;
      available. Up to 48 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
