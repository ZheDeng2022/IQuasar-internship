    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is find the highest tolerated dose of paclitaxel&#xD;
      that can be given directly into the liver of patients with advanced cancer involving the&#xD;
      liver. Researchers also want to collect descriptive information on any effects the drug may&#xD;
      have on tumor tissue.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is designed to work by blocking the mechanisms of cell division in cancer cells,&#xD;
      causing them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening tests.&quot; These&#xD;
      tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will&#xD;
      have a complete medical history and physical exam, including measurement of height, weight,&#xD;
      and vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, breathing rate, and heart rate). You will have&#xD;
      a neurological evaluation evaluating your strength and nerve function. You will be asked to&#xD;
      report how a pinprick or a thin brush feel when applied to your skin. About 2 tablespoons of&#xD;
      blood and some urine samples will be collected for routine tests. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will begin taking study drugs in cycles&#xD;
      of 28 days. You will be hospitalized to receive your chemotherapy. The night of the hospital&#xD;
      admission, you will receive fluids (normal saline) in your veins to help decrease the risk of&#xD;
      kidney side effects from the chemotherapy. The morning after your admission to the hospital,&#xD;
      you will be taken to the interventional radiology suite, and a catheter (a thin plastic tube)&#xD;
      will be placed in your groin area and advanced to the liver. You must be on bedrest the&#xD;
      entire time that the catheter is in place. After the procedure, you will go to Nuclear&#xD;
      Medicine, and a test called &quot;flow study&quot; will be carried out to confirm the right position of&#xD;
      the catheter. After your return to the room, the nurses will start the chemotherapy. You will&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel nonstop over 24 hours through the catheter (a thin plastic tube) into the&#xD;
      artery that carries blood to your liver. You will repeat this procedure once every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter will be carefully taped so that it can not move and to prevent it from coming&#xD;
      out while you are receiving chemotherapy. You will be asked to lie flat on your back while&#xD;
      the treatment takes place. In some cases, the catheter will be removed immediately after your&#xD;
      chemotherapy infusions is complete. In some cases, the catheter will remain in longer. You&#xD;
      will be on bedrest until the catheter is removed. When the catheter is pulled, pressure will&#xD;
      be applied to the groin for 15 minutes. The catheter will be removed by someone experienced&#xD;
      in the procedure. The catheter will be placed and removed for each cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for blood counts and liver function tests, before&#xD;
      each dose, to be sure researchers are safely giving you the paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be seen by a doctor or advanced practitioner every day while you are in the&#xD;
      hospital. You will be hospitalized for about 3-5 days until recovery from all immediate&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related side effects. The charges of your hospitalization will be billed to you&#xD;
      or your insurance carrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue to receive the chemotherapy once every 28 days, unless the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or intolerable side effects occur. Every 2 months and at the end of your participation&#xD;
      in this study, you will have scans to see if your tumors are growing or shrinking and blood&#xD;
      work (about 3 teaspoons) will be performed for safety tests. These tests can be performed at&#xD;
      your doctor's office and the results faxed to the study doctor at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, you will be asked to call the research nurse in charge of this study at&#xD;
      713-745-1042 to report on your health status every week for 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      the drug or until you start a new course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy you will be given is FDA approved. The&#xD;
      cost of being on these medications will be billed to you or your insurance company. About 59&#xD;
      patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
