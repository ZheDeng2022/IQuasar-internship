      Background: Local anaesthetic day-care open haemorrhoidectomy (LH) is feasible, cheap and may&#xD;
      be the cost-effective surgical approach to third degree haemorrhoids. This prospective&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial compares patient's evaluation of LH with general anaesthetic&#xD;
      day-care Park's modified Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy (GH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 41 patients with third degree haemorrhoids were randomised to LH (19 cases) and GH&#xD;
      (22 cases). Demographics were comparable. Independent assessment (by a research nurse) and&#xD;
      clinical evaluation ran parallel for 6 months. Outcome measures were average and expected&#xD;
      pain scores for 10 days; satisfaction scores at 10 days, 6 weeks and 6 months. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were journey time and cost in day surgery.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open haemorrhoidectomy is a commonly performed painful operation. In 1998-99, 26514&#xD;
      haemorrhoidectomies were performed in the UK of which 14373 were day cases. A further 5342&#xD;
      could have been performed as day surgery1. Improvements in multimodal2 and pre-emptive&#xD;
      analgesia3, introduction of stapled anopexy4 and improvements in patient counselling5 have&#xD;
      led to increasing number of day surgical treatment of haemorrhoids. Technique of LH is&#xD;
      described6-11 but with the paucity of randomised controlled trials this is rarely offered as&#xD;
      a routine choice to patients with third degree haemorrhoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised controlled trial compares patient-evaluation of postoperative pain and&#xD;
      expected pain scores for 10 days and satisfaction scores at 10 days, 6 weeks and 6 months&#xD;
      between local and general anaesthetic day surgical open haemorrhoidectomy. Clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (for 6 months), cost comparison and evaluation of total journey time in day surgical unit&#xD;
      formed part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised controlled trial was approved by the Research and Development department and&#xD;
      the Local Research Ethics committee. We performed a pilot evaluation of ten-day average pain&#xD;
      and expectation scores after LH in 7 patients. Based on the data from this pilot study and&#xD;
      the average pain scores from the literature for GH, we calculated a requirement of 40&#xD;
      patients to give a 90% power to the study at the 5% significance level (student's t-test) to&#xD;
      detect a 22% difference in 10 day average pain scores with a standard deviation of 1.712.&#xD;
      Null hypothesis was that there was no difference in the pain scores between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty two patients with third degree haemorrhoids had full explanation of the trial (verbal&#xD;
      and written with copies sent to their GP) and were randomised [Figure 1] on the day of&#xD;
      surgery after consent. Patients unfit for day-surgery were excluded. Computer generated&#xD;
      random numbers with opaque envelopes [produced by the principal researcher (GNR)] were opened&#xD;
      by the research nurse (WH) after obtaining the research consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal and written information of the expected postoperative course following open&#xD;
      haemorrhoidectomy were given to all patients. This leaflet detailed the measures to take in&#xD;
      the event of constipation or difficulty in passing urine, if such a problem arose. They were&#xD;
      given the research nurse's contact number, in the event of a problem and were advised to&#xD;
      contact out-of-hours GP service or the research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research nurse [WH] assessed their pain and expectation scores in the post operative period&#xD;
      on the day of surgery and spoke to all the patients on the day after surgery to record their&#xD;
      comments and reinforce the importance of accurate scoring. Patients then recorded their pain&#xD;
      and expectation scores at home for 10 days. This was the average of the pain that the&#xD;
      patients experienced before, during and after defecation or the average of the pain during&#xD;
      the course of the day. Two patients failed to return their 10 day pain scores [7%].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores were recorded on a ten-point Visual-analogue scale with scores from 1 to 10, with&#xD;
      1 being 'no pain' and 10 being 'as bad as it could be'. Ten-point patient expectation score&#xD;
      was -5 to 5 with -5 being 'much better than expected' and 5 being 'much worse than expected'.&#xD;
      Seven point satisfaction score was -3 to 3 with -3 being 'extremely dissatisfied' and 3 being&#xD;
      'extremely satisfied'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up by the surgeon (NGR) at 10 days, 6 weeks and 6 months evaluated the&#xD;
      surgical outcome and recorded all surgical complications. Patients sent their satisfaction&#xD;
      scores directly to the research nurse at these time-points and were un-influenced by the&#xD;
      surgical out-patient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All haemorrhoidectomies [Park's modified Milligan-Morgan technique13] were performed by a&#xD;
      single surgeon [NGR]. Prone-Jacknife position (with buttocks strapped apart) was used for&#xD;
      those randomised to local anaesthesia while Lithotomy-Trendelenburg position was used for&#xD;
      those undergoing the procedure under general anaesthesia. Those with Type B and C buttocks10&#xD;
      needed more Trendelenburg position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perianal block was used for all patients irrespective of their randomisation. GH were given&#xD;
      the block prior to commencement of surgery. This was performed with 20 ml of 1% Lignocaine&#xD;
      (with 1 in 10000 Adrenaline) injected at four sites [midline anterior and posterior; left and&#xD;
      right lateral], fanning the needle in three directions at each of the four sites; care being&#xD;
      taken to inject outside the external sphincter, to avoid pain. Once the sphincter muscle&#xD;
      relaxed with the perianal block, a further 10 ml of the same anaesthetic was injected&#xD;
      submucosally raising a bleb in each of sites corresponding to the sites of perianal block.&#xD;
      This bleb was massaged inferiorly. No sedation was used with local anaesthetic&#xD;
      haemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following diathermy excision of haemorrhoids, a tube of lignocaine gel (Instillagel) was&#xD;
      instilled into the anal canal followed by insertion of a gram of metronidazole and 50 mg of&#xD;
      voltarol unless a history of asthma contraindicated the use of Voltarol in which case that&#xD;
      was omitted. A soft sponge 'pack' [curisponge] was subsequently inserted. Patients were&#xD;
      warned pre-operatively to expect the passage of the gelatinous curisponge in the&#xD;
      post-operative period with their first defaecation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A package of medications was given to take home (TTA). TTA contained Co-codamol, Ibuprofen,&#xD;
      Metronidazole, Lactulose, Dulcolax, 5% lignocaine ointment and 2% Diltiazem cream, with&#xD;
      detailed instructions on its usage. Message in the post-operative instruction leaflet was&#xD;
      reiterated prior to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Journey time was calculated as the time elapsed between the start of anaesthesia and patient&#xD;
      going home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection was defined as presence of purulent discharge with heightened pain, a visit to&#xD;
      their general practitioner and use of antibiotics over and above the Metronidazole prescribed&#xD;
      on discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sum of the individual costs of the suture material, anaesthesia, cost of day surgery staff,&#xD;
      recovery room costs and post operative medications were the basis of cost analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected on Microsoft Excel was analysed on 'Analyse-it for Microsoft Excel'&#xD;
      [Analyse-it Software Ltd, Leeds, UK]. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used.&#xD;
      Where the data was normally distributed as in the comparison of age, student's t-test was&#xD;
      used. Serial measurements on linear analogue pain score were summarised by calculating the&#xD;
      average pain over the 10-day time period for each patient as a summary measure14.&#xD;
