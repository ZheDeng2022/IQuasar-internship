      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to identify risk factors associated with the&#xD;
      development of multiple myeloma (MM) by integrating epidemiologic, clinical and molecular&#xD;
      information. We plan to invite MDACC patients with MM, as well as controls, to participate in&#xD;
      this investigative case-control study. Controls will be selected from friends and spouses who&#xD;
      accompany patients to the various MDACC clinics and will be matched to the cases on age (±5&#xD;
      years), gender, and ethnicity. We will obtain demographic, risk factor and clinical&#xD;
      information along with a blood and buccal sample from all cases and controls. This study&#xD;
      could have implications for prevention and subsequent reduction in the incidence of multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. Collecting blood and buccal samples will allow us to study the role genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility plays in MM risk. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To enroll and obtain, through self-administered questionnaires, risk factor information&#xD;
           on all study participants to develop detailed demographic, epidemiologic, and behavioral&#xD;
           profiles. This study will accrue 250 MM patients from MDACC and 250 healthy controls&#xD;
           selected from friends and spouses who accompany patients to the MDACC clinics. Blood (25&#xD;
           ml) and buccal samples will be collected from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify risk factors associated with MM by integrating epidemiological, clinical and&#xD;
           molecular information using a case-control approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate constitutional markers of genetic susceptibility as predictors of MM risk.&#xD;
           Gene-environment interactions will be explored.&#xD;

      Informed Consent For Control Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers are trying to learn about factors that may be associated with MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire asks&#xD;
      questions about your demographics (for example, age and sex), any chemicals you may have been&#xD;
      exposed to, your medical history, family history of cancer, your diet, and your history of&#xD;
      smoking and/or alcohol use. It should take around 30-40 minutes to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn. You will spit into a collection container in&#xD;
      order to provide a sample of your saliva. The blood and saliva samples will be used for&#xD;
      special tests to look for any biological factors associated with MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you live in Houston or the surrounding area, study personnel can arrange to collect the&#xD;
      samples at the time and place of your convenience. If you do not live in the Houston area,&#xD;
      sample collection instructions and supplies will be mailed to you. The blood sample may be&#xD;
      drawn at your doctor's office, or at a clinic or hospital of your choice. All mailing costs&#xD;
      will be paid by the study. No travel to M. D. Anderson will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be considered off-study after the data that is collected has been processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 500 participants will take part in this study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Neither you nor your doctor will receive the results of these tests, and they will not be put&#xD;
      in your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be considered off study after the data that is collected has been processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 500 participants will take part in this study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
