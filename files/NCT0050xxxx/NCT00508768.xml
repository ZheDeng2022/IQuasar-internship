  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of two oral dosing regimens of&#xD;
      SCIO-469, with and without methotrexate, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCIO-469 is being developed for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that&#xD;
      occurs mostly in women; therefore, female patients with active rheumatoid arthritis are&#xD;
      selected as the study population. This study is the first detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation&#xD;
      (study of a drug in the body to watch how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and&#xD;
      eliminated over a period of time) of SCIO-469 in a new capsule formulation. Methotrexate is&#xD;
      frequently prescribed as treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis; thus, SCIO-469&#xD;
      could potentially be used along with methotrexate. It is not known how methotrexate affects&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of SCIO-469; therefore, the study is designed to include patients who&#xD;
      are taking stable doses of methotrexate and patients who are not taking methotrexate. This is&#xD;
      a Phase II, randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the&#xD;
      patient or the physician knows which study treatment the patient is receiving),&#xD;
      parallel-group study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      SCIO-469 in female patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Sixteen patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, with eight receiving stable doses of methotrexate and eight not&#xD;
      receiving methotrexate. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are allowed.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated for SCIO-469 and its metabolites, testing for significant&#xD;
      differences by occasion (Day 1 or Day 12), treatment (30 mg three times a day or 90 mg once a&#xD;
      day), and stratum (methotrexate or non methotrexate). Safety assessments for this study&#xD;
      include clinical adverse events, concomitant medications, and clinical assessments (medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, vital and orthostatic vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), and clinical laboratory evaluations [serum chemistry, urinalysis, hematology, liver&#xD;
      function and other tests, and pregnancy test]). Patients receiving stable doses of&#xD;
      methotrexate (taken once a week, either orally or by injection) and those not receiving&#xD;
      methotrexate will be randomized into one of two oral capsule SCIO-469 dosing regimens: 30 mg&#xD;
      three times a day and 90 mg once a day. Patients will take study drug for 11 of 12 days, with&#xD;
      no study drug taken on Day 2. On Day 19, seven days after the end of treatment, patients will&#xD;
      undergo a follow-up assessment of safety variables.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on methotrexate are required to have taken a stable methotrexate dose of 15&#xD;
             to 25 mg/week (or lower maximum-tolerated dose level) for at least 1 month before&#xD;
             study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with no methotrexate are required to have taken no methotrexate for at least&#xD;
             1 month before study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and low-dose prednisone are allowed if&#xD;
             doses had been stable for at least 1 month before study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have agreed to practice two forms of birth&#xD;
             control for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
