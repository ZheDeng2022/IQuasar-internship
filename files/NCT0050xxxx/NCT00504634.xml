      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the antimyeloma effect of bortezomib after allogeneic transplantation for&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the toxicity profile of bortezomib in patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib (velcade) is a new drug that works by blocking a structure in the cells called&#xD;
      proteasome. This proteasome acts like a system that eliminates abnormal or old proteins from&#xD;
      the cells. Cancer cells may be sensitive to drugs like bortezomib (velcade), because tumor&#xD;
      cells have more abnormal proteins than normal cells. Bortezomib (velcade) enters the tumor&#xD;
      cells and affects the way they divide. When cancer cells cannot divide, they die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood (about 2 tablespoons) and bone marrow testing done about every 2-3 months&#xD;
      to determine your response and tolerance to treatment. To collect a bone marrow sample, an&#xD;
      area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is&#xD;
      withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive bortezomib (velcade) as an infusion into a vein over 5-10 minutes twice a&#xD;
      week for 2 weeks. You will then rest for 10 to 17 days. This 21-28 day period makes up 1&#xD;
      cycle. You will complete up to a total of 4 cycles. Courses 2 and 3 might be given under&#xD;
      supervision of your local physician however the principal investigator will do necessary&#xD;
      treatment dose adjustments and new set of treatment orders will be provided to your&#xD;
      physician. Treatment evaluations will be under the supervision of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam and routine blood tests (about 2 tablespoons) before each dose&#xD;
      of bortezomib (velcade). Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine tests to determine response to&#xD;
      treatment will be performed once a month, as well as blood tests to look at side effects of&#xD;
      treatment, will be performed at least once a week and more frequently if medically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. You&#xD;
      will be called every 3 months for at least 1 year after the last dose of bortezomib (velcade)&#xD;
      to see how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bortezomib (velcade) is commercially available and&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of myeloma. A total of 28 patients will participate in this&#xD;
      study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
