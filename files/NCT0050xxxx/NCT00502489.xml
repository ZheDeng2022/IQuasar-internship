      After an episode of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, weaning the&#xD;
      patient from the ventilator may be difficult. Discontinuation of ventilation is estimated to&#xD;
      take up to 40% of the total duration of ventilatory support. Approximately two- thirds of&#xD;
      patients can be disconnected from the ventilator after a spontaneous breathing trial.&#xD;
      Prolongation of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of adverse events such as&#xD;
      infections and can increase morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying weaning readiness early and reliably is therefore crucial. Weaning protocols&#xD;
      developed to assist in identifying weaning readiness have been shown to shorten duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, most notably the weaning period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed loop knowledge-based systems serve as a continuously applied weaning process that&#xD;
      automatically reduce ventilatory assistance according to patient ability and indicate when&#xD;
      the patient is ready for disconnection. No data on the use of such a computer driven system&#xD;
      (CDS) in elderly patients requiring prolonged ventilation in weaning centers (non ICU) have&#xD;
      been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Objective of the present study is to evaluate the ability of a computer driven system to&#xD;
      predict weaning readiness and to compare this to a physician-directed protocol. The CDS&#xD;
      continuously adapts pressure support, gradually decreasing ventilator assistance according to&#xD;
      patient ability, and thus indicates weaning readiness. Patients who maintain spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing for 7 days following weaning will be considered to be successfully weaned from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

      Introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an episode of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, weaning the&#xD;
      patient from the ventilator may be difficult. Discontinuation of ventilation is estimated to&#xD;
      take up to 40% of the total duration of ventilatory support. Approximately two- thirds of&#xD;
      patients can be disconnected from the ventilator after a spontaneous breathing trial.&#xD;
      Prolongation of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of adverse events such as&#xD;
      infections and can increase morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying weaning readiness early and reliably is therefore crucial. Weaning protocols&#xD;
      developed to assist in identifying weaning readiness have been shown to shorten duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, most notably the weaning period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed loop knowledge-based systems serve as a continuously applied weaning process that&#xD;
      automatically reduce ventilatory assistance according to patient ability and indicate when&#xD;
      the patient is ready for disconnection. No data on the use of such a computer driven system&#xD;
      (CDS) in elderly patients requiring prolonged ventilation in weaning centers (non ICU) have&#xD;
      been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the ability of a computer driven system to predict weaning readiness and to&#xD;
      compare this to a physician-directed protocol. The CDS continuously adapts pressure support,&#xD;
      gradually decreasing ventilator assistance according to patient ability, and thus indicates&#xD;
      weaning readiness. Patients who maintain spontaneous breathing for 7 days following weaning&#xD;
      will be considered to be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single center, randomized, controlled clinical study at the Beit Rivka regional weaning&#xD;
      center (RWC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at the Beit Rivka geriatric rehabilitation hospital, Petah&#xD;
      Tikva. Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient or legal representative.&#xD;
      The study will include 60 consecutive patients who meet all inclusion criteria after&#xD;
      stabilization of the acute health problems that prompted admission to the referral hospital.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are as follows: pressure support ventilation (PSV) for at least 48 h,&#xD;
      plateau pressure less than 30 cmH2O, PEEP &lt; 6 cmH2O, PaO2/FIO2 ratio &gt; 150 or SaO2 &gt; 94% with&#xD;
      FIO2 &lt; than 0.5, pCO2 &lt;55 mm Hg for normal patients and &lt; 65 m Hg for patients with COPD, no&#xD;
      requirement for inotropic support, body temperature &gt; 36.50C and &lt; 38.50 C, stable&#xD;
      neurological status with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) &gt; 6, HgB &gt; 8 mg %, systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      &gt;90 mg Hg, mean arterial pressure &gt;65 mg Hg, absence of sedative medications and availability&#xD;
      of CDS at the time of patient admission or switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV).&#xD;
      Patients younger than 60 or older than 85 years of age, patients on chronic ventilatory&#xD;
      assistance at home, and patients with decision to limit life-sustaining treatments will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group assignment will be by a sealed envelope upon admission to the hospital.&#xD;
      Attending doctors will not be blinded as to the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the computer driven system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDS is a knowledge- based system embedded in a ventilator (EVITA XL) (15, 16, 17). It&#xD;
      achieves three main goals. First, the CDS continuously adjusts the PSV level based on&#xD;
      respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (Vt) and end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PETCO2)&#xD;
      acquired from the ventilator in real time and averaged over 2 min. Adjustment is such that&#xD;
      the patient is kept within a &quot;comfort zone&quot; defined as a RR between 15-30 range (up to 34&#xD;
      within patients with neurological disorders), Vt greater than 300 ml (&lt; 250 ml if body weight&#xD;
      &lt; 55 kg), and PETCO-2 less than 55 mm Hg (&lt; 65 mmHg in patients with COPD). Second, the CDS&#xD;
      gradually decreases ventilatory assistance by reducing PSV level after at least 30 min of&#xD;
      stable ventilation within the comfort zone; the reduction is by 2 or 4 cm H20 depending on&#xD;
      whether the initial level is below or above 20 cm H2O, respectively. Third, the CDS evaluates&#xD;
      weaning readiness: when the PSV level reaches the preset minimal value (9 cm H2O in&#xD;
      tracheotomized patients), the CDS starts an observational period, which serves as automatic&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing trial. After uninterrupted ventilation at the minimal PSV level for 1&#xD;
      or 2 h (depending on whether the initial PSV level was above or below 15 cm H2O), the CDS&#xD;
      displays a message that the patient is ready to be disconnected from the ventilator. The&#xD;
      investigator will have perfect knowledge of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of weaning. Weaning readiness as evaluated by the CDS and by the internist will be&#xD;
      recorded daily, i.e., every morning between 10 and 11 a.m. The decision will be considered to&#xD;
      be taken by the CDS before the physician when it was taken 1 day in advance, i.e., the&#xD;
      preceding morning. Physicians will be aware of the PSV level delivered by the CDS and could&#xD;
      take this level into account in their evaluation. Weaning protocols used routinely in the&#xD;
      center recommend a daily assessment for weaning similar to that used by the CDS. Patients are&#xD;
      declared weaned as soon as the physician or CDS predicts weaning readiness. The control group&#xD;
      reflects the standard of care before CDS implementation. PS of 10 cm H2O or higher is set&#xD;
      manually. After 20 min, in the absence of signs of poor tolerance, the PSV is reduced by 4 or&#xD;
      2 cm H20 (depending on initial PSV level &gt; or &lt; 20). If poor tolerance to weaning is evident,&#xD;
      the progression of the weaning is stopped, and the patient is reassessed 20 min later for&#xD;
      further reduction in PSV. The PSV level is decreased to 9 cm H2O. In the case of apnea, SIMV&#xD;
      is reinstituted. If the evaluation is satisfactory, the patient is disconnected from the&#xD;
      ventilator. The patient is closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure requiring&#xD;
      reinstitution of mechanical ventilation, as well as for occurrence of any other&#xD;
      complications. RWC length of stay on MV will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics including age, sex, anthropometrical data, APACHE II score,&#xD;
      Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Scale (GDS), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), temperature, ny concomitant&#xD;
      medications, hand grip strength will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expired tidal volume, respiratory rate, Peak airway pressure, mean airway pressure,&#xD;
      Compliance, Resistance, respiratory frequency to tidal volume ratio (f/Vt ), Negative&#xD;
      Inspiratory Pressure (NIP), Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), Minute Ventilation&#xD;
      (MV),inspiratory time will be recorded .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other elements relevant to mechanical ventilation management include arterial blood gas&#xD;
      estimation, the number of changes in the settings of the ventilator performed by the health&#xD;
      care workers, the number of transitions from controlled to assisted ventilation, and the&#xD;
      number of apnea and high pressure alarms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variables will be the duration of mechanical ventilation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation from MV will be attempted when the primary physician judges that the patient&#xD;
      is ready to be weaned, according to the standard criteria. Mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      reinstituted in the following circumstances: respiratory rate above 35 breaths /min, P02&#xD;
      below 65 mm Hg with FIO2less than 0.6, ph 7.34 or less, heart rate equal to or above 1 10&#xD;
      beats min or Increased by 20 % or more, or if arrhythmias appear, systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      without inotropes &lt;90 mmHg or above 20% of usual blood pressure, uncoordinated&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal movements, activation of accessory muscles, agitation or depressed mental&#xD;
      status, or excessive sweating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A weaning trial will be considered a failure when the patient will be not tolerate the&#xD;
      weaning trial, patients still in the use CDW at day 60 and patients requires reconnection to&#xD;
      MV. Weaning trial will be considered successful if spontaneous breathing is sustained for&#xD;
      more than 168 h (7 days) after disconnection from MV .&#xD;
