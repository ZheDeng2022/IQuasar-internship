    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the tolerability of treatment with human&#xD;
      lactoferrin 1-11 peptide (hLF1-11) administered intravenously as a single dose given for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days, to patients with bacteremia due to staphylococcus epidermidis.&#xD;

      RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staphylococcus epidermidis is a relatively uncommon find in blood cultures, most cases being&#xD;
      found in patients with intravenous lines through contiguous contamination and current&#xD;
      clinical practice is often one of not using antibiotic treatment immediately, unless&#xD;
      significant clinical signs and symptoms and/or patient status justifies intervention with an&#xD;
      antibiotic. The latter tends to be vancomycin as many S epidermidis strains are resistant to&#xD;
      other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      hLF1-11 is hypothesized to have antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis,&#xD;
      amongst other strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should hLF1-11 be shown to be an effective antibacterial against Staphylococcus epidermidis,&#xD;
      its use would be justified in other more serious hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA&#xD;
      for which hLF1-11 has been shown (in preclinical in vitro and in vivo data) to display a&#xD;
      strong therapeutic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preclinical data hLF1-11 has been shown to possess antibacterial effects on the&#xD;
      selected bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis). Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal&#xD;
      found in human skin. In current clinical practice hospital-acquired systemic Staphylococcal&#xD;
      epidermidis is not routinely treated unless the bacteremia is accompanied by a clear clinical&#xD;
      risk to the patient.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized patients with positive blood culture for Staphylococcus epidermidis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of staphylococcal infection based on a positive culture for Staphylococcus&#xD;
             epidermidis on 2 consecutive occasions within 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study medication must be started not later than 24 hours of the last qualifying&#xD;
             positive blood culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom antibiotic treatment is not clinically indicated at the start of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have sufficient venous access to permit administration of study drug and&#xD;
             monitoring of safety variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have hepatic and renal parameters within 2X ULN (upper level of&#xD;
             normality) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fecund females patients must not be pregnant (confirmed by pregnancy test at entry)&#xD;
             and must be on appropriate mechanical (intra-uterine device) or pharmacological&#xD;
             (&quot;pill&quot;) contraception.&#xD;
