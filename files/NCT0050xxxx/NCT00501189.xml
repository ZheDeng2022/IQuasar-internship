      This project will compare the rate of regression of minimally abnormal Pap smears to normal&#xD;
      in women who receive Gardasil to a historical control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis: Women with low grade cervical dysplasia on Papanicolaou (Pap) smear that&#xD;
      receive Gardasil vaccination will revert to a normal within one year at a rate 33% higher&#xD;
      than historical controls that did not receive Gardasil vaccination.&#xD;

      This study is looking for additional clinical outcomes in women who are already getting the&#xD;
      Gardasil vaccination. We are not giving the vaccination as part of the research protocol.&#xD;
      This point will be stressed to patients. Their participation or non-participation will not&#xD;
      impact their ability to receive the vaccine series. Their participation only impacts whether&#xD;
      or not we will contact them in the future and whether or not we will review their medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled into the study at the time of their presentation for colposcopy in&#xD;
      the EAMC Family Medicine Clinic. Subjects will be screened for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Those found eligible will be consented for enrollment by one of the study&#xD;
      investigators. Colposcopy records will also be searched for patients seen in the colposcopy&#xD;
      clinic between the availability of Gardasil and the beginning of this study. Any patients who&#xD;
      meet enrollment criteria will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      These patients will be followed in the exact same way as patients enrolled upon presenting&#xD;
      for the first time to the colposcopy clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given their first vaccination at the time of their colposcopy appointment&#xD;
      unless they have already begun the vaccine series. Phone and email will be used to remind&#xD;
      patients when they are due for their second and third vaccinations. Any study subject that&#xD;
      does not receive the their 2nd or 3rd vaccine will be considered &quot;partially vaccinated&quot;. They&#xD;
      will not be removed from the protocol, however, because an intention-to-treat analysis is&#xD;
      planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be followed prospectively for up to 15 months. 15 months was chosen&#xD;
      because some patients may be late getting their one-year follow ups. AHLTA records and&#xD;
      colposcopy clinic convenience files will be reviewed for each patient periodically. Patients&#xD;
      who meet criteria to return to routine annual Pap smear, based on ASCCP guidelines, during&#xD;
      the next 11 to 15 months will be considered as &quot;reversion&quot;. Those patients who have ASCUS, +&#xD;
      HPV, LGSIL, or HGSIL on Pap smear at 11 to 15 months past their original Pap smear will be&#xD;
      considered &quot;persistent&quot;. Historical control subjects will also be grouped into &quot;reversion&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;persistent&quot; using the same criteria.&#xD;
