      This study will compare the effectiveness of two types of cognitive behavioral therapy,&#xD;
      one-session exposure treatment and family-enhanced one-session exposure treatment, in&#xD;
      treating children with specific phobias.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A specific phobia is a fear of a particular object or situation. For many children, phobias&#xD;
      result in considerable academic difficulties, social and personal distress, and interference&#xD;
      in day-to-day activities. Physical symptoms typically accompany the intense anxiety caused by&#xD;
      a specific phobia and may include blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, nausea, and&#xD;
      difficulty talking. Phobias can persist a lifetime and may lead to other adult anxiety, mood,&#xD;
      and substance use disorders. One-session exposure treatment (OST), a form of cognitive&#xD;
      behavior therapy, has been considered a rapid and effective treatment for adults with a&#xD;
      variety of specific phobias. Upward of 75 to 80% of adults treated with OST were considered&#xD;
      diagnoses free following treatment. OST has proven useful in treating some children with&#xD;
      specific phobias but not all. It is possible that parental factors may affect whether a child&#xD;
      continues to experience a phobia and how well a child responds to treatment. For example,&#xD;
      parents who are overly protective or have a phobia themselves may prevent their child from&#xD;
      overcoming a specific phobia. Family-enhanced OST (augmented OST) involves the parents of&#xD;
      affected children and provides the parents with strategies to assist their children in&#xD;
      overcoming phobias. This study will compare the effectiveness of OST and augmented OST in&#xD;
      treating children with specific phobias. This study will also evaluate how parental factors&#xD;
      influence the expression and maintenance of phobias in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive OST or augmented OST.&#xD;
      Participants receiving OST will attend one extended treatment session, lasting up to 3 hours&#xD;
      in duration. During this session, the child will be taught a number of cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral skills to deal effectively with the feared situation or object. The child will&#xD;
      also be exposed to the feared situation or object in a highly structured, safe, and&#xD;
      controlled manner. This treatment will only be delivered to the child and will not involve a&#xD;
      parent or guardian. Participants receiving augmented OST will attend the same type of&#xD;
      extended treatment session, but, in addition, their parent or guardian will attend a 3-hour&#xD;
      session. During this session, parents will first be educated on specific phobias, including&#xD;
      why phobias occur and how they are maintained over time. Next, parents will observe their&#xD;
      child being treated from behind a one-way mirror for about 1 hour. During this time, a&#xD;
      therapist will explain what the child's therapist is doing and discuss ways for parents to&#xD;
      implement the treatment at home. Parents will then be asked to join their child and the&#xD;
      therapist for the last hour of the child's session to assist the therapist with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed for all participants immediately after treatment and at 1-, 6-, and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up evaluations during which the presence of specific phobias will be&#xD;
      measured. Parents will also be asked to provide information about their child's school grades&#xD;
      and school attendance for the year prior to participating in the study and up to 1 year after&#xD;
      the child completes the treatment. The child's teacher may be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the child's behavior in school. All of the information collected will&#xD;
      help to determine how much progress each child has made as a result of treatment.&#xD;
