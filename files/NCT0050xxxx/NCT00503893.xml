  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to collect information and blood samples to try&#xD;
      to learn why some people develop cancers and tumors, why some families have more cancers than&#xD;
      others, and whether certain genes or regions of DNA (the genetic material of cells) affect a&#xD;
      person's risk of getting cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1500 patients and family members will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at&#xD;
      MD Anderson.&#xD;

      If you choose to take part in this study, blood (about 10 teaspoons) will be drawn for&#xD;
      genetic testing. The blood may be drawn more than 1 time, depending on how much blood is&#xD;
      drawn at the first visit, and if you are available for more blood draws. If this is the case,&#xD;
      your doctor will discuss any extra blood draws with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For small children (less than 5 years old), about 2 teaspoons will be drawn. Children who are&#xD;
      5 years old or older will not have more than 3 teaspoons drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete a questionnaire about your medical history and family medical history. The&#xD;
      questionnaire should take about 1 hour to complete. The study staff will also review your&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to allow the study staff to collect any of your tissue (whether healthy or&#xD;
      cancerous) that is leftover from surgeries performed as part of your standard care. This may&#xD;
      be from any past or future surgeries or any tissue being stored at MD Anderson or elsewhere.&#xD;
      No new surgeries or biopsies will be performed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your information, tissue samples, and/or bodily fluids can be used for research, the&#xD;
      people doing the research must get specific approval from the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB is a committee made up of doctors, researchers, and members of&#xD;
      the community. The IRB is responsible for protecting the participants involved in research&#xD;
      studies and making sure all research is done in a safe and ethical manner. All research done&#xD;
      at MD Anderson, including research involving your information, tissue samples, and/or bodily&#xD;
      fluids, must first be approved by the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be contacted either by phone or mail 1 time a year, so that the study staff can&#xD;
      update your medical history and information. If contacted by phone, this call should last&#xD;
      about 30 minutes.&#xD;
