      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the efficacy and safety of daptomycin given for treatment of catheter-related&#xD;
      bloodstream infections due to S. aureus bacteria with or without exchange of the central&#xD;
      venous catheter (CVC) over guide wire in comparison with a historical control group of&#xD;
      catheter-related S. aureus bacteremia treated with standard therapy (Vancomycin) or other&#xD;
      active agents against staph aureus (such as beta-lactam antibiotics).&#xD;

      Daptomycin is a new antibiotic. It may be effective against a variety of bacterial infections&#xD;
      that are difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aztreonam, Cefepime, Carbapenems and Augmentin are antibiotics that are used to treat certain&#xD;
      types of bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be given daptomycin by&#xD;
      vein for at least 10 days, depending on your certain type of bacteria. You will receive&#xD;
      Daptomycin by vein for 30 minutes every 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CVC associated with CRBSI (catheter-related bloodstream infection = CR-BSI) from all&#xD;
      enrolled patients will either be removed or be exchanged over guide wire for a new CVC within&#xD;
      96 hours of onset of the first blood culture. Your primary doctor will decide whether to&#xD;
      remove or exchange the CVC with the willingness of you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor and/or your primary physician knows or thinks that you have a mixed&#xD;
      infection (both &quot;gram positive&quot; and &quot;gram negative&quot;) or may have infection in lungs&#xD;
      (pneumonia), you may also be treated with the antibiotic drugs Aztreonam, Cefepime,&#xD;
      Carbapenems, or Augmentin by vein or by mouth in combination with the study drug Daptomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week of treatment, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine lab&#xD;
      tests. The blood sample may be drawn from the CVC, if the CVC is still in place. In addition,&#xD;
      blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn every other day until it no longer shows signs of&#xD;
      infection. The catheter exit site may be examined at each visit until you have no more signs&#xD;
      or symptoms of infection. If you are discharged from the hospital before completing the study&#xD;
      medication, arrangements will be made to provide infusions on an out-patient basis or home&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week of treatment, you will be asked about any symptoms or illnesses that you&#xD;
      have experienced. In addition, you will be asked to inform the study doctor and/or study&#xD;
      staff of any medications or therapies that you are taking while on study. You will be taken&#xD;
      off study if the infection gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on this study will last for a no more than 60 days. If you have been discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital, the end of treatment visit will take place within 7 -14 days of the last&#xD;
      day of study drug. You will need to return for the visit on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (heart&#xD;
      rate, temperature, and blood pressure). Blood samples (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for&#xD;
      routine test and to check for infection. The blood sample may be drawn from the CVC, if the&#xD;
      CVC is still in place. The CVC exit site will be examined. You will be asked about any&#xD;
      symptoms or illnesses that you may have experienced. In addition, you will be asked to inform&#xD;
      the study doctor and/or study staff of any medications or therapies that you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow-up exam between 32 (+/- 7) days after your last dose of study drug.&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (heart rate, temperature,&#xD;
      and blood pressure). Blood (about one tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to&#xD;
      check for infection. The blood samples may be drawn from the CVC, if the CVC is still in&#xD;
      place. The CVC exit site may be examined. You will be asked about any symptoms or illnesses&#xD;
      that you may have experienced. In addition, you will be asked to inform the study doctor&#xD;
      and/or study staff of any medications or therapies that you are taking. Participation on this&#xD;
      study will end once you complete the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Daptomycin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of skin&#xD;
      and soft tissue infection. However, for the use described in this study and at this dose&#xD;
      level, Daptomycin is authorized by the FDA for use in research only. About 50 patients will&#xD;
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at the University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center (MDACC).&#xD;
