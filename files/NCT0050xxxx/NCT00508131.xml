      Iron deficiency and anemia in infants and young children impair neurodevelopment. Efficacious&#xD;
      interventions for reducing the prevalences of iron deficiency and anemia, under controlled&#xD;
      conditions, are available. However, little information is published about the effectiveness&#xD;
      of large-scale programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. Assess the effectiveness on iron deficiency and anemia in young children of a&#xD;
      large-scale program that provides iron fortified milk at a subsidized price to low income&#xD;
      households. Design, Setting, and Sampling. A randomized effectiveness study in 12 milk&#xD;
      distribution clusters randomly selected from 542 clusters in 4 States in Mexico. Selected&#xD;
      clusters were randomly assigned to receive iron-fortified milk FM, N=7) or non-fortified milk&#xD;
      (NFM, N=5). Over 95% program beneficiaries with children 12-30 mo of age in the 12 clusters&#xD;
      (490 in FM and 275 in NFM) were enrolled in the FM and NFM interventions and participated in&#xD;
      a baseline survey. 635 children (405 in FM and 230 in NFM) and 584 children (371 in FM and&#xD;
      213 in NFM) completed the 6 and 12-mo follow-up surveys, respectively. Intervention: A daily&#xD;
      portion of FM contained 5.28 mg of iron, 48 mg of sodium ascorbate and other added&#xD;
      micronutrients. The FM and NFM were distributed to beneficiaries at a subsidized price in&#xD;
      Milk Distribution Centers in the 12 clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Mild-to-moderate anemia (Hb: 90-109 g/L), mild anemia (Hb: 100-109&#xD;
      g/L), moderate anemia (Hb: 90-99 g/L),iron deficiency: Serum Ferritin (SF) &lt;12 ug/L and&#xD;
      soluble transferring receptors (sTfR) &gt;6 mg/L.Serum Zinc deficiency (&lt; 65ug/dL), and stunting&#xD;
      (&lt;2SD Height/Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention effects at 6 and 12 moths were assessed using General Linear Mixed Models with&#xD;
      three repeated measures.&#xD;

      Introduction. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide&#xD;
      (1-3).Children less than 5 years are the most affected(4). Almost 24% of Mexican children 1-4&#xD;
      years of age are anemic and 52% iron deficient (5). The peak prevalence of anemia (38%)&#xD;
      occurs in children 12-23 months of age (6). The prevalence is higher in low socioeconomic&#xD;
      households (29 %) but remains high even in the highest quintile (17%). Anemia and iron&#xD;
      deficiency in infants and young children are associated with adverse effects on&#xD;
      neurodevelopment (7-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During several decades, the Mexican government has sold whole milk at subsidized prices to&#xD;
      low income households with children 1-11 y of age through a federal program (Liconsa). In&#xD;
      2000 a decision was made to fortify the subsidized milk with iron, vitamin C and other&#xD;
      micronutrients to contribute to the reduction of IDA and other micronutrient deficiencies. At&#xD;
      that time, 4.2 million children 1-11 y old from low income families were beneficiaries of the&#xD;
      program. There are very few examples of large scale public health interventions using iron&#xD;
      fortified whole milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of interventions such as food fortification for reducing anemia and iron&#xD;
      deficiency is often questioned (14) and little information is available on the effectiveness&#xD;
      of these strategies implemented through large scale programs. Reliable evidence of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these strategies applied in large-scale programs is needed for planning&#xD;
      interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of iron and zinc deficiencies and anemia in&#xD;
      children.This study aims to document the effectiveness on iron and zinc deficiencies,anemia&#xD;
      and stunting, in young children of a large-scale program that distributes iron and zinc&#xD;
      fortified milk to low income households at subsidized prices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The subsidized milk distribution program. The program was created in 1944 and is&#xD;
      operated by a public organization (Liconsa)(15). It distributes whole milk at subsidized&#xD;
      prices to families living in poverty. The milk distributed is intended mostly for children&#xD;
      1-11 y.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is distributed in milk distribution centers throughout the Country as dry powder in 240 g&#xD;
      sachets which yield two liters of fluid milk after hydration or as a 1 L container of fluid&#xD;
      milk. Children receive the equivalent of 400 mL of fluid milk per day either in dry or fluid&#xD;
      form for reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia and other micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies, through the fortification of the product with iron, zinc, vitamin C and&#xD;
      micronutrients that were deficient in the diet of low income children in Mexico (5, 16). The&#xD;
      program serves approximately 5 million individuals of which about 4.2 million are children&#xD;
      &lt;11 years and about 650,000 were children 12-30 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and sample. This randomized effectiveness trial on children 12-30 mo of age was&#xD;
      conducted in 4 States of Central and Eastern Mexico. The randomized effectiveness trial was&#xD;
      conducted in 12 milk distribution clusters (MDC) comprising periurban areas serving around&#xD;
      5000 beneficiaries with one or more milk distribution centers. These clusters were randomly&#xD;
      selected from a universe of all MDC (n=542) in 4 States in central and eastern Mexico. The&#xD;
      twelve clusters were randomly assigned to receive either fortified (n=7) or non-fortified&#xD;
      (n=5) milk using a random numbers list. The clusters assigned to the non-fortified milk&#xD;
      started receiving fortified milk at the end of the trial. The milk distributed to the&#xD;
      participants in the trial was all in the dry form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the trial was 12 months with a baseline survey and 2 follow-up surveys at&#xD;
      approximately 6 and 12 months. The baseline study was conducted between May 28 and July 30,&#xD;
      2003. The 6 mo and 12 mo follow-up surveys were conducted between December 2003 and February&#xD;
      2004 and between June and July 2004, respectively. The mean time between the baseline and the&#xD;
      6 mo follow up was 5.4 mo and from the 6 to the 12 mo follow was 6.8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The packages of fortified and non-fortified milk were undistinguishable, except for a&#xD;
      color-coded band in the upper corner of the sachet. The color code was unknown to&#xD;
      researchers, field workers, and program beneficiaries, and was not disclosed before data&#xD;
      analysis. The iron and zinc content of the fortified milk was analyzed by our laboratory on&#xD;
      samples of milk powder obtained from LICONSA at the beginning of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers or caretakers of children participating in the study received the same information&#xD;
      and instructions provided regularly to all beneficiaries of the milk distribution program at&#xD;
      the MDC. They were instructed how to reconstitute the milk powder and were encouraged to feed&#xD;
      the selected children 400 mL, preferably at two separate times during the day (200 mL in the&#xD;
      morning and 200 mL in the afternoon). Milk was bought and collected by each family on a&#xD;
      weekly or bimonthly basis at the MDC. The portion of 400 mL of rehydrated fortified milk (FM)&#xD;
      contained 5.28 mg of iron as ferrous gluconate, 48 mg of sodium ascorbate, 5.28 mg of zinc as&#xD;
      zinc oxide and 36.2 mg of folic acid. The non-fortified milk (NFM) contained per 400 mL: 0.16&#xD;
      mg of iron, 1.6 mg of zinc and 6.8 mg of vitamin C. The micronutrient premix,purchased from&#xD;
      DSM Nutritional Products (Herleen, The Nederland) was added to the powdered milk in the plant&#xD;
      by the manufacturer (LICONSA, SA,Queretaro, Mexico) and 220 g units of the products were&#xD;
      packed in metallic foil sachets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of households with children 12-30 months of age (n=798) who were beneficiaries of the&#xD;
      program in the 12 distribution clusters was provided by program officers at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study. 510 of these children corresponded to the distribution clusters assigned to FM and&#xD;
      288 to the clusters assigned to NFM. The number of children in the FM clusters was larger for&#xD;
      two reasons: more clusters were assigned to receive FM as a request from program officials&#xD;
      who wished to minimize the number of children who would not receive the fortified milk&#xD;
      immediately. In addition, some of the clusters randomly assigned to the fortified milk&#xD;
      intervention served larger populations of beneficiaries. The parents or legal guardians of&#xD;
      the 12-30 month old children were invited to participate and those who accepted signed an&#xD;
      informed consent letter after a detailed explanation of the objectives, nature, and risks&#xD;
      posed by the study. Prior to baseline measurements 33 children were excluded from the study&#xD;
      (20 in the FM and 13 in the NFM groups) because they were either severely anemic (Hb&#xD;
      concentrations &lt; 90 g/L, n= 26) or refused to participate (n=7. Therefore, 765 children&#xD;
      participated in the baseline measurements (490 in the FM and 275 in the NFM clusters).&#xD;
      Between the baseline and the 6-mo follow-up measurements, 130 out of these children were lost&#xD;
      to follow up for several reasons. Therefore 635 children completed 6 mo of follow up (n= 405&#xD;
      in the FM and 230 in the NFM groups). Between the 6-mo and the 12-mo follow-up measurements,&#xD;
      51 additional children were lost to follow up. Therefore 584 children completed 12 mo of&#xD;
      follow up (n= 371 in the FM and 213 in the NFM groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 635 children who completed the 6 mo follow-up and the 584 who completed the 12 mo&#xD;
      follow-up, hemoglobin concentrations (the main outcome of this study) as well as basic&#xD;
      socio-demographic variables were available. iron status. The protocol was reviewed and&#xD;
      approved by the Human Subjects and Ethics Committee of the National Public Health Institute,&#xD;
      Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and processing. At the beginning of the study a questionnaire about the&#xD;
      housing characteristics and possession of household goods was applied to the mother or child&#xD;
      caretaker in all households. Hemoglobin concentrations were determined at baseline and 6 and&#xD;
      12 months after in capillary blood samples obtained by finger prick using a Portable&#xD;
      Photometer Hemocue (HemoCue, Angelholm, Sweden)17, 18. Reliability of the photometers was&#xD;
      assessed during fieldwork at the beginning and at the end of each working day. A three-level&#xD;
      liquid quality control check (4C-ESControl, Beckman-Coulter, Miami Fla, USA), and the&#xD;
      readings of a precalibrated reference cuvette included with the equipment were used for such&#xD;
      purpose. The mean difference between duplicates was 0.3 ± 9.9 g/L, (P=0.36 for liquid quality&#xD;
      control material and -0.24 ± 3.6 g/L, P= 0.27 for the reference cuvette). Venous blood&#xD;
      samples were drawn from children at baseline and 6 and 12 mo after. Samples were centrifuged&#xD;
      and serum was stored in color coded cryovials kept in liquid nitrogen until delivery to a&#xD;
      central laboratory. Commercial kits were used to measure the SF concentrations, (Dade Behring&#xD;
      Inc, Newark, DE 19714, U.S.A.) and sTfR (Dade Behring, Maburg, Germany) by ELISA. C reactive&#xD;
      protein (CPR) was determined by nephelometry, using monoclonal antibodies (Behring&#xD;
      Nephelometer 100 Analyzer, Behring Laboratories, Messer Grisheim Gmbh,Frankfurt, Germany.&#xD;
      Serun zinc concentrations were mesured by Atomic Absorption spectrometry by a Analyst 300&#xD;
      model with graphite furnace(Perkin Elmer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length and weight were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 mo after enrollment. Weight was&#xD;
      measured to the nearest 10 g using an electronic scale (Tanita, Model 1583, Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
      Length was measured to the nearest millimeter using a locally made measuring board in&#xD;
      children &lt;24 months of age and standing height, using a stadimeter with precision of 1 mm&#xD;
      (Dyna-Top, model E-1,Mexico City, Mexico) in children 24 months or older. The measurements&#xD;
      were obtained using standard techniques (19, 20). The birth date was reported by the mother&#xD;
      and corroborated in a large proportion of children using birth certificates. Length and&#xD;
      weight data were transformed to z-scores by using the WHO/NCHS/CDC reference data (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify compliance a field worker visited the household every month, at the usual times of&#xD;
      milk intake by the child, to verify the correct reconstitution of milk and to register the&#xD;
      amount of milk consumed. During the same visit a questionnaire was applied regarding the&#xD;
      intake of milk during the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A morbidity questionnaire was applied during the same visit. Feeding practices were assessed&#xD;
      every 2 months through a food frequency questionnaire applied to the mother or caretaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia was defined according to CDC recommendations as hemoglobin concentrations &lt;110 g/L at&#xD;
      sea level (18). Hemoglobin concentrations were adjusted for altitude following the equation&#xD;
      proposed by Cohen and Haas (22). Iron deficiency was defined as SF &lt;12 ug/L and as sTfR &gt; 6&#xD;
      mg/L. SF indicates the level of storage iron and sTfR reflects tissue iron deficiency. Zinc&#xD;
      deficiency was defined as by the IZnCG (&lt;65ug/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the information about housing characteristics and possession of household goods, an&#xD;
      indicator of socioeconomic status (SES) was derived by the first component obtained by&#xD;
      Principal Components Analysis (23) Only variables with factor loadings &gt; 0.5 were maintained&#xD;
      in the model. The variables included in the factor were: flooring material, ceiling material,&#xD;
      availability of piped water,sanitary service, possession of refrigerator and washing machine&#xD;
      as well as the number of electric appliances in the household: radio, TV, video&#xD;
      player,telephone, and computer. The resulting standardized factor scores were divided into&#xD;
      tertiles which were further used to construct SES status categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods. Characteristics of study children at baseline and at 5 and 12 months and&#xD;
      the socioeconomic status of their families were compared between intervention groups using&#xD;
      t-test on continuous variables and Ji2 for categorical variables (24). Distributions which&#xD;
      were not normal were transformed and were compared using t-test. When adequate&#xD;
      transformations were not achieved, the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test was employed (24. Intervention&#xD;
      effects at 6 and 12 moths were assessed using General Linear Mixed Models with three repeated&#xD;
      measures (25). Dependent variables were the prevalences of anemia or iron deficiency by&#xD;
      either SF or sTfR. The interaction term between intervention and indicator variables for 6&#xD;
      and 12 months were used as the measure of effects at 6 and 12 months adjusting for baseline&#xD;
      measurements. All models were adjusted for cluster effects (Milk Distribution Centers) and&#xD;
      covariates. Adjusted probabilities were obtained to illustrate effects in graphic form26.&#xD;
      Main effects were considered statistically significant at p values &lt; 0.05 and interactions at&#xD;
      p values &lt;0.10. Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA (version 9.0)&#xD;
