      In our opinion, it is worth to check an ability of antioxidant therapy to produce a favorable&#xD;
      effect on Residual Renal Function.&#xD;

      Background Preserving residual renal function (RRF) has always been the primary clinical goal&#xD;
      for every nephrologists managing patients with chronic kidney disease but not yet on&#xD;
      dialysis. RRF in patients on dialysis has proven to be a consistent and powerful predictor of&#xD;
      mortality. This is particularly evident for patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD):&#xD;
      CANUSA study showed that only RRF but not dialysis dose has significant predictive power of&#xD;
      mortality [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, there have been very few studies that have examined the contribution of RRF to&#xD;
      outcome in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This is particularly unfortunate because HD patients&#xD;
      counts more than 90% of all dialysis population both in Israel and USA. A single study showed&#xD;
      that persistence of RRF significantly improved patients' outcome [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is well known that RRF deteriorates more rapidly in HD patients than in PD&#xD;
      patients [3]. Preservation of RRF remains an unresolved problem in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism of rapid loss of RRF on HD is not fully understood. Several experimental&#xD;
      and clinical studies showed that variety of vascular events and increased oxidative stress in&#xD;
      dialysis patients may be due to inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by ADMA (Asymmetric&#xD;
      Dimethylarginine ), known to be endogenous inhibitor of NO synthetase [4]. ADMA may be&#xD;
      significantly reduced by dialysis [5]. Metabolism of ADMA is primarily by the enzyme DDAH ,&#xD;
      which activity is decreased by inflammation, oxidative stress, diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current knowledge, treatment aimed at reducing oxidative stress should decrease ADMA&#xD;
      levels [6], and it is logical to suggest that such a therapy might help to preserve RRF in HD&#xD;
      patients. In our opinion, it is worth to check an ability of antioxidant therapy to produce a&#xD;
      favorable effect on RRF. One preliminary study on effect of antioxidant Vitamin E showed a&#xD;
      small beneficial effect on ADMA in chronic kidney disease [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an active antioxidant proved to be safe and beneficial in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patents [8]. In our recent study, NAC effectively reduced the ototoxic effect of&#xD;
      gentamicin in chronic hemodialysis patients [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of N-acetylsysteine on RRF in prevalent HD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Study population. The study will include 20 patients with ESRD, treated with chronic&#xD;
      hemo- dialysis in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded from the study if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with acute renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Currently treated with antioxidants ( NAC, vitamin E ets.) Study protocol. We planned&#xD;
           this study as a prospective cross-sectional study where every patient will serve as&#xD;
           his/her own control. Al the patients will continue their previous dialysis and drugs&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performance of baseline clinical and laboratory examination the patients will receive&#xD;
      orally NAC 1200 mg x 2/day for 2 weeks. At the end of this therapy, a follow up PET and Kt/V&#xD;
      examination will be performed. These baseline and follow up clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      examination will be performed at outpatient basis in our dialysis unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical monitoring of all the patients will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - at each of two visits. 2. Review of current medications&#xD;
      and doses. 3. Body weight - at each of two visits. 4. Dialysis adequacy: Kt/V 6. Residual&#xD;
      renal function examination: 24 hours urinary collection for urea and creatinine and&#xD;
      calculation of CCT and residual Kt/V both at baseline and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Biochemical studies: ADMA, DDAH, NO - both at baseline and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical&#xD;
      software SPSS-version 10. Parametric data will be expressed as means Â± standard deviation and&#xD;
      compared by the standard t-test. Non-parametric data will be compared using chi square test.&#xD;
      p value of 0.05 or less will be considered significant.&#xD;
