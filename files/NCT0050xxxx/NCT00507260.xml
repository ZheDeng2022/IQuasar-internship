      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To use the results from this pilot study to estimate the effect size of the nutritional&#xD;
      intervention on fatigue and caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To apply nutritional assessment tools for early detection of patients at risk for&#xD;
           malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the feasibility of conducting this intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe cancer-related fatigue patterns among BMT patients at multiple time points&#xD;
           during ambulatory visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effects of a nutritional intervention for post-allogeneic BMT recipients&#xD;
           on adequacy of caloric intake in order to improve cancer-related fatigue scores.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recipients of an allogeneic BMT often experience fatigue as a side effect due to several&#xD;
      factors, including high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy as well as stress from&#xD;
      everyday activities that increase fatigue. In addition, after transplantation, the patient's&#xD;
      ability to maintain regular nutritional needs (usually due to the unique diet that is&#xD;
      required to help increase marrow function) is affected, which further increases fatigue&#xD;
      levels. Researchers want to use information learned in this study to find out if nutritional&#xD;
      intervention can help decrease fatigue levels and increase caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating in this study involves routine visits to M. D. Anderson at the ambulatory&#xD;
      treatment center. Before you can start on this study, you will be asked about any allergies&#xD;
      you may have. You will also be asked some questions about your caregivers, such as how many&#xD;
      caregivers you have, whether your caregiver will be able to attend the nutrition class with&#xD;
      you, and whether the caregiver will record the food intake information. You will be asked&#xD;
      these questions to help the study researcher decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study. It should take about 30 minutes to collect this data. Your caregiver will be present&#xD;
      while this data is being collected. You will be asked to fill out questionnaires about your&#xD;
      medical history, personal demographics (such as your name, age, race, and gender), and&#xD;
      fatigue levels. These questionnaires should take about less than 1 hour to complete. The&#xD;
      study researcher will collect these questionnaires and put them in an envelope with a code ID&#xD;
      number on the front cover, instead of your name or other personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dietitian will then set-up an appointment (within 3 days after your first visit to the&#xD;
      ambulatory clinics) for a baseline test called indirect calorimetry. This test will be&#xD;
      performed in your treatment room in the ambulatory treatment clinic to find out how many&#xD;
      calories you need to have on a daily basis. For this test, you will be asked to sit quietly&#xD;
      in your treatment room and breathe through a mouth piece with a nose clip on your nose for 10&#xD;
      minutes. This test will use a machine to collect the air that you breathe in (inhalation) and&#xD;
      out (exhalation). The machine will use the information from your breathing to calculate how&#xD;
      many calories you will need to intake each day. This entire process should take about 1 hour&#xD;
      to complete. You will be given recommended levels of dietary caloric intake and your schedule&#xD;
      for study activities within the first week of enrolling in this study. After this test, you&#xD;
      will be randomized (as in the toss of a coin) to a group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 groups in this study. There will be about 6 participants in each group. If&#xD;
      you are found to be eligible and you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to&#xD;
      draw a sealed envelope from a bag, which will show which study group you will be in. You will&#xD;
      be allowed to draw only 1 envelope from the bag. You will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in 1 group will be given standard care (for the next 42 days) for allogeneic BMT&#xD;
      at the ambulatory center. Participants in the other group will be given standard care (for&#xD;
      the next 45 days) for allogeneic BMT at the ambulatory center as well as nutritional&#xD;
      assessment and intervention. If your envelope has a label that says &quot;standard,&quot; you will&#xD;
      receive standard care only. If your envelope has a label that says &quot;intervention,&quot; you will&#xD;
      receive standard care as well as nutritional assessment and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first week on this study, you and your caregiver will receive training from the&#xD;
      dietitian about putting information in a food record, which will include your name and the&#xD;
      amount and kind of food and drink you intake from the time you get out of bed to the time you&#xD;
      go to bed. On Days 7, 21, and 35 (Weeks 1, 3, and 5), the study researcher will remind you&#xD;
      and your caregiver to start this food record and give you the recording sheets. You have to&#xD;
      turn in 3 daily food records for the specified weeks. If you have some days off from the&#xD;
      ambulatory center visits during that week, the study researcher would like you to complete a&#xD;
      one-day food record on your day off as part of the 3 daily records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have a different caregiver on any one of the weeks, the dietitian will train the new&#xD;
      caregiver to record food and drinks on these days. The study researcher will collect the food&#xD;
      records and give you a fatigue questionnaire on Days 14, 28, and 42. It should take about 30&#xD;
      minutes to complete. If you are not scheduled for a clinic visit on these specified days, the&#xD;
      study researcher will meet with you on the first visit following these dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the standard care group, you will receive an indirect calorimetry test at the&#xD;
      beginning of study, and you will submit 3-day food records every 2 weeks. You will not&#xD;
      receive the results from these food records. Your health care provider may refer you to see a&#xD;
      dietitian at any time during this study as part of your standard care. If at any time your&#xD;
      caloric intake is considered to be 50% or less of your expected intake, your regular doctor&#xD;
      will be notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the intervention group, the results from these food records will be given to&#xD;
      you by a dietitian within 3 days after the collection of food records (Days 17, 31, and 45).&#xD;
      You will receive these results in person with a dietitian consultant. You will be able to&#xD;
      discuss any issues related to food intake (such as food choices, food options, problems&#xD;
      related to meal preparation, and how to increase calories or nutrients) so that you might be&#xD;
      able to bring up the caloric intake to good level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off this study if you develop a condition called gastrointestinal graft&#xD;
      versus host disease, major organ failure (such as heart, kidney, or liver), or any&#xD;
      intolerable side effects from the standard care treatment you are on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 12 patients will take part in this pilot study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
