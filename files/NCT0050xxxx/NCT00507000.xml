      Tuberculosis and vitamin D deficiency are important public health problems in India. Before&#xD;
      the advent of effective antitubercular therapy, patients with tuberculosis were advised&#xD;
      treatment and rest at sanatorium where sunshine was available in plenty. There have been&#xD;
      reports associating vitamin D deficiency with tuberculosis in terms of incidence and&#xD;
      beneficial response following addition of vitamin D to antitubercular therapy. Sputum AFB&#xD;
      conversion rate is higher in patients with tuberculosis supplemented with vitamin D. The&#xD;
      present study would systematically assess role of adjunct vitamin D therapy (cholecalciferol)&#xD;
      in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis and vitamin D deficiency are important public health problems in India. In&#xD;
      recently published studies from our center, up to 90% of the apparently healthy subjects in&#xD;
      Delhi were classified either as as vitamin D insufficient or deficient by using serum 25(OH)D&#xD;
      cut off levels of 20 ng/ml and 32 ng/ml respectively. Before the advent of effective&#xD;
      antitubercular therapy, patients with tuberculosis were advised treatment and rest at&#xD;
      sanatorium where sunshine was available in plenty. In the western literature, there have been&#xD;
      reports associating vitamin D deficiency with tuberculosis in terms of incidence and&#xD;
      beneficial response following addition of vitamin D to antitubercular therapy. A few pilot&#xD;
      studies have shown that sputum conversion rate is higher in patients with tuberculosis&#xD;
      supplemented with vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the above context the mechanisms linking vitamin D deficiency and its effect on&#xD;
      tuberculosis are currently under investigation. In order to understand the link two types of&#xD;
      studies have been conducted (a) clinical studies associating vitamin D deficiency and&#xD;
      tuberculosis and (b) in-vitro assessment of molecular immune changes related to vitamin D&#xD;
      exposure. With the currently available knowledge, the linkage between the two disorders is&#xD;
      being explained by the broad role of vitamin D deficiency in modulation of cell-mediated&#xD;
      immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with military tuberculosis are characterized by decreased levels of Th1 cytokines&#xD;
      and increased levels of IL-10 compared with the healthy infected and noninfected controls.&#xD;
      Current literature suggests that long-term control of M. tuberculosis infection is associated&#xD;
      with elevated Th1 responses and concomitant inhibition of the Th2 response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been shown to express vitamin D receptors. Incubation&#xD;
      of macro¬phages with physio¬logical concentration of 1,25 (OH)D [10-9M] results in inhibition&#xD;
      of intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, has&#xD;
      significant immunomodulatory effects leading to (a) shift in cytokine profile of T-helper&#xD;
      (Th1 to Th2) and (b) reduced antigen presentation, reduced production of Th1-promoting&#xD;
      cytokines, reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules in the antigen-presenting cell. In&#xD;
      addition, it was demonstrated that the addition of vitamin D3 derivatives inhibits the&#xD;
      differentiation of IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells while it augments the differentiation of&#xD;
      IL-4- or IL-10-producing Th2 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no systematic data from our country assessing association between vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency and tuberculosis and the possible role of vitamin D related modulation in the&#xD;
      tuberculosis specific cellular immune response. The present study has been planned with the&#xD;
      following hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and vitamin D deficiency when treated with&#xD;
      vitamin and antitubercular therapy are likely to show early sputum conversion and immune&#xD;
      response favoring resolution of tuberculosis&#xD;
