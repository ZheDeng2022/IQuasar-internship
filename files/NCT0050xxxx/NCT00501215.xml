  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine disorder that disrupts calcium metabolism&#xD;
      and has a broad range of clinical manifestations. With respect to the nonclassic, subjective&#xD;
      symptoms that have been reported to be associated with PHPT, such as sleep disturbance,&#xD;
      neurocognitive dysfunction, mood disturbance, fatigue, and decreased quality of life, there&#xD;
      is a lack of objective data on the extent to which these symptoms are affected by&#xD;
      parathyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been reports of improvements in sleep in patients following parathyroidectomy, but&#xD;
      these have been based solely on subjective sleep surveys. To date, there are no published&#xD;
      studies on objective sleep evaluations of patients with PHPT. The overall goals of this&#xD;
      protocol are to ascertain the feasibility of performing sleep studies on patients with PHPT,&#xD;
      and to obtain pilot data on the effects of parathyroidectomy on those sleep studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that it will be feasible to evaluate sleep parameters in patients with&#xD;
      PHPT in the M. D. Anderson Sleep Center. Towards testing this hypothesis, the specific aims&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of using nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) to&#xD;
      evaluate the primary outcome measure of total sleep time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of using nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) to&#xD;
      evaluate the secondary outcome measures of sleep architecture, arousal index, sleep&#xD;
      efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep onset latency in patients with PHPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To assess the feasibility of evaluating the secondary outcome measures of&#xD;
      subjective sleepiness as tested with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and of sleep quality&#xD;
      as tested with the Brief Sleep Disturbance Scale (BSDS) in patients with PHPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To assess the feasibility using a randomized &quot;wait-list&quot;-control design to&#xD;
      assess the effects of parathyroidectomy on sleep measures obtained with nocturnal PSG.&#xD;

      Screening Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible to take part in this study, women who are able to have children must have a&#xD;
      negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and you agree to take part, you&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. There is an equal&#xD;
      chance that you will be assigned to either group. One group (the 'Surgical' Group) will&#xD;
      receive the parathyroid surgery and &quot;observation&quot; (the review of blood tests by the study&#xD;
      doctor) during the course of the study. The other group (the 'Observation' Group) will&#xD;
      receive observation alone, and then surgery after their study participation ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have 2 overnight sleep tests (called &quot;polysomnograms&quot; -- PSGs) and a&#xD;
      telephone interview on sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Surgical Group will have their first PSG, and then 1-3 weeks later their surgery and a&#xD;
      telephone interview will be performed. (For the surgery, a separate informed consent form&#xD;
      will be signed that will describe the procedure in detail.) About 6-8 weeks after surgery, a&#xD;
      second PSG will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Observation Group will have their first PSG, and then a telephone interview 1-3 weeks&#xD;
      later. At 6-8 weeks after the interview, a second PSG will be performed. The Observation&#xD;
      Group participants will be offered to have their parathyroid surgery soon after they complete&#xD;
      their second PSG (after their 7-11 week participation in this study is over).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the telephone interview, a research staff member will call you at home to ask you to&#xD;
      discuss 6 questions about the quality of your sleep. It should take about 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PSG is a standard test for evaluating sleep. However, patients with PHPT do not routinely&#xD;
      receive PSGs as part of their standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSGs use many measurements made while the participant is asleep. Sensors on the body record&#xD;
      information about a person's sleep stages, body position, blood oxygen levels, breathing,&#xD;
      muscle tone, heart rate, snoring, and general sleep behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors will be placed on your scalp and face in order to measure&#xD;
      what 'stage' of sleep you are in. Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors will be placed on your&#xD;
      chest to monitor your heartbeat. A small probe will rest just inside your nostrils in order&#xD;
      to measure your breathing and airflow. A snoring sensor will be taped on your neck. Elastic&#xD;
      straps will be placed around your chest and abdomen (midsection), which will measure your&#xD;
      breathing effort. Sensors will be placed on both of your shins in order to measure your leg&#xD;
      movements. A sensor will be taped onto your fingertip in order to measure your blood oxygen&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audio and video recordings will be made of your sleep in order to monitor your body positions&#xD;
      and to record any sleep disturbances and/or restless movements that may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both of the PSGs, you will arrive at the M. D. Anderson Sleep Center at about 7:30 p.m.&#xD;
      You will complete a questionnaire about your sleep the night before and your activities&#xD;
      during that day. You will also complete a questionnaire that asks about any 'dozing off'&#xD;
      habits you may have. It should take about 10-15 minutes to complete the 2 questionnaires. You&#xD;
      will be taken to a sleep room, which will be quiet and darkened. A registered PSG&#xD;
      technologist will place the sensors on your body. You will be allowed to sleep until your&#xD;
      usual wake-up time, as noted on your sleep diary. Soon after you wake up, the sensors will be&#xD;
      removed. You will complete a third questionnaire about your night's sleep. This last&#xD;
      questionnaire should take about 5-10 minutes to complete. You will be able to leave shortly&#xD;
      after completing the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you normal sleep during the day, the study staff will arrange the sleep study to happen&#xD;
      around your usual sleeping and waking times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Diaries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 7 days before each PSG, you will complete a sleep diary. In the diary, you will&#xD;
      record information about the quality and amount of your sleep. You will bring the sleep diary&#xD;
      to the Sleep Center on the days of your PSGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 4 teaspoons each time) will be drawn earlier in the day of your PSG, before you&#xD;
      have the PSG performed. This blood will be used to measure certain biomarkers that will be&#xD;
      compared with the results of your PSGs and questionnaires. These biomarkers include the&#xD;
      levels of calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Crossover to Surgical Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Observation Group and your blood tests show very high calcium levels, you&#xD;
      will be offered parathyroid surgery as soon as reasonably possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, if you are in the Observation Group and you start experiencing worsening symptoms that&#xD;
      may mean kidney stones (such as abdominal pain and/or blood in the urine) or inflammation of&#xD;
      the pancreas (such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and/or chills), your condition&#xD;
      will be evaluated and treated. You will then be offered parathyroid surgery as soon as&#xD;
      reasonably possible. At 6-8 weeks after your parathyroid surgery, you will have your second&#xD;
      PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Test Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be able to receive a copy of your PSG results. If the results show any sleep&#xD;
      disorders and/or other medical disorders, you will referred for standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the PSG will not affect your PHPT treatment in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your second PSG, your participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Using PSGs for this purpose in patients with PHPT is&#xD;
      considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 12 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
