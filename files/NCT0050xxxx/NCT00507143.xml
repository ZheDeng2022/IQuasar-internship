  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From 100 colorectal cancer patients being treated with FOLFIRI regimen or any kind of&#xD;
      irinotecan containing regimen, blood samples for irinotecan and its metabolites levels and&#xD;
      genotypes related with its metabolism will be collected. The association of their levels and&#xD;
      genotypes and treatment effects will be evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the genotype-PD association, 50 colorectal cancer patients treated with FOLFIRI will be&#xD;
      enrolled and studied. 50 additional colorectal patients treated with any kind of irinotecan&#xD;
      containing regimen will be enrolled and including the 50 patients for the genotype-PD&#xD;
      association, a total of 100 patients will be evaluated for the genotype-PK association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected from patients with colorectal cancer during&#xD;
      1st treatment cycle of irinotecan and 2nd, 3rd infusion. During the 1st treatment cycle,&#xD;
      blood will be drawn 0 h (before irinotecan infusion), 0.75 h, 1.5 h and each at time ranges&#xD;
      of 2~8 h, 8~16 h, 24~32h and 48~52 hours after the start of irinotecan infusion over 90 min&#xD;
      and additional blood will be collected 48~52 hours after the respective 2nd and 3rd infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 50 colorectal cancer patient treated with FOLFIRI regimen, responses to the treatment&#xD;
      will be assessed every 3 cycles. All assessments will be repeated at the end of trial&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RECIST criteria for measurable disease will be followed and toxicity will be evaluated&#xD;
      according to NCI common toxicity criteria version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to disease progression will be calculated from the date of study entry to the first&#xD;
      objective documentation of progressive disease. Response duration will be measured from the&#xD;
      date a patient first fulfills the CR or PR criteria to the first date of objective&#xD;
      documentation of disease progression.&#xD;
