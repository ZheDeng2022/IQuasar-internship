    <textblock>
      This study will determine the prevalence of endocrine-related side effects in children who&#xD;
      have been treated for cancer and establish a database and registry organized according to&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis, treatments and endocrine side effects. In children, the endocrine system,&#xD;
      which includes glands and hormones that help to control metabolism, growth, development and&#xD;
      reproduction, is particularly vulnerable to long-term side effects associated with cancer and&#xD;
      its treatments. The study will also serve to help train medical fellows, residents and&#xD;
      students in identifying and managing endocrine abnormalities in children who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with and treated for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 2 and 24 years of age who have been treated for a childhood cancer and have&#xD;
      been disease-free for at least 1 year may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of cancer treatment record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for DNA studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and body measurements (height, weight, waist, body proportions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of child health questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individualized screening and counseling program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of the following endocrine systems: growth, pituitary and hypothalamic function,&#xD;
           thyroid function, ovary and testicular function, bone health, risk of obesity and&#xD;
           diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following additional studies may be done, as clinically indicated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid, testicular or ovarian ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to measure bone density&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wrist x-ray to measure bone age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine pregnancy test for girls who are old enough to have menstrual periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulation testing (tests that involve giving medicine by mouth or in the vein and then&#xD;
           measuring blood levels of substances afterwards, such as oral glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
           arginine-clonidine growth hormone stimulation test, ACTH stimulation test, and&#xD;
           gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with endocrine abnormalities are offered standard treatments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endocrine dysfunction is increasingly recognized as one of the most important aspects of&#xD;
      quality of life issues, physical and psychosocial development and overall prognosis in&#xD;
      pediatric patients diagnosed with neoplasms as well as in patients s/p bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      throughout their lifespan. In addition, several of the new, molecularly designed therapies&#xD;
      for neoplasms may interact with endocrine signaling; these include receptors and/or their&#xD;
      ligands for growth and/or proliferation factors, and disruptors of steroid hormone&#xD;
      interactions. The present study serves as a natural history protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a natural history, this protocol allows our Institute to care for pediatric and adult&#xD;
      patients with endocrine related complications associated with prior cancer therapy and/or&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for the purposes of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training our fellows, residents and students in the identification and management of&#xD;
      endocrine abnormalities developing in patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for&#xD;
      neoplasms and/or who have received HSCT at the NIH-Clinical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of endocrine side effects&#xD;
      related to cancer therapy and/or HSCT: this protocol will eventually lead to new, separate&#xD;
      protocols that will address specific aspects of endocrinopathies in childhood cancer&#xD;
      survivors and HSCT survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will serve as the basis for outpatient clinics that will function within the&#xD;
      context of the pediatric and adult endocrine outpatient clinics: every eligible patient&#xD;
      referred to the endocrine service from the NCI, NHLBI, and other NIH institutions and centers&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study, which for the first time will create an endocrine database&#xD;
      for these patients. As stated in our aims above, it is our hope that the present&#xD;
      investigation will serve as an incubator of further research-focused studies with the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of improving the life of children and adults who have been cured of their&#xD;
      underlying neoplasms as well as those individuals who are recipients of an HSCT.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of diagnosis of malignancy or HSCT and completion of therapy prior to entering&#xD;
             the study. Eligible patients must be free of their underlying malignancy for at least&#xD;
             one year prior to entering the study, as confirmed by records from the referring&#xD;
             oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will request permission to administer the Child Health Questionnaires (PF 50 and&#xD;
             CF87) to all patients who are enrolled in this protocol. This instrument has been&#xD;
             validated for use in children ages five and older. Children 10 years and older will&#xD;
             complete the child version. The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) has been normed in a&#xD;
             representative sample in the US, and is being used in large population studies in&#xD;
             Australia, Ireland, and the UK. Additionally, it has been rigorously translated into a&#xD;
             number of languages using international guidelines including American-Spanish,&#xD;
             Canadian-French, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Greek, Honduran-Spanish,&#xD;
             Mexican-Spanish, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish. For this study will purchase the&#xD;
             CHQ in American- Spanish in order to include Spanish-speaking subjects in this part of&#xD;
             the study. The costs to purchase the CHQ in numerous languages would be prohibitive&#xD;
             for this pilot study. However, if a significant number of subjects in a specific&#xD;
             language are recruited, we will consider the purchase of the CHQ for that group of&#xD;
             subjects.&#xD;
