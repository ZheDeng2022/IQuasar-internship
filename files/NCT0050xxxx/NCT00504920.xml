      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess the self-reported symptoms and the plasma cytokine levels of AML/MDS patients&#xD;
      pretransplantation and posttransplantation with allogeneic blood and marrow in order to&#xD;
      identify changes in symptoms (or symptom clusters) and changes in cytokines that may be&#xD;
      related to the conditioning regimen and/or to the development of GVHD during the 100 days&#xD;
      posttransplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current literature, both animal and human research, in this study we hypothesize&#xD;
      that increases in TNF alpha to be associated with poor appetite, sleep disturbance and&#xD;
      fatigue, but not with increases in pain, depression and numbness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One of the ways to learn about the symptoms of blood and/or bone marrow transplantation is by&#xD;
      looking at how certain proteins called cytokines (found in the blood) change during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the transplantation, you will be asked to complete several questionnaires during a&#xD;
      visit to the bone marrow clinic at M. D. Anderson. These questionnaires measure physical and&#xD;
      emotional symptoms. The questionnaires should take about 30 minutes to complete. During this&#xD;
      visit, the research nurse will teach you how to use the telephone system for measuring&#xD;
      symptoms. You will tell the system the most convenient times for the telephone calls. This&#xD;
      first assessment (questionnaires and learning the telephone system) should take about 90&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day you are admitted, or up to 10 days before your admission for your transplant, you&#xD;
      will have a sample of blood drawn (around 2½ tablespoons) . The sample of blood will be used&#xD;
      to measure levels of cytokines in your blood before the transplant procedure. You will also&#xD;
      have blood drawn about three days postadmission, on the day of transplant, 1 day after&#xD;
      transplant, 3 days, 8 days, 15 days, 22 days, and 29 days posttransplant. One blood sample&#xD;
      will be taken between 50 - 60 days posttransplant and one sample between 80 - 100 days after&#xD;
      transplant. If you develop Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), cytokine samples will be&#xD;
      assessed within 24 hours of GVHD diagnosis, then 3 days, 5 days, 10 days and 15 days after&#xD;
      GVHD diagnosis. Around 2½ tablespoons of blood will be collected each time. These samples of&#xD;
      blood will be used to measure the levels of cytokines in your blood after the transplant&#xD;
      procedure. These cytokines may be related to symptoms experienced after the transplant&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research nurse will come to your room and collect information about your symptoms 2 times&#xD;
      a week while you are in the hospital or until you are able to use the IVR system. Once you&#xD;
      return to your home, the automated telephone system will call you once a week to ask you to&#xD;
      rate your symptoms and how much the symptoms interfere in your daily life. It should take&#xD;
      around 5 minutes to complete each automated phone symptom assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected by these calls is only being used for this research study. At the&#xD;
      beginning of each IVR telephone call, you will be reminded to report any symptom/s you are&#xD;
      concerned about to your treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 40 participants will take part in this study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
