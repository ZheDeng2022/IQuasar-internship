  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive aspergillosis (IA), and particularly invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), is an&#xD;
      important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who are receiving chemotherapy for&#xD;
      acute leukemia (AL), being the the most common invasive mycosis which develops in these&#xD;
      patients. Proven invasive aspergillosis has been reported in 6,5% of patients with acute&#xD;
      leukemia in a retrospective multicenter study (Pagano, Haematologica 2001) but that frequency&#xD;
      may be underestimated, since definite diagnosis is difficult to obtain, particularly in&#xD;
      leukemic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the recently developed, internationally recognized IFIGC/MSG/EORTC diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      were retrospectively applied to a consecutive series of acute leukemia patients, the overall&#xD;
      frequency of IPA was 25,3% (proven/probable 8,5%; possible 16,9%). Criteria for a diagnosis&#xD;
      of IPA were fulfilled in 62,8% of pulmonary infiltrates developing in AL patients&#xD;
      (proven/probable 17,1%; possible 45,7%). IPA developed both in AML and in ALL patients.&#xD;
      Proven/probable IPA developed in 83% of cases during the first induction cycle (Borlenghi,&#xD;
      EHA 2003). It may be estimated that such figures would be higher when patients would be&#xD;
      followed prospectively and strictly monitored, particularly with GM antigenemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which common colonizing agents like Aspergillus spp. can become invasive&#xD;
      pathogens and cause severe tissue damage are only partially known. Recent experimental data&#xD;
      in animal models raised the hypothesis that the long pentraxin Ptx3 may play an important&#xD;
      role in resistance to selected microbial agents, in particular to Aspergillus fumigatus&#xD;
      (Garlanda, Nature 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caspofungin is an echinocandin with potent antifungal activity against Aspergillus species.&#xD;
      Its mechanism of action differs from that of the antifungal agents used so far, like&#xD;
      amphotericin and azoles. It has proven effective and well tolerated and its use is therefore&#xD;
      currently approved as salvage treatment in patients with invasive aspergillosis refractory to&#xD;
      amphotericin, as well as for the empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia. Indeed it has been&#xD;
      recently evaluated as empirical treatment in neutropenic patients with persistent fever of&#xD;
      unknown origin and proved equally effective and better tolerated than liposomal amphotericin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are as yet no data on the use of caspofungin as primary prophylaxis in patients with&#xD;
      acute leukaemia, a setting in which the lack of effective preventive treatments together with&#xD;
      the generally favourable safety profile and efficacy of caspofungin makes it particularly&#xD;
      attractive for investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be hypothesized from the above data that the administration of caspofungin as&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment of invasive aspergillosis should be safe and well tolerated by patient&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may reduce the high incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis which characteristically&#xD;
      develops during the first course of induction treatment, avoiding the direct morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of IPA and its negative impact on the treatment and prognosis of AL as well as the&#xD;
      costs for IPA diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serum levels of the long pentraxin Ptx3 may have interpatient variability and may&#xD;
      correlate with the subsequent development of invasive aspergillosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These facts led to the present multicenter, phase II, single arm, open study, performed by&#xD;
      the Northern Italy Leukemia Group. There will be approximately 12 participating centers,&#xD;
      which will enroll a total of 100 patients. Patients will receive caspofungin, starting from&#xD;
      the first day of induction chemotherapy for leukemia, as a single daily dose intravenously at&#xD;
      the dosage of 70 mg q.d. and followed by 50 mg q.d. thereafter until documentation of&#xD;
      complete hematologic remission after the first induction cycle or of leukemia persistence&#xD;
      after one cycle of induction and one cycle of salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No stratification is planned. Patients will concurrently receive all the medications needed&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute leukemia,according to the ongoing protocols of NILG for acute&#xD;
      leukemia at diagnosis. The study period continues&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be stopped in the presence of any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of a severe adverse event or of any grade 3-4 toxicity attributable to&#xD;
           caspofungin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of proven/probable IPA No caspofungin dose reduction is planned. The dose of&#xD;
           caspofungin will be adjusted when patients weight is over 80 kgs and in patients taking&#xD;
           rifampin or other liver enzymes-inducing drugs.&#xD;
