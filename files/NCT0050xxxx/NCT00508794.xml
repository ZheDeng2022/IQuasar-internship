      In this study researchers will examine the initial efficacy of implementing a yoga program&#xD;
      for patients with breast cancer as an adjuvant to their radiotherapy. Patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy will be randomly assigned to either a yoga group (YG),&#xD;
      or a stretching (ST) control group, or a waitlist control (WL) group. Participants in YG and&#xD;
      ST groups will attend three sessions each week throughout their 6-week radiotherapy schedule.&#xD;
      The sessions will be coordinated with the treatment schedule and conducted adjacent to the&#xD;
      treatment facility. Measures will be obtained prior to randomization, a brief assessment&#xD;
      during the middle of radiation therapy, during the last week of radiation therapy, and 1, 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after the last radiation session. With the inclusion of two control groups in&#xD;
      this randomized trial researchers will attempt to validate the benefits of yoga as an&#xD;
      adjuvant to radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer wherein researchers will control for&#xD;
      specific components of the yoga program and also examine some of the mechanisms that are&#xD;
      necessary for the program to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims in the proposed study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct an initial evaluation of whether participation in the yoga program improves&#xD;
           patients' fatigue and sleep disturbances. Fatigue and sleep will be assessed with&#xD;
           self-report measures and the use of actigraphy for a more objective measure of sleep&#xD;
           quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary end points will include examining QOL, mental health and objective&#xD;
           physiological outcomes (blood samples for immune measures, saliva samples for cortisol&#xD;
           levels, and heart rate variability).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory analyses will examine some plausible mediators of the yoga program including&#xD;
           cognitive processing, spirituality, and finding meaning in the cancer experience.&#xD;

      If you choose to take part in this study, you will come to M. D. Anderson for your first&#xD;
      visit. If this is not convenient, a researcher can visit you at your home. At this time, you&#xD;
      will be asked to complete several questionnaires. The questions will ask about your sleeping&#xD;
      habits, how you have been feeling, and your general QOL. This will take about 45-60 minutes&#xD;
      to complete. Researchers, will then ask you to complete a daily sleep diary for the next 7&#xD;
      days. During this time, you will be given an actigraph watch to wear that will collect data&#xD;
      about your day-time activity and sleeping habits. The watch should be worn 24 hours a day for&#xD;
      7 days a week. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test to measure the electrical&#xD;
      activity of your heart) and your breathing rate will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your first visit to M. D. Anderson or after a researcher has visited you at home, you&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the first group will take part in a yoga program. If you are assigned to the&#xD;
      yoga group, you will take part in 3 sessions of yoga each week for 6 weeks. You may take part&#xD;
      in the yoga sessions any 3 days of the week. Each yoga session will last around 60 minutes.&#xD;
      During the yoga sessions, you will also be asked to do breathing exercises and to perform&#xD;
      different movements and meditation. None of the movements are difficult. You will be able to&#xD;
      follow this program at your own pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the second group will take part in a stretching program. If you are assigned&#xD;
      to the stretching group, you will take part in 3 sessions of stretching each week for 6&#xD;
      weeks. You may take part in the stretching sessions any 3 days of the week. Each stretching&#xD;
      session will last around 60 minutes. During these stretching sessions you will be asked to do&#xD;
      simple stretching exercises. None of the movements are difficult. You will be able to follow&#xD;
      this program at your own pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning with the second week, participants in the first and second groups will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a brief questionnaire, about the yoga or stretching program, before the first class&#xD;
      each week. The questionnaire will take about 1 to 2 minutes to complete. You will also have&#xD;
      an ECG and your breathing rate will be measured before and after one of the classes during&#xD;
      the third or fourth week and again during the last week. Each stretching and yoga session&#xD;
      will be audio and video taped for the purpose of quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the third group will not take part in the yoga or stretching program during&#xD;
      this study. However, if you are assigned to this group, you will be given the option of&#xD;
      participating in the yoga or stretching program after the study has ended. This will be after&#xD;
      you have finished your last assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete a brief questionnaire during the middle of radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will evaluate your treatment-related symptoms and will take about 15 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last week of radiotherapy, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of radiation&#xD;
      treatment, all participants will be asked to fill out a packet of questionnaires (similar to&#xD;
      those taken at the first visit). It should take about 45 minutes to complete all of the&#xD;
      questionnaires. If it is not convenient for you to come to M. D. Anderson, a researcher can&#xD;
      visit you at home to help with the questionnaires. You will then be asked to complete another&#xD;
      daily sleep diary for another 7 days. During this time, you will wear an actigraph watch 24&#xD;
      hours a day for 7 days a week to collect the same data as before. During this time, you will&#xD;
      have an ECG and your breathing rate will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to refrain from participating in any other yoga classes for&#xD;
      the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after your 6-month assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 180 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
