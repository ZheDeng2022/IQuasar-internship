    <textblock>
      This study examined the benefit of continued treatment with an antidepressant medication,&#xD;
      sertraline, in adolescents with depression who improved on sertraline acutely. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that adolescents who remained on sertraline long term were less likely to have a recurrence&#xD;
      of depression compared to those on placebo.&#xD;

      This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial of maintenance treatment of&#xD;
      sertraline in adolescents aged 13-19 with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Subjects aged 13-19 were recruited, over 18 months, at mood disorders clinics in 3&#xD;
      tertiary care centres across Canada. Informed consent was obtained from eligible and&#xD;
      interested subjects and parents (if subject &lt;16 years of age). Subjects were eligible for&#xD;
      entry into the study if they had a diagnosis of Major Depression determined from both&#xD;
      clinical interview and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for Children&#xD;
      (K-SAD-PL) and scored &gt; 16 on the first 17 items of the 29-item Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Depression (HAM-D). Subjects were excluded if they had past or current hypomanic or manic&#xD;
      episode, current psychotic symptoms, substance dependence in the last 3 months, significant&#xD;
      medical condition that would contra-indicate the use of antidepressants or that if untreated&#xD;
      may require medical attention, pregnancy, or past treatment with sertraline for major&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Procedures There were 3 phase to the study: 1) a 12-week acute phase, 2) a&#xD;
      24-week continuation phase, and 3) a 52-week maintenance phase. In general, subjects were&#xD;
      assessed every 2 weeks throughout the study except during the first 4 weeks of the&#xD;
      maintenance phase when they were seen or contacted weekly. In the continuation and&#xD;
      maintenance phases, every 2nd visit was conducted in person while the other assessments could&#xD;
      be conducted either by telephone or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial sertraline dose during the acute phase was either 25 mg or 50 mg daily with increases&#xD;
      of 25 to 50 mg every 2 weeks at the treating clinicians' discretion, up to a maximum of 200&#xD;
      mg daily. For responders who entered the continuation phase and had some re-emergence of&#xD;
      symptoms without relapse, dose increases with sertraline were permitted every 2 weeks to a&#xD;
      maximum dose of 200 mg daily but only during the first 8 weeks of the continuation phase. If&#xD;
      a subject experienced side effects, one dose decrease was permitted in the first 8 weeks of&#xD;
      the continuation phase. Subjects who maintained response during continuation were then&#xD;
      randomized to continue sertraline or to take placebo. In the placebo group, sertraline was&#xD;
      tapered by 25% of the initial dose every week for the first 4 weeks of the maintenance phase.&#xD;
      During the maintenance phase, no treatment changes were permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who responded to acute phase treatment, defined as 2 consecutive HAMD &lt; 9 and&#xD;
      greater than a 50% reduction in HAM-D score within 12 weeks, were offered entry into the&#xD;
      continuation phase. Inter-rater reliability for the HAM-D was tested annually with site&#xD;
      project coordinators and research assistants. Further training and evaluation were&#xD;
      implemented until the inter-rater reliability was 0.8 or greater. Relapse during the&#xD;
      continuation and recurrence during maintenance phases were determined according to the&#xD;
      clinical judgement of the treating physician that the major depression had recurred or an&#xD;
      intervention beyond what was permitted by the study protocol was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events were collected using the Common Adverse and Side Effects Scale. The scale was&#xD;
      administered every 2 weeks during the acute phase and every 4 weeks during the continuation&#xD;
      and maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Randomization Randomization was conducted by the study pharmacist using a&#xD;
      computer generated randomization schedule. Subjects, clinicians and research staff remained&#xD;
      blinded to treatment during the randomization phase. All statistical analyses were conducted&#xD;
      by an independent statistician blinded to patient allocation.&#xD;
