    <textblock>
      The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has awarded cooperative agreements to 6&#xD;
      sites from across the country (Salt Lake City, UT, Molokai, HI, Houston, TX, Newark, NJ,&#xD;
      Detroit, MI, and Baltimore City) to participate in a national 4-year demonstration (September&#xD;
      15, 2006 to September 30, 2010). One goal of the demonstration is to reduce disparities in&#xD;
      cancer treatment among seniors from U.S. racial and ethnic minority populations. Each site&#xD;
      will focus on a specific racial/ethnic minority group, and collaborate with CMS in project&#xD;
      implementation. A Core questionnaire, the Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA) will be&#xD;
      administered at baseline to all participants in the demonstration. Participant&#xD;
      identification, randomization, and intervention implementation will be standardized across&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: The proposal developed by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Baltimore City Community Health Coalition is designed to address&#xD;
      persistent disparities in breast, cervix, colon/rectum, prostate and lung cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Conduct A CONTROL RANDOMIZED TRIAL within a randomized control&#xD;
      demonstration project (N = 200) to compare the efficacy of 2 interventions that differ in&#xD;
      intensity to improve continuity and outcomes of care among African Americans seniors. Among&#xD;
      African American seniors, compared to a less intensive intervention (general information and&#xD;
      educational materials), does the addition of facilitation services delivered by a health&#xD;
      coordinator result in a greater improvement in adherence to recommended treatment among those&#xD;
      diagnosed with breast, cervix, colon/rectum, prostate, or lung cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We will recruit African Americans, age 65 years or older, and currently&#xD;
      enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. (Baltimore City's 82,202 seniors represent 13% of its&#xD;
      population, and account for 68% of the City's cancer deaths. Among these seniors, 96% have&#xD;
      Medicare Parts A and B, 54.5% have income levels at less than 250% of the federal poverty&#xD;
      guideline, and 55.6% are African American.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of individuals diagnosed with breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, or&#xD;
      lung cancer. Eligible participants will respond to a baseline questionnaire, the Cancer&#xD;
      Screening Assessment (CSA). They will then be randomized to receive a less intensive or more&#xD;
      intensive intervention. The less intensive group will receive general information about&#xD;
      cancer and Medicare covered services and instructions to discuss the information with their&#xD;
      primary care doctor. The more intensive group will receive the same information as the less&#xD;
      intensive group receives, plus tailored facilitation services delivered by a nurse-supervised&#xD;
      community health worker. The primary outcome variable for the trial will be the difference&#xD;
      between randomized groups in adherence to treatment for breast, cervix, colon/rectum,&#xD;
      prostate and lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A community advisory committee will guide all aspects of the study and will include important&#xD;
      stake holders (both public and private sectors), representatives from the Baltimore City&#xD;
      Community Health Coalition, the Baltimore City Department of Health, the Maryland Department&#xD;
      of Health and Mental Hygiene, community leaders, consumers, health care providers&#xD;
      (physicians, oncologists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, social workers,&#xD;
      pathologists) and academicians.&#xD;

      Among African American seniors, compared to a less intensive intervention (general&#xD;
      information and educational materials), does the addition of facilitation services delivered&#xD;
      by a health coordinator result in a greater improvement in adherence to recommended treatment&#xD;
      among those diagnosed with breast, cervix, colon/rectum, prostate, or lung cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) received congressional&#xD;
      authorization to launch a nationwide demonstration project to address persistent disparities&#xD;
      in cancer treatment among racial and ethnic minority populations. Hopkins was selected as one&#xD;
      of six national sites to conduct a demonstration project designed to test an intervention&#xD;
      strategy to promote adherence to cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim This demonstration project will evaluate the efficacy of a health coordinator model. We&#xD;
      will conduct A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL testing the efficacy of the intervention for&#xD;
      African American seniors diagnosed with cancer. The duration of follow-up post-randomization&#xD;
      will be from date of randomization and September 30th, 2010, the end date for the&#xD;
      demonstration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will compare the efficacy of a less intensive intervention&#xD;
      (general information and educational materials in the context of &quot;usual care&quot;) to that of a&#xD;
      more intensive intervention, the addition of a health coordinator (HC), in promoting&#xD;
      adherence to treatment among African American seniors who have been diagnosed with breast,&#xD;
      cervix, colon/rectum, prostate or lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable for the trial will be the difference between the two&#xD;
      intervention groups in the time to initiation of therapy, beginning on the date of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The study population will consist of a convenience sample of 200 individuals&#xD;
      diagnosed with breast, cervix, colon, lung or prostate cancer, and who intend to receive&#xD;
      their cancer treatment from either Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) or from Johns Hopkins Bayview&#xD;
      Medical Center (JHBMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling frame will be restricted to African American Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and&#xD;
      older, enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, but not enrolled in managed care (Medicare Part&#xD;
      C), hospice, or some other extended care facility. With a population of 651,154, African&#xD;
      Americans constitute 64% of Baltimore City's total population44. Additionally, 13.2% of&#xD;
      Baltimoreans are age 65 or older, and this accounts for 68% of the City's cancer deaths.&#xD;
