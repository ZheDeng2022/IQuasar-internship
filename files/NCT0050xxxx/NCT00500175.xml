  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than half of all lower extremity amputations are in persons with diabetes. These&#xD;
      patients suffer from severe, diabetes-induced, peripheral, sensory neuropathy and, thus they&#xD;
      frequently do not protect their feet from repetitive shear stress or traumatic episodes and&#xD;
      ulceration often ensues. We have previously shown that the temperature profile of the plantar&#xD;
      aspects of the foot provides a reliable warning of tissue injury and can be effectively used&#xD;
      as a preventive modality. In this study we propose to further develop and clinically test a&#xD;
      novel infrared-based temperature instrument (TempTouchRMÂ®) that is intended for home use by&#xD;
      high-risk diabetic patients. This step-on remote monitoring device will serve as an early&#xD;
      warning system for impending ulcers and Charcot fractures. The study's central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the TempTouchRM device will reduce the incidence of ulcers by providing an accurate,&#xD;
      simple, and effective approach to monitor changes in foot temperatures.&#xD;

      The study's central hypothesis is that the TempTouchRM device will reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      ulcers by providing an accurate, simple, and effective approach to monitor changes in foot&#xD;
      temperatures. To study this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To develop, validate and implement software and protocols for the following: (i) data&#xD;
      acquisition and processing, and (ii) the physician-TempTouchRM communications interface. A&#xD;
      state-of-the-art web interface will be developed to allow clinicians to view the stored data&#xD;
      for their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the TempTouchRM in reducing the incidence of diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcers among high-risk patients. Our hypothesis is that patients monitored with the&#xD;
      TempTouchRM will have fewer foot ulcers and that the ulcers will be less severe. The 110&#xD;
      patient study will comprise two treatment arms: the standard therapy group and the enhanced&#xD;
      therapy group The latter will receive standard care plus infrared temperature monitoring&#xD;
      using the TempTouchRM daily for 12 months. Elevated temperatures will provide information to&#xD;
      the physician that prevention practices should be initiated, such as off-loading, skin care,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the normal range of temperature variations for each individual foot for&#xD;
      patients in the Enhanced Therapy and to correlate deviations from this range to the incidence&#xD;
      of ulcers. Our previous studies have used the contralateral foot as the control to detect&#xD;
      abnormal temperatures. We will investigate the hypothesis that with proper trending of normal&#xD;
      foot temperatures, the individual foot can serve as its own control for predicting ulcers.&#xD;
