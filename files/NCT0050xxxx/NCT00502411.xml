    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of radiation therapy&#xD;
      plus low dose doxorubicin chemotherapy given after surgery is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      sarcoma. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin is a drug that is commonly used to treat certain kinds of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation treatment and chemotherapy will start around 4-6 weeks after surgery. During&#xD;
      the study, you will receive radiation treatments 5 days a week for 6 - 61/2 weeks. On Day 1&#xD;
      of each week of radiation therapy, you will be given doxorubicin through a continuous&#xD;
      injection into a vein for 4 days in a row. A special tube is placed into a large vein in the&#xD;
      neck or chest region or through a large vein in the arm. This is called a central venous&#xD;
      line. A small pump is then used to give the drug. This pump is about the size of a pack of&#xD;
      cigarettes. You will receive appropriate instructions for the maintenance of the pump. The&#xD;
      doxorubicin and radiotherapy will be given on an outpatient basis at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
      radiation therapy may be stopped and you may be taken off the study. At that time, your&#xD;
      doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of each week of treatment, you will have a physical exam and blood tests&#xD;
      (around 2 tablespoons). You will also have a MRI to check on the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study, you will have follow-up visits at M. D. Anderson every 3-4 months for the&#xD;
      first 2 years after the study then every 6 months for the next 3 years. After that you will&#xD;
      have follow-up visits once a year for the rest of your life to check on the status of the&#xD;
      disease. At every follow-up visit you will have ultrasound scans. You will have a MRI at the&#xD;
      first follow-up visit then only when the doctor feels it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Doxorubicin is FDA approved and is commercially available.&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients with cytological or histological proof of large (&gt; 5 cm), completely&#xD;
             resected soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk (AJCC Stage IB, IIA, IIC, and&#xD;
             III) will be eligible. Patients with stage IV sarcoma who are considered for primary&#xD;
             tumor treatment with surgery and postoperative radiation are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have undergone pre-referral surgical resection or excisional biopsy with&#xD;
             no measurable residual disease on appropriate radiological imaging will be eligible.&#xD;
             The adequacy of the surgical resection will be evaluated at MDACC and re-excision will&#xD;
             be performed as necessary. Negative surgical resection margins are desirable; positive&#xD;
             margins, however, are allowable if re-excision would result in functional deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients may have received prior doxorubicin-based systemic chemotherapy up to a total&#xD;
             doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2. Inclusion of patients with a prior history of&#xD;
             malignancy will be at the discretion of the Study Chairman.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have a Karnofsky P.S. of &gt; 70 or a Zubrod P.S. of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Absolute neutrophil count must be &gt; 1,500 cells/mm; platelet count &gt; 100,000&#xD;
             platelets/ml; serum creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dl, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase&#xD;
             (SGOT)/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &lt; 3 x normal, total bilirubin &lt;&#xD;
             1.5 mg/dl. For patients with cumulative doxorubicin 400 - 450 mg/m2, EF &gt; 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. EKG (within 6 weeks of the planned start of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) (if prior doxorubicin&#xD;
             treatment or history of either myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have no uncontrolled co-existing medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast feeding and must&#xD;
             practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. All patients must sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) Patients with a history of prior radiotherapy in the area of the primary tumor or those&#xD;
        in whom the anticipated radiation field would include the perineum, scrotum, or vaginal&#xD;
        introitus will not be eligible.&#xD;
