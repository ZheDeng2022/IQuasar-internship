      This study proposes a prospective randomized study of elders undergoing elective major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery to assess recovery following a unique anesthetic regimen incorporating a&#xD;
      adrenergic receptor antagonist. The purposes of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine if using atenolol, a beta-blocker drug commonly used to treat high blood&#xD;
           pressure and heart disease, as part of your anesthetic regimen will decrease&#xD;
           complications that sometimes occur in elderly patients who are undergoing surgery and&#xD;
           being given anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to see if it improves or quickens your recovery from anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to help investigators design better ways to administer anesthesia during surgery,&#xD;
           especially in elderly patients, so that the complications and the time to recover from&#xD;
           surgery and anesthesia can be decreased.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing numbers of aged patients with multiple chronic diseases are undergoing major&#xD;
      surgery. In the first third the last century, surgery was considered a desperate measure and&#xD;
      patients greater than 50 years of age were felt incapable of sustaining the rigors of an&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair. Advances in anesthesia during the last century have allowed surgeons&#xD;
      to develop an extraordinary array of procedures with excellent outcomes. Over 5.5 million&#xD;
      patients aged 60 and over had major procedures in 1994. Centenarians routinely undergo&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding the enthusiasm for surgical treatments, morbidity, mortality, and recovery&#xD;
      times for elderly patients are still substantially greater than for younger patients. Some&#xD;
      morbidities, such as postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction appear to predominantly&#xD;
      affect elderly patients. In a previous study, Dr. Valerie Lawrence, a co-investigator on this&#xD;
      proposal, demonstrated that recovery from major surgery, as measured by the ability to&#xD;
      accomplish standard activities of daily living, takes an average of 6 weeks while more&#xD;
      complicated instrumental activities of daily living take an average of 3 months to return to&#xD;
      baseline in elderly surgical patients. These data have profound implications for initiatives&#xD;
      to control length of hospital stay, utilization of resources and costs of care. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that family members are requiring extra time off work to care for family members&#xD;
      discharged earlier from hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published reports and our preliminary data support the notion that intraoperative&#xD;
      administration of adrenergic receptor antagonists (blockers) will improve functional recovery&#xD;
      following surgery under general anesthesia. There is value in targeting functional status for&#xD;
      elders undergoing surgery, because there is a direct relationship between functional status&#xD;
      and utilization of health resources. Maximizing postoperative recovery, as opposed to&#xD;
      minimizing morbidity and mortality, associated with surgical interventions in the elderly is&#xD;
      consistent with the goal of prolonging &quot;active life expectancy&quot; expounded by Healthy People&#xD;
      2002.&#xD;
