      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that children whose mothers are Migrant/Seasonal Farmworkers&#xD;
           (MSFs) (occupationally-exposed to pesticides) may be at a higher risk for exhibiting&#xD;
           mutagen-induced DNA damage than children whose mothers and fathers are not MSFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that MSF mothers (occupationally-exposed to pesticides) may be at&#xD;
           a higher risk for exhibiting mutagen-induced DNA damage than mothers who are not MSFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that both the extent of pesticide exposure and the type of&#xD;
           polymorphisms in chemical detoxification genes and DNA repair genes contribute to the&#xD;
           extent of cytogenetic damage found in children of MSF women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that both the extent of pesticide exposure and the type of&#xD;
           polymorphisms in chemical detoxification genes and DNA repair genes contribute to the&#xD;
           extent of cytogenetic damage found in MSF mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the hypothesis that the total concentration levels of organochlorine (OCP) and&#xD;
           organophosphate (OP) pesticides will correlate with the mutagenic potency of the serum&#xD;
           and urine of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the hypothesis that the total concentration levels of OCP and OP pesticides will&#xD;
           correlate with the mutagenic potency of the serum and urine of the mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To test the hypothesis that inherited polymorphisms in the PON1 gene and its expression&#xD;
           modulate the risk for OP genotoxicity measured by the inhibition of the&#xD;
           acetylcholinesterase enzyme in MSF children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To test the hypothesis that inherited polymorphisms in the PON1 gene and its expression&#xD;
           modulate the risk for OP genotoxicity measured by the inhibition of the&#xD;
           acetylcholinesterase enzyme in MSF mothers.&#xD;

      Participants in this study are either MSF children and their mothers or non-MSF women (women&#xD;
      who have never worked in agriculture) and their children. If a mother has more than one child&#xD;
      in the school system, only one child can participate in the study. A major effort of this&#xD;
      study is to collect, store and analyze blood and urine samples from MSF women children and a&#xD;
      group of non-MSF women and children. Only the MSF children will be matched by ethnicity, sex,&#xD;
      age (2 or more years), and place of residence to non-MSF children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mothers and children participants will be recruited from the school rosters of the Goose&#xD;
      Creek Consolidated Independent School District in Harris County, and the La Joya School&#xD;
      District in Hidalgo County. The names and addresses of all the children and their mothers are&#xD;
      also included in the rosters. Each mother will be contacted by a telephone call or letter&#xD;
      inviting her and her child to participate in the study. If they agree, they will then be&#xD;
      asked if they would like to complete the interview by telephone with the interviewer from M.&#xD;
      D. Anderson or prefer to do the interview at the on-site visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bilingual interviewer will ask each child's mother if she and her child would like to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The interviewer will ask each participating mother about her and&#xD;
      her child's age, child's gender, her and her child's exposure to chemicals, medical history,&#xD;
      places they have lived, places she has worked, family history of disease, reproductive and&#xD;
      breast feeding histories, diet, alcohol and tobacco use. The interview will take from 60 to&#xD;
      70 minutes to complete the mother's and the child participants' questionnaires. All&#xD;
      interviews will be completed by telephone or on-site in the language of choice (English or&#xD;
      Spanish).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) members of the research team will collect the blood and urine samples, and transport&#xD;
      them to M. D. Anderson since an overnight carrier is not available on the required days of&#xD;
      collection. About 5 teaspoons of blood will be drawn and a urine sample will be collected. In&#xD;
      addition, the height and weight of the mothers and the children will be measured. All blood&#xD;
      and urine collected will be used only by the researchers involved in this study. If the&#xD;
      child's mother agrees, the type(s) and levels of the pesticides detected will be provided to&#xD;
      the child's physician for diagnostic purposes only. The data will be analyzed in a way that&#xD;
      will help maintain confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. A total of 400 children participants and their mothers&#xD;
      (N=400) will take part in this study. All 800 participants will be enrolled at UT MD Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center.&#xD;
