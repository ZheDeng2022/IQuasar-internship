  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if stereotactic spine radiotherapy is&#xD;
      safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic spine tumors. The feasibility of this type&#xD;
      of treatment will be studied as will any side effects related to the treatment. The precision&#xD;
      and accuracy of the CT-on-rails will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT-On-Rails or Trilogy is a system that places the radiation treatment machine in the same&#xD;
      room as the CT scanner so that the CT scanner can help deliver radiation more precisely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a MRI of the spine within 1 month of registration on this study. You will also&#xD;
      fill out a health survey (5 minutes), a symptom inventory ( 5 minutes), and a Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (5 minutes) within 1 week of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pretreatment feasibility study will first be performed to determine the precision,&#xD;
      accuracy, and reproducibility with which the target volume and critical normal structures&#xD;
      (e.g. spinal cord) can be positioned relative to the radiation beams for spine tumors; this&#xD;
      will consist of a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a CT-simulation. The simulation is like a CT scan where a special body&#xD;
      frame is used to keep the patient from moving during scanning and later treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked questions about your medical history and have a complete neurological exam&#xD;
      during your first consultation. The neurological exam involves testing upper and lower motor&#xD;
      strength, sensation to light touch, reflexes, mental exam, and way you walk. MRI of the spine&#xD;
      must be performed within 1 month of registration. You will be asked to complete 3&#xD;
      questionnaires to evaluate your symptoms and pain. Each questionnaire will take around 5&#xD;
      minutes to complete, and should be completed within 1 month of being enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with radiation therapy that is guided by the CT-on-Rails or&#xD;
      Trilogy procedure. Patients will receive a CT scan immediately before the treatment in the&#xD;
      same room of the treatment using CT-On-Rails or Trilogy. There will be a total of 3&#xD;
      treatments over a period of 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of side effects will be focused on neurological, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal, and hematological systems. Every attempt will be made to have the patient&#xD;
      complete the prescribed course of radiation to maximize the beneficial effect of treatment.&#xD;
      However, if there is severe side effects, radiation treatment will be stopped and patients&#xD;
      will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow up visits once a week during radiation treatment, scheduled on the same&#xD;
      day as radiation. After treatment, you will have telephone, mail, or follow-ups per fax&#xD;
      scheduled at 2 and 4 weeks,and 2 months post radiation. You will have follow up visits&#xD;
      scheduled at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, then every six months for the rest of your life.&#xD;
      At all follow-up visits, you will be asked questions about your medical history, have a&#xD;
      neurological exam, and neurologic function will be evaluated. Any pain medication you are&#xD;
      taking will be noted. You will have an MRI of the spine at 3, 6, 9, 12,18, and 24 months,&#xD;
      then once a year for the rest of your life. You will also be asked to complete 3&#xD;
      questionnaires to evaluate your symptoms and pain. Each questionnaire will take around 5&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The CT-on-rails and Trilogy linear accelerator are&#xD;
      FDA-approved medical devices and are commercially available, however, the way these two&#xD;
      devices are being used is investigational. Up to 150 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

The &quot;worst pain score&quot; from BPI used as the marker for treatment success or failure.</description>
