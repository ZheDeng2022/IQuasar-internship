      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase&#xD;
           II dose of RTA 402 capsules in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoid&#xD;
           malignancies who have failed standard-of-care curative or survival-prolonging therapy,&#xD;
           or for whom no such therapies exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of RTA 402 capsules administered orally for 21 days&#xD;
           in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document any preliminary antitumor activity of RTA 402 in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the in vivo molecular and biological effects of RTA 402 by measuring&#xD;
           changes in markers of differentiation, apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory effects in WBCs,&#xD;
           blood plasma, and, in consenting patients, tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the biological activity of RTA 402 with drug concentration in plasma and&#xD;
           blood cellular elements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the series of inflammation related symptoms over the course of the study,&#xD;
           and to determine the correlation of symptom intensity with plasma cytokines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RTA 402 is a new man-made drug that is designed to inhibit (turn off) genes that may activate&#xD;
      your cancer cells and cause them to grow. This drug has not been tested in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take RTA 402 by mouth&#xD;
      (several capsules a day) in the morning with a glass of water (before eating) on the dose&#xD;
      level that will be assigned to you. The dose level you receive will depend on when you begin&#xD;
      on this study. You will receive the study drug for 21 days in a row. You will not take the&#xD;
      study drug for the next 7 days. This is considered a rest period. These 28 days equal 1&#xD;
      cycle. You should take your study drug as instructed. If a dose is missed or vomited, it will&#xD;
      not be replaced either on that day or at the end of the 21-day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, one to three patients may be enrolled at each dose level, and&#xD;
      dose will be doubled between groups until the first occurrence of intolerable side effects&#xD;
      during Cycle 1. At the first occurrence of less severe side effects, groups will be expanded&#xD;
      to 3-4 patients. Dose escalation (increasing) will continue in this way until researchers&#xD;
      learn the highest dose that is best tolerated. You will remain at the same dose level that&#xD;
      you started on for at least 2 cycles. After at least 2 cycles, your dose may be increased to&#xD;
      another dose that has been determined to be safe. If your disease gets worse or you&#xD;
      experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 21, you will be asked to go to the Clinical and Translational&#xD;
      Research Center for your dose of the study drug. You will be asked about how you are feeling,&#xD;
      and about any medications you may be taking including any over the counter medication, herbs,&#xD;
      and alcohol. You will be asked to report any bad side effects you may experience from the&#xD;
      study drug. You will have blood draws (about 1 1/2 teaspoons each time) for PK studies. You&#xD;
      will have these PK blood draws before you take RTA 402 at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after you take the study drug. You will have your vital signs measured&#xD;
      at 2, 4, and 8 hours after taking RTA 402. You will have your urine collected over a 24-hour&#xD;
      period. The study staff will provide the urine sample container and explain how to collect&#xD;
      your urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 1, you will return to the clinic every week to have routine blood drawn (about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons) to check the status of your disease. You will be asked how you are feeling and&#xD;
      about any medications you may be taking including any over the counter medication, herbs, and&#xD;
      alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week during Cycle 1 and on Day 28 of each additional cycle, you will complete 2&#xD;
      questionnaires that will take about 15 minutes to complete. You will also have your body&#xD;
      weight measured and be asked about your normal food intake. Your body composition will be&#xD;
      measured using measurements that include body weight and height, skin fold thickness, and&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance using the Tanita body composition monitoring scale. This is a&#xD;
      non-invasive method to measure total body water, total body fat, and total body lean mass.&#xD;
      Researchers will measure how much energy your body uses while at rest. You will also have&#xD;
      timed test that will involve your participation where at your fastest speed you will be asked&#xD;
      to walk 25 feet and walk back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycle 1, you will return to the clinic every other week for up to 18 cycles (about 18&#xD;
      months) as long as your health does not get worse and you do not experience any intolerable&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During every other cycle starting with Cycle 2, you will be evaluated to check the status of&#xD;
      your cancer. You will have routine imaging studies, such as x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs to&#xD;
      measure your tumor. You will have a bone marrow biopsy (if you have lymphoid disease) to&#xD;
      measure your disease. On Day 1 of the next cycle, you will return to your doctor's office for&#xD;
      your next physical exam and to begin the next cycle of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on this study, you will not be allowed to take any other investigational agent,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or anti-cancer treatments. You will not be&#xD;
      allowed to take medicine that can help increase your white blood cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you have completed all cycles of the study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit.&#xD;
      During this visit, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
      You will have blood drawn (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) for routine tests, and a urine sample will&#xD;
      be collected. You will have a bone marrow biopsy (if you have lymphoid disease) to measure&#xD;
      your disease. You will have imaging studies, such as x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs to measure&#xD;
      your tumor. You will be asked to report any side effects or new medications that you may be&#xD;
      taking including any over the counter medication, herbs, and alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be followed (30 days after you are off study) and asked to report any side effects&#xD;
      you may be experiencing, or new medications that you may be taking. You will also have a&#xD;
      physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. If your doctor thinks that you&#xD;
      should continue taking RTA 402 (after 18 cycles or 18 months), you will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in an extended study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. RTA 402 has been authorized by the FDA for use in research&#xD;
      only. Up to 45 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 42 will be enrolled&#xD;
      at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
