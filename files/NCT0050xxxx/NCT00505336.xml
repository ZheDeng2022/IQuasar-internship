      To investigate whether the medicines eplerenone or atorvastatin have a favourable effect on&#xD;
      diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eplerenone is a drug that has been shown to be beneficial in Chronic Heart Failure due to&#xD;
      pump failure. It can increase life expectancy and improve symptoms in these patients. It is&#xD;
      not known whether or not eplerenone might be beneficial in heart failure with normal pump&#xD;
      function (diastolic heart failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin is one of a group of cholesterol lowering medicines called statins, which have&#xD;
      been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease in patients irrespective of whether cholesterol&#xD;
      levels are high or normal. It is not known whether atorvastatin also reduces fibrosis of the&#xD;
      heart which is one of the causes of diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the impact of aldosterone antagonism or statin therapy on markers of&#xD;
           collagen turnover in patients with diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the impact of aldosterone antagonism or statin therapy on markers of diastolic&#xD;
           dysfunction and indices of clinical well being in patients with diastolic heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic heart failure is a significant contributor to the heart failure syndrome. However,&#xD;
      little work has been done on the causes of diastolic heart failure, and in contradistinction&#xD;
      to those with systolic heart failure, little is know about the aetiology and therefore, there&#xD;
      are few effective therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally believed that diastolic heart failure represents a problem with compliance&#xD;
      and relaxation of the ventricle. One possible explanation for this is thought to be an&#xD;
      abnormality of collagen structure in the myocardium. There are data from hypertensive&#xD;
      populations as well as from hypertensive experimental models indicating an abnormal fibrotic&#xD;
      process in patients with hypertensive heart disease. However, there are a few data on this&#xD;
      potential aetiological explanation for diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now possible to measure serum markers of fibrosis in circulating blood. Work in this&#xD;
      area has established the reproducibility and reliability of measurements of pro-collagen I&#xD;
      and pro-collagen III amino-terminal, secreted as the collagen molecules are released from the&#xD;
      fibroblast. These markers have been analysed in several settings, including normal&#xD;
      individuals, hypertensive populations and in those with established heart failure due to&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction. Recently we have completed a study on analysis of these factors in&#xD;
      patients with proven diastolic heart failure. These data have demonstrated an increased&#xD;
      activity of the amino terminal pro-collagen III (PIIINP) with a trend towards an increase in&#xD;
      the amino-terminal pro-collagen I (PINP). Other relevant markers of the fibrotic process were&#xD;
      not altered, including metalloproteinase enzymes (MMP) and tissue inhibitors of&#xD;
      metalloproteinase enzymes (TIMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observational data support the hypothesis that diastolic heart failure may be the&#xD;
      result of an aggressive uncontrolled myocardial fibrotic process. The purpose of this project&#xD;
      is to assess whether aldosterone inhibition or statin therapy may have an impact on increased&#xD;
      levels of collagen markers, and thereby have a positive influence on parameters of diastolic&#xD;
      function. Aldosterone is known to be a potent stimulus of the fibrotic process and therefore&#xD;
      is a likely contributor. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation in the&#xD;
      systolic heart failure population where the administration of an aldosterone antagonist was&#xD;
      found to be of benefit especially in those individuals who had serum evidence of heightened&#xD;
      fibrotic activity. Statin therapy has been shown to reduce myocardial fibrosis in a rat&#xD;
      model. Furthermore, preliminary data presented from the EPHESUS study has shown that greater&#xD;
      benefits of eplerenone in those receiving concomitant statin therapy. We therefore propose to&#xD;
      analyse the impact of atorvastatin therapy or aldosterone inhibition on markers of collagen&#xD;
      turnover and also indices of diastolic function and markers of clinical well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to analyse the impact of aldosterone inhibition or statin therapy on&#xD;
      markers of collagen turnover and also indices of diastolic function and markers of clinical&#xD;
      well being.&#xD;
