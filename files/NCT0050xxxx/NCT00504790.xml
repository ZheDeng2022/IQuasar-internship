    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, first time in human study of GSK923295, in adult subjects with&#xD;
      cancers that do not respond to standard therapy. This study will be conducted in two stages;&#xD;
      a dose-escalation stage (Stage 1) and an expansion cohort stage (Stage 2).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) is a protein that is required for correct&#xD;
      chromosomal alignment in mitosis. Loss of CENP-E activity, due to microinjection of&#xD;
      antibodies, ablation of gene expression with siRNA or antisense oligonucleotides, or&#xD;
      inhibition of enzymatic activity by small molecule inhibitors, causes aberrant cell cycle&#xD;
      arrest in mitosis, characterized by a bipolar mitotic spindle with misaligned chromosomes.&#xD;
      Studies with small molecule inhibitors have demonstrated that this aberrant cell cycle arrest&#xD;
      can result in apoptosis and cell death. CENP-E has been shown to be abundantly expressed in a&#xD;
      variety of human tumors. GSK923295 is a potent and selective CENP-E inhibitor which has&#xD;
      demonstrated potent and broad spectrum antitumor activity against solid and hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies in vitro. GSK923295 is intended for use either as a monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with existing anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drug targeting CENP-E may prove as efficacious as the taxanes and vinca alkaloids, without&#xD;
      the potential for neurotoxicity or other side-effects associated with interference of tubulin&#xD;
      function in non-dividing cells. Similar to many other anti-proliferative drugs, CENP-E&#xD;
      inhibitors are expected to have manageable dose-limiting toxicities resulting from action on&#xD;
      normal proliferating tissues (e.g., myelosuppression and gastrointestinal epithelial cell&#xD;
      damage). The opportunity for inhibitors of CENP-E lies in the potential for broad efficacy.&#xD;
      The absence of broad clinical experience with anti-mitotic cancer therapies acting on targets&#xD;
      other than tubulin complicates prediction of additional benefits, beyond the lack of&#xD;
      neurotoxicity that might accrue from a drug targeting CENPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this Phase I, first time in human (FTIH) study in subjects with refractory&#xD;
      cancers is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) (or recommended dose based on&#xD;
      available safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and response data), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs),&#xD;
      PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of GSK923295, an inhibitor of&#xD;
      CENP-E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives in Stage 1 (Dose Escalation) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the MTD (or recommended dose based on available safety, PK, and response&#xD;
      data), DLTs, safety, and PK of GSK923295 administered to subjects with advanced, refractory&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives in Stage 2 (Expansion Cohort) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the safety and PK of GSK923295 at the MTD (or recommended dose based on&#xD;
      available safety, PK, and response data) administered to subjects with advanced, refractory&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the clinical activity of GSK923295 administered to subjects with advanced,&#xD;
           refractory malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of GSK923295 on biomarkers in normal host tissue (Stage 1 and 2)&#xD;
           and tumor (Stage 2, optional in Stage 1) and the effect of GSK923295 on tumor metabolism&#xD;
           with FDG-PET imaging (Stage 2, optional in Stage 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore associations between biochemical and genetic characteristics of baseline&#xD;
           archival tumor specimens (Stage 1 and Stage 2), biopsy-accessible tumor specimens (Stage&#xD;
           2), and anti-tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore pharmacogenomic associations between genetic variants in drug metabolizing and&#xD;
           drug transport genes and PK, safety, and efficacy of GSK923295.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary endpoint(s) used to assess the objective measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Adverse events (AE) and changes from baseline in vital signs, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, and electrocardiography (ECG) assessments will be evaluated to assess safety&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MTD (or recommended dose based on available safety, PK, and response data) where no&#xD;
           more than 1 of 6 subjects has a DLT in the first treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK parameters CL, Vdss, AUC(0-∞), AUC(0-t), Cmax, tmax, and t1/2 (Stage 1) and develop a&#xD;
           PK model for GSK923295 (Stage 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-tumor activity measurements will be obtained at baseline and after every second&#xD;
           cycle according to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines for solid tumors (for&#xD;
           solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  National Cancer Institute - Working Group (NCI-WG) Guidelines for chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
           leukaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory PK/PD modeling of safety and response data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in biomarkers of cell proliferation and cell death or imaging endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarker profiles in archival tumor specimens and their correlation with clinical&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic polymorphisms in key enzymes involved in the metabolism and disposition of&#xD;
           GSK923295 and correlations with pharmacokinetic, safety, and response (pharmacodynamic)&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two stages. Stage 1 consists of a dose escalation stage to&#xD;
      determine the MTD (or recommended dose based on available safety, PK and response data) using&#xD;
      an accelerated titration scheme combined with standard dose escalation methods. GSK923295&#xD;
      will be administered intravenously over one hour, once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (i.e.,&#xD;
      Day 1, 8, and 15) with treatment cycles repeated every 4 weeks (each cycle = 28 days). During&#xD;
      Stage 1, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity will be assessed.&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies and PET imaging are optional in Stage 1 subjects. The MTD (or recommended dose&#xD;
      based on available safety, PK and response data) will be defined as the dose of GSK923295 at&#xD;
      which no more than 1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT in the first treatment cycle. Eighteen&#xD;
      subjects are anticipated to participate in Stage 1 of the study. In Stage 2, 15-20 additional&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at the MTD (or recommended dose based on available safety, PK and&#xD;
      response data) dose to further evaluate the safety of GSK923295. In Stage 2, PK samples&#xD;
      (using a sparse PK sampling scheme for population PK analyses), PET imaging, and tumor&#xD;
      biopsies will be obtained. Clinical activity will be assessed. Subjects (Stage 1 and Stage 2)&#xD;
      will remain on study until they meet the criteria for treatment discontinuation described in&#xD;
      the protocol. It is anticipated that 33-38 subjects will participate in the study (18 in&#xD;
      Stage 1 and 15-20 in Stage 2. During Stage 1 and Stage 2, subjects with histologically&#xD;
      confirmed advanced refractory solid tumors will be enrolled. In Stage 2, subjects with&#xD;
      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia can also be enrolled.&#xD;
