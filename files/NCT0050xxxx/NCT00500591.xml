  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that women who are obese are at higher risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the&#xD;
      lining of the uterus or womb). The goal of this clinical research study is to find out how&#xD;
      common abnormalities of the endometrium are in women who are considered obese and to find out&#xD;
      if those same abnormalities are less common in women who are considered to be thin.&#xD;
      Researchers would like to learn if obese patients have symptoms (like irregular menstrual&#xD;
      cycles) that may mean there could be an abnormality present. Researchers would also like to&#xD;
      know if obese women have access to regular female exams and whether they routinely go to&#xD;
      their primary care doctors.&#xD;

      Women in this study will be asked to complete three different parts of the study. All three&#xD;
      parts of the study will be done during one visit to the gynecology center. First, you will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a survey/questionnaire that will give researchers information on your&#xD;
      background, weight history, gynecologic, and medical history. You will be assisted by a&#xD;
      research nurse and completion of the questionnaire is expected take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, you will be asked to have a blood sample drawn. About 2 tablespoons of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn. This blood will be used to look at different hormone levels that may be related to&#xD;
      your risk of endometrial abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, an endometrial biopsy will be performed by one of the doctors running the study. This&#xD;
      will require you to have a full pelvic exam (much like when you have a pap smear), which will&#xD;
      include looking at the cervix (mouth of the womb) and putting a small pipelle (straw) into&#xD;
      the womb to collect a tissue sample. This procedure is routinely done in the office. You will&#xD;
      not be required to take medications prior to the procedure and you will not receive a&#xD;
      prescription for pain medication once the procedure is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of all three parts of the study may take between one to two hours. You and your&#xD;
      physician will be notified of your endometrial biopsy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
