  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is an acquired, symmetric, irregular hypermelanosis on sun-exposed areas of the face,&#xD;
      commonly seen in Latin American women. It is a very frequent disease, although its true&#xD;
      incidence is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melasma has historically been difficult to treat and therapy remains a challenge for this&#xD;
      chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melasma being a relapsing disease, there is a real need to address how to maintain efficacy&#xD;
      achieved after acute treatment. A previous 12-month trial has shown that Tri-Luma® applied&#xD;
      once daily over a long-term period is safe and tolerable. However, there are no robust data&#xD;
      available either on the efficacy of Tri-Luma® in long-term treatment or guidance for a&#xD;
      maintenance dosage regimen with this product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations have been made through a feasibility work among Dermatologists from USA and&#xD;
      Latin America to assess their current practice in terms of Maintenance Therapy. Two regimens&#xD;
      appear to be prescribed frequently and will be compared in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expectation is that Tri-Luma® will be effective, in one of the two regimens explored, in&#xD;
      maintaining the Melasma improvement achieved with a previous treatment of Tri-Luma®.&#xD;
