      The purpose of this study is to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TBE antibody persistence 24, 34, 46 and 58 months (as applicable) after the first&#xD;
           booster TBE vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml given in Study 223, by means of ELISA&#xD;
           (IMMUNOZYM FSME IgG) and Neutralization test (NT),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TBE antibody response to a second booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml in the&#xD;
           present study, by means of ELISA and NT,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml after the second booster vaccination.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who participated in Study 223 will be eligible for participation in this&#xD;
             study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions and provide written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they received the first booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml during the course of&#xD;
             study 223&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  blood was drawn after their first booster vaccination in Study 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  received any TBE vaccination since their first booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN&#xD;
             0.5ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a history of infection with or vaccination against other flaviviruses (e.g.&#xD;
             dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese B-encephalitis) since their first booster&#xD;
             vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required for the purpose of&#xD;
             the study) since their first booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse (&gt; 4 liters wine / week&#xD;
             or equivalent level of other alcoholic beverages).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will not be eligible for booster vaccination if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are not clinically healthy, (i. e. the physician would have reservations vaccinating&#xD;
             with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml outside the scope of a clinical trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment&#xD;
             (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence immunological&#xD;
             functions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are females of childbearing potential and are pregnant or breastfeeding before the&#xD;
             booster vaccination (positive pregnancy test result at the medical examination before&#xD;
             the booster vaccination)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have shown an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since their&#xD;
             first booster vaccination in Study 223&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are simultaneously participating in another clinical trial including administration of&#xD;
             an investigational product within six weeks prior to the booster vaccination until the&#xD;
             end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  do not agree to keep a Subject Diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria, but have a febrile illness (body&#xD;
             temperature &gt;= 38.0Â°C, measured orally) at the scheduled time of vaccination, will not&#xD;
             be vaccinated until their body temperature returns to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been administered any vaccination within 2 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             booster vaccination will not be vaccinated until an interval of two weeks has passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subjects have received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the scheduled time of&#xD;
             vaccination, the vaccination should be performed at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a subject had a tick-bite within 4 weeks of the scheduled booster vaccination, the&#xD;
             vaccination shall be delayed such that an interval of 4 weeks has passed since the&#xD;
             tick-bite in order to avoid any interference with diagnostic assays in the event of a&#xD;
             TBE infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a subject has donated blood or plasma or has received a blood transfusion or&#xD;
             immunoglobulins within 4 weeks of the scheduled booster vaccination, the vaccination&#xD;
             shall be delayed until an interval of 4 weeks has passed.&#xD;
