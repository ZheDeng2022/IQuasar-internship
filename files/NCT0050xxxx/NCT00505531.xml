    <textblock>
      The Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Translational Pain Research is conducting a&#xD;
      research study to see if Ultram ER, an FDA-approved pain medication, would be helpful in&#xD;
      providing pain relief in subjects whose chronic pain is not well controlled on narcotic pain&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study consists of 6 visits over 6 weeks. Study testing includes: physical exam, urine&#xD;
      testing, questionnaires and non-invasive (no needles) nerve testing using cold/heat&#xD;
      sensations. Compensation and some parking reimbursement provided.&#xD;

  <eligibility>

        Subjects whose chronic pain is not well controlled on narcotic pain medicine.&#xD;

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject will be between ages 18 to 65 years in all three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has NOT been on Tramadol or Tramadol ER for at least one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has NOT been on tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin, norepinephrine, or mixed&#xD;
             serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI/SNRI), or muscle relaxant with&#xD;
             potential action as an SSRI or SNRI (e.g., Flexeril) for at least one month. Subject&#xD;
             has not been on monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the past 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects should have had a stable pain condition (e.g., axial low back pain as listed&#xD;
             below in item # 5-7) for at least three months. This requirement is set in order to&#xD;
             avoid clinical uncertainty from an unstable pain condition and to minimize the study&#xD;
             variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Axial low back pain refers to pain conditions resulting from myofascial disorder,&#xD;
             lumbar facet joint disease, discogenic disease, and postlaminectomy syndrome. Patients&#xD;
             with neurological signs (weakness or numbness) will not be included in the study&#xD;
             because of potential confounding effects on the QST assessment of pain threshold and&#xD;
             pain tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Headaches refer to migraine, tension, or cluster headache, cervicogenic pain (e.g.,&#xD;
             facet joint disease, myofascial pain), and trigeminal neuralgia. However, patients&#xD;
             with neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
             sclerosis, and stroke will not be included due to possible neurological deficits that&#xD;
             may confound the QST assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Abdominal and pelvic pain refers to pain from abdominal and/or pelvic organs (e.g.,&#xD;
             chronic pancreatitis, endometriosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is willing to have his/her opioid dose tapered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             the initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has sensory deficits at the sites of QST. Sensory deficits refer to such&#xD;
             changes resulting from neurological diseases or medical conditions causing peripheral&#xD;
             polyneuropathy and sensory changes, which include but are not limited to diabetes,&#xD;
             alcoholic neuropathy, AIDS neuropathy, thyroid disease, severe liver or kidney&#xD;
             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has scar tissue, infection, or acute injury at the sites of QST.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has had interventional procedures that may alter the results of QST. Such&#xD;
             procedures include neuroablation (chemical or electrothermal) at any time, neuraxial&#xD;
             (e.g., epidural) or local anesthetic block within the last eight weeks, and lumbar&#xD;
             sympathetic or hypogastric block within the last six months. We consider eight weeks&#xD;
             and six months as the minimal time period that must have elapsed after neuraxial&#xD;
             injection and lumbar sympathetic block, respectively, in order to minimize the&#xD;
             possible influence from a previous interventional procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a pending litigation related to his/her chronic pain condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a history of or current seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a history of severe allergic reaction to Tramadol ER or other opioid&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has a major psychiatric disorder (major depression; bipolar disorder;&#xD;
             schizophrenia; anxiety disorder; psychotic disorders; eating disorders; alcohol or&#xD;
             drug dependence; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); subject with any known&#xD;
             history of such conditions also will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is using illicit drugs detected through the urine toxicology screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
