  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to provide further clinical and statistical evidence&#xD;
      of the efficacy of r-hLIF, in comparison with placebo, administered during the luteal phase&#xD;
      after IVF and ET for improving embryo implantation in infertile women with a history of at&#xD;
      least 2 implantation failures following transfer of fresh embryos. The secondary objective of&#xD;
      the study was to assess the safety profile of r-hLIF in the proposed indication.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. The presence of both ovaries.&#xD;

          4. Current body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 20 &amp; ≤ 30 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Early follicular phase (cycle day 2-5) serum FSH levels ≤ 10 IU/L. If two&#xD;
             determinations are available, at least one should be &lt; 10 IU/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 2 ART cycles with adequate stimulation that led to the transfer of at least two&#xD;
                  or more fresh Grade A or B embryos, but did not result in implantation or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 3ART cycles with adequate stimulation that led to the transfer of at least one&#xD;
                  fresh Grade A or B embryo from a cohort with one additional Grade A or B embryo,&#xD;
                  but did not result in implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Normal male partner's semen analysis according to standard WHO criteria. Male&#xD;
             partner's semen analysis must be suitable for IVF (ICSI not allowed). Donor sperm is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Normal cervical cytology within 3 years prior to starting GnRH-agonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. At least one wash-out cycle (defined as ≥ 30 days since the last dose of clomiphene&#xD;
             citrate or gonadotrophin treatment) since the last ART cycle and/or clomiphene citrate&#xD;
             or gonadotrophin treatment, prior to starting GnRH-agonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting GnRH-agonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willingness and ability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Written informed consent given prior to any study-related procedure not part of the&#xD;
             patient's normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by&#xD;
             the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known to be positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B or C Virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of any liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any one of the following parameters above the upper limit of normal at the prestudy&#xD;
             visit: AST, ALT, Alkaline phosphatases, gamma GT, alpha GST, bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any clinically significant systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any significant allergic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of an uncontrolled clinically significant medical condition including&#xD;
             infection) as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of ART biochemical pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any cause of infertility that would justify ICSI treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of another known cause of previous ART failure other than recurrent&#xD;
             implantation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uterine cavity with abnormalities which, in the investigator's opinion, could impair&#xD;
             embryo implantation or pregnancy outcome, as assessed by US examination performed&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to starting GnRH-agonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. More than one previous failed ART cycle, where &quot;failed&quot; is defined as cancellation of&#xD;
             administration of hCG or poor response to gonadotrophin stimulation (defined as&#xD;
             retrieval of 3 oocytes or less).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any history of difficulties in ET procedure (i.e. requiring general anaesthetic e.g.&#xD;
             due to position of cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Abnormal undiagnosed gynaecological bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any contraindication to being pregnant and/or carrying pregnancy to term.&#xD;
&#xD;

             progesterone is contra-indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known allergy to Escherichia coli derived pharmaceutical products.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to gonadotrophin preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Known intolerance or allergy to paracetamol (acetaminophen).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Active substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
