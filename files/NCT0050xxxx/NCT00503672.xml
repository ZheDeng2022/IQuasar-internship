      We would like to quantify the amount and type of activity a typical pregnant woman engages in&#xD;
      and then compare the pregnancy outcomes of women with varying activity levels. To do this, we&#xD;
      will have women wear a device known as an accelerometer (that records activity by measuring&#xD;
      changes in voltage levels) at certain times in their pregnancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General findings that have consistently been demonstrated in the literature are that activity&#xD;
      tends to decreased during pregnancy from pre-pregnancy levels and that activity in the third&#xD;
      trimester is less than in the first trimester. In non-pregnant patients, increase in physical&#xD;
      activity and exercise has been associated with improved mood and self-esteem. Although the&#xD;
      data in pregnancy is limited, available studies do suggest that inactivity is associated with&#xD;
      worse mood. Regular physical activity is not detrimental in low-risk patients and in fact may&#xD;
      be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bed rest or activity restrictions are commonly employed interventions for women with a&#xD;
      variety of obstetric complications such as preterm contractions, vaginal bleeding, and fetal&#xD;
      growth restriction. There is no compelling data to support bed rest as an effective&#xD;
      therapeutic modality. There has been some data that occupational work can increase the risk&#xD;
      of preterm birth, but other studies have not demonstrated an effect.5 Furthermore, prolonged&#xD;
      bedrest can have detrimental effects such as muscle weakness and increased thromboembolic&#xD;
      risk, as well as negatively impact familial relations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the accelerometer is an attempt to objectively quantify physical activity in&#xD;
      pregnancy. The accelerometer assesses activity by measuring voltages, and can thus provide&#xD;
      information on the intensity of activity. An additional advantage is that it can be worn on&#xD;
      the wrist or ankle, whereas pedometers need to be worn on the waist for maximal accuracy&#xD;
      which limits their use in pregnant women. This novel study would contribute to the existing&#xD;
      literature on pregnancy activity that consists primarily of survey/subjective data to&#xD;
      determine what correlation, if any, exists between activity and pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
      Secondarily, the study will survey its participants to see if we can corroborate previous&#xD;
      studies that have demonstrated a relationship between activity level and patients' moods.&#xD;
