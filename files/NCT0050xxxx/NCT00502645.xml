    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open, non-controlled clinical investigation in 10 patients at the&#xD;
      Medical University Graz including a treatment visit (V1)and a follow up visit(V2). In the&#xD;
      treatment visit (V1) after admittance to the ICU arterial blood glucose values will be&#xD;
      monitored and either the software-algorithm eMPC will be used to adjust the infusion rate of&#xD;
      intravenously administered human soluble insulin to normalise arterial blood glucose. The&#xD;
      purpose of the present study is to investigate the performance of the already developed and&#xD;
      tested algorithm in combination with a newly developed bed-side, touch screen user interface&#xD;
      (CS-1 decision support system) in patients at the medical ICU for a period of 72 hours.&#xD;
      Follow up information(V2) will be acquired at hospital discharge or at the latest one week&#xD;
      after visit 1.&#xD;

      Before the beginning of any trial related activities, the relatives of each patient will be&#xD;
      asked if the patient has ever mentioned in the past, that he/she does not want do participate&#xD;
      in any kind of clinical study. If this was said by the patient in the past or if there are&#xD;
      any signs which make it likely that the patient would not participate, he/she will be&#xD;
      excluded from the trial. After testing of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, screening&#xD;
      information will be obtained a the beginning of the trial. A screening number will be&#xD;
      assigned to the patient in ascending order. The following data will be recorded in the case&#xD;
      record form (CRF): Check for inclusion/exclusion criteria,demographic data, medical&#xD;
      (including diabetes) history and relevant medication, body weight and heightand laboratory&#xD;
      analyses from routine laboratory assessment. Patients fulfilling all the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and none of the exclusion criteria will be included into the trial and a subject number will&#xD;
      be assigned in ascending order. Routine intensive care will be provided from department of&#xD;
      internal medicine. Trial related activities will not interfere with regular patient care.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be retrieved from an arterial line, available for routine diagnostic and&#xD;
      monitoring procedures in all patients. At time 0, a blood glucose measurement will be taken,&#xD;
      manually entered into the CS-1 decision support system and both a insulin infusion rate and&#xD;
      the time to next glucose reading will be suggested by the computer-based system. Based on the&#xD;
      suggestion of the system, an insulin infusion pump as routinely used in the ICU will be&#xD;
      manually set to this suggested insulin infusion rate by specially trained ICU staff but only&#xD;
      if the staff feels safe with this suggestion. Intravenous infusion of human soluble insulin&#xD;
      will then be started. For safety reasons: In case that the suggested measurement interval of&#xD;
      the decision support system exceeds a 90 minute interval, interim glucose measurements will&#xD;
      be taken. All measurements will be documented in the CRF. Only in case that the blood glucose&#xD;
      values are below 40 mg/dl the additional interim-glucose value will also be put into the CS-1&#xD;
      system. However, the nursing staff can at any time decide to take an additionlal blood&#xD;
      glucose measurement and/or neglect the decision as suggested by the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target range for blood glucose levels will be 80-110 mg/dl [4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l]. The&#xD;
      current blood glucose level and insulin infusion rate will continuously be documented by the&#xD;
      CS-1 decision support system and supervised by the investigator. Glucose values will be&#xD;
      provided to the system by manual entry. In case of hypoglycaemia, intravenous insulin&#xD;
      infusion will be stopped and glucose will be administered via intravenous bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment visit, including all trial related activities as described above, will last for&#xD;
      72 hours. Adverse events and relevant medication will be continuously monitored and&#xD;
      documented The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score (Apache II) will be&#xD;
      documented for each patient at the beginning of the trial. There is no physical connection&#xD;
      between the algorithm suggesting the insulin infusion rate and the insulin infusion pump such&#xD;
      as that the algorithm would be capable to independently steer the insulin infusion. There is&#xD;
      also no physical connection between the glucose measurement device and the algorithm such as&#xD;
      that the algorihthm would be able to independently get a glucose measurement. For safety&#xD;
      reasons, both the glucose measurement and the insulin infusion rate are parameters that need&#xD;
      to be manually entered by a specially trained nurse. For glucose measurement, a certified&#xD;
      device for ICU application is being used (Accuchek® Inform; Roche Diagnostics), for&#xD;
      intravenous insulin infusion, a certified insulin infusion pump (Perfusor® Space, BBraun&#xD;
      Melsungen) as it is used under routine conditions in the ICU is being used. Follow up&#xD;
      information will be acquired at hospital discharge or at the latest one week after visit 1. .&#xD;
