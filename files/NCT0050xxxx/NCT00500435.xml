      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of performing an extraperitoneal laparoscopic&#xD;
           lymphadenectomy in patients with stage IB2-IVA cervical carcinoma who are dispositioned&#xD;
           to undergo radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document intraoperative and postoperative complications in patients undergoing&#xD;
           extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of lymph node metastases in the para-aortic region in patients&#xD;
           with stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate histopathological findings in the para-aortic lymph nodes with preoperative&#xD;
           imaging studies (Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
           and computed tomography (CT)).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the decision about how much radiation should be given to patients with stage&#xD;
      IB2-IVA cervical cancer is based on direct physical examination, chest x-ray, computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, cystoscopy (examination of the&#xD;
      bladder), proctoscopy (examination of the rectum), and possibly an intravenous pyelogram (a&#xD;
      test that uses dye to outline the bladder, kidneys, and the tubes that carry urine from the&#xD;
      kidney to the bladder on an x-ray). Unfortunately, these techniques may not identify cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to the lymph nodes. Studies have shown that cancer in the lymph nodes is one&#xD;
      of the most important factors in the return of the cancer. Standard radiation therapy treats&#xD;
      the lymph nodes in the pelvis area but does not include the lymph nodes in the abdomen&#xD;
      (called para aortic lymph nodes) . If cancer is present in the lymph nodes in the abdomen and&#xD;
      it was not detected by the standard techniques, the cancer could be undertreated and the risk&#xD;
      of the cancer returning would be high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a surgical procedure called extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, surgeons can&#xD;
      remove and examine the lymph nodes in the abdomen. This may help to find cancer in the lymph&#xD;
      nodes that cannot be detected using standard techniques. If these lymph nodes contain cancer,&#xD;
      the area of the body treated with radiation can be &quot;extended&quot; to treat new areas. This means&#xD;
      that radiation will be used to treat both the para-aortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes in the&#xD;
      abdomen) in addition to the standard pelvic radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning your radiation therapy, you will be taken to the operating room for the&#xD;
      laparoscopy procedure. The laparoscopy procedure involves placing a telescope-like instrument&#xD;
      through a small, usually Â½ inch, incision (cut) in the abdomen. Three other small incisions&#xD;
      are made to place additional instruments that may be needed to complete the surgery. Before&#xD;
      the laparoscope is inserted, carbon dioxide gas (CO2) is introduced into the side of the&#xD;
      abdomen. This gas helps to separate the organs inside the abdominal cavity, making it easier&#xD;
      for the surgeon to see. The laparoscope is then inserted through the small incision. The&#xD;
      laparoscope has a small camera on the end of the instrument. This is attached to a&#xD;
      high-resolution TV monitor. Using the TV monitor, the surgeon can see inside your body&#xD;
      without making a large incision. While watching the TV monitor, the surgeon uses the&#xD;
      laparoscope to find the para aortic lymph nodes and removes them. Once the procedure is&#xD;
      finished, the carbon dioxide gas is removed and you are taken to the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lymph nodes that were removed will be sent to the lab and evaluated for the presence of&#xD;
      any cancer cells. If cancer is found, your radiation therapy will be adjusted to also treat&#xD;
      the lymph nodes. If no signs of cancer is found, you will receive the standard radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, during the laparoscopy procedure, the surgeon finds an obvious sign of cancer (such as&#xD;
      enlarged lymph nodes) then an exploratory laparotomy will be performed. This procedure&#xD;
      involves making a long incision in the abdomen so that the surgeon can remove any additional&#xD;
      lymph nodes that may contain cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a Positron Emission Tomography scan, also called a PET scan,&#xD;
      before their scheduled surgery. This test studies the function of organs such as the heart,&#xD;
      brain, and bone. The test is different from other imaging tests such as x-rays, CT scans, or&#xD;
      MRI's because PET images show how tissues function. The other imaging methods show what the&#xD;
      tissues look like. The PET scanner is similar to a CT or an MRI scanner. The bed on the&#xD;
      scanner moves during the exam so that each area of the body can be imaged. The PET scanner&#xD;
      makes no noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the PET scan, a blood test (about 1 teaspoon) will be done to check your blood sugar&#xD;
      level. The day before the scan, you will be asked to follow a special diet. This is to&#xD;
      control the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. One the day of the scan a small tube will be&#xD;
      placed in your vein to administer a very small amount of radioactive material. This material&#xD;
      allows the PET scanner to &quot;see&quot; where the sugar is metabolized in your body. The amount of&#xD;
      time the scan takes depends on how tall you are and why you are having the test. After the&#xD;
      scan, patients rest for about 45 to 90 minutes before being discharged. Family members are&#xD;
      not allowed to come in with the patient during the test. Overall, you should allow about 3&#xD;
      hours for this scan. If you had this test prior to entering the study, you do not have to&#xD;
      have this test repeated as long as it was done within 4 weeks of the laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The PET/CT scan will be performed only at M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      and the laparoscopy procedure will be performed at both M. D. Anderson and Lyndon Baines&#xD;
      Johnson General Hospital (LBJGH). The chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments may be done at&#xD;
      either MD Anderson or in your hometown. Up to 70 patients will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      multicenter study. Up to 55 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
