  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of&#xD;
      REOLYSIN® therapeutic reovirus is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with bone&#xD;
      and soft tissue sarcomas metastatic to the lung.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are uncommon mesenchymal malignancies that encompass a variety of tumors of soft&#xD;
      tissue or bone. Included in this study are patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma family&#xD;
      tumors, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma.&#xD;
      Patients with these lesions presenting with metastatic disease remain largely incurable. In&#xD;
      all sarcomas, the lungs are by far the most frequent site of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for new therapies that have activity against these types of sarcomas.&#xD;
      REOLYSIN® is an unmodified oncolytic reovirus which replicates selectively in ras transformed&#xD;
      cells causing cell lysis. Activating mutations in ras or mutations in oncogenes signaling&#xD;
      through the ras pathway may occur in as many as 80% of human tumors. Such mutations have been&#xD;
      described in many of the common sarcomas of childhood and adults. REOLYSIN® demonstrated&#xD;
      excellent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in childhood sarcoma cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further supporting the development of REOLYSIN® in the context of sarcomas as detailed in&#xD;
      this study, is the fact that sarcomas resistant or refractory to conventional chemotherapy&#xD;
      may remain clinically responsive to viral therapy. Sarcoma patients with pulmonary metastases&#xD;
      may be especially suitable for studies with REOLYSIN® due to rapid selective uptake of the&#xD;
      virus by the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN® given&#xD;
      intravenously over 5 days every 4 weeks in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas&#xD;
      metastatic to the lung. Safety data, including laboratory parameters and adverse events, will&#xD;
      be collected for all patients in order to determine the toxicity and reversibility of&#xD;
      toxicity of REOLYSIN® therapy. Response will be assessed using radiographic imaging every 2&#xD;
      cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure tumor responses and duration of response, and describe any evidence of&#xD;
           antitumor activity of intravenous multiple dose REOLYSIN® in patients with bone and soft&#xD;
           tissue sarcomas metastatic to the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate safety of intravenous multiple dose REOLYSIN®.&#xD;
