      This study is part of a series of studies that will explore how the mind and the brain work&#xD;
      to cause episodes of uncontrollable shaking in people who have no known underlying brain or&#xD;
      medical disorder. The study is conducted at NIH and at the Brown University Rhode Island&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and people with functional movement disorders (FMD) or non-epileptic&#xD;
      seizures (NES) who are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NES have 3 teaspoons of blood drawn. The blood is tested for two genes that are&#xD;
      normally found in healthy individuals to see if they are found more frequently in patients&#xD;
      with uncontrolled shaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with FMD have blood drawn for testing and also undergo functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) to look at how the brain functions while the subject performs a specific task.&#xD;
      MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues.&#xD;
      During the scan, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner, a&#xD;
      metal cylinder. The scan lasts about 60 to 90 minutes, during which the subject may be asked&#xD;
      to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time and to perform tasks, such as identifying the&#xD;
      gender of faces shown on a screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers may have blood drawn for genetic testing or fMRI or both.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigates the neurobiological correlates of conversion disorder (CD). The&#xD;
      primary objectives are to investigate in CD patients:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The frequency of the 5HTTLPR S/S genotype&#xD;

           morphometry (VBM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The neural correlates of fear conditioning and fear extinction in a fear learning fMRI&#xD;
           task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The neural correlates of interoceptive activity in a Interoceptive Attention fMRI task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying the cortical physiology correlated with making a movement following a go&#xD;
           command.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying the cortical physiology correlated with not making a movement following a&#xD;
           no-go command.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying the cortical physiology correlated with planning to move or not move&#xD;
           following a choose go-no go command.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are to investigate in CD patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The frequency of several gene polymorphisms that are implicated in stress and affective&#xD;
           disorder, including 5HTTLPR S/S (serotonin receptor), COMT (catechol-o-methyltransferase&#xD;
           enzyme), Val/Met BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and FKBP5 rs1360780 genotypes,&#xD;
           as well as other polymorphisms or mutations to be determined later. Additionally,&#xD;
           epigenetic data will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The levels of salivary cortisol as a measure of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The heart rate variability, as a measure of autonomic nervous system function.&#xD;
           (COMPLETE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structural differences in white matter of the brain as detected by diffusion tensor&#xD;
           imaging (DTI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The resting state BOLD fMRI signal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of the caregiver's attitude on the patients' symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between hemodynamic responses in regions implicated in interoception&#xD;
           and self-reported measures of interoceptive attention, as well as behavioral and motor&#xD;
           symptom severity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study adult patients with diagnoses of functional movement disorders (FMD) seen&#xD;
      by the Human Motor Control Section clinic (HMCS), patients with diagnoses of psychogenic&#xD;
      non-epileptic seizures (PNES) seen by the Epilepsy clinic and healthy volunteers. Up to 12&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be for the EEG-EMG sub-study. The PNES patient group will include&#xD;
      patients seen at Rhode Island Hospital. Additionally, we would like to study caregivers of&#xD;
      patient's with FMD who are enrolled un protocol 07-N-0190.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assessment for psychiatric diagnoses and measurement scales will be administered to the&#xD;
      FMD and PNES patients, healthy volunteer controls and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional MRI (fMRI): emotional processing will be studied using a gender&#xD;
           identification task with differing emotional valences. (COMPLETE) Limbic processing will&#xD;
           also be studied using a fear learning fMRI task. Resting state BOLD fMRI signal will&#xD;
           also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anatomical MRI: VBM and DTI will be performed using anatomical MRI sequences collected&#xD;
           during the fMRI scanning or subsequent dedicated anatomical MRI sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetics: blood will be collected for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;

           heart rate variability. [COMPLETE].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event related potentials: 64-channel EEG and surface EMG will be recorded during a go ,&#xD;
           no-go and choose go-no go behavioral task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EEG will be recorded during the resting state condition (five minutes with eyes open and&#xD;
           five minutes with eyes closed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>The imaging study will use a block design to (i) optimize amygdala activation to emotionally balanced images, (ii) to optimize analysis of PPI and (iii) to optimize the go/notask design. G. T2- sensitive functional images will be obtained on a MRI system with a 1.5 Tesla superconducting magnet and a standard head coil. An echo planar image sequence (TR=2500msec, TE=33 msec, 90 flip angle) with 30 contiguous 2mm thick coronal oblique slices with 1 mm interslice gap centered over the amygdala, tilted 30 to the anterior, to improve susceptibility artifact. Three dimensional anatomical images will be taken for the co-registration of the functional images.</description>
