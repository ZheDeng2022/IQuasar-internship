      Background The existence, diagnosis and treatment of short esophagus is one of the&#xD;
      controversies of the past which has recently re-emerged The missed diagnosis of short&#xD;
      esophagus and the consequent inadequacy of treatment is one of the major causes of failure of&#xD;
      antireflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily clinical practice of surgeons dedicated to therapy of esophageal diseases could&#xD;
      take advantage of the definition of frequency, preoperative predictors, intraoperative&#xD;
      management and post operative outcomes of cases of foreshortened esophagus, in order to offer&#xD;
      the patient affected by GERD the elements necessary for a conscious choice of therapy and to&#xD;
      plan the best performance of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the Study To define the percentage of cases among the total of antireflux procedures&#xD;
      performed, in which, after standard isolation of the ge junction and eventual dissection of&#xD;
      the mediastinal esophagus at least two centimetres of esophagus can not be replaced without&#xD;
      any applied tension below the apex of the diaphragmatic hiatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the percentage of surgical procedures aimed to treat electively a condition of non&#xD;
      reducible G-E junction and foreshortened esophagus, among a multicentric formed case series&#xD;
      of patients submitted to antireflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the preoperative clinical and instrumental predictors for a surgical procedure&#xD;
      aimed to treat foreshortened esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To record the intra-operative, postoperative, 6 month and 12 month outcome of procedures&#xD;
      adopted for the surgical treatment of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods The study will comprise patients in which surgical therapy for GERD is&#xD;
      indicated according to the international guidelines and the Centres policy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be submitted to the antireflux procedure chosen by the surgeon according to the&#xD;
      internationally recognized scientific surgical principles and the personal judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative study and the postoperative follow up adopted in the present study are&#xD;
      accepted by the Centres as they correspond to the international guidelines and the Centres'&#xD;
      current practice criteria for the surgical treatment of GERD.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The existence, diagnosis and treatment of short esophagus is one of the&#xD;
      controversies of the past within esophageal surgery which has recently re-emerged. This&#xD;
      entity was described in detail by radiologists in the 60's. Many surgeons confirmed its&#xD;
      existence in the operating room, describing the clinical, anatomical and surgical patterns&#xD;
      along with the modalities of surgical treatment of shortened esophagus following progressive&#xD;
      fibrosis and retraction of the esophageal wall consequent to severe long standing&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Contrarily other surgeons denied its existence&#xD;
      claiming that the gastro-oesophageal junction can be reduced into the abdomen without tension&#xD;
      in virtually all patients and that the esophagus is, in fact, not shortened. In the case&#xD;
      series of open antireflux surgery, the percentage of dedicated procedures aimed to treat the&#xD;
      condition of non-reducibility of the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) below the diaphragm is&#xD;
      highly variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present era of minimally invasive antireflux surgery, short esophagus again seems to&#xD;
      originate controversy and open debate. Many thousands of laparoscopic standard antireflux&#xD;
      operations have been performed in the world and numerous articles report satisfactory short&#xD;
      and medium-term functional results in over 90% of cases, although in these experiences the&#xD;
      need for a tailored approach has not emerged. However, in the last two or three years, many&#xD;
      reports on the diagnosis and laparoscopic management of shortened esophagus in GERD surgery&#xD;
      have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The controversy is based on four facts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the indications for surgical therapy of GERD are restricted to severe, long standing&#xD;
           cardial incontinence and to the complications associated with a hiatus hernia, then the&#xD;
           number of patients with panmural esophagitis and esophageal shortening will be higher in&#xD;
           percentage than if the indications are open also to refluxers otherwise treatable with&#xD;
           intermittent low dosage medical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The clinical-instrumental predictors of esophageal elastic or fibrotic shortening are&#xD;
           not defined and current studies adopt different evaluation criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The perception of &quot;excessive tension&quot; of the fundoplication at the operating table is&#xD;
           highly subjective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During the process of progressive shortening of the esophagus, the portion of the fundus&#xD;
           attracted above the diaphragm may take the appearance of a funnel hardly distinguishable&#xD;
           from a thickened oesophagus. Therefore the gastric fundus may be erroneously wrapped&#xD;
           around the herniated stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment of the length of the esophagus in order to decide which surgical&#xD;
      technique to adopt is controversial. Yau et all. demonstrated that there is an association&#xD;
      between esophageal shortening measured by standard manometry and postoperative&#xD;
      para-esophageal herniation, but this increased risk is small. Predictors of the need for&#xD;
      esophageal lengthening procedure are para-esophageal hernia, Barrett's esophagus and failed&#xD;
      antireflux surgery. However no preoperative assessment can give information on the degree of&#xD;
      elasticity or fibrosis of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through laparoscopic surgery, by cranially distending the diaphragmatic hiatus the&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum may by artefact increase the length of the intra-abdominal esophagus, and&#xD;
      the impossibility to manually palpate and feel the tension applied to the esophagus to bring&#xD;
      the GEJ below the diaphragm may make it difficult to recognize a condition of shortened&#xD;
      esophagus, more so if the experience of the surgeon is not adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of a radiological classification used since the sixties, later validated with a&#xD;
      radiological-manometric study it was demonstrated that the progressive orad migration of the&#xD;
      GEJ is associated with an increasing severity of cardial incontinence and gastro-esophageal&#xD;
      reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that the permanent orad displacement of the GEJ across or above the&#xD;
      diaphragm is not infrequent in patients affected by various grades of GERD and that it is&#xD;
      present in 50% of patients undergoing antireflux surgery for severe, not otherwise manageable&#xD;
      GERD. Up to 25% of patients may require a procedure of lengthening of the esophagus in order&#xD;
      to place the fundoplication below the diaphragm without tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The missed diagnosis of short esophagus and the consequent inadequacy of treatment is one of&#xD;
      the major causes of failure of antireflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the number of antireflux operations, mainly laparoscopic, performed per year has&#xD;
      remarkably increased, the issue of the so-called short esophagus is today one of the major&#xD;
      points in the management of antireflux surgery, which deserves reappraisal and definitive&#xD;
      clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily clinical practice of surgeons dedicated to therapy of esophageal diseases could&#xD;
      take advantage of the definition of frequency, preoperative predictors, intraoperative&#xD;
      management and post operative outcomes of cases of foreshortened esophagus in order to offer&#xD;
      the patient affected by GERD, the elements necessary for a conscious choice of therapy,&#xD;
      whether medical or surgical and to plan the best performance of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS OF THE STUDY Principal aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define the percentage of cases among the total of antireflux procedures performed, in&#xD;
           which, after standard isolation of the ge junction and eventual dissection of the&#xD;
           mediastinal esophagus at least two centimetres of esophagus can not be replaced without&#xD;
           any applied tension below the apex of the diaphragmatic hiatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To define the percentage of surgical procedures aimed to treat electively a condition of&#xD;
           non reducible, foreshortened esophagus, among a multicentric formed case series of&#xD;
           patients submitted to antireflux surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To define the preoperative clinical and instrumental predictors for a surgical procedure&#xD;
           aimed to treat foreshortened esophagus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To record the intra-operative, postoperative, 6 month and 12 month outcome of procedures&#xD;
           adopted for the surgical treatment of GERD;&#xD;
