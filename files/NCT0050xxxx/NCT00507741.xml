  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial of vintafolide administered to participants with advanced&#xD;
      ovarian and endometrial cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate&#xD;
      vitamin receptor (FR). Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on&#xD;
      virtually all ovarian cancers as well as the majority of endometrial cancers. Early clinical&#xD;
      evidence in a small number of Phase I patients suggests that vintafolide may have antitumor&#xD;
      effect in women with advanced ovarian cancer and that it is generally well-tolerated. This&#xD;
      evidence suggests that vintafolide may be useful as chemotherapy against advanced ovarian and&#xD;
      endometrial cancers. The primary objective of Part A of this study is to collect data on&#xD;
      clinical benefit produced by therapy with vintafolide. The primary objective of Part B of&#xD;
      this study is to collect data on the safety and efficacy of vintafolide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo imaging with the FR targeting investigational imaging agent&#xD;
      ertafolide (EC20, FolateScan) during the screening period to confirm eligibility for the&#xD;
      treatment portion of the clinical trial. Clinical evidence suggests that ertafolide may be&#xD;
      used to identify women with cancers that express the target receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the safety and tolerability of both vintafolide and ertafolide will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Screening: After completion of all screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility, all participants receive a 1- to 2-mL injection of 0.1 mg ertafolide labeled with 20 to 25 mCi of technetium-99m Part A: Induction phase of treatment: Two 4-week cycles; if stable disease or better at week 8 computed tomography (CT), participant may proceed into maintenance phase, comprised of 4-week cycles with CT every 8 weeks. Participants continue on study until they experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or attain protocol-defined clinical benefit. Part B: 4-week cycles with CT every 8 weeks. Participants continue until they experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or attain protocol-defined clinical benefit.</description>

Maintenance Phase: vintafolide 2.5 mg intravenous injection, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, weeks 1 and 3 of each 4 week cycle. At the investigator's discretion, participants may receive vintafolide via an ambulatory pump after the first week of therapy has been administered in the clinic setting.
