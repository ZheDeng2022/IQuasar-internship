  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well megestrol works in treating patients with&#xD;
      endometrial neoplasia or endometrial hyperplasia. Estrogen can cause the growth of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer cells. Hormone therapy using megestrol may fight endometrial cancer by&#xD;
      blocking the use of estrogen by the abnormal cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the frequency of complete remission by a central pathology review panel in&#xD;
      diagnosed endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) patients treated for 24 weeks with oral&#xD;
      continuous versus interrupted progestin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether quality of life is superior in patients who take continuous megestrol&#xD;
      versus sequential megestrol by evaluating mood, concerns about weight changes and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the expression levels of PTEN using immunohistochemistry and to explore the&#xD;
      association of PTEN expression levels with patient response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the expression levels of the hormone receptors ER and PR using&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and to explore the association of ER/PR expression levels with patient&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess histomorphometry and karyometry characteristics of the pre-treatment biopsy in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify patterns of protein and glycoprotein expression associated with invasive&#xD;
      cancer in serum specimens obtained from patients with a diagnosis of atypical endometrial&#xD;
      hyperplasia (AEH) or EIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess differences in plasma concentrations of megestrol acetate HPLC in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess patient compliance to their treatment regimen using HPLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to the collection method of the initial/intake&#xD;
      biopsy (dilatation and curettage vs all other methods). Patients are randomized to 1 of the&#xD;
      following treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN 1: Patients receive oral megestrol twice daily every day for 24 weeks. Approximately&#xD;
      twelve weeks after treatment starts, clinical blood tests are obtained and research serum and&#xD;
      plasma collected. Twenty-four weeks constitutes one course of treatment and a pill count is&#xD;
      performed during the 12-week f/u visit and at the completion of the treatment course to&#xD;
      determine compliance. After progestin therapy the patient has an induced-withdrawal bleed.&#xD;
      Patients in this arm undergo a re-evaluation biopsy and hysterectomy a minimum of two weeks&#xD;
      and a maximum of eight weeks after completing the megestrol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN 2: Patients receive oral megestrol twice daily for two weeks continuously followed by&#xD;
      no treatment for two weeks. This course is repeated for a total of 24 weeks. Approximately&#xD;
      twelve weeks after treatment starts, clinical blood tests are obtained and research serum and&#xD;
      plasma collected. Twenty-four weeks constitutes one course of treatment and a pill count is&#xD;
      performed during the 12-week f/u visit and at the completion of the treatment course to&#xD;
      determine compliance. After progestin therapy the patient has an induced-withdrawal bleed.&#xD;
      Patients in this arm undergo a re-evaluation biopsy and hysterectomy a minimum of two weeks&#xD;
      and a maximum of eight weeks after the megestrol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN 3: (Closed as of 6/3/2010) Patients do not receive megestrol. At the discretion of&#xD;
      the managing physician, patients undergo the re-evaluation biopsy and hysterectomy anytime&#xD;
      between 2-20 weeks after enrollment and randomization. Patients undergo biopsy and blood&#xD;
      sample collection periodically for immunological and pharmacodynamic studies. Samples are&#xD;
      analyzed for presence or absence of myoinvasion or deep myoinvasion in hysterectomy&#xD;
      specimens, hormone receptivity status, and to compare PTEN status against treatment via&#xD;
      karyometry or morphometry, expression of VEGF and tenascin-C (TN-C) via ELISA, presence of&#xD;
      TN-C fragmentation via western immunoblots, additional biomarkers via proteomic analysis,&#xD;
      protein and glycoprotein expression patterns via electrophoresis and image analysis, and&#xD;
      plasma megestrol concentrations via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Patients&#xD;
      complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and two items on bleeding and&#xD;
      weight gain at baseline and periodically during study. A Treatment Decision Assessment is&#xD;
      completed at baseline, and for patients withdrawing from the study, a Study Withdraw&#xD;
      Assessment is also completed. There will be no additional follow-up on this study after the&#xD;
      patient's hysterectomy.&#xD;
