  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers propose to apply Social Cognitive Theory to improve understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanisms of physical activity adherence for endometrial cancer survivors participating in a&#xD;
      physical activity intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test a Social Cognitive Theory-based model of physical activity adoption among&#xD;
           sedentary endometrial cancer survivors receiving an intervention to increase physical&#xD;
           activity. The model includes hypotheses about the effect of self-efficacy and outcome&#xD;
           expectations on physical activity adherence, the effects of four sources of efficacy&#xD;
           information (mastery experience, verbal persuasion, modeling, and physiological&#xD;
           feedback) on self-efficacy and subsequent exercise adherence, and the influence of&#xD;
           physical activity outcomes on subsequent self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and&#xD;
           physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To elucidate the influence on self-efficacy of cardiorespiratory fitness and somatic&#xD;
           sensations while engaging in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether the received dose of an intervention based on Social Cognitive&#xD;
           Theory is related to physical activity adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the effects of adherence to physical activity on endometrial cancer survivors'&#xD;
           quality of life and stress as assessed by self-report and salivary cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To test the feasibility of a web-based maintenance intervention for women who have&#xD;
           completed the phone counseling portion of the study.&#xD;

      Women who have been successfully treated for endometrial cancer will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. After you agree to participate you will be asked questions about&#xD;
      your physical activity to make sure you are eligible. You will only be allowed to participate&#xD;
      in this study if your physician feels it is safe for you to engage in moderate physical&#xD;
      activity, so you will be asked to have him or her complete a form about your health&#xD;
      conditions. Information about you cancer and treatment history will be collected from your&#xD;
      medical records as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will come to M. D. Anderson for study visits&#xD;
      twice at the beginning of the study. If needed, the activities for these first 2 visits can&#xD;
      be combined into 1 visit, though it will mean that the single visit will take a little longer&#xD;
      than each of the 2 visits. After the first visit, you will be asked to return after 2, 4, and&#xD;
      6 months. Each visit will take about 2 hours. Three (3) months and 6 months after the last&#xD;
      visit, you will be called to answer questions about your physical activity. It will take&#xD;
      about 10 minutes to answer the questions. In case you cannot be reached by phone, the&#xD;
      questionnaires will be mailed to you. You will be asked to mail the questionnaire back in&#xD;
      with a pre-paid addressed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit you will complete questionnaires about your quality of life, medical&#xD;
      conditions, and how physically active you are currently and have been in the past. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will take about 45 minutes to complete. A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG-a&#xD;
      test to measure the electrical activity of the heart) will be performed. If your ECG test is&#xD;
      not normal you will be informed. You will practice using the exercise bicycle that will be&#xD;
      used in the fitness testing at the later visits. You will be asked to provide a saliva sample&#xD;
      by placing a cotton roll in your mouth until it is saturated and then placing it back in a&#xD;
      plastic vial without using your hands. This sample will be for practice and will be&#xD;
      discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be given an ActiGraph to wear for 5 days. This is a small light device that you&#xD;
      wear on your waist during the day. It records how active you are. You will also be given a&#xD;
      handheld computer that you will use for 5 days to answer questions about physical activity.&#xD;
      The computers are small (about 4-1/2 by 3 inches) and light (about 4 1/2 ounces). The&#xD;
      computer will prompt you to enter information up to 8 times a day. Answering these questions&#xD;
      will take up to 5 minutes. You will be asked to return the Actigraph and the computer on your&#xD;
      second visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 days, you will come back to M. D. Anderson for your second study visit. During this&#xD;
      visit, you will be asked to complete questionnaires about physical activity that will take&#xD;
      about 1 hour. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG--a test to measure the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the heart) performed. You will perform a fitness test, in which you will ride a&#xD;
      stationary bicycle while your heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration (breathing) are&#xD;
      monitored. You will also be asked to complete two tasks on a computer. After the second&#xD;
      visit, you will again use the handheld computer and wear an Actigraph for 5 days. You will&#xD;
      also be given 10 vials with a container bag and instructions on collecting saliva samples.&#xD;
      You will be asked to provide saliva samples 5 times per day for 2 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your second visit, you will meet with an exercise physiologist, a specially-trained&#xD;
      health care professional who will design a personalized exercise program for you, that will&#xD;
      involve walking (up to 30 minutes) on most days of the week. If walking is difficult or&#xD;
      painful for you, another form of exercise will be substituted. In addition to receiving a&#xD;
      personalized exercise program, you will also receive telephone counseling between your visits&#xD;
      to M. D. Anderson and printed materials. Both will provide information and support for your&#xD;
      exercise program. The telephone counseling calls will take place once a week during the first&#xD;
      2 months, every other week during Months 3 and 4, and once a month during Months 5 and 6. The&#xD;
      phone counselor will talk to you about your exercise program and how it is working for you.&#xD;
      The telephone calls will take place at a time that is convenient to you, and will take about&#xD;
      15-20 minutes each time. Some of these telephone counseling calls may be audiotaped, so that&#xD;
      the counselors' supervisors can make sure the counseling is done correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of the 2-month, 4-month, and 6-month clinic visits (Visits 3, 4, and 5), you will&#xD;
      do another fitness test, and any necessary adjustments to your exercise program will be made.&#xD;
      This means that if the goals for exercise were set too high or too low, how often the&#xD;
      exercise occurs or how long each exercise session lasts will be changed. For example, if the&#xD;
      exercise physiologist first recommended that you walk for 15 minutes a day 5 days a week, but&#xD;
      you report that you can't walk for 15 minutes, the length of the walk may be reduced. You&#xD;
      will also fill out the questionnaires and do the tasks on the computer at these visits. You&#xD;
      will complete a brief (5 minutes) program evaluation. You will also be asked to answer&#xD;
      questions on the handheld computer for 5 days before and after each these visits. You will&#xD;
      also be asked to wear the Actigraph for 5 days before and after each of these visits. At the&#xD;
      last visit, you will also be given 10 vials with a container bag and instructions on&#xD;
      collecting saliva samples. You will be asked to provide saliva samples 5 times per day for 2&#xD;
      consecutive days. The study staff will give you a prepaid mailing envelopes so you can return&#xD;
      the computer, the Actigraph, and the package of vials to them by mail, after the last 5-day&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 326 participants will be enrolled for this study. For&#xD;
      the pilot phase, which has been completed, 22 endometrial cancer survivors and 37 comparison&#xD;
      participants with no history of cancer were enrolled. For the main phase of the study, for&#xD;
      which you are enrolling, up to 267 endometrial cancer survivors will be enrolled. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
