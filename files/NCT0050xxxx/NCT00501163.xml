      Participants will be asked to do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A screening session in which you will take part in a diagnostic interview that will take&#xD;
           about 2-3 hours to complete and will address your medical history. If you've recently&#xD;
           participated in one of Dr. Haupt's or Dr. Newcomer's studies (HRPO #03-1281, 01-0134, or&#xD;
           04-0191) you may not have to complete this screening interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An ultrasound test of your heart and blood vessels where an ultrasound machine will use&#xD;
           sound waves to create images that allow the main blood vessels in your neck to be&#xD;
           examined. You will be lying down for the procedure, and a colorless gel will be applied&#xD;
           to the side of your neck where the handheld probe (called a transducer) will be placed.&#xD;
           The transducer will then be gently moved over each side of your neck. This procedure&#xD;
           will take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) study where the amount of fat in your liver will be&#xD;
           measured. The MRI involves having your body painlessly scanned inside a tubular machine,&#xD;
           while lying on a table for about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Some routine blood tests to assess glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) control and liver&#xD;
           function, as well as an additional hepatitis screen if you have a history of hepatitis.&#xD;
           You will go to the Intensive Research Unit (IRU) or Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) after an&#xD;
           8 to 10-hour overnight fast (except water). Approximately 42 ml (3 tablespoons) of blood&#xD;
           will be obtained from you, and you will also have your height, weight, blood pressure,&#xD;
           and waist and hip measurements taken. This will take approximately one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure your body fat and body muscle&#xD;
           content. The DEXA scan involves lying on a table in a private room wearing a hospital&#xD;
           gown for about 15 minutes while a machine silently measures the amount of fat in your&#xD;
           body. The DEXA scan is part of the research study and gives the researcher a picture of&#xD;
           how much fat is in your body.&#xD;

      In comparison to the general population, major mental illness is associated with higher rates&#xD;
      of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. These problems can result in a life span that can be&#xD;
      up to 25 years shorter than in people without a major mental illness. This study uses&#xD;
      established medical tests that can predict how you might be affected. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the risk for these disorders in people with schizophrenia with the risk&#xD;
      for these disorders in other people without schizophrenia.&#xD;
