      RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIGB), may carry&#xD;
      radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such&#xD;
      as irinotecan and vincristine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving iodine I 131 MIGB&#xD;
      together with irinotecan and vincristine may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 MIGB&#xD;
      when given together with irinotecan and vincristine in treating young patients with resistant&#xD;
      or relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine&#xD;
           when given in combination with fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and vincristine in&#xD;
           young patients with refractory or relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine when&#xD;
           combined with fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and vincristine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is a therapeutic response to this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine&#xD;
      (^131I-MIBG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ^131I-MIBG IV over 1½-2 hours on day 1, vincristine IV on days 0 and 7, and&#xD;
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 0-4 and 7-11. Treatment repeats every 56 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
