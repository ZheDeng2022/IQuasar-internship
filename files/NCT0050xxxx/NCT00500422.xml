      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of the drug Velcade&#xD;
      (bortezomib) that can be given together with gemcitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      (Doxil) in the treatment of advanced cancer. The effect of this combination treatment on&#xD;
      tumor growth will also be studied.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is a newer form of the common anticancer drug Adriamycin. It&#xD;
      is enclosed in liposomes, which are fat particles found normally in the body. This new form&#xD;
      is designed to act against cancer cells while causing less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is a drug that has shown to be active in patients with several different cancers&#xD;
      including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and certain lymphomas. Bortezomib is a new drug&#xD;
      that is designed to block the proteins needed for tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups of 3 participants that are less than 65 years old and 3-6 participants that are at&#xD;
      least 65 years old will be enrolled at a time. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      level than the group before as long as no serious side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose is determined, up to 30 additional patients with small cell&#xD;
      cancer or neuroendocrine carcinoma, and up to 30 patients with T cell lymphoma will be&#xD;
      treated at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin through a vein over about 2&#xD;
      hours. The drug will be given once every 21 days (3 weeks or 1 cycle). Gemcitabine will be&#xD;
      given through a vein over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Patients will only&#xD;
      receive the combination of both drugs on Day 1; on that day pegylated liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      will be given before the dose of gemcitabine. Bortezomib will be given by vein on Days 1, 4,&#xD;
      8 and 11 of every 21 days, except for the first group of patients who will receive it on days&#xD;
      1 and 8 only. Participants whose tumors are responding to treatment may continue treatment if&#xD;
      their doctor approves for as long as they respond, as long as there are no serious side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of a nationwide shortage of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you may continue&#xD;
      treatment with gemcitabine and bortezomib. If pegylated liposomal doxorubicin becomes&#xD;
      available, you may be able to receive it again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, you will have a weekly blood test (about 2 tablespoons of blood) and a&#xD;
      physical exam. X-rays and other scans, such as MRIs and CT scans, will be done at 6 weeks to&#xD;
      measure the size of the tumor. Other tests will be done if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be stopped if the cancer grows or if severe side effects occur, and other&#xD;
      treatments may be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. All three drugs are approved by the FDA for use against&#xD;
      some kinds of cancer. Their use in this study is investigational. Up to 276 patients will&#xD;
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
