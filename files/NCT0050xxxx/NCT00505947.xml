      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with infliximab improves macular edema&#xD;
      which is refractory to laser photocoagulation in patients with diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy affects on average 30% of all patients with diabetes. Good glycaemic control&#xD;
      delays the onset and progression of retinopathy in subjects with both type 1 and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. However, the incidence of retinopathy has not been declining in type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      over the last decades, even if visual acuity may be better preserved. As many as 20% of the&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have already retinopathy at the time of diagnosis of&#xD;
      diabetes. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a serious manifestation of diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      that produces loss of central vision. Data from the Wisconsin Epidemiological Study of&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) estimate that after 15 years of known duration of diabetes the&#xD;
      prevalence of DME is 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 25% in patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes who are treated with insulin, and 14% in the patients with type 2 diabetes who are&#xD;
      not treated with insulin. Concerning the natural history a previous study has shown that 53%&#xD;
      of the eyes with DME involving the centre of the macula, lost two or three lines of visual&#xD;
      acuity over a two year period. In addition, in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study&#xD;
      (ETDRS), 33% of untreated eyes available for follow-up at the 3-year visit, all with oedema&#xD;
      involving the centre of the macula at baseline, had experienced a 15 or more letter decrease&#xD;
      in visual acuity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The federal budgetary cost of blindness was estimated to be $4.1 billion in the U.S. for the&#xD;
      year 1990, and 97% of these costs were accounted for by the working-age adult group. Health&#xD;
      care and economic burdens are further compounded by the resulting decline in quality of life;&#xD;
      thus, the true impact on society cannot be estimated on a monetary basis alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the etiology of DME is unclear, an altered local expression of the pleiotropic&#xD;
      cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may play an important role in pathogenesis. Standard&#xD;
      treatment of clinically significant DME (i.e. reduction of visual acuity due to DME) consists&#xD;
      of laser photocoagulation (two sessions for optimal results?). However, this treatment&#xD;
      effectively reduces the risk of vision loss in only 50% of cases. Even among those patients&#xD;
      who achieve an initial response recurrences are common, requiring ongoing treatment.&#xD;
      Vitreomacular traction or the vitreous itself may play a role in increased retinal vascular&#xD;
      permeability. Removal of the vitreous or relief of mechanical traction with pars plana&#xD;
      vitrectomy and membrane stripping may be followed by substantial resolution of macular edema&#xD;
      and improvement in visual acuity. However, this treatment may be applicable only in specific&#xD;
      subset of eyes with DME. It also requires a complex surgical intervention with its inherent&#xD;
      risks, recovery time and expenses. Other treatment modalities such as pharmacologic therapy&#xD;
      with oral protein kinase C inhibitors, antibodies targeted at vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF), intravitreal corticosteroid injection, or high doses of non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents that lower retinal expression of TNF are under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody with an approximate molecular weight of&#xD;
      149,100 Dalton. It is composed of human constant and murine variable regions. Infliximab&#xD;
      binds specifically to human tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) with an association constant&#xD;
      of 1010 M-1. Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous&#xD;
      perfusion and is purified by a series of steps that includes measures to inactivate and&#xD;
      remove viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab is currently used for the treatment of inflammatory arthritic conditions and&#xD;
      inflammatory disease with a favorable safety profile. Because of the limitations of current&#xD;
      treatments for DME, and based on our recent findings indicating that infliximab is an&#xD;
      effective therapy for cystoid ME associated with uveitis, we decided to assess whether&#xD;
      infliximab is effective for patients with diabetes (type 1 or 2) and sight-threatening DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found that a clinically meaningful anatomic and functional improvement was achieved&#xD;
      after two infliximab infusions in 4 of 6 eyes with severe diffuse DME (i.e. macular thickness&#xD;
      &gt;400 μm); in contrast the remaining 2 eyes with coexisting epiretinal membranes did not&#xD;
      improve. The observed recovery of useful vision represents a very significant clinical&#xD;
      result, especially for those eyes in which DME was refractory to laser photocoagulation.&#xD;
      Comparable beneficial results have been obtained in our patients with severe, chronic cystoid&#xD;
      ME complicating intermediate uveitis, Adamantiades-Behcet's disease, or adult type vascular&#xD;
      pseudotumor. Repeated treatment in one diabetic patient produced a further significant&#xD;
      improvement of DME, indicating that the clinical response to anti-TNF dosing regimens is&#xD;
      individualized, as it has also been observed in patients with arthritis, or in patients with&#xD;
      uveitic ME. Thus, a sustained beneficial effect of infliximab for DME may require long-term&#xD;
      treatment. Infliximab was well tolerated by our patients in all studies conducted at our&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from a preliminary study suggest a central role for TNF-mediated pathogenesis&#xD;
      mechanisms in DME. Recent experimental evidence also indicates that low-grade subclinical&#xD;
      inflammation is responsible for many of the signature vascular lesions of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy On the other hand, studies in patients with arthritis have shown that anti-TNF&#xD;
      therapy negatively affects vascular permeability and angiogenesis by decreasing the potent&#xD;
      angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor, which has been implicated directly in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of DME and diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four women, aged 52 to 76 years, with type 2 diabetes who were in danger of vision loss due&#xD;
      to severe DME were included in this prospective, non-comparative case series. They all used&#xD;
      oral antidiabetic agents for 14 to 20 years, while one patient required exogenous insulin&#xD;
      therapy for the last 4 years. Patients were free of other major medical disorders and they&#xD;
      had no evidence of infection. Following full discussion and after obtaining informed consent,&#xD;
      2 infusions of infliximab (5mg/kg, Remicade, Schering-Plough, Greece) with one month&#xD;
      interval, were given intravenously over 3 hours in an outpatient setting on a compassionate&#xD;
      basis. Additional infusions were offered in 3 patients. Concomitant medications remained&#xD;
      unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete ophthalmic examination and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT, Model 3000, Zeiss,&#xD;
      Humphrey Systems) were performed immediately before each infliximab infusion, as well as 2&#xD;
      months after the last infusion. The main outcome measurements were best corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity (BCVA) and macular thickness. The OCT-derived maximum height of DME was recorded as&#xD;
      described previously in detail. The student t-test for paired data was used to compare&#xD;
      logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) transformed BCVA, as well as macular&#xD;
      thickness between baseline and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DME was present in 7 eyes, 6 of which were refractory to previous treatment with laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation. DME was classified as severe in 6 eyes (range of macular thickness 420-720&#xD;
      μm) and as mild in 1 eye (macular thickness of 290 μm after vitrectomy). A dense epiretinal&#xD;
      membrane was present in 2 eyes with severe DME. BCVA at baseline was profoundly impaired,&#xD;
      ranging from 'hand motion' to 0.1 at the Snellen chart. At one month after the first&#xD;
      infliximab infusion, macular thickness had decreased in 5 from 7 eyes from [mean(SD)]503&#xD;
      (171) to 426 (165) μm (p=0.033). The 2 eyes with coexisting epiretinal membranes did not&#xD;
      improve. Two months after the second infusion, the macular thickness had further regressed to&#xD;
      330 (134) μm (range 170 to 515 μm, p=0.028, compared to baseline). The BCVA was increased in&#xD;
      all 5 eyes from a baseline mean at the Snellen chart of 0.03 to 0.15 (logMAR 1.42 (0.45) to&#xD;
      0.82 (0.27), p=0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months post-baseline a third infliximab infusion was offered in those 3 patients who had&#xD;
      the least improvement of DME. Repeated OCT after 2 months revealed a further decrease of&#xD;
      macular thickness in 3 of 5 eyes, by 7 %, 15 % and 23 %, respectively. At this point the&#xD;
      patient who still had the most severe condition received a fourth infliximab infusion;&#xD;
      remarkably, a repeated OCT two months later revealed a marked resolution of severe DME, while&#xD;
      BCVA had improved from counting fingers at baseline to 0.2. Infliximab therapy was well&#xD;
      tolerated and no ocular or extra-ocular side effects were noted. In further available&#xD;
      follow-up ranging from 4 to 7 months post-treatment, a recurrence of DME was observed in 2 of&#xD;
      5 eyes, albeit at a less severe level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For detailed information about the safety of infliximab please refer to summary of product&#xD;
      characteristics. Active tuberculosis may develop soon after the initiation of treatment with&#xD;
      infliximab. Before prescribing the drug, physicians should screen patients for latent&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection or active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, we believe that administration of infliximab may be a reasonable&#xD;
      therapeutic approach in diabetic patients who are in danger of vision loss due to refractory&#xD;
      DME. Therefore, a controlled study on the safety and efficacy of infliximab treatment in DME&#xD;
      refractory to laser photocoagulation is warranted. Because of our preliminary results (27),&#xD;
      we feel that all patients who will participate in such a study should be granted the&#xD;
      opportunity to receive infliximab, therefore a cross-over design is proposed. A cross-over&#xD;
      design would also enhance the statistical power of the study, achieving the same statistical&#xD;
      power with fewer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this study, additional questions could be addressed. For example, TNF in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes is secreted mainly by the fat cells and is involved in the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and decline in the pancreatic beta-cell function. Previous studies examined the&#xD;
      effect of anti-TNF treatment on indices of insulin resistance in non-diabetic subjects and&#xD;
      showed that chronic treatment with anti-TNF agents may improve insulin sensitivity in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research programme will involve one country (Greece), and will include a total of 26&#xD;
      patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The planned treatment period will be 32 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients with clinically significant DME (i.e. BCVA &lt; 0.4) refractory to at least two&#xD;
      sessions of laser photocoagulation or who have leaking microaneurysms within the foveal&#xD;
      avascular zone (FAZ) making laser photocoagulation unsafe for the central vision, will be&#xD;
      included in the study. The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, ICH&#xD;
      guidelines, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirements&#xD;
