  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorectal Crohn's disease is one of the most problematic and debilitating conditions&#xD;
      encountered in colorectal practise. The condition is usually chronic, debilitating, and&#xD;
      frequently refractory to current medications. Failure to respond to medical therapy may&#xD;
      ultimately result in proctocolectomy and ileostomy, even in the absence of more proximal&#xD;
      colonic disease. Isolated anorectal Crohn's disease is reported in 3 to 5% of Crohn's&#xD;
      patients. In Crohn's patients as a whole, anorectal involvement is reported in up to one&#xD;
      third to one half of patients, in addition to either colonic or enteric Crohn's disease. In&#xD;
      spite of the previously reported painless nature of anorectal Crohn's disease, it is the&#xD;
      author's experience that the condition can be inordinately painful due to deeply eroding&#xD;
      fissures, oedematous skin tags, and painful induration of the perianal region.&#xD;
