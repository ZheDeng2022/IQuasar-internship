    <textblock>
      A randomized, parallel, multicenter, active-controlled with 48 weeks of treatment period.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive clevudine alone for 48 weeks or clevudine for 24 weeks&#xD;
      followed by 24 weeks of clevudine in addition to monthly HBV vaccination.The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate efficacy of combination of clevudine and HBV vaccine over clevudine&#xD;
      alone in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patient is coinfected with HCV, HDV or HIV.&#xD;
