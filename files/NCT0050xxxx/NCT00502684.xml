    <textblock>
      Surgery for breast cancer has a major role in enhancing long term survival and cure, but&#xD;
      several physiological aspects associated with surgery are implicated as enhancing tumor&#xD;
      spread and formation of distant metastases. These include: an increase in pro-angiogenic&#xD;
      factors, direct spread of tumor cells, accumulation of grown factors, immune suppression and&#xD;
      direct effects of anesthetics and opiate pain relievers on cancer cells. Some of these&#xD;
      pro-metastatic mechanism may be blocked by the interventions proposed in this study, namely&#xD;
      by administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and COX2 inhibitors around the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that surgery increases levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins, which&#xD;
      in turn may promote the release of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, and enhance&#xD;
      vascularization of micro metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opiates given for pain relief during and after surgery have been reported to enhance tumor&#xD;
      cell division and cause immune suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system is significantly suppressed during surgery. This suppression has been shown&#xD;
      to affect the systemic resistance to infection as well as neoplastic metastatic processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that increased levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins add to&#xD;
      the immune suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in rats found that peri-operative administration of the beta beta-blocker propranolol&#xD;
      together with the COX2 inhibitor etodolac significantly reduced the suppression of NK cell&#xD;
      activity as well as the risk for distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent retrospective clinical study found that among breast cancer patients treated with a&#xD;
      combination of regional anesthesia and a COX inhibitor the recurrence rated were&#xD;
      significantly less than among patients undergoing surgery without these two interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed prospective trial is to examine if peri-operative administration&#xD;
      of the combination of a beta-blocker together with a COX2 inhibitor will prevent suppression&#xD;
      of cellular immunity, decrease VEGF levels, and decrease cancer recurrence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study breast cancer patients will be treated with a combination of a&#xD;
      beta-blocker and COX2 inhibitor (or placebo) before, during and after surgery. (A control&#xD;
      group of healthy women will serve as untreated controls). The variables which will be&#xD;
      examined are: number and activity of NK cells, levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, serum stress&#xD;
      hormones and angiogenic factors, and the ability of leukocytes to produce Th1 and Th2&#xD;
      cytokines as a result of in vitro stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these immediate parameters, long term follow up will be conducted in order to&#xD;
      determine the effect of the intervention on long term cancer recurrence over five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done using t-tests, ANOVA, and multivariate regressions, with&#xD;
      regard to the known risk factors for recurrence such as tumor grade, lymph node involvement&#xD;
      etc. Sample size for immunological parameters will be 40 patients in each group and 20&#xD;
      healthy women. Sample size for estimates of cancer recurrence at five years of follow up wiil&#xD;
      be 460 women (230 in each group). This sample size provides a power of 80% to detect a 50%&#xD;
      reduction in cancer recurrence at an Î± of 0.05.&#xD;

      Scientific Background Anesthesia and surgery are stressful situations which cause&#xD;
      neuro-endocrine, metabolic and neurological responses. Cancer surgery may cause a decrease in&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic factors, and enable dissemination of tumor cells through manipulation of the&#xD;
      tumor and it blood vessels, as well as local and systemic secretion of growth hormones, and&#xD;
      immune suppression. The magnitude of the response depends on many factors, including the&#xD;
      extent of tissue injury, technique of anesthesia and type of analgesia, transfusions,&#xD;
      temperature changes, psychological stress and genetic factors (1-3). The tissue damage starts&#xD;
      a cascade of local and systemic processes which include secretion of hormones and cytokines&#xD;
      (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operatively, suppression of several immune functions occurs, and may last for weeks. The&#xD;
      cellular immunity undergoes suppression, while the humoral immunity remains almost entirely&#xD;
      intact (1). These changes in cell mediated immunity may impact systemic resistance to&#xD;
      infection as well as metastatic processes. Specifically, NK cells have a pivotal role in&#xD;
      defense from neoplastic processes. Studies have shown that high levels of activity of NK&#xD;
      cells are associated with long term survival (1). Therefore, understanding of the processes&#xD;
      which cause post-operative immune suppression, and prevention of such suppression, are of&#xD;
      clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several substances which are secreted after surgery are thought to contribute to immune&#xD;
      suppression in general and NK cell dysfunction in particular. These include prostaglandins,&#xD;
      catecholamines, steroids and endorphins, have all been shown to suppress several&#xD;
      immunological functions in vitro (1). Animal studies have shown that administration of&#xD;
      prostaglandins and catecholamines to rats suppresses NK cell activity in vivo, in association&#xD;
      with elevated susceptibility to metastases 4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rats undergoing a laparotomy, peri-operative administration of beta- adrenergic blockers&#xD;
      together with COX-2 inhibitors significantly abrogated the NK cell suppression as well as the&#xD;
      enhanced susceptibility to metastases after surgery (4,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of effect of prostaglandins and catecholamines on NK cells has been elucidated&#xD;
      (1): beta- adrenergic receptors and prostanoid receptors on the cell membrane cause elevated&#xD;
      levels of intra-cellular cAMP when activated by their ligand, which in turn interferes with&#xD;
      the NK cell cytotoxic activity against cancer cells or viral pathogens. Since the elevated&#xD;
      intra-cellular levels of cAMP is caused by each type of receptor independently, blockade of&#xD;
      only one of these pathways will enable an increase in intracellular cAMP levels via the other&#xD;
      pathway, and have no effect of the suppression of cytotoxic activity. Therefore, simultaneous&#xD;
      blockade of both pathways may be more effective. Research in rats directly supports this&#xD;
      hypothesis (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells of the immune system express mostly beta-2 adrenergic receptors, and to a lesser degree&#xD;
      beta-1 receptors (9, 10), so pharmacological blockade requires use of a non specific blocker&#xD;
      which can block both types of receptors. The beta-antagonist propranolol was chosen for this&#xD;
      experiment since it is a non specific beta-blocker, capable of blocking both types of&#xD;
      receptors, as well as extensive clinical experience with this drug and the fact that it is a&#xD;
      relatively safe drug. The COX-2 inhibitor chosen is Etodlac (Etopan), which has the advantage&#xD;
      of being a selective COX-2 inhibitor,synthesized during injury and inflammation, with little&#xD;
      effect on the COX-1 enzyme, which is associated with ongoing maintenance of tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetics and opiate analgesics also cause NK cell suppression. Research in animals and in&#xD;
      humans has shown that morphine and fentanyl cause suppression of NK cell activity, and&#xD;
      enhance susceptibility to breast cancer metastases in rats (11,12). Lower doses of opiates in&#xD;
      patients have been reported to decrease the immune suppression magnitude and duration (13).&#xD;
      Therefore, peri-operative interventions which decrease the use of opiates (or their&#xD;
      endogenous secretion) may be clinically important factors in cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to immune suppression, endogenous and exogenous opiates (endorphins morphine,&#xD;
      fentanyl) have been implicated as promoting metastatic spread and neoplastic proliferation&#xD;
      via other mechanisms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catecholamines have been reported to increase VEGF secretion by human cancer cells, and&#xD;
           enhance tumor cell invasion (14-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphine causes increased proliferation of human tumor cells and enhances tumor&#xD;
           vascularization (17)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COX2 inhibitors enhance sensitivity of human tumor cells to induction of apoptosis, and&#xD;
           decrease capillary density in cancer tissue (18, 19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, minimization of peri-operative opiate use and prevention or blockade of&#xD;
      prostaglandin and catecholamine effects may delay the metastatic process and the development&#xD;
      of existing micro-metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective clinical study published in 2006 indirectly supports the proposed study: In&#xD;
      this study breast cancer patients were treated per-operatively with a COX inhibitor&#xD;
      (diclofenac) along with local blockade of the sympathetic and pain pathways (paravertebral&#xD;
      anesthesia). These treatments no doubt lowered the use of opiates during and after surgery.&#xD;
      Among patients thus treated a three fold decrease in recurrence rates was found three years&#xD;
      after surgery (21). Of note, this study quotes the previously mentioned study in rats (6,22)&#xD;
      and involves the same interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The aim of the proposed study is to examine whether peri-operative administration of COX2&#xD;
      inhibitors with beta- adrenergic blockers decreases immune suppression during surgery,&#xD;
      decreases stress hormone and pro-angiogenic factor secretion, and is associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in cancer recurrence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peri-operative variables which will be examined will include number and activity of NK&#xD;
      cells in the blood, levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, stress hormones and pro-angiogenic&#xD;
      factors, and Th1 and 2 cytokine production by leukocytes in response to in vitro stimulation.&#xD;
      As part of the clinical monitoring meticulous recording of type and doses of analgesics given&#xD;
      post operatively, as well as post operative pain assessment (NAS VAS). In addition to these&#xD;
      parameters, long term follow up will be conducted to determine long term effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-operative administration of COX inhibitors and beta- adrenergic blockers Routine pre&#xD;
      medication before surgery generally includes anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines, drugs&#xD;
      routinely taken by the patient, and additional drugs for specific indications. Preventive&#xD;
      administration of beta- blockers and COX inhibitors are recommended in the literature&#xD;
      pertaining to anesthesia and pain. Administration of beta- blockers has been shown to&#xD;
      stabilize the cardio vascular system and decrease peri-operative ischemic events (23), while&#xD;
      preventive administration of COX inhibitors decreases post operative pain (5). Post operative&#xD;
      pain has significant immunological effects: it causes secretion of endogenous opiates, and is&#xD;
      often treated with synthetic opiates such as morphine. The opiates cause a stress response,&#xD;
      suppress immune functions and promote tumor growth and spread. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      administration of COX inhibitors together with morphine caused a decrease in morphine&#xD;
      requirements. Administration of COX inhibitors can help control pain by abrogation of&#xD;
      prostaglandin mediated pain pathways while at the same time decreasing opiate requirements.&#xD;
      An additional benefit of COX inhibitors is it's direct activity against tumor cells by&#xD;
      enhancing apoptosis and decreasing tumor blood supply as reported in a recently published&#xD;
      study (21). These studies indicate that peri-operative use of these drugs does not have any&#xD;
      detrimental effects, is not associated with increased complication - and in fact may be&#xD;
      beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune system activity will be determined among 80 operated breast cancer patients, and 20&#xD;
      health women in the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment arm: 40 patients undergoing elective surgery for primary breast cancer will be&#xD;
           treated orally according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Propranolol (Deralin) - patients will receive a low dose of 40 mg/day (4X10mg)&#xD;
                starting two days before surgery (immediately following the first blood draw) until&#xD;
                the evening of surgery. The first dose will be given under supervision (described&#xD;
                later). On the morning of surgery, a single tablet of propranolol XL 80mg will be&#xD;
                administered together with other pre-medication drugs, and will be continued once&#xD;
                daily for three days after surgery. Pulse and blood pressure will be monitored&#xD;
                during the first day of treatment, during the day of surgery and on the following&#xD;
                days until discharge from the hospital. If pulse decreases to &lt;50/min or blood&#xD;
                pressure decreases to &lt;100 systolic - the dose will be halved.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Etodolac (Etopan) - patients will receive 400mg of etodolac XL twice a day starting&#xD;
                two days before and continuing through two days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: Forty patients undergoing the same operations will be treated with placebo&#xD;
           drugs on the same schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy controls: a third control arm will include 20 healthy age-matched women&#xD;
           presenting for routine breast exams and not undergoing surgery will undergo blood tests&#xD;
           only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of the two groups, and patient, physicians and laboratory&#xD;
      personnel will be blinded to the patient's assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cytotoxic activity of NK cells against K562 target cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Stress hormones and angiogenic factors: levels of cortisol and VEGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Doses of anesthetics and analgesics used during and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cancer recurrence during 5 years (including site of recurrence). In addition to the&#xD;
           aforementioned groups, another 190 patients will be recruited onto each group without&#xD;

      who are unable to sustain oral intake, intravenous Tramal will be offered at a dose of 50-100&#xD;
      mg every 6 hours and if needed - morphine 0.1 mg/kg every 4 hours. This protocol is identical&#xD;
      to the one currently used after this type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained two days before surgery (prior to administration of study&#xD;

      and will be transferred immediately to the neuro-immunology lab at Tel Aviv University.&#xD;
      Laboratory evaluation of the samples will begin within 3 hours of blood drawing. The samples&#xD;
      will be kept at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be divided as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK cell activity testing - 2 ml FACS analysis of cells - 1 ml In vitro testing of cytokine&#xD;
      response to LPS - 2 ml Cytokine, cortisol and VEGF levels - 5 ml (to be performed in batches&#xD;
      at a later time - after separation of cells plasma will be kept at -80C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation and analysis of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data: identification (name, ID no), age, ethnic origin, background medical&#xD;
      conditions and drugs, smoking, menstrual status and date of last menstrual period, physical&#xD;
      activity, presence of infections or viral illnesses within last 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data related to anesthesia and surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and length of surgery, systemic administration of opioids during and after surgery (type&#xD;
      and dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer related parameters: Tumor size, grade, histological type, lymph node status, adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological parameters: as previously detailed is three blood samples from operated&#xD;
      patients and a single sample from the healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence data: location, time since surgery and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done by ANOVA (between and within subjects) regarding the&#xD;
      variables. Determination of specific differences between groups will be based on the PLSD&#xD;
      test for planned comparisons, and the Scheffe test for unplanned comparisons. Chi square&#xD;
      tests will be used as well as Kaplan-Meier survival curves for non continuous or categorical&#xD;
      variables. In addition, Cox regressions will be calculated to evaluate the predictive ability&#xD;
      of treatments on cancer recurrence, taking other predicting factors into account. Blood&#xD;
      samples and immunological data will be collected for 40 patients in groups 1 and 2 and 20&#xD;
      healthy controls in group 3. In order to determine impact of treatment on recurrence rates a&#xD;
      total of 230 patients will be recruited in each group. Sample size was calculated to provide&#xD;
      an 805 power to detect a 30-50% decrease in cancer recurrence with an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
