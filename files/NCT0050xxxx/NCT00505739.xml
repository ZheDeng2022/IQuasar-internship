      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the antitumor activity of Mifepristone (RU-486) in patients with advanced&#xD;
           or recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma or low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma&#xD;
           (LGESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of Mifepristone in this patient&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate at a tissue level the effect of Mifepristone on estrogen and progesterone&#xD;
           receptors post treatment and to evaluate other markers that may reflect effects of&#xD;
           Mifepristone on cancer cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effect of the agent and dosing schedule on the patient's quality of&#xD;
           life.&#xD;

      Mifepristone is a drug that has been approved for use in the termination of pregnancy. It has&#xD;
      been studied in women with breast and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts, patients will have a complete checkup, blood tests, a CT scan, and a&#xD;
      chest x-ray. Women able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test. Blood&#xD;
      tests and a complete checkup will also be done within 3 days of starting each course of&#xD;
      therapy and a month after treatment ends. Tumors will be measured by CT scans once every 2-3&#xD;
      months and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will take Mifepristone in the form of a pill by mouth every day. Each&#xD;
      course of therapy is 4 weeks long. Patients will see their doctor for an exam and blood tests&#xD;
      before they begin each 4 week course of therapy. The dose of Mifepristone may be lowered if&#xD;
      the patient has side effects. Patients who have a complete response (there is no evidence of&#xD;
      cancer by physical exam or x-ray) will continue taking Mifepristone for 2 years after this&#xD;
      response is documented. Other patients will take Mifepristone for as long as it benefits&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. At least 12 and as many as 37 patients will take part in&#xD;
      this study. Patients from MD Anderson Cancer Center and Gynecologic Oncology of Houston, P.A.&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologic diagnosis of advanced/recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma or low grade&#xD;
             endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS) not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients should have previously undergone radical surgery (minimum of total abdominal&#xD;
             hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy) definitive radiation therapy, or not&#xD;
             be candidates for such procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The primary (including archived specimens) or recurrent tumor must be PR positive.&#xD;
             Hormone receptor positivity is defined as PR positivity in &gt;/+10% cells by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to the initiation&#xD;
             of Mifepristone and patients must have recovered from the acute side effects of such&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Performance status &lt; Zubrod 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have measurable disease as defined by the presence of bidimensionally&#xD;
             measurable lesions with clearly defined margins on x-ray, scan (CT or MRI) or physical&#xD;
             exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate bone marrow reserve: granulocyte count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L, hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL&#xD;
             (transfusion-independent) and platelets &gt; 100,000 K/UL.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate liver and renal function as defined as: total bilirubin value &lt; 1.5 mg/dL;&#xD;
             SGPT &lt; 2x the upper limit of normal or &lt; 5x the upper limit of normal when liver&#xD;
             metastases are present; serum creatinine value of &lt; 1.8 mg/dL. All qualifying&#xD;
             laboratory parameters must be determined within one week of first treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Patients who have received treatment for brain metastases may be enrolled provided&#xD;
             they have remained stable for at least 6 months after surgery or radiation.&#xD;

             the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ) unless in complete remission and off all&#xD;
             therapy for that disease for a minimum of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of any chemotherapy or investigational agent within 3 weeks prior to taking study&#xD;

             medications or prior surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Overt psychosis or mental disability or otherwise incompetent to give informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
