      This study is designed to explore the use of myfortic ® in patients with active lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus. Similar drugs in this class are increasingly used in organ transplantation and&#xD;
      in autoimmune diseases. With the established safety profile of myfortic ® in&#xD;
      allo-transplantation and the already existing data of mycophenolate mofetil in autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, this study should help to demonstrate the beneficial effect of myfortic ® on lupus&#xD;
      activity. The aim of the study will be to show a decreased disease activity with myfortic ®&#xD;
      compared to standard maintenance therapy with azathioprine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex and potentially life-threatening disease that&#xD;
      affects about 40 per 10,000 people in the general population (Mills 1994, Brown &amp; Schrieber&#xD;
      1996). SLE is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by auto-antibody overproduction&#xD;
      and other distinct immunological abnormalities (Boumpas, et al 1995, Mohan &amp; Datta 1995). It&#xD;
      may affect the skin, joints, lungs, heart, serous membranes, nervous system or other organs.&#xD;
      Improvements in treatment over the last decade have increased 10-year survival rates in&#xD;
      Western countries to 90% or more, and 20-year survival rates of nearly 70% have also been&#xD;
      reported (Abu-Shakra, et al 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer treatment strategies include the use of novel immunosuppressive agents, such as&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MMF has been widely used in solid-organ transplantation&#xD;
      (Sollinger 1995, The Tricontinental Mycophenolate Mofetil Renal Transplantation Study Group&#xD;
      1996). MMF also has been used increasingly in autoimmune diseases (e.g., dermatomyositis,&#xD;
      primary glomerular disease or psoriasis (Epinette, et al 1987, Gelber, et al 2000, Choi, et&#xD;
      al 2002)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF is the morpholinoethylester prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). After oral administration&#xD;
      MMF is well absorbed and rapidly hydrolyzed to MPA. MPA is a noncompetitive inhibitor of&#xD;
      inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (DH). Inhibition of IMPDH leads to the depletion of&#xD;
      deoxyguanosine triphosphate and a consequent decrease in the level of substrate required for&#xD;
      DNA polymerase activity. This results in inhibition of DNA production and cell proliferation.&#xD;
      T and B cells are more dependent on this de novo pathway of purine synthesis because&#xD;
      alternative salvage pathways are unavailable. Thus, MPA is a selective inhibitor of&#xD;
      lymphocyte proliferation, especially in activated lymphocytes (Allison &amp; Eugui 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited number of clinical studies have been performed to study the efficacy of MMF in the&#xD;
      treatment of SLE. Most of these studies involved the treatment of nephritis. Chan, et al&#xD;
      (2000) showed that the combination of MMF and prednisolone is as effective as a regimen of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and prednisolone followed by azathioprine and prednisolone. Azathioprine and&#xD;
      MMF as maintenance therapy were compared to cyclophosphamide therapy (Contreras, et al 2004)&#xD;
      and appeared to be more efficacious and safer than long-term therapy with i.v.&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. In this study, it was also noted that patients treated with MMF had&#xD;
      received lower doses of corticosteroids during maintenance therapy as compared to patients&#xD;
      treated with azathioprine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reports suggest that MMF may also be effective in systemic lupus without severe renal&#xD;
      involvement.(Pisoni, et al 2005) Yet, the superiority over azathioprine in this patient group&#xD;
      has not been established. Own observations show that approximately 50% of patients with SLE&#xD;
      treated with azathioprine have at least some evidence of lupus activity. The aim of this&#xD;
      study will be to show a decreased lupus activity in patients treated with myfortic ® compared&#xD;
      to therapy with azathioprine. Data so gathered may be useful in planning future developments&#xD;
      in this indication&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 12 months, multi-center, 2-treatment arm, parallel-group, randomized, open label&#xD;
      study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus currently on azathioprine. The patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the following two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of previous therapy including azathioprine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Switch to a myfortic ® based regimen: myfortic ® (dose of 1440mg/day) A total of 48&#xD;
           patients (24 patients per arm) fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           enrolled in the study from approximately 5 centers in the Netherlands. Screening&#xD;
           evaluations and assessments will be performed in the period after informed consent has&#xD;
           been signed by the patient and before randomization of the patient (Baseline, Day 1).&#xD;
           Visits are scheduled for Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 12, Months 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final analysis will be performed after the last patient has reached the 12 months of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following efficacy variables will be obtained and recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease activity index measured with SLEDAI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease activity index measured with BILAG (numerical score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Average) daily dose of prednisone (mg/kg/day). The dose will be measured from the&#xD;
           patient starting the study and for the whole duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Damage index measured with SLICC/ACR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine protein:creatinine ratio&#xD;
