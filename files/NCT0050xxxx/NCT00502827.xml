      The goal of this research study is to look at treatments that may help individuals who have&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS to stop smoking.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, researchers will first do a test to learn what the&#xD;
      CO level of your blood is. To do this test, you will be asked to blow into a cardboard tube.&#xD;
      If the test finds that you are ineligible, you will not be able to continue on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible, you will be enrolled in this study and asked to complete an&#xD;
      interview that should last about 1 hour. During this interview, you will be asked basic&#xD;
      questions, such as your age, education level, and smoking history. You will also be asked&#xD;
      questions about your mood, quality of life, and stress. You will then be asked to complete a&#xD;
      short test that involves completing some basic tasks, such as remembering several words and&#xD;
      drawing a simple shape. This test, which will take about 2-5 minutes to complete, is used to&#xD;
      measure attention and concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups.&#xD;
      There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 1, you will receive advice from your physician/provider to stop&#xD;
      smoking and written materials designed to help you quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive the advice from your physician/provider to&#xD;
      quit smoking and the written materials, but you also be given a cell phone and be called 11&#xD;
      times over the course of an 12 to 13 week period. During these calls, which will last about&#xD;
      10 minutes, you will be asked to talk about smoking and quitting smoking. Access to a hotline&#xD;
      number that you can call to speak with a counselor about quitting smoking will also be given&#xD;
      to you if you are assigned to group 2. Participants in Group 1 will not get the number to the&#xD;
      hotline. There is a limited number of prepaid minutes on the phone, so participants who&#xD;
      receive a cell phone should make an effort to save enough minutes to complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete three more interviews about 3-, 6-, and 12-months after the&#xD;
      first interview. During these interviews, you will again be asked questions about your&#xD;
      smoking behavior, mood, quality of life, and stress. All three of these interviews will take&#xD;
      about one hour to complete. Your participation in this study will be complete after the&#xD;
      12-month interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lost, stolen, or broken cell phones will not be replaced, but participants will remain on&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 705 participants will take part in this research&#xD;
      study. All participants will be enrolled at Thomas Street Clinic.&#xD;
