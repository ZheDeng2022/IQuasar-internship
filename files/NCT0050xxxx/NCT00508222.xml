    <textblock>
      The study has been designed to test the hypothesis that in patients co-infected with HIV and&#xD;
      HCV who exhibit maximal virologic suppression on a double class antiretroviral (ARV) regimen,&#xD;
      including two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) and a Non-nucleoside&#xD;
      Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI) or a Protease Inhibitor (PI) (boosted or not with&#xD;
      ritonavir), simplification of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to Kaletra®&#xD;
      monotherapy will represent a viable strategy without any negative impact on the virologic&#xD;
      control of HIV infection.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine how safe and effective the drug Kaletra® is&#xD;
      in treating HIV when it is administered without any other antiretroviral drugs (monotherapy).&#xD;
      Kaletra® is 2 protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir) combined in one dosage form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaletra monotherapy is experimental and subjects eligible to the study are switching from a&#xD;
      successful conventional triple therapy to an unproven experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40 HIV/HCV coinfected participants, aged over 18 years will participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has confirmed his or her willingness to participate in the study after being&#xD;
             informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to his or her decision to&#xD;
             participate, by signing and dating the IRB / IEC approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is both HIV positive and HCV positive (must be viremic for HCV, not just&#xD;
             antibody positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject must have an undetectable viral load (VL) less than 50 copies/ml for the last&#xD;
             6 months on HAART therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject must not be taking any medication that could interact with Kaletra® to enhance&#xD;
             hepatic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject's serum AST and ALT levels must be &amp;lt;5 times normal (grade 2 or less) at the&#xD;
             start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must not harbour viral strains that are resistant to Kaletra® at the start of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;

             reliability as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Female subject is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initiation of&#xD;
             study dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject exhibits viral strains that are resistant to lopinavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
