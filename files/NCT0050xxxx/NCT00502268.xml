    <textblock>
      Arterial calcification within the coronaries and other vessels is greatly accelerated among&#xD;
      patients with chronic or end-stage kidney disease. The mechanisms leading to increased&#xD;
      calcification are unknown, but include hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism and altered&#xD;
      vitamin D metabolism. Moreover, recent data demonstrates that circulating carboxy fragments&#xD;
      of PTH (7-84) are physiologic antagonists of intact PTH (1-84) and may directly contribute to&#xD;
      vascular calcification. Current PTH assays no not distinguish between intact and carboxy PTH&#xD;
      fragments leading to an overestimation of intact PTH levels. Because second generation PTH&#xD;
      assays detect both 1-84 and 7-84 PTH fragments, the use of vitamin D analogues to treat&#xD;
      secondary hyperparathyroidism could lead to excessive suppression of 1-84 and a preponderance&#xD;
      of carboxy PTH fragments. Moreover, increased administration of vitamin D analogues amy&#xD;
      contribute to vascular calcifications. To investigate these questions, we plan to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of managing new ESRD patients using conventional and third generation PTH assays&#xD;
      on vitamin D administration and the development of coronary calcification. Hypothesis #1:&#xD;
      Clinical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in new hemodialysis patients using the&#xD;
      Scantibodies 1-84/7-84 PTH ratio for one year will reduce the amount of Vitamin D&#xD;
      administration resulting in reduced coronary calcification compared to patients in which PTH&#xD;
      management is accomplished by conventional, second generation PTH assay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic renal failure are at increased risk for vascular calcification and&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications. For example, data from the USRDS database demonstrates that 42%&#xD;
      of all deaths among chronic dialysis patients are cardiovascular in origin with 22% of those&#xD;
      deaths due to arrhythmias or overt acute myocardial infarction. While numerous factors&#xD;
      including hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes contribute to both renal failure and&#xD;
      coronary disease, recent studies find that patients with CKD experience an accelerated rate&#xD;
      of coronary calcification. Medial calcification reduces compliance of medium to large elastic&#xD;
      arteries such as the aorta and common carotids. The resulting loss of elasticity is thought&#xD;
      to contribute to the high prevalence of systolic hypertension and left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy (LVH) among patients with ESRD 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of vascular calcification associated with diabetes and ESRD is histologically&#xD;
      distinct from that found in atherosclerotic plaques. In patients with CKD or diabetes calcium&#xD;
      deposits are concentric and uniformly distributed within the medial layer of the vessel wall.&#xD;
      The deposition of calcium does not require the presence of atherosclerotic lesions and occurs&#xD;
      in the absence of intimal hyperplasia. Infiltration of the adventia by T cells and activated&#xD;
      macrophages leads to expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and osteopontin (OPN)&#xD;
      by pericytic myofibroblasts. In diabetics, BMP-2 expression is enhanced by the simultaneous&#xD;
      upregulation of two BMP-2 associated transcription factors Msx1 and Msx2 3. The resulting&#xD;
      transcription of BMP-2 genes leads to mineralization of non-endochondrial matrix. The&#xD;
      expression of OPN is a consistent feature of medial calcification 4. Osteopontin or &quot;bone&#xD;
      bridge&quot; is a highly phosphorylated glycoprotein that binds calcium and integrin receptors.&#xD;
      The expression of osteopontin can be stimulated by vitamin D and increased circulating levels&#xD;
      of phosphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, physiologic concentrations of 1, 25, dihydroxyvitamin D increases calcium&#xD;
      deposition in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and is associated with reduced expression&#xD;
      of PTH related peptide (1-34 PTH) suggesting that amino PTH fragments are not only involved&#xD;
      in regulating bone turnover, but also function to prevent dystrophic vascular calcification.&#xD;
      Indeed, these observations raise the question of whether carboxy PTH fragments can accelerate&#xD;
      vascular calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because second generation PTH assays detect both 1-84 and 7-84 PTH fragments, the use of&#xD;
      vitamin D analogues to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism could lead to excessive&#xD;
      suppression of 1-84 and a preponderance of carboxy PTH fragments. As observed by Jono et.al&#xD;
      accumulation of 7-84 could contribute to excessive vascular calcification. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that limiting the accumulation of 7-84 PTH fragments by maintaining a 1-84/7-84 ratio above&#xD;
      1.6 will reduce the amount of vitamin D analogues administered and ultimately reduce the&#xD;
      development of coronary calcification. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose to&#xD;
      prospectively treat 50 patients with 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D2 where doses are determined by&#xD;
      maintaining a 1-84/7-84 ration &gt; 1.6 or by maintaining intact PTH levels between 150-350&#xD;
      pg/ml using existing second generation PTH assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Hypothesis &amp; Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Hypothesis #1: Clinical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in new hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients using the Scantibodies 1-84/7-84 PTH ratio for one year will reduce the amount of&#xD;
      Vitamin D administration resulting in reduced coronary calcification compared to patients in&#xD;
      which PTH management is accomplished by conventional, second generation PTH assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1a Specific Aim #1 Specific Aim #1 will compare the amount of coronary calcification and&#xD;
      the percentage of patients with at least one coronary lesion &gt; 50% luminal obstruction at&#xD;
      baseline and after one-year therapy following randomization to one of two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Group 1] Patients randomized to group 1 will have the administration of 1alpha OH vitamin D2&#xD;
      (Hectorol) targeted to achieve serum PTH levels between 150-300 ng/ml using a Bayer Centaur&#xD;
      iPTH assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Group 2] Patients randomized to group 2 will have the administration of vitamin D analogues&#xD;
      targeted to achieve a ratio of 1-84/7-84 PTH fragments between ranges of 1.4-1.6 using the&#xD;
      Scantibodies IRMA PTH assay. (Hectorol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Coronary calcification is a frequent complication of end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) with recent estimates of up to 80% of chronic hemodialysis patients exhibiting&#xD;
      moderate to severe vascular calcification 1. Numerous clinical factors have been associated&#xD;
      with the development of arterial calcification including hyperphosphatemia 2, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus 3 and calcium containing phosphate binders 4. More recently, the increased use of&#xD;
      vitamin D analogues to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism has been implicated as a major&#xD;
      contributor to vascular calcification among ESRD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical practices are complicated by the observation that carboxy fragments of PTH&#xD;
      (e.g. 7-84) cross react with second generation PTH assays. Because carboxy PTH fragments are&#xD;
      either inert or antagonize functional bio-intact PTH (1-84), clinicians have used excessive&#xD;
      doses of vitamin D analogues to regulate PTH levels. Moreover, there are animal model studies&#xD;
      that suggest that carboxy PTH fragments directly contribute to vascular calcification 16.We&#xD;
      propose that clinical decision making using the incomplete information provided the currently&#xD;
      available second generation PTH assays leads to excessive vitamin D administration and&#xD;
      subsequent acceleration of coronary calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: We anticipate that prolonged (1 year) management of PTH levels using a&#xD;
      second generation of PTH assays will lead to an increase in the total administered dose of&#xD;
      vitamin D analogues. Moreover, this increase in vitamin D administration will result in&#xD;
      increased coronary calcification at the end of one year of therapy. Conversely, maintaining a&#xD;
      1-84/7-84 PTH ratio between 1.4-1.6 using the Scantibodies third generation assay will reduce&#xD;
      the amount of administered vitamin D analogues and subsequently reduce the amount of coronary&#xD;
      calcification at one year.&#xD;
