      The study proposes to analyze the difference in the rapidity of the recovery of post&#xD;
      operative cognition immediately after extubation and 20, 40 and 60 minutes post extubation&#xD;
      and neuropsychological complications (delirium) after 48 hours following general anesthesia&#xD;
      using a prospective, randomized approach. Patients undergoing any type of surgery with the&#xD;
      exception of cranial, cardiac or thoracic surgery can be enrolled in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study comparing different types of anesthetic maintenance is based on&#xD;
      the amount of systemic metabolic breakdown and the low repartion rates within the various&#xD;
      tissues and the very rapid elimination of desflurane in respect to the other common&#xD;
      inhalation and intravenous anesthetics as possible factors in the rate of recovery of&#xD;
      cognitive function and the appearance of post operative delirium. After general anesthesia&#xD;
      with desflurane there is less residual hypnotic agent for elimination in the circulation and&#xD;
      tissue with respect to the amount given than with propofol or sevoflurance (1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative cerebral injury correlated with surgical intervention and anesthesia can result&#xD;
      in a decline in cognitive function (4) defining the entity of post operative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction (POCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study it is possible to distinguish:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early POCD: attributable to anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-Term POCD: could be attributable to of cognition associated with advanced age&#xD;
           rather than to procedural effects (surgery, anesthesia, or confinement to a hospital&#xD;
           bed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of POCD is higher in patients with advanced age (&gt;70) and in cases where&#xD;
      general anesthesia is used for highly invasive surgery (orthopedic, abdominal and thoracic&#xD;
      surgery) (5-7). A consensus does not exist regarding tests for evaluation of POCD. In this&#xD;
      protocol we propose to use three scales concurrently that are commonly used for evaluation of&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding neuropsychological complications, the scope of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      prevalence of post operative delirium with onset during the 48 hours following the end of the&#xD;
      surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium fundamentally consists of three basic neuropsychological disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual or auditory hallucination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spatial-temporal disorientation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inappropriate language&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative delirium entails:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An increase in morbidity and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An increase risk of neurological damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant discomfort for the patient, families and staff (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some conditions predispose patients to the onset of post operative delirium: advanced age&#xD;
      (&gt;70 years old), alcohol abuse, abnormalities in the pre-operative cognitive state, and&#xD;
      electrolyte or chemical imbalance (Na, K, glucose, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the induction of anesthesia, carried out using routine clinical practice determined by&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist the patient will be assigned to either the control group or the&#xD;
      comparison group (the assignment will have been made prior to induction). The control group&#xD;
      will receive either propofol or sevoflurance (with or without N2O at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist based on clinical needs). The comparison group will be given desflurane (end&#xD;
      tidal 5.0 - 6.0%) for maintenance of anesthesia (with or without N2O at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist based on clinical needs). According to a randomized sequence patients will&#xD;
      be assigned in a consecutive manor to the maintenance with the control technique or with&#xD;
      desflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to observe if there are differences in the point of recovery of&#xD;
      cognition, evaluated with the appropriate test in the immediate post operative period and the&#xD;
      onset of post operative delirium (visual or auditory hallucination, spatial or temporal&#xD;
      disorientation, or inappropriate language) within 48 hours following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal care should be used in the administration of benzodiazapam premedication to patients&#xD;
      at high risk for developing post operative delirium, but their use doe not represent criteria&#xD;
      for exclusion from the study. In addition hypotension should be avoided (maintenance of a&#xD;
      mean blood pressure of greater than 70 mmHg) as also intraoperative hyper ventilation (avoid&#xD;
      hypocapnia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every collaborator would initially enroll 10 patients (5 control group receiving propofol or&#xD;
      sevoflurance and 5 comparison group receiving desflurane) in order to become confident with&#xD;
      the method of the protocol and with the evaluation methods used for measuring cognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every collaborator and those relevant to the core study will be cited in the list of&#xD;
      coauthors. The databases consisting of the protocol data will be at the disposal of the&#xD;
      collaborators for further scientific work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic characteristics of the patients registered will be described according to&#xD;
      categorical variables across a table of frequency. Continuous variables will be subjected to&#xD;
      summary statistics such as average, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. The&#xD;
      differences between the groups will be subjected to verification of the significance through&#xD;
      non-parametric (Chi Square and Fisher Exact Test for the non-continuous variables and the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney or the Kruskall-Wallis for associations between the continuous variables. The&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular or respiratory complications, nausea and/or vomiting, shivering,&#xD;
      neurological complications and delirium will be tabulated through table of frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes patients of any age and ASA physical status undergoing elective surgery.&#xD;
      All patients must have a Glascow Coma Score (GCS) equal to 15 before the intervention and&#xD;
      they must have undergone the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent about anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative evaluation including determination of ASA physical status and GCS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment and testing appropriate to the patient's condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the induction of anesthesia which can be done according to the normal routine of the&#xD;
      individual anesthesiologist, the patient will then be assigned according to a randomized&#xD;
      sequence to one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a) Anesthesia with propofol (total intravenous anesthesia - TVA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b) Anesthesia with sevoflurane (with or without N2O) 2) Anesthesia with desflurane (with or&#xD;
      without N2O)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist can use other agents (oppiods, _________, antihypertensives etc.)&#xD;
      according to the clinical need in the judgment of the anesthesiologist. The type and quantity&#xD;
      of drugs used in the Perioperative period must be reported on the anesthesia record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra operative monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure (invasive or non-invasive)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SpO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EtCO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Et halogenated agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine output&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests Before anesthetizing the patient they will be given three cognitive tests: SOMCT, RLAS&#xD;
      and MMSE. The same tests will be followed (repeated at emergence, after 20, 40, and 60&#xD;
      minutes after extubation. This will permit the evaluation of the level of recovery of&#xD;
      cognition compared to the value obtained before anesthesia with that obtained in the three&#xD;
      successive administrations of the tests after wake-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Short Orientation Memory Concentration Test (SOMCT) investigates the patient's capacity&#xD;
      to know the current year or month or only one of the two and to repeat in numerical order the&#xD;
      inverse sequence of the months of the year. These variables permit the assignment of a&#xD;
      numerical score from 0 to 28 based upon the patient's cognitive function. Higher scores&#xD;
      indicate better cognitive function (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rancho Los Amigos Scale (RLAS) is a scale utilized to quantify the behavioral and&#xD;
      cognitive state after acute cerebral injury. Each state corresponds to one of eight levels (I&#xD;
      - VIII). Higher scores indicate a good state of behavior and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a test that is usually administered to adults or&#xD;
      the elderly who one suspects might have a memory or character disturbance (13). This test&#xD;
      requires the use of a pencil, a watch and some sheets of paper. The maximum attainable score&#xD;
      is 30. A compiled score of between 24 - 30 could indicate a psychological decline in&#xD;
      cognitive function of little importance. On the other hand scores below 24 can denote&#xD;
      cognitive disturbance much more severe as the score decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wake-up The start of the study period coincides with the suspension of the hypnotics&#xD;
      (propofol/sevoflurane or desflurane). At this moment the timing of extubation begins which is&#xD;
      at the discretion of the anesthesiologists who would evaluate the patient as usual for&#xD;
      extubation criteria (respiratory dynamics, ability to maintain SpO2 &gt;95%, Et CO2 between 30 -&#xD;
      40 mmHg, muscle strength, the presence of laryngeal reflexes, and swallowing, etc.) At that&#xD;
      point the anesthesiologist will bring the flow of fresh gas to a value greater than that of&#xD;
      the minute ventilation and change the circuit to an open system. The time between the&#xD;
      suspension of anesthesia and extubation will be recorded on the patient's anesthetic record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate memory quickly at termination of the anesthetic (after extubation) it&#xD;
      would be necessary to inform the patient of the correct time and day in the immediate wake up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is evaluated according to the Aldrete score (11) 5 minutes after the extubation&#xD;
      ane every 5 minutes after until an Aldrete score of 9-10 is obtrained. The patient that&#xD;
      reaches a score of 9-10 (capacity to move their extremities spontaneously and under command,&#xD;
      to breath and cough, have a mean blood pressure between 20% of the preoperative level, to&#xD;
      arouse themselves and the capacity to maintain an SpO2 greater than 90%) can begin to undergo&#xD;
      cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time interval of evaluation of the recovery of cognition, the patient will be&#xD;
      evaluated (and treated?) for pain through use of an analogue visual scale (VAS 0 = no pain,&#xD;
      10 = maximum pain imaginable). The patient will then be asked for the information furnished&#xD;
      at awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the same period the blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, SpO2 will be measured to evaluate&#xD;
      cardiovascular, respiratory function, and the patient evaluated for nausea/vomiting,&#xD;
      shivering and any neurological abnormalities. Episodes of hypotension (mean blood pressure&#xD;
      less than 50 mmHg for a period greater than 5 minutes), hypertension (meant blood pressure&#xD;
      greater than 100 mmHg for a period greater than 5 minutes) will be recorded and treated if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 and 48 hours the presence of delirium will be evaluated, and in particular the&#xD;
      appearance of alteration of spatial or temporal orientation, auditory or visual&#xD;
      hallucinations or any inappropriate language, will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information compiled for Patient Records&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Data This section has the aim to identify the researcher and to classify the patient.&#xD;
      Information will be obtained regarding the patients age, sex, height and weight and the name&#xD;
      of the medical center and the date of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative data Needed therapy and medical condition including cardiac, respiratory,&#xD;
      neurologic and metabolic problems prior to surgery will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative data This data records factors related to the intervention including&#xD;
      anesthetic techniques utilized, fluid administered, duration of anesthesia and surgery, type&#xD;
      of surgery and the patient's position. It is of great importance to report episodes of&#xD;
      hypertension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg ) or hypertension (diastolic pressure &gt;100&#xD;
      mmHg) that is protracted (duration longer than 5 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative data This is data that relates to the wake up of the patients based on the&#xD;
      three groups studied. The evaluation at wake-up and the results from the Aldrete score, the&#xD;
      SOMCT, RLAS, and the MMSE according to the order specified in the discription of the&#xD;
      protocol. It is important to indicated episodes of protracted hypo or hypertension and&#xD;
      episodes of hypoxia (SpO2 &lt; 95%) as well as the intensity of pain using the VAS (and&#xD;
      treatment?).&#xD;
