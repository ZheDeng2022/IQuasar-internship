      The purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic samples from the blood and lungs from&#xD;
      patients with lung diseases in order to study the causes and indications of these disorders,&#xD;
      learn how these lung disease manifest and progress, and how the lung disease can be treated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lung diseases are disorders associated with functional and/or structural derangements to&#xD;
      the alveolar structures, airways, pulmonary blood vessels, pleura and/or mediastinum. The&#xD;
      purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic materials from the blood and lungs from these&#xD;
      patients in order to: (1) develop an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of these&#xD;
      disorders; and (2) identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for other protocols&#xD;
      such as those involving investigational new drugs. As such, this protocol is part of the&#xD;
      &quot;infrastructure&quot; for all of our human lung-related studies such as genomic/gene expression&#xD;
      studies of airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages in all individuals with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive lung disease (COPD), asthma, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
      compared to normal non-smokers and smokers, and studies of mediators in bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol, to be carried out at Weill Cornell Medical College - Qatar and Hamad Medical&#xD;
      Corporation, Qatar, parallels a similar approved protocol IRB #0005004440, entitled,&#xD;
      &quot;Evaluation of the Lungs of Individuals with Lung Disease with Segmental Bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      Lung Lavage, Bronchial Brushing, and Bronchial Wall Biopsy&quot;, ongoing at Weill Cornell Medical&#xD;
      College - New York.&#xD;

        Recruitment will be from the patients of the Hamad Medical Corporation and others as&#xD;
        relevant. The source of potential subjects will be the population of potential subjects&#xD;
        with lung disease, as defined by the elegibility criteria, in Qatar. Accrual will be random&#xD;
