    <textblock>
      The Standard Days Method® is a fertility awareness-based method of family planning in which&#xD;
      users avoid unprotected intercourse during cycle day 8 through 19. The method is most&#xD;
      appropriate for women with cycles that usually range 26-32 days. The clinical trial tested&#xD;
      the contraceptive efficacy of the Standard Days Method. A total of 478 women, age 18-39&#xD;
      years, in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines, with self-reported cycles of 26-32 days,&#xD;
      desiring to delay pregnancy at least one year were admitted to the study and followed for up&#xD;
      to 13 cycles of method use.&#xD;

      The Standard Days Method® is a fertility awareness-based method of family planning. Users&#xD;
      avoid unprotected intercourse during cycle day 8 through cycle day 19. The method is most&#xD;
      effective for women with cycles that usually range 26-32 days. It was developed by applying&#xD;
      various formulae (i.e. various numbers of days and various sets of days) to over 7500&#xD;
      menstrual cycles in an existing data set from the World Health Organization, to determine&#xD;
      which formula would provide the optimal balance between he length of the identified fertile&#xD;
      period and the efficacy in avoiding unplanned pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the clinical trial was to test the efficacy of the method in preventing&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were from five sites in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines. In all sites, the&#xD;
      Institute for Reproductive Health trained 5-10 health workers (service providers) in teaching&#xD;
      the Standard Days Method to study subjects and in study procedures. Method provision involved&#xD;
      a counseling session in which the woman (or the couple, if her partner was available) was&#xD;
      instructed in the use of the method, and counseled on the importance of following the method&#xD;
      recommendations to avoid pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assist women in monitoring their cycles, the provider gave them CycleBeads® a mnemonic&#xD;
      device, a string of 32 beads in which each beads represents a day of the menstrual cycle. The&#xD;
      first bead is red, representing the first day of menses; the next 6 beads are brown,&#xD;
      representing the additional non-fertile days preceding the fertile window; the next 12 beads&#xD;
      are white, representing days that should be considered fertile (8-19); and the remaining 13&#xD;
      beads are brown, again representing non-fertile days. It also has a moveable, tight-fitting&#xD;
      rubber ring that is used to mark the current day of the cycle. Women were instructed to place&#xD;
      the ring on the red bead on the day their menses began, and move the ring one bead per day&#xD;
      until their menses returned. They also were told that to avoid pregnancy they should not have&#xD;
      unprotected intercourse on the days the ring was on a white bead. If they had menstrual&#xD;
      bleeding before day 27 of the cycle (i.e., a cycle shorter than 26 days), or if their menses&#xD;
      had not occurred by the day after they completed all 32 beads (i.e., a cycle longer than 32&#xD;
      days), they were instructed to contact their provider for further assessment and advice.&#xD;
      Women who had two cycles outside the 26 through 32 day range during the study period were&#xD;
      advised to use another method, and were withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 478 women wishing to use the Standard Days Method and meeting the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria were admitted to the study after signing an informed consent form and interviewed&#xD;
      monthly until they either completed 13 cycles of method use or left the study for other&#xD;
      reasons. The first level of data collection was administered by the clients themselves. Each&#xD;
      woman was asked to keep a daily diary to record menstrual bleeding, intercourse, and use of&#xD;
      any other contraceptive method. The information on the diary card was reviewed by the clients&#xD;
      and the service provider during each of the monthly follow-up contacts. In addition,&#xD;
      follow-up forms were administered, which included questions concerning method use,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and willingness to continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who had not had their menses by day 42 of their cycle were tested for pregnancy. If&#xD;
      results were negative, they were followed until they tested positive or their menses&#xD;
      returned. Loss to follow-up was minimized by interviewing study participants in their homes&#xD;
      and actively seeking out each participant, with a minimum of three attempts per cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-decrement multi-censoring life tables were used to calculate pregnancy rates.&#xD;
