      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ZIO-101 when&#xD;
           administered intravenously once a day for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks in subjects&#xD;
           with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of ZIO-101 when administered intravenously once&#xD;
           a day for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the anti-tumor effects of ZIO-101.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ZIO-101 is a drug that may change cancerous cells into healthy (benign) cells. It is also&#xD;
      designed to cause cancer cells to destroy themselves; a term called apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening tests&quot;&#xD;
      no more than one week before starting the study. These tests will help the doctor decide if&#xD;
      you are eligible to take part in the study. You will have a complete medical history and&#xD;
      physical exam, including measurements of your weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.&#xD;
      You will also be asked what other medicines you are taking and about your general well-being.&#xD;
      You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test to measure the electrical activity of the&#xD;
      heart). Blood (about 2 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn. A sample of urine will be also be&#xD;
      collected and tested to see if your kidneys are working correctly. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see the current condition of your tumor, additional tests may need to be performed if they&#xD;
      have not already been done recently. These tests may include a chest x-ray, a CT scan&#xD;
      (imaging computer pictures of your body), a bone scan (an imaging test of your bones with a&#xD;
      contrast material), or an MRI (a detailed imaging scan of certain areas of your body).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin treatment with&#xD;
      ZIO-101. Immediately before being treated with ZIO-101 on Day 0, you will have another&#xD;
      physical exam and you will be asked about any medicines you are taking and how you are&#xD;
      feeling. You will also be asked a series of questions which will assess your mental health.&#xD;
      This is called a mini-mental status exam and will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      The blood tests may need to be repeated along with the ECG and the urine test. In addition, a&#xD;
      small blood sample (about 10 teaspoons) must be taken immediately before the injection of&#xD;
      ZIO-101. This blood will be used to help in the measurement of drug levels in the blood.&#xD;
      These are called pharmacokinetic (PK) tests. This blood sample will also be used to measure&#xD;
      arsenic levels in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ZIO-101 will be injected into your vein over 60 minutes in the clinical translational&#xD;
      research center of UTMDACC. This drug must be given through a special IV called a central&#xD;
      line catheter so that it does not damage your surrounding tissue. You will have to sign a&#xD;
      separate consent document before placement of a catheter can be performed. Special care will&#xD;
      be taken to be sure the drug does not leak into surrounding tissue. The use of anti-nausea&#xD;
      and other supportive care medications may be given during the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the injection, you will have 6 samples of blood taken for PK tests at half an hour&#xD;
      and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after finishing the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the next 4 days at about the same time as your first infusion, you will be prepared for&#xD;
      treatment with ZIO-101. Before each injection, you will be asked how you feel, an ECG will be&#xD;
      performed, and a small sample of blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK tests. The&#xD;
      Day 1-4 infusions will also each take about 1 hour. In total you will receive 5 daily&#xD;
      injections of ZIO-101. On Day 4 at the end of the infusion, another sample of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn (about 5 teaspoons) to measure arsenic levels in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your next visit will be Week 2 and at the start of this visit, a blood sample (about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be drawn for PK tests, and you will be asked how you feel. At Week 3, another&#xD;
      blood sample (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK tests, and to measure arsenic levels in&#xD;
      your blood, and you will again be asked how you feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 4, a new cycle begins. Immediately before being treated with ZIO-101, you will have a&#xD;
      physical examination and you will take a mini-mental status examination; you will be asked&#xD;
      about any medicines you are taking and how you are feeling. The blood tests will be repeated&#xD;
      along with the ECG and the routine urine test. In addition, tests to measure your tumor will&#xD;
      be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is trying to find the best dose of ZIO-101. At first, 3 patients will be assigned&#xD;
      to the first dose level. They will be followed to evaluate their side effects for a period of&#xD;
      4 weeks before 3 more patients are enrolled. If none of the patients develop serious side&#xD;
      effects, the dose escalation will continue. If 1 of the 3 patients in a particular dose level&#xD;
      develops significant side effects, 3 more patients will be enrolled at that level. If 2 or&#xD;
      more of the 6 patients develop serious side effects, then the escalation will finish and all&#xD;
      future patients on this study will be treated at a lower dose level (half way between this&#xD;
      level and the previous one).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. You may be taken off study early if your disease&#xD;
      gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. Once you go off study, you will have an end of&#xD;
      study visit. During this visit, you will have a physical exam, a mini-mental status exam and&#xD;
      blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. ZIO-101 has been authorized by the FDA for use in research&#xD;
      only. ZIO-101 will be provided free of charge during the study. Also, any tests or procedures&#xD;
      that are being done solely for the purpose of this research study will be provided free of&#xD;
      charge. Up to 50 patients will take part in this multicenter study. All will be enrolled at&#xD;
