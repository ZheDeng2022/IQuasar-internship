  <brief_title>r-hLIF for Improving Embryo Implantation in IVF</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled, Proof of Concept Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety and Acceptability of r-hLIF for Improving Embryo Implantation Following in Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) and Embryo Transfer (ET) in Women With Recurrent Implantation Failure.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to obtain pilot clinical evidence of the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      acceptability of r-hLIF administered during the luteal phase after IVF/intra-cytoplasmic&#xD;
      sperm injection (ICSI) and ET for improving embryo implantation in infertile women with a&#xD;
      history of at least three implantation failures following ART. Based on LIF expression&#xD;
      patterns and experimental data from animal research a role of LIF in embryo implantation is&#xD;
      anticipated.&#xD;

          3. A history of at least three ART cycles resulting in a transfer of at least two&#xD;
             apparently healthy embryos and no evidence of implantation menstruation and/or beta&#xD;
             hCG &lt; 10 IU/L at the end of the cycle)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Had regular ovulatory spontaneous menstrual cycles lasting 25 to 35 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Had FSH assessment (early follicular day 2 to 5) within the past six months &lt; 12 IU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No other diagnosed cause of previous ART failure other than recurrent implantation&#xD;
             failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A body mass index (BMI) of ³ 20 and £ 30 kg/m2, calculated according to the following&#xD;
             formula: BMI (kg/m2) = Body Weight (kg) / Height * Height (m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The presence of both ovaries&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A uterine cavity without abnormalities which, in the investigator's opinion, could&#xD;
             impair embryo implantation or pregnancy outcome, as assessed by ultrasound (US)&#xD;
             examination performed within six months prior to beginning GnRH-agonist therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Normal cervical cytology within three years prior to beginning GnRH- agonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. At least one wash-out cycle (defined as ³ 30 days since the last dose of clomiphene&#xD;
             citrate or gonadotrophin treatment) since the last ART cycle and/or clomiphene citrate&#xD;
             or gonadotrophin treatment, prior to beginning GnRH-agonist therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Male partner semen analysis within the six months prior to starting GnRH agonist&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Had a negative pregnancy test (urinary) within seven days of commencing GnRH-agonist&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Willingness and ability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Written informed consent given prior to any study related procedure not part of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. More than one previous failed ART cycle, where &quot;failed&quot; is defined as cancellation of&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Any history of difficulties in ET procedure (i.e. requiring general anaesthetic e.g.&#xD;
