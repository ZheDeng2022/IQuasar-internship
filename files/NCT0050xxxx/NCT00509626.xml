      RATIONALE: Physical activity may prevent or reduce weight gain in women receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying physical activity to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared with usual care to prevent or reduce weight gain in women with stage I or&#xD;
      stage II breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility for conducting a clinical trial that uses a 6-month physical&#xD;
           activity intervention initiated within 45 days after surgery for early-stage breast&#xD;
           cancer and prior to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and/or&#xD;
           radiotherapy. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if participation in a 6-month physical activity intervention initiated within&#xD;
           45 days after surgery for early-stage breast cancer decreases weight gain in patients&#xD;
           treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if participation in a 6-month physical activity intervention initiated within&#xD;
           45 days after surgery for early-stage breast cancer differentially affects weight change&#xD;
           in women who are premenopausal compared to those who are postmenopausal at diagnosis.&#xD;
           (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if participation in a 6-month physical activity intervention initiated within&#xD;
           45 days after surgery for early-stage breast cancer decreases gains in adiposity in&#xD;
           patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if participation in a 6-month physical activity intervention initiated within&#xD;
           45 days after surgery for early-stage breast cancer differentially affects change in&#xD;
           adiposity among women who are premenopausal compared to those who are postmenopausal at&#xD;
           diagnosis. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if participation in a 6-month physical activity intervention initiated within&#xD;
           45 days after surgery for early-stage breast cancer decreases the frequency of&#xD;
           depressive symptomology and improves quality of life among patients treated with&#xD;
           adjuvant chemotherapy. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      participating site and menopausal status (premenopausal vs postmenopausal). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (exercise and usual care): Patients receive usual care and are enrolled in an&#xD;
           exercise and weight control program at Curves® fitness center. The Curves® program,&#xD;
           which begins during the third week of study, uses aerobic activity and resistance&#xD;
           training to reduce weight and increase strength and fitness. Patients exercise a minimum&#xD;
           of 3 times per week, approximately 30 minutes every time, for up to 6 months in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients' physical activity is&#xD;
           measured at baseline and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also undergo behavior modification counseling with a study nurse to help them&#xD;
      overcome the specific barriers to adhering to the recommended exercise routine. Counseling&#xD;
      sessions are conducted every 2 to 3 weeks during chemotherapy and at least monthly after&#xD;
      completion of chemotherapy for up to 6 months, starting within 2 weeks after randomization&#xD;
      and prior to initiation of the Curves® intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (control: usual care alone): Patients receive usual care and general advice on&#xD;
           coping with their breast cancer treatment for up to 6 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive no counseling or recommendations&#xD;
           concerning emotional and practical barriers encountered during breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary information is obtained from patients by telephone during three 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recalls performed within 2 weeks of baseline and at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits&#xD;
      to estimate total energy intake throughout the study. Patients complete questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline and periodically during study assessing demographic characteristics and established&#xD;
      breast cancer risk factors, medical history, and health changes. Weight, adiposity as&#xD;
      measured by waist circumference, quality of life, and depressive symptomology are assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study intervention, patients are followed for up to 6 months.&#xD;
