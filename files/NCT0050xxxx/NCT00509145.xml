    <measure>Relapse Rate: Number of Confirmed Relapses During the Double Blind Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of at least one new neurological abnormality or the reappearance of at least one previously observed neurological abnormalities lasting greater than or equal to 48 hours and immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of greater than or equal to 30 days from onset of previous relapse. An event was counted as a relapse only when the participant's symptoms were accompanied by observed objective neurological changes, consistent with one or more of the following: An increase of greater than or equal to 0.5 in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score as compared to previous evaluation, an increase of one grade in the actual score of greater than or equal to 2 of the 7 functional systems (FS), as compared to previous evaluation, or an increase of 2 grades in the actual score of one FS as compared to the previous evaluation.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Composite score was calculated as the sum of the number of gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions at Month 12 and the number of gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions at Month 24 on T1-Weighted MRI scans.</description>

    <measure>Composite Endpoint: Sum of the Number of New/Enlarging T2 Lesions</measure>

    <measure>Accumulation of Physical Disability Measured by the Time to Confirmed Progression of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems with an overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]). A confirmed progression of EDSS is defined as at least 1 point increase from baseline if baseline EDSS was between 0 and 5.0, or at least 0.5 point increase if baseline EDSS was 5.5 or higher, confirmed 3 months later. Participants were assessed between baseline and month 24 visit. Participants that met these criteria for any 3 consecutive months were counted in the progression category. Progression could not be confirmed during an MS relapse. Data is presented as a distribution of confirmed disease progression (CDP) events (number of participants with CDP).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disability as Assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite is an instrument assessing disability that consists of 3 clinical assessments. The 3 are Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test which measures upper extremity (arm and hand) function, and PASAT (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) which is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. A Z-score is used to define a common metric from the 3 assessments that constitute the MSFC score. The study's population at baseline was used as reference population for the Z-score calculation. A Z-score of 0 represents the population mean at baseline. Higher Z-scores correspond to an improved outcome.</description>

        <title>Relapse Rate: Number of Confirmed Relapses During the Double Blind Study Period</title>
        <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of at least one new neurological abnormality or the reappearance of at least one previously observed neurological abnormalities lasting greater than or equal to 48 hours and immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of greater than or equal to 30 days from onset of previous relapse. An event was counted as a relapse only when the participant's symptoms were accompanied by observed objective neurological changes, consistent with one or more of the following: An increase of greater than or equal to 0.5 in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score as compared to previous evaluation, an increase of one grade in the actual score of greater than or equal to 2 of the 7 functional systems (FS), as compared to previous evaluation, or an increase of 2 grades in the actual score of one FS as compared to the previous evaluation.</description>

          <title>Relapse Rate: Number of Confirmed Relapses During the Double Blind Study Period</title>
          <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of at least one new neurological abnormality or the reappearance of at least one previously observed neurological abnormalities lasting greater than or equal to 48 hours and immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of greater than or equal to 30 days from onset of previous relapse. An event was counted as a relapse only when the participant's symptoms were accompanied by observed objective neurological changes, consistent with one or more of the following: An increase of greater than or equal to 0.5 in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score as compared to previous evaluation, an increase of one grade in the actual score of greater than or equal to 2 of the 7 functional systems (FS), as compared to previous evaluation, or an increase of 2 grades in the actual score of one FS as compared to the previous evaluation.</description>

        <description>EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems with an overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]). A confirmed progression of EDSS is defined as at least 1 point increase from baseline if baseline EDSS was between 0 and 5.0, or at least 0.5 point increase if baseline EDSS was 5.5 or higher, confirmed 3 months later. Participants were assessed between baseline and month 24 visit. Participants that met these criteria for any 3 consecutive months were counted in the progression category. Progression could not be confirmed during an MS relapse. Data is presented as a distribution of confirmed disease progression (CDP) events (number of participants with CDP).</description>

        <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite is an instrument assessing disability that consists of 3 clinical assessments. The 3 are Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test which measures upper extremity (arm and hand) function, and PASAT (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) which is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. A Z-score is used to define a common metric from the 3 assessments that constitute the MSFC score. The study's population at baseline was used as reference population for the Z-score calculation. A Z-score of 0 represents the population mean at baseline. Higher Z-scores correspond to an improved outcome.</description>
