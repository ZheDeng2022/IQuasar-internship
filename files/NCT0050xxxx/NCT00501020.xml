  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, double dummy, multicenter study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of the addition of RSG (rosiglitazone) to sub-maximal MET&#xD;
      (metformin) combination relative to maximal MET monotherapy in subjects with type 2 DM&#xD;
      (diabetes mellitus). The total duration of the study was approximately 20 months. The study&#xD;
      consisted of a two-week washout period, a four to seven-week MET titration period, and a&#xD;
      24-week randomized treatment phase in which subjects, stratified by prior therapy, received&#xD;
      either RSG + MET combination therapy or MET monotherapy.&#xD;

          -  Subjects previously treated by either diet and exercise or oral therapy. Any subjects&#xD;
             who were receiving MET or MET plus Sulfonylurea (SU) must have been receiving no more&#xD;
             than MET 1000mg/day for at least three months prior to study entry. Subjects must have&#xD;
             stopped previous treatment with thiazolidinediones (TZDs) at least three months prior&#xD;
             to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who received monotherapy treatment within the last three months prior to&#xD;
             study entry or drug-naives who had HbA1c levels between 7% and 10%, inclusive.&#xD;
             Subjects who received prior combination treatment had HbA1c of at least 6.5% to 8.5%,&#xD;
             inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with FPG of &lt;270 mg/dL at screening and visit 2, must have had a FPG &gt;=126&#xD;
             mg/dL at either screening or at the MET titration period (visit 2, run-in) for entry&#xD;
