    <textblock>
      This study will look at the relative amounts of GSK189075 that are found in samples of blood,&#xD;
      urine, and feces of healthy male volunteers. Results of the study will be used to understand&#xD;
      how the drug is converted in the body and how it is eliminated.&#xD;
