      The primary objective of the Phase I portion of this study is to evaluate the safety of a&#xD;
      combination of capecitabine and proton therapy for patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent rectal cancer. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined in the Phase I&#xD;
      portion of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Phase II portion of this study is to evaluate the local control&#xD;
      rate in patients treated with the above regimen at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate local tumor response in patients treated with the above regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the relapse-free and overall survival in patients treated with the above&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate proton dosimetry in patients receiving this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate quality of life in patients receiving this therapy.&#xD;

      Proton beams can be used to deliver a high dose of radiation to the treatment area while&#xD;
      sparing surrounding normal tissues. Capecitabine is a drug that interferes with the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study. You will have a complete physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for&#xD;
      routine tests. Urine will be collected for routine tests. Chest x-rays and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen (stomach area) and pelvis will be done. Women who are&#xD;
      able to have children must have a negative blood or urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive radiation&#xD;
      therapy 1 time a day, for 5 days in a row (Monday-Friday) for 6 -7 weeks (30-35 treatments in&#xD;
      all). You will take the chemotherapy drug, capecitabine, by mouth 2 times a day, at morning&#xD;
      and night, on each of the days that you receive radiation therapy. These pills will not be&#xD;
      taken on Saturday or Sunday. These pills should be taken within 30 minutes of eating and with&#xD;
      a full glass of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, every week you will have a physical exam and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn to check for side effects from chemotherapy and radiation therapy. You will be asked&#xD;
      about any side effects you are experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be evaluated by a surgeon 4-6 weeks after the completion of treatment. Those with&#xD;
      tumors that can be surgically removed will have surgery to remove the tumor 6-8 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of treatment, as they would for the standard of care for their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) weeks after completing radiation therapy, you will have a follow-up visit. At this&#xD;
      visit, you will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine&#xD;
      tests. You will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing. Six (6) weeks after&#xD;
      completing radiation therapy, you will have a follow-up visit. At this visit, you will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, chest x-ray, and CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Blood (about 2 teaspoons)&#xD;
      and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will be asked about any side effects you&#xD;
      are experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing treatment, you will have a follow-up visit every 3 months for the first 2&#xD;
      years, and every 6 months after that. At each visit, you will have a physical exam. Blood&#xD;
      (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will have a chest&#xD;
      x-ray and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. You will be asked about any side effects you are&#xD;
      experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) year after you finish treatment, you will also have a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
      You will receive a separate consent for these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participation in the study is over, you will have follow-up evaluation as needed for&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Capecitabine is FDA approved for treating colon cancer&#xD;
      after surgery, and for treating metastatic colorectal cancer. The use of capecitabine with&#xD;
      proton beam therapy in this study is investigational. About 50 patients will take part in&#xD;
      this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
