  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effects of almonds on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors (serum lipids,&#xD;
      measurements of oxidative stress and nitric oxide production) when added to the diets of&#xD;
      subjects with high cholesterol. Also, to assess whether the amount of almonds consumed (i.e.&#xD;
      almond dose) decreases CHD risk factors in a dose dependent manner. We hypothesize that since&#xD;
      almonds have been shown to reduce serum lipids, we believe they will also increase nitric&#xD;
      oxide levels related to their high levels of arginine and reduce markers of oxidative stress&#xD;
      related to their content of bioactive phenolics. We anticipate that a dose-dependent&#xD;
      relationship will be observed resulting in greater reductions in risk factors for coronary&#xD;
      heart disease when greater doses of almonds are consumed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that nuts, specifically almonds, result in an improved coronary&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD) lipid risk profile. Part of the reason has been ascribed to their high&#xD;
      content of monounsaturated fat. However in a previous study we have done, the almond&#xD;
      supplement, in comparison with an olive oil and dairy protein based supplement, still showed&#xD;
      a significant reduction in total cholesterol (total-C) and low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-C). We wish to use this paradigm to confirm the lipid lowering effect of&#xD;
      almonds, to establish a similar relationship for the apolipoproteins and so add further&#xD;
      support for the cardiovascular risk reduction associated with an almond diet. In addition, in&#xD;
      view of the relatively high arginine content of almonds, we believe higher levels of nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) will be produced, as indicated by increased NO in expired air from perfused&#xD;
      olfactory mucosa. With this technique, we have found higher levels of NO in preliminary&#xD;
      studies of subjects on soy diets. These data would further add to interest in nuts in&#xD;
      relation to cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Furthermore, phenolics are present in high&#xD;
      concentrations in oil seeds and nuts, and are known to have antioxidant activity. As yet,&#xD;
      they do not appear to have been emphasized in relation to almonds. We will therefore&#xD;
      determine the effect of feeding almonds on measures of oxidative stress, including oxidized&#xD;
      LDL-C, considered to be of direct relevance to CHD; and oxidized DNA, of potential importance&#xD;
      to neoplastic transformation and carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies could lead to assessment of postprandial effects of almonds to determine a&#xD;
      mechanism, and to studies of cardiovascular effects of almonds including exercise stress&#xD;
      tests and measures of vascular reactivity (e.g. forearm blood flow) in conjunction with NO&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: All subjects underwent three 4-week treatments in a randomized crossover trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Diet: Subjects were instructed to follow the National Cholesterol Education&#xD;
      Program (NCEP) Step 2 dietary guidelines. Nuts, soy and dietary supplements (vitamins,&#xD;
      minerals or herbal remedies) were excluded in the background diet during all phases of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments: The three phases were all weight maintaining, self-selected diets: control, full&#xD;
      almond and half almond. Almond: Raw almonds were added as supplements to the subject's usual&#xD;
      diet. Subjects with calorie needs of 2,400 kcal or greater, assessed by LRC tables, received&#xD;
      the full almond supplement (100 g/d, approximately 600 kcal). Subjects requiring between&#xD;
      1,600-2,400 kcal daily received 75% of the full supplement (75 g/d, approximately 450 kcal).&#xD;
      Subjects requiring less than 1,600 kcal daily received 50% of the full supplement (50 g/d,&#xD;
      approximately 300 kcal). Control: The full control supplement was four 150 kcal muffins.&#xD;
      Control supplements was matched with the energy content of the nut supplements; i.e. either&#xD;
      600 kcal/d (4 muffins); 450 kcal/d (3 muffins) or 300 kcal/d (2 muffins). The macronutrient&#xD;
      composition of the muffins conformed to an NCEP Step 2 diet with 25% total fat, &lt;7% saturated&#xD;
      fat (by use of corn oil as the oil commonly used in healthy baked goods), with 18% protein&#xD;
      (the average for our subject population using added skim milk powder), and zero cholesterol.&#xD;
      Muffins were made with wheat flour. Half Portion: The Half Portion was matched with the&#xD;
      energy content of the other two treatment periods. However on this treatment, half of the&#xD;
      energy was derived from almonds and half from the control muffins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: The study consisted of three months subject recruitment and selection; three 4-week&#xD;
      treatment periods where supplements are provided, and at least two-week washout periods&#xD;
      between supplements. (Total duration: approximately 7.5 months per subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Details: Subjects came after a 12h overnight fast to the Risk Factor Modification&#xD;
      Center at St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto) immediately prior to commencement of each study&#xD;
      and at weekly intervals during the course of each study period. Prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study, subjects were instructed on details of the study diet protocol. They were also asked&#xD;
      to maintain a constant level of physical activity throughout the course of the study. At all&#xD;
      visits, body weight (in kg) was obtained in indoor clothing, without shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Bloods were taken at baseline and at weeks 2 and 4 of each phase. Pulmonary air&#xD;
      was collected at baseline and at week 4 of each phase. Diet histories were recorded during&#xD;
      the last week of each phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance:Compliance was assessed from completed one-week diet records where supplement&#xD;
      intake is recorded. Diet records were reviewed by the dietitian with the subject at the end&#xD;
      of the week. In addition, uneaten supplements were returned, weighed and noted on the menu&#xD;
      plans by the dietitian.&#xD;
