      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 25 million HIV-1 infected individuals are currently living in Africa and as many as&#xD;
      50-90% may be co-infected with soil transmitted helminths such as roundworms, hookworms or&#xD;
      whipworms. Helminth infection in HIV-1-infected individuals may increase HIV-1 RNA levels and&#xD;
      increase the rate of progression of HIV-1 to AIDS. Studies have also shown that successful&#xD;
      treatment of helminth co-infection (as documented by clearance of helminth eggs in stool) led&#xD;
      to a significant decrease in HIV-1 plasma viral load (-0.36 log10). This change in viral load&#xD;
      was significantly greater than that seen in those individuals without documented clearance of&#xD;
      their helminth co-infection (+0.67 log10) (p=0.04). Studies conducted in Africa have shown an&#xD;
      estimated 2.5-fold increased risk for sexual transmission of the HIV-1 for each log increase&#xD;
      in plasma HIV-1 viral load. In addition to direct effects on plasma viral load, the rate of&#xD;
      CD4 cell decline in helminth infected individuals may be directly impacted by the significant&#xD;
      immune activation seen with such co-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial examining the potential benefits of&#xD;
      routine empiric helminth eradication in HIV-1 infected adults who do not yet qualify for&#xD;
      antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in Kenya. The current standard of care of symptomatic diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment will be compared to a systematic empiric scheduled de-worming program for HIV&#xD;
      infected adults. The investigators will compare markers of disease progression including rate&#xD;
      of CD4 decline and changes in HIV-1 RNA levels between the two treatment arms.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Epidemiology of HIV-1 and helminth infections in Africa: Over two thirds of all HIV-1&#xD;
      infected individuals live in Africa. An expected 4 million new infections will occur this&#xD;
      year in Africa alone. While antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) offer the hope of stemming this&#xD;
      tremendous public health disaster, the reality is that many individuals are not able to&#xD;
      access ARTs. In addition, millions of HIV infected individuals do not yet qualify for ART&#xD;
      based on clinical or immunologic staging criteria. Alternative care strategies to delay&#xD;
      immunosuppression and reduce infectivity are critically needed. Treatment of co-infections&#xD;
      that are prevalent in areas of high HIV-1 sero-prevalence may be one strategy to address this&#xD;
      need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helminths represent some of the most common infections of humans throughout the world. It is&#xD;
      estimated that over half of all individuals living in Sub-Saharan Africa are infected with at&#xD;
      least on species of soil transmitted helminths. Distribution mapping of HIV-1 sero-prevalence&#xD;
      and helminth infection prevalence reveal remarkably geographic similarities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently conducted a large study of helminth infection among HIV-1 infected adults at&#xD;
      several sites in Kenya. While rates of helminth co-infection are highest in Kilifi and Nyanza&#xD;
      sites, there is a significant rate of co-infection even within the greater Nairobi area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also determined that while hookworm was the most common helminth identified in this&#xD;
      cohort, the type of helminth infection varied significantly with the location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Immunology of helminth co-infection: Helminth infection has been shown to have profound&#xD;
      effects on the immune system. Chronic helminth infection leads to a dominant Th2 immune&#xD;
      profile, anergy to various antigens, and significant activation of the immune system. These&#xD;
      changes suggest that helminth co-infection may significantly affect the host immune response&#xD;
      to HIV-1 viral replication and control. Such immune dysregulation may also increase HIV&#xD;
      co-receptor expression and result in a cell population more susceptible to HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Th1/Th2 Immune Bias: An important immunologic consequence of helminth infection is the&#xD;
      polarization of the immune response to a TH2 subset. This immune modulation by helminth&#xD;
      species appears to be important in tempering TH1 cell mediated inflammation and subsequent&#xD;
      tissue damage to the host. Such modulation may be detrimental to the HIV-1 infected host by&#xD;
      limiting the Th1 immune response that may be important for the control of HIV-1 replication.&#xD;
      The TH2/TH1 response to infection is directly influenced by parasite biology. Helminth&#xD;
      infection results in specific nematode-elicited macrophages (NeMacs) that directly induce&#xD;
      naïve T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells. Cytokine mimics produced by some parasites are&#xD;
      also able to directly induce Th2 cells. Other non-protein molecules produced by helminths are&#xD;
      able to interact with dendritic cells and induce Th2 cells and Treg cells that produce IL-10&#xD;
      and directly lead to a Th2 shift in naïve T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to being inducers of Th2 cells, there is evidence that helminth infection can&#xD;
      directly suppress the Th1 response. This reduction in the Th1 cytokine response is&#xD;
      accompanied by a reduction in virus specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL's). Plasma&#xD;
      HIV-1 viral load is directly related to HIV-1 specific CTL responses in humans and a&#xD;
      reduction in CTL response is associated with a more rapid progression of HIV-1 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Immune Activation: Individuals residing in Africa display high levels of immune activation.&#xD;
      Initial studies of Ethiopian immigrants to Israel revealed elevated levels of plasma IgE and&#xD;
      IgG as well as increased levels of eosinophilia that were strongly associated with the&#xD;
      presence of helminth infection in this population. These individuals were also found to have&#xD;
      significantly activated CD4 lymphocytes that correlated with reduced total CD4 number in this&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several authors have suggested that this increased activation may be important in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. The uncontrolled T cell destruction characteristic of HIV&#xD;
      infection is not due to the direct cytopathic effects of the virus but is more likely the&#xD;
      result of activation-induced cell death. Immune activation markers (namely HLA-DR, Ki-67 and&#xD;
      CD38) have been shown to be more predictive of CD4 decline than plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
      Treatment of helminth infections can result in reversal of this activated immune state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helminth co-infection and clinical HIV-1 disease progression in resource constrained settings&#xD;
      • Effect of treatment on HIV-1 RNA: Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels correlate closely with the burden&#xD;
      of helminth infection as measured by the number of excreted eggs per gram of stool (p &lt;&#xD;
      0.001). In this same cohort, anti-helminth therapy leading to clearance of helminth eggs in&#xD;
      the stool led to a significant decrease in HIV-1 plasma viral load (-0.36 log10) in this&#xD;
      cohort. While this effect may appear modest, mathematical modeling suggests that a 0.5 log&#xD;
      reduction in HIV-1 RNA levels would slow the onset of AIDS by 3.5 years and would delay the&#xD;
      need for antiretroviral medications by almost a full year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, only one randomized controlled trial has been conducted evaluating the effect of&#xD;
      treating helminths on markers of HIV-1 progression. In this small unblinded study conducted&#xD;
      in Zimbabwe, individuals with schistosomiasis (both with and without HIV-1 infection) were&#xD;
      randomized to receive praziquantel at inclusion or after a delay of 3 months. The study found&#xD;
      that the HIV-1 infected individuals receiving early treatment of schistosomiasis had no&#xD;
      change in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels compared to an increase in HIV-1 RNA levels in the delayed&#xD;
      treatment group. However, several other observational studies evaluating the effect of&#xD;
      treating helminth co-infection have found that successful eradication of helminths had no&#xD;
      effect on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels or even led to transient increases in viral load. We are&#xD;
      currently conducting a systematic review for the Cochrane Library evaluating all of the&#xD;
      available data examining the effect of treating helminths of HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect of treatment on CD4 count:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating changes in CD4 counts following therapy for helminth co-infection have&#xD;
      largely failed to find significant differences. The randomized controlled trial noted above&#xD;
      did find that patients treated for helminths in the early treatment group (both HIV&#xD;
      seropositive and seronegative) had a increase in absolute CD4 counts compared to no change in&#xD;
      CD4 counts in the delayed treatment group (p &lt; 0.05). Another study conducted in Ethiopia&#xD;
      found that the treatment of helminth infection in a population of co-infected individuals&#xD;
      resulted in a significant increase in absolute CD4 counts (192 versus 279 cells/mm3, p =&#xD;
      0.002). Other studies have shown no significant difference in CD4 decline following&#xD;
      anti-helminth treatment. The systematic review currently in preparation has not found a trend&#xD;
      towards an effect on CD4 counts in the available studies though all included studies were of&#xD;
      short duration (4 months or less).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Justification of the Study: It is important to determine if empiric deworming can be&#xD;
      beneficial for the millions of pre-HAART HIV-1 positive individuals living in helminth&#xD;
      endemic areas. Documenting the potential effects of such an intervention on markers of&#xD;
      disease progression will serve to inform practical approaches for cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions in resource limited settings. Interval anti-helminth therapy may be a feasible&#xD;
      option in many areas of the world to delay immunosuppression, to enhance the response to&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy or to reduce infectiousness in HIV-1 infected individuals. In&#xD;
      addition, as patients progress to HAART, it is important to determine the ideal timing for&#xD;
      helminth eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Hypothesis: An empiric intensive treatment regimen to eliminate helminths in patients with&#xD;
      HIV-1 may impact markers of disease progression, namely CD4 count and plasma HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      levels, when compared to current standard of practice in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Overall General Objectives: To evaluate the effect of an empiric intensive helminth&#xD;
      eradication regimen on HIV-1 disease progression in a cohort of HIV-1 infected Kenyan adults&#xD;
      who do not meet criteria for highly active antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of an intensive, empiric deworming regimen on changes in markers&#xD;
           of HIV-1 disease progression, namely time to ART eligibility and time to CD4 count less&#xD;
           than 200 and less than 350 cells/mm3 in a cohort of HIV-1 infected adult Kenyans not&#xD;
           meeting criteria for antiretrovirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if intensive treatment of intestinal helminths in HIV-1 infected adults can&#xD;
           reduce markers of clinical disease progression as measured by WHO staging criteria,&#xD;
           hospitalization and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DESIGNS AND METHODOLOGY • Study Site: The study will be conducted at several HIV care&#xD;
           sites in Kenya. The University of Washington has a history of collaborative research&#xD;
           with the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the University of Nairobi, and Kenyatta&#xD;
           National Hospital; all leading academic institutions in Kenya. Enrollment in the&#xD;
           randomized clinical trial will take place at up to three sites in Kenya. The&#xD;
           determination of sites will be based on ongoing studies of helminth prevalence in Kenya&#xD;
           (Walson JL, Otieno P, ongoing) and may include AMREF/CDC Clinic in Kibera, KNH&#xD;
           Comprehensive Care Clinic, KEMRI CCC, Homa Bay District Hospital, Kisii District&#xD;
           Hospital, Kisumu District Hospital, Kerugoya District Hospital, Machakos District&#xD;
           Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital, Thika District Hospital, and The Comprehensive&#xD;
           Care and Research Clinic at Kilifi District Hospital (CGMR-C).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study Populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Individuals who are 18 years or older, who are not currently on antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
           and who are interested in study participation will be enrolled after written informed&#xD;
           consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Sample Size: Sample size determination - Assuming a power of 90% and alpha of 0.05, we&#xD;
           have calculated that 340 individuals would be needed in each arm to detect a difference&#xD;
           in CD4 decline of 50 cells/mm3 between the two groups (SD of 200 cells/mm3) over the two&#xD;
           years of follow up. Given a maximum expected loss to follow up of approximately 20% over&#xD;
           the 24 months of follow up and a maximum of 20% beginning ARV therapy, we will enroll&#xD;
           1200 individuals in the trial to ensure that 340 individuals are available in each arm&#xD;
           for analysis. This sample size will also provide greater than 90% power to detect a 0.5&#xD;
           log difference in log10 HIV RNA levels between the treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 1: randomized clinical trial Specific Aim 2: randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Summary: We propose a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of an intensive&#xD;
           deworming care package versus standard of care in a cohort of HIV-1 seropositive adults&#xD;
           who do not yet meet criteria for antiretroviral medications. Participants will be&#xD;
           randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm 1 will receive an intensive regimen of&#xD;
           anti-helminthic therapy consisting of albendazole every three months for two years and&#xD;
           praziquantel at enrollment and at one year of follow up. Arm 2 will receive symptomatic&#xD;
           diagnosis and treatment of helminth infection as is current standard of care in Kenya.&#xD;
           The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate changes in CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
           over the two years of follow up in each of the study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adult men and women participating in or referred to the HIV Care and Treatment Clinics&#xD;
           at each of the included sites will be offered screening for eligibility. HIV-1&#xD;
           seropositive individuals with a documented CD4 count greater than 350 cells/mm3 will be&#xD;
           considered potentially eligible. Those who agree to participate, are willing and able to&#xD;
           provide informed consent, are WHO stage I or II based on clinical exam and history, are&#xD;
           18 years of age or older, have not been treated with worm medication in the previous 4&#xD;
           months and who are not pregnant (based on urine beta-HCG testing if female) will be&#xD;
           offered to participate in this trial. Pregnancy testing will be performed at each study&#xD;
           visit (every three months) for all premenopausal women. Women who become pregnant during&#xD;
           the course of the study will continue to be followed but will not receive any further&#xD;
           study medication during pregnancy if they had been randomized to study arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening for trial eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
           At each selected clinical trial study site, HIV-1 infected individuals who meet&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria will be informed about the ongoing study. A physical&#xD;
           examination will be conducted on all prospective clients, and those found to have&#xD;
           clinical pallor or signs of WHO Stage III or IV HIV will be excluded from the study and&#xD;
           referred for appropriate medical management. Those who meet criteria and wish to&#xD;
           participate will be referred to the study staff for possible enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All invited participants will be required to sign written informed consent prior to&#xD;
           enrollment. At enrollment, all participants will complete a standardized questionnaire&#xD;
           assessing medical and social history and will undergo a complete physical examination.&#xD;
           Blood specimens will be collected for full blood count with differential measurement of&#xD;
           absolute CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A detailed questionnaire will also be administered in order to assess socio-economic&#xD;
           status, living conditions, level of education completed and occupation. This&#xD;
           questionnaire will also document potential exposures to helminth infection such as water&#xD;
           supply, sanitation facilities, exposure to large bodies of water and type of foot&#xD;
           covering used. In addition, a detailed clinical history will also be collected to&#xD;
           document any prior illnesses or treatments relevant to HIV-1 or co-infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Detailed information regarding the location of each participant's current residence and&#xD;
           any additional residences that they consider as a primary dwelling will also be&#xD;
           collected by field workers at each site. Global positioning system information will be&#xD;
           collected at the location of each participants site of primary residence to facilitate&#xD;
           patient tracing. This information will be stored as well as any other potential contact&#xD;
           information available (such as cell phone numbers) in order that participants may be&#xD;
           traced for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After signing informed consent and being enrolled, participants will be randomized into&#xD;
           one of two treatment arms. The study biostatistician will generate block randomization&#xD;
           codes for the sites. Both the investigators and the participants will remain blinded to&#xD;
           study arm allocation until randomization occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All enrolled participants will have scheduled study visits every third month for 24&#xD;
           months (enrollment, months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24) at the clinic from which they&#xD;
           were enrolled. At each follow up visit, a standardized questionnaire designed to assess&#xD;
           any change in socio-demographic variables or clinical history will be performed. A&#xD;
           physical examination will also be performed at each visit. Blood will be collected at&#xD;
           enrollment, months 6, 12, 18 and 24 for measurement of full blood count with&#xD;
           differential and CD4 count. Measurement of HIV-1 RNA will be collected at enrollment,&#xD;
           the 12 month visit and the 24 month visit. All blood will be separated into plasma and&#xD;
           PBMC's (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and stored for future studies. Any future&#xD;
           study utilizing stored specimens will obtain approval from both the Kenya Medical&#xD;
           Research Institute and the University of Washington Ethical Review Boards. All&#xD;
           participants will provide a single stool sample at the final 24 month follow up visit to&#xD;
           determine helminth infection status at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Rationale for not screening stool samples at each visit: Participants will not be&#xD;
           screened for helminth infection at enrollment or during the course of this study. The&#xD;
           only testing for helminth infection status will occur at the final visit. The rationale&#xD;
           for this design is principally due to the study objectives. The study is designed to&#xD;
           assess the potential benefit of empiric helminth therapy in HIV-1 infected individual's&#xD;
           not yet meeting criteria for initiation of antiretroviral medications. As such, it is&#xD;
           important to determine if HIV infected individuals in areas of moderate helminth&#xD;
           prevalence (20-40%) would benefit from a program of empiric deworming as part of their&#xD;
           pre-HAART care package. It is critical that participants be enrolled regardless of&#xD;
           helminth infection status in order to determine if empiric therapy should be considered&#xD;
           as a useful addition to the care package currently provided to these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Storage of stool samples for evaluation of helminth status following completion of the&#xD;
           study is also not feasible for several reasons. Most importantly, there are ethical&#xD;
           issues related to the collection of samples (and therefore the potential knowledge of&#xD;
           infection status) without providing directed therapy. If helminth status is known (or&#xD;
           potentially known), the standard of care in Kenya would change from symptomatic&#xD;
           screening and treatment to definitive pathogen directed therapy. This would alter the&#xD;
           intervention arms in the current study. In addition, the most common helminth at all of&#xD;
           the sites sampled in our previous study was hookworm. Hookworm eggs are fragile and&#xD;
           rapidly degrade. None of the currently available techniques will preserve hookworm eggs&#xD;
           reliably and so any delayed evaluation of helminth infection status is likely to miss&#xD;
           many infections and therefore not provide any additional useful information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Laboratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Between ten and twenty millilitres of blood will be drawn each visit where laboratory&#xD;
           investigations are being conducted (months 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24). This quantity of blood&#xD;
           is being drawn for the following assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CD4 measurement (5 mL) will be assessed by FACSCount or FACSCalibur at the individual&#xD;
           study sites or at the KEMRI/University of Washington Flow Laboratory at the Centre for&#xD;
           Clinical Research in Nairobi, Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full Blood Counts with Differential (2 mL) will be assessed at each individual study&#xD;
           site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stool microscopy will be performed by technicians with training and certification in the&#xD;
           differentiation and quantification of stool helminth species. Stool will be prepared for&#xD;
           examination by wet preparation, Kato-Katz technique and formol-ether concentration. Both&#xD;
           qualitative and quantitative diagnosis will be made for all helminths identified in&#xD;
           stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA) (3 mL) will be assessed in the Centre for Clinical&#xD;
           Research, KEMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. HIV-1 RNA levels (10 mL) will be quantified at the Kenya Medical Research&#xD;
           Institute/Centers for Disease Control, Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Data Management and Analysis: This study is being carried out at several clinical&#xD;
           sites in Kenya. Clinical and laboratory data for each participant will be abstracted&#xD;
           from routine clinical data forms into standardized trial files. These data will be&#xD;
           entered weekly into a computer using a computerized database designed and maintained by&#xD;
           the study investigators. Information will be cross checked for accuracy on a bi-weekly&#xD;
           basis. All data, both hard and soft copy format, will be stored in locked cabinets with&#xD;
           limited access by study staff only. Participants will be identified by a unique study ID&#xD;
           number and the code linking the study ID to individual identifying information will be&#xD;
           kept in a separate secure location by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data will be collected on preprinted forms and data entered into a software data&#xD;
           management program (Teleform SPSS, MS ACCESS or SQL). Data will be collected at&#xD;
           enrollment and at each follow up visit on these forms. Following collection, the data&#xD;
           forms will be entered into the database as described above. Original data forms will be&#xD;
           stored in the study offices with access restricted to study investigators. Following&#xD;
           completion of all data collection, the data forms will be archived. At 1-year following&#xD;
           completion of the study, identifiers will be removed from the data. Data will be the&#xD;
           property or KEMRI and the University of Washington.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A data clerk from KEMRI will be employed to hand verify that all data is completed&#xD;
           accurately and that the computerized scanned data is comparable to the paper forms. Data&#xD;
           will be cleaned by the Principal Investigator, the data manager and data clerk and at&#xD;
           that time a second verification of accuracy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 1: All analyses will be intent-to-treat. To assess the success of randomization we&#xD;
           will compare baseline characteristics between the 2 randomization groups using&#xD;
           Chi-square tests for categorical data and Mann-Whitney U-tests or t-tests for continuous&#xD;
           data. To determine the effect of anti-helminth treatment on disease progression markers,&#xD;
           we will compare the time to eligibility for ART between the groups and the time to CD4&#xD;
           counts of less than 200 and 350 respectively using Cox regression analysis models. If&#xD;
           current treatment guidelines for the initiation of ART change during the course of the&#xD;
           study, the analysis plan would incorporate that change in ART eligibility criteria as a&#xD;
           date dependent event. In addition, we will compare changes in measurements of mean CD4&#xD;
           count and log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA in the two study arms using linear mixed effects models&#xD;
           or linear regression censoring values after initiation of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2: To determine the effect of anti-helminth treatment on clinical disease&#xD;
           progression markers, we will compare time to changes in WHO Clinical Staging, time to&#xD;
           hospitalization, and time to death using Cox regression analysis models. We will also&#xD;
           compare the treatment arms for CD4 response to ARVs, and development of IRIS among those&#xD;
           who initiate therapy during the course of the trial using regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy assessment The primary measure of efficacy for the randomized clinical trial is&#xD;
           the time to ART eligibility and the time to CD4 counts of less than 200 and 350&#xD;
           cells/mm3. Secondary measures of efficacy will include changes in WHO Clinical Staging,&#xD;
           development of IRIS, time to hospitalization, time to death, time to initiation of ARVs&#xD;
           and CD4 response to ARVs as well as the development of IRIS among those who initiate&#xD;
           ARVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety and loss to follow up All participants will be monitored over the course of the&#xD;
           trial for adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and HIV related morbidity. Any&#xD;
           participant experiencing National Institutes of Health grade 3-4 toxicity after receipt&#xD;
           of anti-helminthic therapy will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened and will meet every 6 months&#xD;
           following the start of enrolment to review safety data including all adverse events,&#xD;
           protocol violations and any other reported events. In addition, the DSMB will review&#xD;
           interim data when 250 patients have completed 12 months of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants failing to meet a clinic appointment or follow up will be identified and&#xD;
           have their study file flagged. If a participant fails to return to clinic within two&#xD;
           weeks following a missed appointment, a social worker or peer counselor will attempt to&#xD;
           contact the participant to encourage attendance using the contact information provided&#xD;
           at enrollment. All attempts at contact will be recorded. If a participant desires to be&#xD;
           removed from the study or fails to follow up after 3 consecutive attempts by the peer&#xD;
           counselors or social workers to encourage follow up, the participant will be considered&#xD;
           lost to follow up. It the study staff is unable to trace the patient for a period of 60&#xD;
           days following a missed appointment, the participant will be considered lost to follow&#xD;
           up. If a participant dies in the course of the study, a verbal autopsy will be obtained&#xD;
           from family members or household contacts where possible for classification of possible&#xD;
           cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who meet criteria for the initiation of septrin prophylaxis or ARV's during&#xD;
           the course of the study (based on CD4 count or clinical criteria) will be referred for&#xD;
           initiation of treatment at the clinic at which they were enrolled. All of the clinics&#xD;
           considered as study sites are supported by Government of Kenya and PEPFAR and provide&#xD;
           antiretroviral therapy and septrin prophylaxis at no charge to clients who qualify.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will require approximately 3-4 years for completion. Enrollment will occur&#xD;
           over a 6 month period. All participants will be followed for 24 months after enrollment.&#xD;
           Thus, it will take approximately 2.5 years to enroll, randomize and complete follow up&#xD;
           for all of the patients in the study. An additional 6 months of preparation time will be&#xD;
           required to develop the database and prepare each site for study enrollment. Following&#xD;
           completion of follow up, we anticipate an additional 6 months will be necessary to&#xD;
           complete all laboratory investigations, data analysis, data cleaning and completion of a&#xD;
           manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Ethical approval: Study approvals will be obtained from the University of Washington&#xD;
           and the KEMRI ethical review boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Benefits: This study has been designed to address several areas of major public health&#xD;
           significance for HIV-1 infected individuals in resource poor settings. If we are able to&#xD;
           show that treatment of helminth co-infection in HIV-1 infected individual's delays&#xD;
           immunosuppression, millions of HIV infected individuals in resource poor settings may&#xD;
           benefit. Participants randomized to the intensive intervention arm will benefit from&#xD;
           free treatment and examination given to them. All participants will benefit from&#xD;
           intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Voluntary Participation: All subjects will provide written informed consent prior to&#xD;
           study enrolment. Consent forms will be made available in Swahili as well as in English.&#xD;
           All patients will have the opportunity to have the forms explained to them and to ask&#xD;
           questions of the investigator prior to study enrollment. Patients will be informed of&#xD;
           their right to withdraw consent at any time. Since the participants will spend extra&#xD;
           time to participate in the study, they will receive compensation for transport, but no&#xD;
           other compensation will be provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The field sites where patients will be recruited for screening and enrollment are in&#xD;
           Kenya. All of these sites are currently receiving support through CDC Kenya using the&#xD;
           PEPFAR mechanism. Laboratory procedures will be performed at each clinic site, in&#xD;
           Nairobi and in Seattle, Washington. The study will be reviewed by the Institutional&#xD;
           Review Board (IRB) at the University of Washington and the Ethical Review Board (ERC) at&#xD;
           the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The study will not recruit subjects prior&#xD;
           to approval from both the University of Washington IRB and the KEMRI ERC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be informed of all potential risks. The proposed study will involve adult&#xD;
           men and women infected with HIV-1. All participants will be interviewed. Participants&#xD;
           may experience discomfort while answering some of the questions regarding socio-economic&#xD;
           status. Participants may also be uncomfortable discussing or providing stool samples for&#xD;
           helminth screening. Study staff including social workers and/or peer counselors may&#xD;
           contact the participants by telephone or visit the participants in their home if&#xD;
           scheduled appointments are missed. These visits will be conducted in a manner designed&#xD;
           to protect confidentiality but it is impossible to completely eliminate the risk of&#xD;
           further social stigmatization for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study involves serial blood specimen collection at 5 time points over a two year&#xD;
           period (enrollment and months 6, 12, 18, and 24). The collection of these samples&#xD;
           involves venipuncture which may cause discomfort, pain or bruising. Precautions will be&#xD;
           taken to avoid bleeding by immediate application of a pack and pressure at the injection&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will provide written informed consent prior to screening or enrollment.&#xD;
           Any adverse events associated with anti-helminthic medications will be managed by the&#xD;
           appropriate clinic site, and if necessary, hospitalization. The costs of this care will&#xD;
           be borne by the study. All clinical information including HIV status that is collected&#xD;
           for the purposes of the study will be delinked from any client's identifier. This&#xD;
           includes data collected in the clinic and in the laboratory. All data will be entered&#xD;
           into a password protected computer with no links to identifiers. The code linking&#xD;
           individual patient identifiers to a unique study ID will be kept securely locked in a&#xD;
           separate location under control of the study principal investigator. All study files&#xD;
           will be accessible only to researchers and will be stored in a locked office when not in&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There may be risks associated with use of the study medications, albendazole and&#xD;
           praziquantel:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Albendazole is a benzimidazole carbamate derivative with activity against most nematodes&#xD;
           and some other worms. Albendazole is thought to inhibit cytoplasmic microtubules in the&#xD;
           worm's intestinal tract leading to decreased glucose uptake and depletion of glycogen&#xD;
           stores in the worm. Three 400 mg doses of albendazole has efficacy against whipworm,&#xD;
           hookworm and roundworm infections, all of which we expect to be prevalent in this&#xD;
           cohort. A recent randomized controlled trial of various albendazole dosing regimens&#xD;
           showed that a single 400mg dose of albendazole was associated with a significantly lower&#xD;
           rate of cure (23%) compared to a three day regimen (67%). In this study, reduction in&#xD;
           the number of eggs/gm of feces with a single 400mg dose was 96.8% compared to 99.7% with&#xD;
           the three day regimen. Albendazole is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
           and has minimal side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Praziquantel is a heterocyclic prazino-isoquinoline derivative with significant activity&#xD;
           against both cestodes and trematodes. Praziquantel is highly effective against&#xD;
           schistosomes in humans and there have been no confirmed cases of resistance reported.&#xD;
           Praziquantel is well tolerated and severe adverse reactions are rare. There have been&#xD;
           rare cases of increased intracranial pressure during treatment in patients with&#xD;
           neurocysticercosis. This is not anticipated to be an issue in Kenya due to the low level&#xD;
           of pork consumption in this population and the rarity of Taenia solium. In the study&#xD;
           described above, we screened over 1600 individuals for helminths and documented no cases&#xD;
           of Taenia solium (Walson J, unpublished data). Praziquantel is contraindicated in&#xD;
           pregnancy and all female patients will undergo urine beta-HCG testing prior to&#xD;
           administration. Pregnant or breast feeding women will not receive praziquantel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with obvious clinical signs or symptoms of anaemia, significant diarrhoea or&#xD;
           abdominal pain will not be enrolled. Neither routine screening of asymptomatic helminth&#xD;
           infection nor empiric anti-helminth therapy is currently conducted in adults in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Confidentiality: Patients will be assigned a study number at enrollment. This number&#xD;
           will be used to identify patients for all matters related to data analysis. The forms&#xD;
           linking patient names and demographic information to particular ID numbers will be kept&#xD;
           locked in a file at the office of the Fellow Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Expected application of result: We anticipate that the proposed study will help to&#xD;
           determine the role that common helminth co-infections play in HIV-1 pathogenesis and&#xD;
           progression. If empiric deworming is found to significantly slow HIV-1 disease&#xD;
           progression, it may be a cost-effective and easily implemented strategy to add to the&#xD;
           current treatment options in helminth endemic areas.&#xD;
