    <textblock>
      In people with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria is a strong, independent risk factor for&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. ACE inhibitor therapy&#xD;
      decreased the risk of microalbuminuria in hypertensive subjects with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      normoalbuminuria by about 40%. Available data suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers&#xD;
      (ARBs) might have a similar renoprotective effect and that this effect might be increased by&#xD;
      combined ACE inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the effects, at similar blood pressure control (systolic/diastolic&#xD;
      &lt;130/80 mmHg), for a period of three years, of dual renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) blockade&#xD;
      by benazepril and valsartan combination therapy as compared to single RAS blockade by&#xD;
      benazepril or valsartan alone on microalbuminuria and cardiovascular events in high-risk&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes, creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dl, no evidence of microalbuminuria but at&#xD;
      high risk of renal disease, with hypertension and a urinary albumin excretion between 7 and&#xD;
      19 microgram/min. The relationship between albuminuria and cardiovascular outcomes will also&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to show a more effective prevention of microalbuminuria and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events with combined than with single drug ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. As&#xD;
      compared to ACE inhibitor, ARB therapy is expected to have a similar effect on&#xD;
      microalbuminuria, but an inferior cardioprotective effect. Applied to clinical practice, the&#xD;
      findings should help preventing renal and cardiovascular complications, and related treatment&#xD;
      costs, of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nephropathy of type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the&#xD;
      world.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes affects over 170 million&#xD;
      people, and, due to progressive aging of the population, life-style modifications and&#xD;
      increasing burden of obesity, this number is expected to rise to 370 millions by 2030. About&#xD;
      one third of those affected will eventually have progressive deterioration of renal function&#xD;
      Untreated, these patients progress to ESRD within 10 years or die prematurely because of&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications (that are 10-fold more frequent in diabetics with nephropathy&#xD;
      than in those without and the general population). Costs for renal replacement therapy of&#xD;
      these patients - and for treatment of related complications - are also progressively&#xD;
      increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent microalbuminuria is the first clinical sign of renal dysfunction in diabetic&#xD;
      patients and progresses to overt proteinuria in 20 to 40 percent of cases. In 10 to 50&#xD;
      percent of patients with proteinuria, chronic kidney disease develops that ultimately&#xD;
      requires dialysis or transplantation. Of great concern, 40 to 50 percent of type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients with microalbuminuria eventually die of cardiovascular disease.Thus, preventing (or&#xD;
      delaying) the development of microalbuminuria is a key treatment goal for renoprotection and,&#xD;
      possibly, for cardioprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large scale randomized trial, the BErgamo NEphrologic DIabetes Complications Trial&#xD;
      (BENEDICT) found that treatment with the ACE-inhibitor trandolapril (either alone or combined&#xD;
      to the calcium channel blocker verapamil) significantly reduced the incidence of&#xD;
      microalbuminuria in 1204 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, but normal urinary&#xD;
      albumin excretion, as compared with placebo. The effect of preventing microalbuminuria&#xD;
      exceeded expectations based on changes in blood pressure alone and was not enhanced by&#xD;
      combined calcium channel blocker therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and micro- or macro- albuminuria clearly show that&#xD;
      ARBs can have renoprotective effect but trials evaluating the effects of angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blockers (ARBs) on the incidence of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with normal&#xD;
      urinary albumin excretion rate are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether the beneficial effect against the development of microalbuminuria is enhanced when&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors and ARBs are given in combination is not established so far. However, finding&#xD;
      that combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy more effectively than single drug RAS blockade&#xD;
      reduced albuminuria or proteinuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes and slowed progression to&#xD;
      ESRD in those with non-diabetic chronic nephropathies, suggests that the renoprotective&#xD;
      effect of combined therapy could be superior to that of single drug blockade of the RAS also&#xD;
      in diabetic patients with no evidence of renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post hoc analyses of the BENEDICT trial found that high-normal albuminuria at baseline&#xD;
      evaluation (defined as a urinary albumin excretion rate between 10 µg/min and the upper limit&#xD;
      for study entry: 19 µg/min) was the strongest baseline predictor of subsequent development of&#xD;
      microalbuminuria. Indeed, regardless of treatment randomization, 69 of 271 (25.5%) patients&#xD;
      with high-normal albuminuria (urinary albumin excretion &gt;10µg/min) progressed to the end&#xD;
      point as compared to only 32 of 933 (3.4%) with low-normal albuminuria (&lt;10%). Thus,&#xD;
      large-part of the excess risk for microalbuminuria observed in people with type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      associated with high-normal albuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this clinical trial might have a clinical relevance for the Italian National&#xD;
      Health service (SSN): applied to clinical practice the results should help in reducing renal&#xD;
      and cardiovascular complications and related treatment costs, of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Primary To evaluate whether, at comparable blood pressure control, dual RAS blockade&#xD;
      with combined therapy with halved doses of benazepril (10 mg/day) and valsartan (160 mg/day)&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of microalbuminuria more effectively than single drug RAS blockade by&#xD;
      full doses of benazepril (20 mg/day) given alone in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and high normal albuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether, at comparable blood pressure control, dual RAS blockade with&#xD;
           combined therapy with halved doses of benazepril (10 mg/day) and valsartan (160 mg/day)&#xD;
           reduces the incidence of microalbuminuria more effectively than valsartan (320 mg/day)&#xD;
           given alone in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and high normal&#xD;
           albuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether, at comparable blood pressure control, the effects of benazepril and&#xD;
           valsartan therapy are similar or whether, alternatively, one of the two treatments offer&#xD;
           a superior protective effect against the development of microalbuminuria in the above&#xD;
           study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of the three study treatments on the incidence of fatal and&#xD;
           non-fatal cardiovascular events, regression to low-normal albuminuria (urinary albumin&#xD;
           excretion &lt;7 µg/min), albuminuria (considered as a continuous variable), serum&#xD;
           creatinine, lipid profile, and GFR (in a representative subgroup);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationships, in the study group as a whole and within each treatment&#xD;
           group, between renal outcome variables (including microalbuminuria and time-dependent&#xD;
           changes in albuminuria) and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, between achieved&#xD;
           blood pressure or metabolic control and renal and/or cardiovascular outcome variables&#xD;
           and between achieved albuminuria reduction or residual follow-up albuminuria and renal&#xD;
           and/or cardiovascular outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This will be a multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Open label, Blinded End point&#xD;
      (PROBE) trial of 3-year treatment with halved doses of benazepril (10 mg/day) and valsartan&#xD;
      (160 mg/day) given in combination, or full doses of both benazepril (20 mg/day), or valsartan&#xD;
      (320 mg/day) given alone in 1020 consenting patients &gt;40 year old, with type 2 diabetes (WHO&#xD;
      criteria), serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dl, high-normal albuminuria (UAE &gt;7 and &lt;20 µg/min in at&#xD;
      least 2 of 3 overnight urine collections), and no specific contraindications to the study&#xD;
      drugs. Primary outcome variable will be microalbuminuria (UAE &gt; 20µg /min in at least 2 of 3&#xD;
      overnight urine collections in two consecutive visits 2 months apart) and primary comparison&#xD;
      will be between the combined benazepril plus valsartan and the benazepril alone groups. The&#xD;
      analysis will have an 80% power to detect (p=0.05, two-side test) a 40% difference in the&#xD;
      incidence of microalbuminuria.&#xD;
