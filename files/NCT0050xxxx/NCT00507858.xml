      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of pemetrexed when given with&#xD;
           dexamethasone. (Please note: One of the three treatment groups will not receive&#xD;
           dexamethasone)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess dose limiting toxicity (DLT), which is defined as grade 4 neutropenia &gt; 7 days&#xD;
           duration, neutropenic fever, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or any grade 3 or 4&#xD;
           non-hematologic toxicity excluding nausea/vomiting and excluding grade 3 transaminase&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine objective response rate, as defined as complete response (CR) or partial&#xD;
           response (PR), confirmed by 2 CT scans at least 6 weeks apart in patients treated with&#xD;
           pemetrexed as a single agent with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;

      Pemetrexed is designed to block enzymes in the body that are important for tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to one of 3&#xD;
      groups. All participants will receive pemetrexed once every 3 weeks through a needle in the&#xD;
      vein over about 10 minutes. Every 3 weeks is considered 1 cycle. Participants in Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive pemetrexed only. Participants in Group 2 will also receive dexamethasone on Day 1 of&#xD;
      each cycle through a needle in the vein. Participants in Group 3 will take dexamethasone by&#xD;
      mouth the day before, the day of, and the day after receiving pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) different dose levels of pemetrexed will be studied. The first group of 6&#xD;
      participants will be treated at Dose Level 1 (lowest of the 3 doses) and evaluated for 3&#xD;
      weeks. If 0 or 1 out of 6 participants experience severe side effects at Dose Level 1, the&#xD;
      next group of 6 participants will be treated at Dose Level 2. At any given dose, if greater&#xD;
      than 1 out of 6 participants experience severe side effects, then no further participants&#xD;
      will receive that dose or a higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 weeks (each cycle), you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital&#xD;
      signs (temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure) and weight. Blood (about 3-4&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A performance status evaluation (a test&#xD;
      looking at the ability to perform everyday activities) and a liver function test will also be&#xD;
      done. Your tumor will be evaluated by CT scan and chest x-ray every 2 cycles of study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study, you will be required to take folic acid by mouth every day for 5-7 days&#xD;
      before the first dose of pemetrexed and continuing until 3 weeks after your last dose of&#xD;
      pemetrexed. You will also receive an injection of vitamin B12 into your muscle 1 to 2 weeks&#xD;
      before your first dose of pemetrexed. The vitamin B12 injection will be repeated every 9&#xD;
      weeks until 3 weeks after your last dose of pemetrexed. It is very important that folic acid&#xD;
      and vitamin B12 be given to decrease the risk of severe side effects from the pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. You will be taken off study if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or intolerable side effects occur. When you stop taking study drug on this study, you&#xD;
      will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (temperature, pulse,&#xD;
      breathing rate, and blood pressure) and weight. Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be collected&#xD;
      for routine tests. A performance status evaluation (a test looking at the ability to perform&#xD;
      everyday activities) and a liver function test (about 1-2 teaspoons of blood) will also be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of 6 cycles of treatment, you will be asked to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up visits every 2-3 months for standard follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved pemetrexed for the treatment of&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. However, the FDA has authorized pemetrexed for research only in&#xD;
      the patients with HNSCC. Between 40-50 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
