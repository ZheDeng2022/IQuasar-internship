      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of mirvetuximab soravtansine and&#xD;
      rucaparib camsylate in treating participants with endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer that has come back. Drugs such as mirvetuximab soravtansine are&#xD;
      antibodies linked to a toxic substance and may help find certain tumor cells and kill them&#xD;
      without harming normal cells. Rucaparib camsylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving mirvetuximab soravtansine and&#xD;
      rucaparib camsylate may work better in treating participants with recurrent endometrial,&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of combination mirvetuximab soravtansine&#xD;
      and rucaparib camsylate (rucaparib) in patients with recurrent endometrial, epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of combination mirvetuximab soravtansine and&#xD;
      rucaparib in study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of&#xD;
      combination mirvetuximab soravtansine and rucaparib as measured by Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure the progression free survival. IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      mirvetuximab soravtansine and rucaparib in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore additional biomarkers of response. II. Explore mutation characteristics and&#xD;
      frequency with treatment response. III. Evaluate if companion diagnostics can be optimized by&#xD;
      combining loss of heterozygosity (LOH) score and level of folate receptor a (FR-alpha)&#xD;
      expression, and possible additional predictors of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore mechanisms of secondary resistance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive mirvetuximab soravtansine intravenously (IV) on day 1 and rucaparib&#xD;
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1 through 21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to a year.&#xD;
