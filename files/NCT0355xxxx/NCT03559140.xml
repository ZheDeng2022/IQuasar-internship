    <textblock>
      The goal of this research was to relate the occurrence of post-endodontic pain after&#xD;
      single-visit RCT using there irrigating regime. Methodology: All 216 patients had upper or&#xD;
      lower molar, premolar or anterior teeth selected for conventional RCT for prosthetic reasons&#xD;
      detected with only vital pulps. Of the sample of 216 teeth, were selected to just one method&#xD;
      for instrumentation and different manner to irrigate. All instruments were used with a micro&#xD;
      motor (VDW, Munich Germany). Reciproc instruments. Final irrigation with cold (8oC, 2.5 oC&#xD;
      and room temperature 17% EDTA and saline solution served as a lubricants.&#xD;

      Two hundred and sixteen of 245 patients (119 women and 97 men) aged 18-65 years were referred&#xD;
      and incorporated in this research while 29 were excluded as not meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. All patients presented with a vital upper or lower molar, premolar or anterior&#xD;
      teeth selected for conventional root canal treatment for prosthetic reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients rejecting to join the study or rejecting, single-visit root canal treatment,&#xD;
      consuming analgesics or NSAIDs were excluded too. All participants were informed on the&#xD;
      goals, risks and strategy of the study, and written informed consent permissions were gained&#xD;
      previous their enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random Selection of instrumentation groups. An investigator who had not contributed in the&#xD;
      study made the randomization arrangement using a computer random table generator&#xD;
      (www.random.org). Each patient receive a consecutive number. A total of 216 patients met the&#xD;
      inclusion requirements and were incorporated in the study. Of the sample of 216 teeth, 72&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to the one of the 3 irrigating methods. Treatment was performed by 3&#xD;
      experienced endodontists; each prepared 72 teeth, 24 per method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol All patients were anesthetized with two carpules of articaine 2% with&#xD;
      epinephrine 1:200,000 (Septodont, Saint-Maur des-Fosses, France). In cases in which&#xD;
      supplemental anesthesia was needed, intraligamental anesthesia (2 mL articaine 2%) was&#xD;
      administered. For the upper teeth, the 2 carpules were administered by gradual infiltration&#xD;
      in the buccal vestibule. For the lower teeth, 1.5 of the carpules was used for an inferior&#xD;
      alveolar nerve block and the other 1.5 for a gentle buccal infiltration around the tooth to&#xD;
      be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After absolute isolation using rubber dam, the tooth was disinfected with 5.25% NaOCl.&#xD;
      Preparation of the access cavity was performed using # 331 bur (Dentsply International, York,&#xD;
      PA), with high-speed and water cooling. 5.25% NaOCl was used to clean the coronal cavity. The&#xD;
      root canals were carefully probed with #10 K-type hand files (Flex-R files, Moyco/Union&#xD;
      Broach, York PA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      REDTA (Roth International, Chicago, IL) lubricant was located at the entry of the canals.&#xD;
      Working length was determined with a #15 k-file and the Root ZX electronic device (J Morita,&#xD;
      Irvine CA, USA), followed by subtracting 0.5 mm from the measurement, which was confirmed&#xD;
      radiographically (Schick Technologies, NY, USA). Cervical and middle thirds of the root canal&#xD;
      was flared with a K3XF 25/10 rotary instrument (Kerr Endo, Orange County, CA) at 500 rpm. The&#xD;
      root canal was irrigated with 3 mL 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). A glide path to the WL&#xD;
      was the established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For mechanical preparations, all instruments were used with a micro motor (VDW Silver Motor,&#xD;
      VDW, Munich Germany). Torque and rotation were preset for each Reciproc instrument. Rotary&#xD;
      Ni-Ti instruments were used in continuous reciprocating mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentinal debris was eliminated from the file with a gauze, instantaneously to the instrument&#xD;
      change after 2-3 in-and-out (pecking) movements (Reciproc) following the manufacturers'&#xD;
      recommendations. Each root canal was irrigated with 2.5mL 2.6% NaOCl. Irrigation was&#xD;
      performed using a 24-gauge needle (Max-I-Probe; Tulsa Dental, York, PA) and a 31-G NaviTip&#xD;
      needle (Ultradent Products Inc, South Jordan, UT) when reaching the WL after each instrument&#xD;
      insertion. A size #10 K file was used to maintain WL after each Reciproc instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A. The R25 (size 25/ .08) instrument was used in thin and curved root canals, and R40&#xD;
      files (40/ .06) were used in wide root canals. Three in-and-out pecking motions were used&#xD;
      with an amplitude of not more than 3 mm until reaching the estimated working length. Patients&#xD;
      assigned to this group receive a final irrigation with 5 mL cold (8oC) 17% EDTA followed with&#xD;
      20 mL cold (8oC) sterile saline solution delivered to the WL using a cold (8oC) sterile&#xD;
      microcannula attached to the Endo Vac System (Kerr Endo) for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B. Canals were prepared as in group A, Patients assigned to this group receive a final&#xD;
      irrigation with 5 mL cold (2.5oC) 17% EDTA followed with 20 mL cold (2.5oC) sterile saline&#xD;
      solution delivered to the WL using a cold (2.5oC) sterile microcannula attached to the Endo&#xD;
      Vac System (Kerr Endo) for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (CG). The R25 (size 25/ .08) instrument was used in thin and curved root&#xD;
      canals, and R40 files (40/ .06) were used in wide root canals. Three in-and-out pecking&#xD;
      motions were used with an amplitude of not more than 3 mm until reaching the estimated&#xD;
      working length. Reciproc instruments were used in one tooth only (single use). Patients&#xD;
      assigned to this control group were treated identically to the experimental groups, except&#xD;
      that receive a final irrigation with 5 mL (room temperature) 17% EDTA followed with 20 mL&#xD;
      (room temperature) sterile saline solution delivered to the WL using a sterile microcannula&#xD;
      attached to the Endo Vac System (Kerr Endo) for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After instrumentation, the root canals were irrigated with 1 mL 2.6% NaOCl, agitated&#xD;
      ultrasonically. Ultrasonic activation was performed using an Irrisafe ultrasonic 20.00 tip&#xD;
      (Satelec, Merignac, France) at 50% power of the MiniEndo ultrasonic unit (Kerr Endo) with the&#xD;
      tip placed 3 mm from the working length for 30 seconds per root canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each experimental and control group received a final irrigation with the irrigant described&#xD;
      above, to eliminate the smear layer and reduce post-endodontic pain. Caution was taken to&#xD;
      ensure that the micro cannula would suction correctly by detecting the system's transparent&#xD;
      evacuation tube. In case there was any obstruction, the micro cannula was instantly&#xD;
      substituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recapitulation of working length was performed again by using an apex locator as described&#xD;
      before using #35 and #40 files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root canals were dried with disinfected paper points and obturated at the same visit.&#xD;
      Gutta-percha cones (Dentsply Maillefer) were laterally compacted with #20 nickel-titanium&#xD;
      spreaders (Dentsply Maillefer) and AH-plus as the sealer (Dentsply Maillefer). The access&#xD;
      cavities of anterior and posterior teeth were etched and repaired with Fuji IX (GC Corp,&#xD;
      Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Post-endodontic pain and Statistical Analysis After these irrigation regimens,&#xD;
      the patients were informed of the probable incidence of pain for days following RCT and&#xD;
      received a survey form (VAS questionnaire) to be finished and returned three days after. In&#xD;
      it, they proof the presence/absence of post-endodontic pain. The pain level was measured&#xD;
      using a validated pain scale known as the VAS. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised&#xD;
      of a horizontal line, which is 10 cm in length. For pain intensity, the VAS is anchored by&#xD;
      ''no pain'' (score of 0) and ''pain as bad as it could be'' (score of 10). The cut points on&#xD;
      the pain VAS are no pain (0-0.5 cm), mild pain (0.6-4.0 cm), moderate pain (0.45-7.4 cm), and&#xD;
      severe pain (7.5-10 cm). The pain VAS was completed by the patients. The patients were asked&#xD;
      to put a mark perpendicular to the pain VAS line at the point that indicated their pain&#xD;
      severity during the 3 days after the endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred and ten of the 216 surveys were returned correctly returned. Of these, 69&#xD;
      belonged to the group A, 70 to group B and 71 to the Control group. The missing 6&#xD;
      questionnaires were returned one day later and were included in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes for the groups A, B and CG associated to occurrence (yes/no), level (mild,&#xD;
      moderate, severe), and interval (days) of post-endodontic pain were evaluated, and related to&#xD;
      the following diagnostic factors: condition of tooth (all vital), occurrence or nonappearance&#xD;
      of pre-operative pain, group of teeth (molar/premolar or anterior), or location (Maxillary,&#xD;
      Mandibular).&#xD;
