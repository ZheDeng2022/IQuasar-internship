  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis remains a concerning health problem, with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) now&#xD;
      causing more deaths than acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). GSK3036656 is a compound&#xD;
      with a novel mechanism of action under development for the treatment of tuberculosis. It&#xD;
      suppresses protein synthesis in MTB by selectively inhibiting the enzyme Leucyl t-ribose&#xD;
      nucleic acid (RNA) synthetase. Thus, this study will investigate the early bactericidal&#xD;
      activity, safety and tolerability of GSK3036656 in up to four sequential cohorts of subjects&#xD;
      with rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis. The primary objective of this dose-escalation study&#xD;
      is to establish the anti-tuberculosis effect of GSK3036656 on serial colony forming units&#xD;
      (CFU) counts of MTB in sputum over 14 days of therapy. Subjects in each cohort will be&#xD;
      randomized in 3:1 ratio to one of two treatments: either GSK3036656 or standard-of-care&#xD;
      (RIFAFOURÂ® e-275) regimen. The approximate duration of the study for an individual subject&#xD;
      will be 5 weeks, including 1 week of screening, 2 weeks of treatment period and another 2&#xD;
      weeks of final follow-up visit. RIFAFOUR e-275 is a registered trademark of Sanofi-Aventis.&#xD;
