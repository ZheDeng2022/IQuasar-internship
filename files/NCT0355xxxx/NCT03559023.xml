    <textblock>
      To investigate the use of ultrasound and manometry to increase the success rate of thoracic&#xD;
      epidural placement. The use of ultrasound for lumbar epidural catheter placement is well&#xD;
      established and is thought to assist in identifying an optimal skin entry point, depth to&#xD;
      lamina and ligamentum flavum, and needle trajectory. The use of sterile manometry tubing to&#xD;
      demonstrate a falling and oscillating fluid column has been described as a confirmatory test&#xD;
      in the placement of lumbar epidurals. This study will determine if the efficacy of thoracic&#xD;
      epidural placement is improved if placement is performed with the use of either US, or&#xD;
      manometry, or both techniques combined, compared with a standard landmark-based placement&#xD;
      technique alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In a variety of thoracic and abdominal surgeries, thoracic epidural placement is associated&#xD;
      with better pain relief, less opioid consumption, a decrease in adverse perioperative cardiac&#xD;
      events, and improved intestinal perfusion and motility. Unfortunately, epidural catheter&#xD;
      placement is challenging and is not always successful. The epidural space in the thoracic&#xD;
      region is especially difficult to access due to the steep and inferior angulation of most of&#xD;
      the spinous processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of thoracic epidurals are placed using a landmark-based technique (i.e.&#xD;
      without ultrasound guidance or fluoroscopy). In addition, a &quot;loss of resistance&quot; technique is&#xD;
      typically used to confirm the needle has entered the epidural space. With a paramedian&#xD;
      technique, the thoracic spinous processes are palpated (if possible), the needle is advanced&#xD;
      through the skin just lateral to the spinous processes until lamina is contacted. The needle&#xD;
      is then redirected medially based on an estimate of the location of the midline at the&#xD;
      interlaminar space. The needle is then &quot;walked&quot; cephalad or caudad to blindly search for the&#xD;
      interlaminar space. The depth to the lamina and interlaminar space are not known which&#xD;
      introduces additional uncertainty in the mind of the operator, who must proceed with caution&#xD;
      so as to not advance the needle too far and puncture the dural sac. It is not surprising that&#xD;
      the landmark approach is associated with a significant number of unsuccessful attempts, long&#xD;
      procedure times, and ineffective catheters, with the percentage of failed thoracic epidurals&#xD;
      reported as high as 32%. In one study, the failure rate confirmed by both epidural waveform&#xD;
      analysis and a sensory test after local anesthetic injection, the primary failure rate was&#xD;
      found to be 23%-24%. A higher number of procedural attempts can also lead to an increased&#xD;
      risk for complications including paresthesia, epidural hematoma, and dural puncture&#xD;
      headaches. The high failure rate of this procedure highlights the need for more studies on&#xD;
      ways to improve the techniques for thoracic epidural access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) has proven to be useful in the imaging of the spine, and has also helped&#xD;
      improve our ability to access the lumbar epidural space. Ultrasound measurement of the&#xD;
      epidural space depth before epidural catheter placement decreased the rate of lumbar epidural&#xD;
      catheter replacements, and reduced the number of epidural attempts when performed by first&#xD;
      year residents compared to attempts without ultrasound guidance. In another study the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound to identify the depth and location of the interlaminar and epidural space improved&#xD;
      placement of labor epidurals with a lower number of block failures, a higher number of&#xD;
      complete blockade, a higher rate of subject satisfaction, and lower VAS scores. Ultrasound&#xD;
      has also been used to image the thoracic spine and epidural space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superior medial border of the thoracic transverse process aligns with the interlaminar&#xD;
      space. This anatomical fact, combined with the ability to use ultrasound to identify the&#xD;
      thoracic transverse processes and other bony landmarks forms the basis of this study. In the&#xD;
      transverse plane, ultrasound can be used to identify the thoracic spinous processes and the&#xD;
      midline. In the paramedian plane, the lamina, articular process and transverse process can be&#xD;
      identified. In the lumbar spine, once the articular process is identified, a paramedian&#xD;
      angulation of the ultrasound beam is used to identify an &quot;acoustic window&quot; between the lamina&#xD;
      and into the spinal canal, thus identifying the interlaminar space. In the thoracic spine,&#xD;
      because of the tight space between the lamina and overlapping of the lamina, an acoustic&#xD;
      window is infrequently visualized and cannot be used as a reliable method to identify the&#xD;
      interlaminar space. In contrast, both the superior border of the transverse process and the&#xD;
      step-off between lamina can be readily identified with ultrasound. Both of these landmarks&#xD;
      align with the interlaminar space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, there is significant variability in techniques used to identify the&#xD;
      correct epidural space. Although the loss of resistance technique is the most commonly used,&#xD;
      variability exists in methods to confirm presence in the epidural space. Once such technique&#xD;
      routinely used at this institution is the manometry technique. This involves using a&#xD;
      three-way stopcock connected to clear plastic tubing IV extension tubing filled with normal&#xD;
      saline. When the loss of resistance is detected, it can be confirmed by connecting the&#xD;
      prefilled tubing to the Tuohy needle and opening the stopcock so the fluid inside is freely&#xD;
      flowing. If the Tuohy needle tip is located in the epidural space, the saline column will&#xD;
      initially fall, then exhibit pulsatility associated with heartbeat and respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of the epidural space by respiratory and heartbeat fluctuations in the&#xD;
      air-fluid level has been previous described. The heart rate variability is believed to be due&#xD;
      to arteriolar pulsations transmitted within a closed epidural space, while the respiratory&#xD;
      variation in air fluid level is believed to be due to venous engorgement of the epidural&#xD;
      veins with changes in thoracic pressure during inspiration. In the past 30 years, a handful&#xD;
      of studies have been published evaluating epidural pressure measurement. Many of the studies&#xD;
      using gravity to confirm presence in epidural space also use a pressure transducer to produce&#xD;
      a visual waveform showing increase in pressure upon entry into the ligamentum flavum, and&#xD;
      decrease in pressure upon entry into the epidural space. Two of these studies also&#xD;
      incorporated an audible alarm to indicate change in pressure. One study correlated epidurals&#xD;
      placed with pressure transducers to confirm the epidural space with presence or absence of&#xD;
      block post-op and contrast spread on CT cathetergram showing a complete correlation between&#xD;
      pressure waveform and catheter positioned in epidural space, further establishing the&#xD;
      validity of pressure measurement to confirm entrance in the epidural space. Epidural pressure&#xD;
      waveform analysis has not become routine practice, likely due to equipment, cost, and time&#xD;
      constraints. We hypothesize that the simple, rapid, and inexpensive technique of extension&#xD;
      tubing manometry will offer similar benefits for confirmation of epidural placement and will&#xD;
      be applicable to placement at the thoracic levels.&#xD;
