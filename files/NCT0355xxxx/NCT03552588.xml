      BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common serious heart rhythm disorder and is&#xD;
      associated with a 4 to 5-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. AF is often detected&#xD;
      for the first time while a patient is hospitalized for an acute medical illness or after&#xD;
      surgery. In these settings, AF can be transient and frequently asymptomatic; detection often&#xD;
      occurs during prolonged periods of continuous ECG monitoring in an intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial Fibrillation Occurring Transiently with Stress (AFOTS) describes the manifestation of&#xD;
      AF in the acute care setting as the only evidence of AF, for which the incidence and&#xD;
      appropriate management are uncertain. AFOTS may be directly and uniquely due to a reversible&#xD;
      precipitant and thus unlikely to recur after this precipitant is removed, thereby having&#xD;
      minimal impact on the patient's long-term prognosis. Alternatively, AFOTS may be the first&#xD;
      detection of a chronic condition that is already present but undiagnosed - facilitated by&#xD;
      inpatient continuous ECG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous published studies have provided a wide range of estimates for the incidence of AFOTS&#xD;
      in the ICU population (3-44%). Differences in estimates may be explained by the methods used&#xD;
      to detect AFOTS in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A precise estimate of the incidence of AFOTS is required in order to understand its long-term&#xD;
      significance. The present study is designed to generate an accurate estimate of the incidence&#xD;
      of AFOTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of AF, lasting 30 seconds or more, in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients in the ICU over the age of 65 and without a prior history of AF. This&#xD;
      will be achieved with a high-sensitivity, 14-day continuous ECG monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE: AFOTS may be common, and may respond to established therapies for stroke&#xD;
      prevention. However, varying methodologies in existing studies have resulted in wide&#xD;
      variations around its incidence. The systematic protocol employed in this study will generate&#xD;
      a precise and accurate estimate of the incidence of AFOTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is uncertainty around the incidence, recurrence and management of AFOTS. The results of&#xD;
      this study will be integrated with those from the other studies in the AFOTS research&#xD;
      program. Together, they will inform the monitoring of hospitalized patients for AFOTS, the&#xD;
      outpatient rhythm monitoring for recurrences of AF and ultimately stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective descriptive epidemiologic study. It is a component study&#xD;
      of the AFOTS Research Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: Consecutive participants aged 65 years and older without a history of AF, who are&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU at Hamilton General or Juravinski hospital for treatment of medical&#xD;
      illness or for recovery from noncardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with AF lasting 30 seconds&#xD;
      or more, as detected by the patch monitor. Secondary outcomes will include: the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who have AF documented by the clinical team; the proportion of patients with AF&#xD;
      lasting 5 minutes or more, 1 hour or more, 6 hours or more and 24 hours or more; the burden&#xD;
      of AF, defined as time spent in AF per 24 hours and the proportion of AF episodes that occur&#xD;
      with an average heart rate of 1-40 bpm, 41-60 bpm, 61-80 bpm, 81-100bpm, 101-120 bpm, and&#xD;
      121-140 bpm and &gt; 140 bpm.&#xD;
