  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed graft function (DGF) is an important phenomenon after kidney transplantation with&#xD;
      direct and indirect implication on graft survival. Although its incidence and risk factors&#xD;
      have been studied after cadaveric kidney transplantation cases, only few data is available&#xD;
      regarding transplants from living donors. The present study was performed to investigate the&#xD;
      frequency and risk factors of DGF among living-unrelated kidney transplant recipients among&#xD;
      three transplant centers in part of Middle East.&#xD;

      In this multi-center retrospective study, data from 480 transplanted patients had been&#xD;
      collected from existing local hospital registries in three countries (Iran, Kingdom of Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia (KSA), and Kuwait) with 3 years post transplantation follow-up. Data for this study&#xD;
      was collected based on routine clinical practice of medical practitioners across the&#xD;
      participating countries. A case report data collecting form was designed for gathering the&#xD;
      data including the recipient and donor's characteristics prior to transplantation, and after&#xD;
      transplantation up to three years post transplantation. Using binary logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis, the potential risk factors for occurrence of DGF in living donor transplantations&#xD;
      were tested. Graft and patient survival at 1, 2 and 3 years depending on follow-up time was&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

        A case report data collecting form was designed for gathering the following data: the&#xD;
        recipients and donors characteristics prior to transplantation, time on dialysis (months),&#xD;
        first or second transplantation, panel reactive antibody (PRA) and human leukocyte antigen&#xD;
        (HLA) mismatch, frequency of DGF, renal function, cold and warm ischemia time,&#xD;
        immunosuppressive regimens (induction, if any used), adverse events, acute and chronic&#xD;
        graft rejection, graft survival and patient survival at 1, 2 and 3 years follow-up.It was&#xD;
        planned to recruit 500 patients, from 3 centers in 3 countries of Middle east. Distribution&#xD;
        by country or region was as following :Iran (n=300), Kuwait (n=100) and KSA (n=100)&#xD;
        subjects . As it was a retrospective disease registry with no access or possibility to&#xD;
        recall patients, obtaining informed consent form from patients was waived up to the local&#xD;
        regulatory processes. Approvals were obtained from each site to access patients' records&#xD;
        and collect their data.&#xD;
