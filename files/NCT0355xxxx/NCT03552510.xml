  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother's milk does not come in contact with the oropharyngeal pouch of preterm infants during&#xD;
      gavage feeding. We hypothesized that stimulation of the oropharyngeal pouch using small&#xD;
      amount of the mother's milk 5 minutes before initiation of regular gavage feeding will&#xD;
      increase the level of GIT hormones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feeding preterm infants continues to challenge health care providers because of difficulty to&#xD;
      provide adequate volume of milk that maintains optimum nutrition without increasing the risk&#xD;
      of feeding intolerance. Preterm, VLBW, infants are at increased risk of feeding intolerance&#xD;
      as they have shorter GIT with lower digestive, absorptive, and motility capabilities than&#xD;
      those of full-term infants. Intolerance to enteral feeding has been associated with abdominal&#xD;
      distention, initiation of inflammatory cascade, edema of the bowel, and subsequent&#xD;
      development of necrotizing enterocolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral feeding is the best physiologic method for enteral nutrition of preterm infants.&#xD;
      However, because of immaturity of suckling reflex and poor coordination between suckling and&#xD;
      swallowing, gavage feeding (oro-gastric or naso-gastric tube feeding) has been used an&#xD;
      alternative method of enteral nutrition in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During breastfeeding, mother's milk comes in contact with mouth and oro-pharyngeal pouch&#xD;
      which, theoretically, stimulates both oro-pharyngeal receptors that improves the motility,&#xD;
      secretory, and absorptive ability of the GIT. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are present abundantly in mother's colostrum and milk, may&#xD;
      exert an immuno-protective effect when they come in contact with oro-pharyngeal as well as&#xD;
      GIT mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm, VLBW, infant in the NICU receives enteral feedings by a naso-gastric or oro-gastric&#xD;
      gavage tube. Thus, mother's milk does not typically come into contact with oro-pharyngeal&#xD;
      pouch which delays the maturation of oral suckling and swallowing skills in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral stimulation has been shown to improve oral feeding performance, attain early oral&#xD;
      feeding, improve weight gain and shorten the length of hospital stay. Investigators aimed to&#xD;
      study the effect of Oro-pharyngeal administration of mother's milk before regular gavage&#xD;
      feeding on gastrointestinal movement in preterm infants.&#xD;
