  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      magrolimab in combination with avelumab in participants with advanced solid tumors and to&#xD;
      confirm the safety and tolerability of this combination and evaluate the anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009) in&#xD;
      participants with checkpoint inhibitor-naive ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and&#xD;
      primary peritoneal carcinoma who have previously progressed within 1-6 months of receiving&#xD;
      platinum chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Dose Level 1: Participants with solid tumors will be given a starting priming dose of 1 mg/kg magrolimab in Week 1, followed by 30 mg/kg weekly for 4 doses (Cycle 1). Starting in Cycle 2, magrolimab 30 mg/kg will be given every 2 weeks. The magrolimab dose will be combined with avelumab 800 mg given once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
Based on Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) assessment in Dose Level 1 Cycle 1; additional participants will be enrolled and administered Dose Level 2.&#xD;
Dose Level 2: Participants with solid tumors will be given a starting priming dose of 1 mg/kg magrolimab in Week 1, followed by 45 mg/kg on Days 8,11,15, 22 and 29 for Cycle 1, continuing weekly in Cycle 2 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Starting in Cycle 3, magrolimab 45 mg/kg will be given every 2 weeks. The magrolimab dose will be combined with avelumab 800 mg given once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
Additional lower or higher dose levels may be explored after reviewing all available clinical data.</description>
