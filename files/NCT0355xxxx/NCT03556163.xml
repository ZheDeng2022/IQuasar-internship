      Aim of study was clinical comparative evaluation of using modified vertical internal mattress&#xD;
      suturing technique and simple loop interrupted suturing technique in the outcome of modified&#xD;
      Widman flap surgery for the management of chronic periodontitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is inflammation of the periodontal tissues resulting in clinical attachment&#xD;
      loss, alveolar bone loss, and periodontal pocketing.The destruction of tooth supporting&#xD;
      tissues is caused by interaction of bacteria present in the dental plaque and the host .The&#xD;
      elimination of bacterial plaque, calculus ,toxic material adhering to tooth surface and other&#xD;
      plaque retentive factors can be achieved by nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapies&#xD;
      .The primary objective of periodontal therapy is arresting infection, restoring the lost&#xD;
      structure and to maintain healthy periodontium .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requirement of access for scaling and root planning, pocket depth reduction, correction&#xD;
      of gross gingival aberrations ,and establishment of morphology of the dento-gingival area&#xD;
      conducive to infection control led to the development of the various surgical procedures. The&#xD;
      initial surgical procedures used in periodontal therapy involved excision of the diseased&#xD;
      gingival tissue . The main disadvantages of these procedures are unwanted root exposure, poor&#xD;
      aesthetics, decrease in width of attached gingiva, excision of frenum attachment and creation&#xD;
      of shallow vestibular depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper management of supracrestal soft tissue flap during suturing appears to be of critical&#xD;
      importance in ultimate outcome of surgical periodontal pocket management .A number of studies&#xD;
      advocate the proper management of supra-alveolar component of flap in management of infrabony&#xD;
      defects employing regenerative techniques with grafts / barrier membrane to minimize&#xD;
      postoperative exposure, contamination and/or exfoliation of the grafted material and / or&#xD;
      barrier membrane. However review of the available literature does not reveal studies&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of close approximation of flaps by different suturing&#xD;
      techniques. Sites with suprabony periodontal pocket depth of 4mm have approximately 6 mm&#xD;
      height of unsupported supracrestal soft tissue flap which increases with further increase in&#xD;
      pocket depth. Moreover, with advancing probing depth, base of the unsupported soft tissue&#xD;
      wall of periodontal pocket comes closer to the musculature in the vestibule, thereby&#xD;
      eliciting requirement of a more efficient suturing technique to resist muscle pull for&#xD;
      prevention of any disturbance to healing granulation tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interrupted suturing encompasses two suturing technique; the simple loop and figure of&#xD;
      eight. Modified vertical internal mattress suture is a variation of the vertical mattress&#xD;
      suture which is especially useful in maximizing wound eversion, reducing dead space, and&#xD;
      minimizing tension across the wound. Wound eversion maximize flap approximation. The&#xD;
      recommended time for removal of this suture is 5-7 days to reduce the risk of scarring (cross&#xD;
      hatching).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the most suitable suturing technique to achieve healing by primary intention and&#xD;
      connective tissue reattachment/ periodontal regeneration need to be explored. The present&#xD;
      study is intended to determine the influence of the simple interrupted and modified vertical&#xD;
      internal mattress suturing technique on the outcome of modified Widman flap surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This randomized clinical interventional study was conducted in Department of&#xD;
      Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences (PGIDS),&#xD;
      Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Out of 172 patients screened from regular OPD in Department of Periodontics&#xD;
      and Oral Implantology, the study was conducted in 48 chronic periodontitis participants&#xD;
      meeting the eligibility criteria for surgical intervention. 45 patients completed the&#xD;
      treatment protocol (28 males and 17 females, mean age: 35.91Â±7.67 years). Study period was&#xD;
      from 01-12-2016 to 31-03-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants after 8 weeks of phase 1 therapy, were examined in a standardized&#xD;
      way using illumination by a standard dental light, a mouth mirror, tweezer, manual calibrated&#xD;
      probe (PCP-UNC 15 Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) and explorer. Following parameters were&#xD;
      recorded at baseline (day of surgery), after 3 months and 6 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque index (Silness and Loe) (PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gingival index (Loe and Silness) (GI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding on probing (BOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probing pocket depth (PPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical attachment level (CAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of crest of free gingival margin in respect to CEJ.(REC) All clinical&#xD;
           parameters were recorded at six sites (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal,&#xD;
           disto-lingual, mid-lingual and mesio-lingual) per tooth in all teeth except for third&#xD;
           molars. BOP was assessed as a dichotomous measure (bleeding present or absent) within 15&#xD;
           seconds of probing. PD was recorded from gingival margin to base of pocket and CAL from&#xD;
           cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to base of pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME VARIABLES Improvement in PPD and CAL over 6 months was&#xD;
      considered as the primary outcome variable of the study. Secondary variables included&#xD;
      improvement in PI, GI, BOP and REC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1 THERAPY Phase 1 therapy included patient education, motivation and plaque control.&#xD;
      Full mouth supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planning with ultrasonic scaler&#xD;
      (EMS Piezon 250 ,Switzerland), hand scaler and curettes (Hu-Friedy) was completed . Patients&#xD;
      were kept on maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical parameters were recorded in 48 eligible patients after 8 weeks of SRP. A custom&#xD;
      made acrylic stent was fabricated to standardized the location and angulations of periodontal&#xD;
      probe. The study procedure was explained to the patient in their own language. Written and&#xD;
      verbal informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients were randomly allocated to&#xD;
      test group and control group by envelop method. 48 labelled papers, 24 papers with label 1&#xD;
      and 24 papers with label 2 were placed into an envelope. If the patient picked paper with&#xD;
      label 1 he or she was assigned to control group, while picking paper with label 2 meant&#xD;
      assignment into test group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE Modified Widman flap surgery was performed in both groups.&#xD;
      After administration of local anaesthesia, first incision which is an internal bevel&#xD;
      incision, was made 0.5 mm away from the crest of gingival margin to crest of alveolar bone,&#xD;
      2nd intra-crevicular incision from base of periodontal pocket to crest of alveolar bone and&#xD;
      3rd incision /horizontal incision follow the contour of the alveolar crest and the&#xD;
      inter-proximal septum to cut loose the collar of gingival tissues which has been separated&#xD;
      from the buccal or lingual flap and the teeth. A mucoperiosteal flap was reflected including&#xD;
      at least one tooth ahead and one tooth behind the tooth/teeth involved. Meticulous&#xD;
      debridement and root planning was carried out using area specific curettes and scalers to&#xD;
      remove all the granulation tissue. After instrumentation, the root surface were washed with&#xD;
      saline solution in attempt to remove any remaining detached fragments from the surgical&#xD;
      field. After debridement mucoperiosteal flaps were repositioned and secured by using 3-0 non&#xD;
      absorbable black silk surgical suture. Test group was given modified vertical internal&#xD;
      mattress suture. The needle was passed through the buccal flap from the external surface,&#xD;
      across the interdental area and through the lingual flap from the internal surface. The&#xD;
      suture was run back to the buccal side by passing the needle through the lingual and buccal&#xD;
      flaps .Thereafter, the suture is brought through the approximal site coronally to the tissue,&#xD;
      passed through the loop of the suture on the lingual aspect, and then brought back to the&#xD;
      starting point on the buccal side and tied. The control group was given simple loop&#xD;
      interrupted interdental suture. The needle is passed through the buccal flap from the&#xD;
      external surface, across the interdental area and the lingual flap from the internal surface&#xD;
      or vice versa and tied. Post operative instructions were given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up was done after 3 and 6 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analysis were carried out using statistical software (SPSS,Version 25.0 for&#xD;
      Windows,SPSS,Chicago,IL).The normality of distribution of the data was assessed using the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. Data for PI, GI, BOP, PPD, CAL and REC followed non-normal distribution.&#xD;
      Non-parametric tests were applied for PI, GI, PPD, CAL and REC. Wilcoxon-Signed Ranks test&#xD;
      was applied for intragroup comparison and Mann Whitney test for intergroup comparison.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of BOP was done by McNemar test in intragroup and Chi-square test for&#xD;
      intergroup comparison. Correlation and association between predictors and dependent variables&#xD;
      was analysed by using Mixed Model analysis. Statistical significance level was set at P=0.05.&#xD;
