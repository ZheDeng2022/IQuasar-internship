      Objective To access predictive values of the auxological parameters and indexes for risk of&#xD;
      comorbid malformations in newborns with Down syndrome (DS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design In this cohort retrospective study, 141 newborns with proven trisomy 21 born at&#xD;
      the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the University of Split Hospital (1990 to&#xD;
      2015) were included. The data were obtained from the medical histories of mothers, infants&#xD;
      and the delivery protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective was to access predictive values of the auxological parameters and indexes for&#xD;
      risk of comorbid malformations in newborns with Down syndrome (DS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion Higher CI were found in hyportrophic (SGA) newborns with DS and indicated their&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction with brain sparing and increased further risk of severe&#xD;
      psychomotor retardation. The SGA newborns have lower parameters and indexes of nutritive&#xD;
      status and significantly differed from eutrophic and hypertrophic newborns. These SGA&#xD;
      newborns with DS have increased developmental risks and that requires further diagnostic&#xD;
      attention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of anthropometric charts developed specifically for children with DS have a better&#xD;
      expression of real growth restriction (small for gestation age/SGA, 9.9%) than the&#xD;
      application of the percentile curve for typical children (SGA, 24.1%). These differences were&#xD;
      also noted in the evaluation of other anthropometric measures. Cephalization index (CI)&#xD;
      proved to be the only predictor from the considered auxological parameters and indexes with&#xD;
      minimal predictive value in the prediction of heart defects type ASD II and VSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of comorbid disorders in newborns with DS did not have a significant predictive&#xD;
      role on growth indicators and nutritive status of the newborn, but we noted a strong&#xD;
      association between preterm births and white matter injury (WMI).&#xD;

        The perinatal outcome of 141 children with confirmed diagnosis of DS was evaluated&#xD;
        retrospectively. 137 (137/141, 97.2%) children had the cytogenetic finding of regular&#xD;
        trisomy 21, 3 (3/141, 2.1%) had the kariotypic finding of mosaicism and 1 child (1/ 141. %)&#xD;
        had translocation 21/22.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There were more boys (74/141, 52.5%) than girls (67/141, 47.5%) in the examined sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The median of gestational age of newborns with DS was 38 weeks (range 37-38 weeks): 10&#xD;
        children were born at 40 weeks of gestation (7.1%), 34 at 38 weeks (24.1%), 24 at 37 weeks&#xD;
        (16.3%), 15 children (10.6%) at 36 weeks; and 19 children from 32 to 35 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The median of gravidity for boys was the 3rd pregnancy, and for girls the 2nd pregnancy.&#xD;
        The age range of the mother for both sexes was 31 to 35 years.&#xD;
