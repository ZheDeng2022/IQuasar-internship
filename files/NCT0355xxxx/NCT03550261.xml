  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in its classic neonatal form with severe salt-wasting&#xD;
      represents a challenge for pediatric endocrinologists in order to maintain sodium balance,&#xD;
      especially as the physiopathology and optimal therapeutic management of this urinary salt&#xD;
      loss remain poorly studied, particularly during the neonatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human kidney presents the characteristic of being immature at birth with a functional&#xD;
      tubulopathy associating sodium wasting and difficulty to concentrate urine, in connection&#xD;
      with a transient renal resistance to aldosterone action, which is exacerbated in case of CAH&#xD;
      by insufficiency of aldosterone production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of project is therefore to study the secretion profiles of plasma and urinary&#xD;
      steroids in neonates with classical salt-wasting form of CAH before treatment and under&#xD;
      treatment with Fludrocortisone and Hydrocortisone during the first months of life, using an&#xD;
      advanced technology: LC-MSMS (Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry).&#xD;
      The study of the existence of a correlation between plasma and urinary steroid profiles will&#xD;
      also make it possible to subsequently consider simplified medical follow-up for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will lead to a better understanding of sodium handling and steroid secretion and&#xD;
      excretion profiles in CAH neonates, in order to improve the therapeutic management of&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid replacement in these patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in its severe salt-wasting form is a challenge in order to&#xD;
      maintain sodium balance. The pathophysiology of this impaired sodium balance is still poorly&#xD;
      investigated as well as its therapeutic management, notably in the neonatal period. Consensus&#xD;
      practice guidelines have been established for hydrocortisone replacement therapy, in order to&#xD;
      maintain negative feedback on the pituitary-adrenal axis to prevent from virilization and&#xD;
      excessive growth velocity. However, mineralocorticoid substitution and sodium supplementation&#xD;
      is currently empirically adapted based on weight gain and renin levels. There is significant&#xD;
      need for improvement of this essential part of CAH treatment. Particularly, CAH patients have&#xD;
      higher risk of adverse cardio-vascular outcomes, which could relate to an excessive&#xD;
      glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid exposure in early infancy rather than to the genotype&#xD;
      of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical human study in classical CAH neonates, using Liquid Chromatography coupled to&#xD;
      tandem Mass Spectrometry LC-MS/MS technology will assess prospectively plasma and urinary&#xD;
      steroid profiling (precursors and substitute hormones, notably Fludrocortisone dosages)&#xD;
      during the first six months of life, before and under treatment; and in correlation with&#xD;
      genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty neonates (boys and girls) diagnosed with a severe form of CAH and followed in one of&#xD;
      the 5 following French reference tertiary centers: Robert Debré Hospital, Paris; Necker&#xD;
      Hospital, Paris; Bicetre Hospital, Le Kremlin-Bicetre; Trousseau Hospital, Paris; Lyon&#xD;
      Hospital, , will be included in the study and will be followed for a period of six months.&#xD;
      The duration of inclusion will be 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping will be processed for all children in Lyon.This project will lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of sodium handling and steroid secretion and excretion profiles in CAH&#xD;
      neonates, in order to improve management of mineralocorticoid replacement.&#xD;

      For blood samples, the biochemistry laboratory of each investigating centre will centrifuge&#xD;
      all blood samples, collect the plasma and transfer it into a new tube on which the&#xD;
      corresponding labels will be affixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tubes will be frozen at -20° C in a freezer at a specific location where the tubes with&#xD;
      the same identification number (blood and urine sample from the same child) will be grouped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urinary samples (H0, H48, M1, M3 and M6) collected on a gauze compress will arrive at the&#xD;
      laboratory of each centre in tubes already labelled (sterile urine jar) and will be frozen&#xD;
      directly at -20° C with the tubes.&#xD;
