    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new schedule of radiation therapy for recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma as a possible treatment for this diagnosis. This radiation schedule is based on&#xD;
      a new model for radiation resistance in glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the radiation schedule involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Re-irradiation for glioblastoma using a novel Mathematical Model-Adapted Radiation&#xD;
      Fractionation Schedule&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Feasibility Study, which means that this is the first time that&#xD;
      investigators are examining this new radiation schedule for recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved radiation therapy as a&#xD;
           treatment option for your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is the first time that this particular radiation schedule will be tested in humans.&#xD;
           There many other studies which have tested different radiation schedules in&#xD;
           glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, investigators are adapting a standard two-week schedule of radiation&#xD;
      commonly used for recurrent glioblastoma using a mathematical model. This study uses the same&#xD;
      total dose of radiation as standard treatments but breaks up the dose into different amounts&#xD;
      daily to maximize tumor kill. investigators have used a new mathematical model to create this&#xD;
      schedule of radiation. This model was created to better represent how glioblastoma cells can&#xD;
      escape the damaging effects of radiation. Based on the results of several laboratory studies,&#xD;
      it is possible that this model may result in improved outcomes compared to standard radiation&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary question of this study is to see whether participants can complete this new&#xD;
      radiation schedule at the scheduled times. In addition, investigators will follow&#xD;
      participants to ensure that this treatment is safe. If this treatment proves feasible,&#xD;
      investigators hope to compare this treatment directly with standard radiation schedules for&#xD;
      newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
