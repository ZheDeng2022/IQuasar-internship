      The primary aim of this proposed project is to collect pilot data using an Emotion-Focused&#xD;
      CBT Psycho-social Intervention i individuals with T2D to obtain the effect sizes on&#xD;
      hypothesized changes in Negative Emotionality, Diabetes Distress, and HbA1c values that will&#xD;
      be needed for a more appropriately sized clinical trial for an RO1 submission to the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health.&#xD;

      Our interest in aberrant Emotional Regulation / Emotional Intelligence in Type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
      stems from observations that while many patients with Type 2 Diabetes have greater incidence&#xD;
      of mood and anxiety (and even anger) disorders than controls, targeting psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions, such as depression, is not sufficient to improve glycemic control in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes. Thus, the key issue for such patients is not what specific psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder they have, but the presence of an impairment in the fundamental regulation of&#xD;
      emotional regulation and in how such individuals modulate their emotional response to&#xD;
      aversive events in their lives (e.g., emotional intelligence), now suggested by a recent&#xD;
      study. As part of a new study, we examined the relationship between glycemic control (HbA1c)&#xD;
      and Emotional Experience (ER-Exp) and Skill at Emotional Regulation (ER-Skill) in 100 adult&#xD;
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes. We found significant relationships between ER-Exp and ER-Skill&#xD;
      and HbA1c levels that accounted for nearly 24% of the variance in HbA1c levels. These&#xD;
      relationships with HbA1c levels remained even after accounting for other relevant behavioral&#xD;
      variables such as depression/anxiety scores and diabetes self-care/literacy scores.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the tendency of an individual to have intense emotional responses (higher scores&#xD;
      on ER-Exp), and/or to have a reduced ability to understand/modulate one's emotions in order&#xD;
      to cope with daily stresses/threats (lower scores on ER-Skill), may well be linked with poor&#xD;
      glycemic control (HbA1c) in adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes. If so, it will be important&#xD;
      to develop psycho-social methods to improve ER-Exp and DR-Skill in Type 2 Diabetes patients&#xD;
      to determine if one can improve aberrant Emotional Regulation (ER-Exp/ER-Skill), Diabetes&#xD;
      Distress (DD), and HbA1c (A1c) levels as suggested by treatment studies showing that such&#xD;
      treatment can improve ER-Skill with a sustained reduction in A1c levels in Type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
      for up to nine months. Supporting these findings are data from a recent study showing that&#xD;
      increasing positive emotion reduces (and increasing negative emotion increases) blood glucose&#xD;
      levels, especially in those with poor emotion regulation skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop an integrated Emotion - Focused Psycho-social EF-CBT) from three (3) existing&#xD;
           sources that contain elements to improve ER-Exp and ER-Skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a pilot study in 10 patients with Type 2 Diabetes with aberrant&#xD;
           ER-ER-Exp/ER-Skill and compare treatment outcomes in emotionality, diabetes distress,&#xD;
           and in A1c levels with 10 patients with Type 2 Diabetes undergoing treatment as usual&#xD;
           (TAU).&#xD;
