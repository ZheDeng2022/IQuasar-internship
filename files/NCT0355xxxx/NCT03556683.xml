  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine if inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) accelerates airway mucociliary&#xD;
      clearance (MCC) in well-controlled moderate to severe asthmatics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: Non-smoking adults with well controlled moderate to severe asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): After undergoing a general health screen, participants will undergo a&#xD;
      lung transmission scan to create an image of the lungs. Participants will then inhale&#xD;
      nebulized radiolabeled aerosol and sit in front of a gamma camera for 2 hours to measure&#xD;
      clearance of radiolabeled particles from the lungs (procedure called gamma scintigraphy),&#xD;
      which will be used to calculate baseline MCC. Participants will then inhale HS, with&#xD;
      spirometry performed before and at regular intervals after HS to assess for clinically&#xD;
      significant reductions in lung function. Vital signs and symptom questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered as well. If they are deemed tolerant to HS (i.e. no clinically significant&#xD;
      deterioration in lung function, vital signs, or symptom questionnaire scores), participants&#xD;
      will move forward to the next study visit. At the next visit, participants will again inhale&#xD;
      nebulized HS and will undergo a gamma scintigraphy scan immediately after to measure the&#xD;
      acute effects of HS on MCC. At a separate visit, participants will inhale nebulized HS and&#xD;
      undergo gamma scintigraphy scan 4 hours later to measure prolonged effects of HS on MCC.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-60 of both genders-&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe asthma at baseline (determined by Step 3 therapy or greater or by&#xD;
             asthma impairment) and well-controlled asthma at the time of enrollment, as determined&#xD;
             by NHLBI Expert Panel Report 3 guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test for females who are not s/p hysterectomy with oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume 1 sec) of at least 70% of predicted for age, sex,&#xD;
             height, and race/ethnicity (without use of bronchodilating medications for 12 hours or&#xD;
             long acting beta agonists for 24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study&#xD;
        participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical Contraindications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Any chronic medical condition considered by the PI as a contraindication to the study&#xD;
             including significant cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic&#xD;
             thyroid disease, history of chronic infections/immunodeficiency, or history of&#xD;
             tuberculosis Any acute infection requiring antibiotics within 4 weeks of study. Mental&#xD;
             illness or history of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Medications which may impact the results of the study treatment, or may interfere with&#xD;
             any other medications potentially used in the study (to include steroids, beta&#xD;
             antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) Active smoking to include&#xD;
