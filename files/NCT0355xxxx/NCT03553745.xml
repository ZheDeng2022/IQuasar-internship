  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The integrity of interoceptive networks is linked to resilience against depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      whereas degradation of these networks is linked to apathy and deficits in emotion processing.&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare two major styles of yoga and cardiovascular exercise&#xD;
      through a 10-week training program to promote interoceptive awareness. The researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize that improvement in affective symptomatology will be correlated with better&#xD;
      interoceptive development. Changes in mood related symptoms and interoception will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, week 12 and week 14, in a cohort of adults aged 18-55.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent annual survey of U.S. college freshman has found consistently declining levels of&#xD;
      emotional health over the past 25 years. Exposure to such stress can have profound&#xD;
      longitudinal effects on well being, influencing risk for disease later in life. Physical&#xD;
      exercise is linked to benefits across a variety of physical and psychological domains. While&#xD;
      the affective and physiological consequences of exercise are well-documented, how they work&#xD;
      to improve subjective well-being is unclear. It has been suggested that exercise promotes&#xD;
      well-being by increasing interoception. The integrity of interoceptive networks is linked to&#xD;
      resilience against depressive symptoms, whereas degradation of these networks is linked to&#xD;
      apathy and deficits in emotion processing. The goal of this study is to compare two major&#xD;
      styles of yoga and cardiovascular exercise through a 10-week training program to promote&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness. The researchers hypothesize that improvement in affective&#xD;
      symptomatology will be correlated with better interoceptive development. Changes in mood&#xD;
      related symptoms and interoception will be assessed at baseline, week 12 and week 14, in a&#xD;
      cohort of adults aged 18-55.&#xD;
