    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic symptom complex that can substantially impair quality&#xD;
      of life. Pharmacological management using antimuscarinics agent remain the mainstay of&#xD;
      therapy and effectively reduce OAB symptoms. However, despite the proven efficacy of such&#xD;
      agents, their tolerability may be limited by adverse events, mostly dry mouth. In fact these&#xD;
      adverse events often lead to poor compliance and discontinuation of therapy.The&#xD;
      β3-adrenoceptor agonist, mirabegron, which acts via a different mechanism of action to&#xD;
      antimuscarinics, could potentially improve the efficacy/ tolerability balance over current&#xD;
      standard of care in the management of OAB.β3-adrenoceptor agonists relax detrusor smooth&#xD;
      muscle during the bladder storage phase and increase bladder capacity without negatively&#xD;
      affecting voiding parameters. Different study has report efficacy and safety of mirabegron&#xD;
      but not done in our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirabegron comparison with solifenacin&#xD;
      succinate in the treatment of overactive bladder.This is a hospital based prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted from July 2016 to November 2017 in the&#xD;
      department of urology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). Among the patient&#xD;
      with overactive bladder who will visit to Urology outpatient department (OPD) of BSSMU, 56&#xD;
      patient who will fulfil the inclusion criteria will be selected. Selected patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated by history, physical examinations and investigation like routine urine analysis &amp;&#xD;
      culture, serum creatinine, random blood sugar, X-ray kidney, ureter &amp; bladder (KUB)&#xD;
      region,ultrasonogram (USG) of KUB region with maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) &amp;&#xD;
      post-viodal residue (PVR). After taking informed consent, selected 82 patient will be&#xD;
      randomly divided in to experimental group and control group, each containing 41 patients. All&#xD;
      patients will be entered into one week run-in period, when they will instructed to stop any&#xD;
      drug including any anti-cholinergics, if they are getting it before. Patient will be supplied&#xD;
      with a Bengali version micturition diary from and instructed to complete a 3 day voiding&#xD;
      diary. Average of three day will be calculated for 24 hours.Overactive symptom score will be&#xD;
      calculated by interviewing the patient for urinary symptom for last 7 days. Experimental&#xD;
      group will receive Mirabegron 25mg and control group will receive solifenacin succinate 5 mg&#xD;
      all are at night for 12 weeks. Patients in both group will be regularly followed up 12 weeks&#xD;
      at 4 weeks interval.Patient will be supplied with a Bengali version micturition diary from&#xD;
      and instructed to complete a 3 day voiding diary in each follow up schedule visit at the end&#xD;
      of 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Overactive symptom score will be calculated by interviewing the patient&#xD;
      for urinary symptom for last 7 days in each visit.Patient will be evaluated for any adverse&#xD;
      effects during the medication. Data will be collected, complied, computed and appropriate&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined by the International Continence Society as&#xD;
      urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually with increased daytime&#xD;
      frequency and nocturia in the absence of proven infection or any other pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data suggest that OAB syndrome is present in about 10.7% of all adult men and&#xD;
      women, although prevalence rates increase with aging in both sexes. The prevalence of OAB&#xD;
      worldwide is estimated as being greater in women versus men (11.6% vs 9.7%, respectively) It&#xD;
      is a chronic symptom complex that can substantially impair quality of life. The prevalence of&#xD;
      lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS), OAB and urgency urinary incontinence is substantial,&#xD;
      affecting both women and men, and resulting in considerable morbidity, personal cost and&#xD;
      health economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial management uses conservative measures, such as fluid advice and bladder training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimuscarinic drugs (eg. Solifenacin succinate) are still the mainstay of oral&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment for OAB, relaxing the detrusor muscle and reducing sensory symptoms&#xD;
      during the storage phase of the micturition cycle by inhibiting muscarinic receptor subtypes,&#xD;
      M2 and M3. Both subtypes are expressed in multiple tissues, increasing the risk of&#xD;
      bothersome, anticholinergic adverse events (AEs) such as dry mouth, which along with lack of&#xD;
      efficacy, is the most frequently cited reason for discontinuation of antimuscarinic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in the understanding of OAB have identified three β-adrenoceptor sub-types&#xD;
      β1, β2 and β3, in the detrusor muscle and urothelium .The β3-adrenoceptor is the predominant&#xD;
      β-receptor subtype in the human urinary bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      β3-adrenoceptor agonists relax detrusor smooth muscle during the bladder storage phase and&#xD;
      increase bladder capacity without negatively affecting voiding parameters, including maximum&#xD;
      urinary flow rate (Qmax), detrusor pressure at Qmax (PdetQmax), and residual volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The β3-adrenoceptor agonist, mirabegron, which acts via a different mechanism of action to&#xD;
      antimuscarinics, could potentially improve the efficacy/ tolerability balance over current&#xD;
      standard of care in the management of OAB. In four 12-week phase III studies mirabegron&#xD;
      consistently demonstrated superiority over placebo with respect to reductions in incontinence&#xD;
      episodes and micturition frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main adverse effects of mirabegron is hypertension, nasopharyngitis, headache and urinary&#xD;
      tract infection. Dry mouth and constipation are similar as placebo but lower than the&#xD;
      solifenacin succinate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were several studies observe mirabegron is effective as well as well tolerable in OAB.&#xD;
      There was a single comparative study between mirabegron &amp; solifenacin shows non inferiority&#xD;
      of mirabegron than solifenacin. But all the study done by industrial sponsored. In&#xD;
      Bangladesh, no such study was performed previously. So it is time demanding to conduct a&#xD;
      comparative study between the safety and efficacy of mirabegron &amp; solifenacin in patient with&#xD;
      overactive bladder in this country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new drug β3 adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron is available as 25mg once daily formulation&#xD;
      in the treatment of OAB in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to see the efficacy and safety of mirabegron comparison with&#xD;
      solifenacin succinate in the treatment of overactive bladder without industrial support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in efficacy and safety of mirabegron&#xD;
      and solifenacin succinate for treatment of overactive bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis (HA):The efficacy and safety of mirabegron is superior to solifenacin&#xD;
      succinate for treatment of overactive bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective General objective To compare the therapeutic efficacy and safety of mirabegron&#xD;
      comparison with solifenacin succinate in the treatment of overactive bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) between both treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out the micturition frequency and nocturia of the both treatment group and&#xD;
           compare between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out the urgency and urge incontinence of the both treatment group and compare&#xD;
           between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the adverse effects of mirabegron and solifenacin succinate to treat&#xD;
           overactive bladder.&#xD;

      select on the basis of selection criteria from the patient attended in the out patient&#xD;
      department of Urology, BSMMU, Dhaka.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of patients before drug therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study commence with the initial visit during which a complete medical history was taken along&#xD;
      with a physical examination with special attention to uro-genital and nervous system. Digital&#xD;
      rectal examination (DRE) will be done to exclude any suspected pelvic pathology causing&#xD;
      bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and neuropathic bladder by assessing perianal sensation and&#xD;
      anal tone, bulbocavernous reflex and other relevant neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory screening for Hb% and clinical chemistry (blood sugar, serum creatinine) and urine&#xD;
      routine examination and culture and sensitivity will be done to exclude urinary tract&#xD;
      infection (UTI). Ultrasonography of the KUB region with MCC and PVR will be done to exclude&#xD;
      any obstructive uropathy. Plain x-ray KUB will be done to exclude urinary stone disease and&#xD;
      any lesion in vertebral column.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After complete of baseline clinical evaluation and investigation, those meting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be selected for the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written informed consent will be taken from all the study subject without exploiting any of&#xD;
      their weakness. For the study a well-informed, voluntary, signed written consent will be&#xD;
      taken in an understandable local language from the patient after convincing them that their&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality will be safeguard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data sheet will be complete for each patient included particulars of the patient, relevant&#xD;
      history, examination finding and relevant baseline investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be entered into one week run-in period, when they will instructed to stop&#xD;
      any drug including any anti-cholinergics, if they are getting it before. Patient will be&#xD;
      supplied with a Bengali version micturition diary from and instructed to complete a 3 day&#xD;
      voiding diary. Average of three day will be calculated for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive symptom score will be calculated by interviewing the patient for urinary symptom&#xD;
      for last 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data sheet will be filled up after taking a brief interview of 15-20 minutes from the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient in both group will be regularly followed up 12 weeks at 4 weeks interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be supplied with a Bengali version micturition diary from and instructed to&#xD;
      complete a 3 day voiding diary in each follow up schedule visit at the end of 4, 8 and 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment to record the number of micturition, urgency, urge incontinence, nocturia,&#xD;
      the number of pad used, and voided volume of each micturition / 24 hours over 3 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Average of three day will be calculated for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive symptom score will be calculated by interviewing the patient for urinary symptom&#xD;
      for last 7 days in each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be evaluated for any adverse effects during the medication like dry mouth,&#xD;
      constipation, blurring vision, hypertension and headache that either intervention can cause&#xD;
      also be recorded in the predesigned data collection sheet. Severity of each of the adverse&#xD;
      effect will be assess as mild, moderate and severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient who will discontinue the drug will be excluded from data analysis. All patient will&#xD;
      contracted over telephone as schedule visit for follow up after initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of voiding diary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruction for completing the 3-days voiding diary Please complete the voiding diary for a&#xD;
      total of 3 days. On the day that you start recording events in the voiding diary, print&#xD;
      Participant name and date at the top of the diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start a new page for each day you keep the diary. Participant need to keep a diary for 3 full&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of functional improvement after intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will based on changes in the number of micturitions, urgency, and urge incontinence&#xD;
      episodes, nocturia episodes, the number of pad used, the voided volume of each micturition,&#xD;
      per 24 hours and OABSS after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of drug intervention. This record will compare&#xD;
      with baseline record.&#xD;

      with patients regarding the procedure, possible complication and their management. Data&#xD;
      collected using questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB): Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined by the&#xD;
      International Continence Society as urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence,&#xD;
      usually with increased daytime frequency and nocturia in the absence of proven infection or&#xD;
      any other pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detrusor over activity (DO): It is an urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary&#xD;
      detrusor contraction during the filling phase which may be spontaneous or provoked and is the&#xD;
      cause of overactive bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of micturition: The term is used to describe the need to urinate more often than&#xD;
      usual. In this study frequency of micturition will considered 8 or more voids per 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urgency: It is the complaint of a sudden compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult&#xD;
      to defer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urge incontinence: It is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine, usually preceded by&#xD;
      urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturia: It is the complaint that the individual had to wake at night one or more times to&#xD;
      void.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voided volume of each micturition: It is the volume of urine expelled via urethra in each&#xD;
      micturition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pad usage: The number of pads are use over 24-hours duration in patient with OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voiding dairy: It is use for assessing the number of micturitions, present of urgency and&#xD;
      urge incontinence, nocturia episodes, pads usage, and voided volume of each micturition.&#xD;
      Here, instructed of the patient to complete the 3-days voiding dairy prior to medication and&#xD;
      each scheduled visit. (Appendix-) Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS): This is a single&#xD;
      symptom score that employs a self-report questionnaire to quantify OAB symptom. The selected&#xD;
      symptom are- day time frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency and urgency incontinence for&#xD;
      the questionnaire. Overall score is the simple sum of the four symptom score. (Appendix-)&#xD;
