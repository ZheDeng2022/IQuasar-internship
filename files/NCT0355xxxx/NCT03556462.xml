      Conduct Sleep Health Literacy RCT- Using a stepped wedge randomized design, investigators&#xD;
      will enroll 540 parent-child dyads from 7 Head Start agencies in New York. Agencies&#xD;
      cross-over from control to intervention. Outcomes are a) child sleep duration, b) parent&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and behavior, c) child sleep difficulty and d) classroom&#xD;
      climate. Invesetigators will compare intervention vs. control data across agencies and&#xD;
      pre/post data within agency, with parental health literacy as a moderator. Investigators will&#xD;
      collect process and fidelity data.&#xD;

      Abstract: Inadequate and/or poor quality sleep in early childhood impairs social-emotional&#xD;
      and cognitive function (via effects on the developing brain), and markedly increases obesity&#xD;
      risk (via hormonal and endocrine effects). Short sleep duration, behavioral sleep problems&#xD;
      and sleep-disordered breathing peak at 20%-50%, during the preschool years (ages 3-5).&#xD;
      Healthy sleep habits increase sleep duration and prevent behavioral sleep problems. Awareness&#xD;
      of sleep-disordered breathing symptoms leads to timely treatment for it. Despite ample data&#xD;
      on sleep problems &quot;…much less work has been done on effective strategies to promote sleep as&#xD;
      a healthy behavior (CDC 2013)&quot;. This study's overarching goal is to empower families of&#xD;
      preschool children with the knowledge and skills needed for healthy sleep, and to recognize a&#xD;
      sleep problem. It builds on work in Head Start, an early childhood education (ECE) program&#xD;
      for disadvantaged preschool children and their families: The team's Early Childhood Sleep&#xD;
      Education Program (ECSEP™) educates Head Start teachers, children, and parents about healthy&#xD;
      sleep in a way they can process and understand. In a randomized controlled trial, the&#xD;
      children in the ECSEP group slept 30 minutes longer/night. As well, our UCLA Health Care&#xD;
      Institute's structured approach to low literacy health training in Head Start (to reduce ER&#xD;
      visits, obesity, etc.) has reached &gt;100,000 families. The proposed study will implement a&#xD;
      Social-Ecological web of multi-level interventions to reinforce the ECSEP, and to promote&#xD;
      healthy sleep throughout ECE. Within Head Start, the team will create new delivery platforms&#xD;
      (print &amp; video, family visits) that 'amplify' the ECSEP. Beyond Head Start, the team will&#xD;
      educate communities, and partner with stakeholders on strategies designed to embed 'sleep&#xD;
      health literacy' in ECE policy. This project will: 1) Adapt sleep education material into&#xD;
      additional multi-media formats, and; apply the Health Care Institute model to train Head&#xD;
      Start staff to mount interventions and collect data. 2) Enroll 540 parent-child dyads from 7&#xD;
      Head Start agencies in New York in a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. Investigators&#xD;
      will analyze trial effects on primary outcomes: a) child sleep duration, b) parent knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, self-efficacy and behavior, and c) child sleep difficulties. 3) Assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of screening and guidance for sleep problems (vs. sleep health) for a future&#xD;
      efficacy study. Secondary outcomes are: classroom behaviors, policy change, and process data.&#xD;
      Poor sleep in early development has ramifications for years to come, perhaps through&#xD;
      adulthood. Head Start serves low-income, mainly racial-ethnic minority families, in whom&#xD;
      sleep health disparities are greatest-- but are modifiable. This study joins together proven&#xD;
      methods of delivering health literacy (Health Care Institute) and sleep health (ECSEP)&#xD;
      programs in Head Start. Intervening at every level of the Social-Ecological model maximizes&#xD;
      the study's reach and sustainability. Integrating sleep health literacy into ECE nationwide&#xD;
      could ultimately benefit upwards of 4 million children. The potential impact upon human&#xD;
      health is far-reaching.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is differences between Intervention vs. Control periods (per stepped wedge design) weeknight sleep: Sunday-Thursday bedtimes and Monday-Friday wake-times. Agency staff will distribute and collect sleep logs from parent participants at 5 points: 1 week pre/post the 2 &quot;cross-overs&quot; and at final follow-up. Analyses will be based upon weeknight (Sun-Thurs) sleep duration from sleep logs, assessed in minutes.&#xD;

    <description>Tayside Children's Sleep Questionnaire- This simple 10-item tool detects 'settling' difficulties (e.g., getting to/staying asleep) in 1-5 year olds. Nine items, scored on a 5-point scale, refer to the past 3 months: a score of &gt; 8/36 indicates a mild/moderate settling difficulty. The last (yes/no) item asks if the child has a sleep problem. hypothesize: a) lower mean Tayside scores for Intervention vs. Control periods, b) a lesser likelihood of Intervention vs. Control scores above the criterion indicative of mild/moderate difficulties (&gt; 8/36) and c) lower rates of parents reporting a sleep problem (Yes/No) in Intervention vs. Control periods.</description>

    <description>Parents rate agreement with items on a 5-point scale. Knowledge items (n=12); Attitude items (n=5); Self-efficacy items (n=7) and Belief items (n=2) query the value of a regular bedtime and bedtime routine. There is one multiple-choice item about how much sleep a preschooler needs.&#xD;
Hypotheses: a) higher KASB total scores for Intervention vs. Control phases, and b) higher scores for each of the Knowledge, Attitudes, Self-Efficacy, and Behavior domains for Intervention vs. Control phases. As descriptive data, repeat analyses will be conducted for pre/post the ECSEP within each agency.</description>

    <description>Investigators will collect a measure of classroom climate, reflecting teacher-child interactions:&#xD;
● Classroom Climate- the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASSTM) is an evidence-based tool developed by the NIH. Data are collected quarterly by certified observers. We will analyze CLASS data for: Positive Climate, Negative Climate, and Behavior Management. Scores range from 1-7: Low (1-2), Medium (3-4) and High (5-7).&#xD;
It is hypothesized that CLASS scores (or their equivalent) for Positive Climate, Negative Climate, and Behavior Management will differ significantly for Intervention vs. Control periods at the classroom, site, and agency levels.</description>
