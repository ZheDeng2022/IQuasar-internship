      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. Although&#xD;
           highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC relapses quickly and becomes&#xD;
           refractory to treatment within a few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inability to destroy residual SCLC cells despite initial chemosensitivity suggests&#xD;
           the existence of a highly effective DNA damage response network. SCLC is also&#xD;
           characterized by high DNA replication stress (RB1 inactivation, MYC and CCNE1&#xD;
           activation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is only one FDA approved treatment for patients with relapsed SCLC after&#xD;
           first-line chemotherapy: topotecan, which inhibits religation of topoisomerase&#xD;
           I-mediated single-strand DNA breaks leading to lethal double-strand DNA breaks.&#xD;
           Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, which causes DNA damage by alkylating guanine at&#xD;
           position O6 also has activity in relapsed SCLC, particularly for brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary evidence indicates that disruption of the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
           pathway can yield responses in a subset of SCLC patients, but response rates&#xD;
           (approximately equal to 10%) are lower than NSCLC and other tumors with comparable tumor&#xD;
           mutational burden indicating additional immunosuppressive mechanisms at play in the SCLC&#xD;
           tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand 1&#xD;
           (PDL1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta&#xD;
           (TGF-beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety data from the dose-escalation study in solid tumors as well as preliminary data&#xD;
           from expansion cohorts show that M7824 has a safety profile similar to other checkpoint&#xD;
           inhibiting compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combining immunotherapy, and chemotherapy could synergistically improve the anticancer&#xD;
           activity of immunotherapy. Combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy have improved&#xD;
           outcomes in NSCLC and melanoma leading to FDA approvals of such combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that increased DNA damage induced by topotecan and temozolomide will&#xD;
           complement the anti-tumor activity of M7824, in recurrent SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The primary objective of the trial is to determine the efficacy (using objective response&#xD;
      rate) of M7824 plus topotecan or temozolomide in relapsed SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with histological or cytological confirmation of SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have a performance status&#xD;
           (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must not have received chemotherapy, or undergone major surgery within 2 weeks&#xD;
           and radiotherapy within 24 hours prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have adequate organ function and measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (M7824 monotherapy): Up to 10 patients may be treated with M7824 monotherapy to&#xD;
           obtain safety and PK data, and a preliminary estimate of clinical responses to M7824 in&#xD;
           SCLC. Patients with progressive disease on Arm A may then receive M7824 plus&#xD;
           temozolomide as per description of treatment for Arm C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (M7824 plus topotecan) and Arm C (M7824 plus temozolomide) will be administered in&#xD;
           3 and 4-week cycles respectively; these arms will have a safety run-in followed by&#xD;
           efficacy analysis. Up to 10 patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancer will be&#xD;
           enrolled in arm C to receive the combination of M7824 and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional tumor biopsies will be obtained at pre-treatment on C1D1 and C1D15 for Arm C;&#xD;
           pre-treatment on C1D1 and C2D1 for arms A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every subject of each arm of the safety run-in will be observed for at least 7 days&#xD;
           after first dose of M7824 before the subsequent subject can be treated. Subjects who are&#xD;
           not evaluable for DLT will be replaced and not included into evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (3-week cycles): M7824 monotherapy 2400 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression&#xD;
           or a criterion in Protocol is met. Patients with progressive disease on Arm A may then&#xD;
           receive 1200 mg M7824 every 2 weeks plus temozolomide 200 mg/m^2/day on days 1-5 every 4&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (3-week cycles): M7824 2400 mg plus topotecan 1 mg/m2 on days 1-5 every 3 weeks&#xD;
           until disease progression or a criterion in Protocol is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C (4-week cycles): M7824 1200 mg every 2 weeks plus temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day on&#xD;
           days 1-5 every 4 weeks until disease progression or a criterion in Protocol is met.&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because topotecan and temozolomide are&#xD;

             the effects of M7824 on the developing human fetus are currently unknown. In addition,&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with topotecan, temozolomide or M7824,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents&#xD;
