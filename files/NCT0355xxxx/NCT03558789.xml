  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metallic taste in head and neck cancer is widely under-estimated in the literature. Its&#xD;
      causes are multiple and poorly defined. Though it has a strong impact on the nutritional&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the TORCAD project is to test the hypothesis that intraoral&#xD;
      lipoperoxidation is associated to metallic taste onset before, during and after treatment of&#xD;
      head and neck cancer (HNC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goals are to evaluate the involvement of others physiopathological factors in&#xD;
      metallic taste: (i) additional chemical modification in the saliva; (ii) release of&#xD;
      inhibition of the facial nerve on the glossopharyngeal nerve; presence of an intraoral&#xD;
      electric current; food pleasantness and acceptability; quality of life.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to perform tests and questionnaires. All samples will be&#xD;
      non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of metallic taste (MT) occurrence with a specific questionnaire. In a single&#xD;
      patient, MT occurrence may vary according to the time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral media modifications 1.1- Salivary functions: basal and stimulated salivary flow&#xD;
           will be determined. Immediately after collection, both salivary samples will be stored&#xD;
           at -80°C. Twice a year frosted samples will be delivered to the Centre des Sciences du&#xD;
           Goût et de l'Alimentation in Dijon, France) by a special transporter. Biochemical&#xD;
           analyses of saliva will consist of analyses of candidate markers: malondialdehyde,&#xD;
           metabolites (uric acid), ions (Mn2+ and Zn2+), enzymatic activities and key proteins&#xD;
           involved in the salivary peroxidation (catalase, superoxide dismutase). All the technics&#xD;
           are already validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2- Quantification of fungiform papillae in dermatoscopy. The objective of the&#xD;
           dermatoscope is placed on the tongue and a snapshot of a predefined surface area will be&#xD;
           recorded on both sides of the tongue. The density will be estimated according to an&#xD;
           automatic method from the snapshots.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3- Trapping of nasal scents To assess the presence of volatile odorous compounds&#xD;
           induced by the oral lipoperoxidation, the nasal scents of the patients will be harvested&#xD;
           by a Tenax® trap positioned at the exit of nostril. The operation will be performed&#xD;
           without any stimulus, after an iron sulphate mouthwash (artificially inducing MT) and&#xD;
           after treatment with lactoferrin mouthwash (chelating agent). The traps will be&#xD;
           hermetically closed and sent to the Centre des Sciences du gout et de l'Alimentation in&#xD;
           Dijon for analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. These tests will be&#xD;
           performed after psychophysical tests not to distort their results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Psychophysical tests. 2.1- Psychophysical tests of taste intensity will be carried out&#xD;
           with two aqueous solutions (one neutral, the other sapid) of each taste (salty, sweet,&#xD;
           sour, bitter and umami) and iron sulphate. The solutions will moisten 0.5 cm-diameter&#xD;
           filter paper discs that will be deposited on the tongue. For each taste, patients will&#xD;
           have to indicate the disc with the strongest and least strong taste. Four locations on&#xD;
           the tongue will be tested: one for the territory of the facial nerve (anterior tongue),&#xD;
           one for the glossopharyngeal nerve (tongue base), repeated on both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2- Efficacy of a lactoferrin mouthwash to attenuate the sensation of MT. Omur-Ozbeck&#xD;
           et al. showed that a lactoferrin mouthwash completely attenuated an artificially-created&#xD;
           MT by an iron sulphate mouthwash. For the investigator's patients, in case of&#xD;
           spontaneous presence of a MT or after having artificially created it by the iron&#xD;
           sulphate mouthwash, a lactoferrin mouthwash will be proposed and its efficacy to&#xD;
           attenuate the MT will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3- Psychophysical olfaction tests (European Test of olfactory Capacities ETOC from&#xD;
           Thomas-Danguin T et al. Rhinology 2003;41:142-51) This test is constructed from odours&#xD;
           contained in vials. It is made up of 16 series of 4 vials. In a series, only one of the&#xD;
           four vials contains an odour. The patients must first find the vial which, among 4&#xD;
           contains the odour (test of detection) then in the vial chosen identify the odour (test&#xD;
           of identification) among 4 alternatives proposed in the form of 4 verbal labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impedancemetry Measurements of the spontaneous presence of a current in the oral cavity&#xD;
           and the resistivity of the oral mucosa will be carried out by application of an&#xD;
           electrode on the back of the tongue. This procedure is painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluation of food intake by patients weighing, an analogic visual scale and of food&#xD;
           pleasantness by MT specific questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterization of quality of life through general EORTC QLQ30 and HNC-specific EORTC&#xD;
           HNC35 quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
