  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current opioid epidemic has led to a renewed interest in exploring non-pharmacological&#xD;
      techniques to treat post-operative pain. An increasing number of patients are suffering from&#xD;
      the adverse effects of opioid use following surgery, including post-operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, respiratory depression, immunosuppression, constipation, and most recently,&#xD;
      addiction. Although the risk of opioid addiction following surgery is recognized, the&#xD;
      percentage of patients becoming addicted to opioids following surgery is not well understood.&#xD;
      Therefore, in order to combat this growing health crisis at the ground level, it is incumbent&#xD;
      upon the medical community to explore alternative methods of pain control to treat the&#xD;
      surgical population in order to reduce the incidence of post-operative opioid addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous Nerve Field Stimulation (PNFS) is one of these recognized methods that ongoing&#xD;
      research has shown to be effective as a complementary method of pain management. While PNFS&#xD;
      is not a novel concept, clinical indications of auricular field stimulation have been limited&#xD;
      in the past due to requirement of bulky, stationary and non-disposable stimulators and&#xD;
      electrodes. These technological limitations made it difficult to establish the real clinical&#xD;
      potential of auricular stimulation for the perioperative management of pain in surgical&#xD;
      patients, despite the demonstration that auriculotherapy has been shown to relieve pain in&#xD;
      the postoperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NSS-2 BRIDGE is a battery operated and disposable percutaneous auricular nerve field&#xD;
      stimulator (Innovative Health Solutions, Versailles, IN, USA), that was recently cleared by&#xD;
      the FDA and assigned a Class II Risk Designation. The indication for the NSS-2 BRIDGE is for&#xD;
      the treatment of clinical symptoms related to opioid consumption and opioid withdrawal. These&#xD;
      symptoms include abdominal pain, anxiety and post-operative nausea and vomiting; conditions&#xD;
      which are also present following major oncologic abdominal surgery. The use of the NSS-2&#xD;
      BRIDGE device has been demonstrated to provide significant analgesia in patients with&#xD;
      abdominal pain syndrome, and clinical trials are ongoing to assess the benefit of this&#xD;
      approach for post-operative pain management. As compared to the present use of opioids for&#xD;
      perioperative pain management, the use of a complementary, non-pharmacologic approach offers&#xD;
      the advantage of analgesia without the associated side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects (from both the prospective interventional and control groups) will be&#xD;
      recruited in the pre-surgical clinic of the surgical oncology group at UPMC Shadyside once&#xD;
      they are scheduled for major abdominal surgery. Patients will be asked for their interest in&#xD;
      pursuing a research study that involves wearing a percutaneous, auricular field stimulator&#xD;
      for five days as a supplementary method of post-operative pain control. Patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the trial will sign an IRB approved Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patient has signed the Informed Consent to participate in this pilot study, demographic&#xD;
      information and medical history will be collected from each participant on the day of&#xD;
      surgery. The NSS-2 BRIDGE device will be applied to the ear by Dr. Jacques Chelly or Research&#xD;
      Coordinator Amy Monroe in the immediate post-operative setting (PACU), as Dr. Chelly and Amy&#xD;
      Monroe have both completed the necessary training required by the company to apply the&#xD;
      device. Rescue analgesia will be permitted as per the approved ERAS multi-modal anesthetic&#xD;
      protocol, however, the patient will be made aware at the time of consent and throughout the&#xD;
      trial that they can drop out of the study at any time if they do not like wearing the NSS- 2&#xD;
      BRIDGE device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of both groups will occur by assigning the participant a subject ID number, and&#xD;
      this ID number will correspond to a treatment allocation based on a pre-designed&#xD;
      randomization schema. This treatment allocation (intervention/control) will be contained in a&#xD;
      sealed, opaque, envelope with the subject ID number that is designated on envelope. The&#xD;
      master randomization list will be created and held by an independent data monitor who will&#xD;
      both create and hold the master randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be assessed 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-operatively to collect&#xD;
      total opioid consumption, incidence of adverse events, and verbal pain scores. Additional&#xD;
      data that will be collected includes total non-narcotic analgesic consumption, time to&#xD;
      readiness for discharge from PACU, time to bowel movement, time to oral intake (liquid and&#xD;
      regular diet), time to hospital discharge, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission&#xD;
      to the hospital, percentage of patients readmitted because of pain related issues, overall&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and patient satisfaction relating to pain management. When the patient&#xD;
      is discharged from the hospital, they will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction&#xD;
      survey. For patients discharged with the device attached, removal instructions and pre-paid&#xD;
      return envelope will be given to patient to remove the device at 120 hours and send back to&#xD;
      the hospital. The patient will be contacted 3 months post-operatively to again assess patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with the pain management after surgery, and to assess functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative nausea and/or vomiting will be evaluated by nausea score (0-10). Frequency of&#xD;
      emesis and rescue antiemetic requirement will be collected per the institution's standard of&#xD;
      care and transcribed from the medical record by research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard opioid conversion table will be used to convert the oral and IV narcotic utilized by&#xD;
      the patients to oral morphine equivalent doses (OME) for analysis purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) initiation on the floor will also be measured, as&#xD;
      well as total PCA hydromorphone consumption over the 120-hour postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction of pain management during hospitalization will&#xD;
      be measured by a numerical rating scale with 0- worst satisfaction and 10 being the best&#xD;
      satisfaction. The patient satisfaction test will be administered by a member of the research&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients with unsatisfactory pain relief defined as average Numerical Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS) more than 5 with or without requirement of IVPCA for pain relief during the first 120&#xD;
      hours postoperative period will be compared between the two groups and form the primary&#xD;
      outcome for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include non-narcotic analgesic consumption, episodes of PONV,&#xD;
      verbal pain scores, time to readiness for discharge from PACU, time to first bowel movement,&#xD;
      time to oral intake (liquid and regular diet), time to hospital discharge, readmission to the&#xD;
      hospital, percentage of patients readmitted because of pain related issues, functional&#xD;
      recovery, overall patient satisfaction, and patient satisfaction relating to pain management.&#xD;
      Overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction of pain management during hospitalization will&#xD;
      be measured by a numerical rating scale with 0- worst satisfaction and 10 being the best&#xD;
      satisfaction. This patient satisfaction score will administered by member of research team.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of surgery through 90 days post-operative.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional recovery will be measured by the assessment of the participant's answers to the Functional Recovery Questionnaire 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The SF-12 Health Survey includes questions from the SF-36 Health Survey (Version 1). Two summary scores are reported from the SF-12 - a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 points above or below 50, corresponds to one standard deviation away from the average. The highest possible PCS-12 score is 56.57706 and the lowest possible score is 23.99938. The highest possible MCS-12 score is 60.75781 and the lowest possible score is 19.06444. Higher scores for both represent better functioning.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients scheduled for surgery by a member of the surgical oncology group of UPMC Shadyside hospital. Patients were recruited in the pre-surgical clinic. After obtaining a signed informed consent the patients were randomized to either an active or a placebo NSS-2 BRIDGE device®. Each patient was made aware at the time of consent and throughout the study that they could ask to have the NSS-2 BRIDGE device® removed at any time.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 65 subjects signed an informed consent. Among them 2 were screen failures and were not randomized because the surgery was cancelled. 10 were excluded because they were considered as major protocol violations. Consequently, a total of 53 patients were included in the final analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Functional Recovery</title>
        <description>Functional recovery will be measured by the assessment of the participant's answers to the Functional Recovery Questionnaire 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The SF-12 Health Survey includes questions from the SF-36 Health Survey (Version 1). Two summary scores are reported from the SF-12 - a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 points above or below 50, corresponds to one standard deviation away from the average. The highest possible PCS-12 score is 56.57706 and the lowest possible score is 23.99938. The highest possible MCS-12 score is 60.75781 and the lowest possible score is 19.06444. Higher scores for both represent better functioning.</description>
