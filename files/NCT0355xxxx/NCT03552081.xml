    <textblock>
      Tobacco is a male infertility risk factor. Many studies comparing smokers to non-smokers have&#xD;
      shown effects on spermatogenesis and the quality of the male gamete. In vitro fertilization&#xD;
      success rates are decreased in smokers and in natural procreation the time required to&#xD;
      conceive (excellent fertility indicator) seems to be lengthened in the smoker. The&#xD;
      prospective study that the investigators propose to carry out would make it possible to know&#xD;
      the time required for the repair of the sperm abnormalities and in particular the DNA of the&#xD;
      gametes generated by the smoking.&#xD;

      Tobacco is a male infertility risk factor. Many studies comparing smokers to non-smokers have&#xD;
      shown effects on spermatogenesis and the quality of the male gamete. In vitro fertilization&#xD;
      success rates are decreased in smokers and in natural procreation the time required to&#xD;
      conceive (excellent fertility indicator) seems to be lengthened in the smoker. Tobacco is a&#xD;
      well-known mutagen. It will induce damage to the male gametes DNA. Tobacco increases the&#xD;
      oxydation of DNA. Exposure to tobacco increases the percentage of spermatozoa with broken DNA&#xD;
      or defective chromatin and induces gametes aneuploidy as has been reported in several&#xD;
      studies. The set of effects of tobacco on the male gametes questions the consequences for the&#xD;
      conceptus (from embryo to adult). The prospective study that the investigators propose to&#xD;
      carry out would make it possible to know the time required for the repair of the sperm&#xD;
      abnormalities and in particular the DNA of the gametes generated by the smoking. Indeed, a&#xD;
      cycle of spermatogenesis extending over 74 days, it would be important to know if it is&#xD;
      necessary to wait a complete cycle or even more before proposing a management. It would&#xD;
      therefore be possible to find the most favorable period for reducing tobacco-related risks&#xD;
      and for effective management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood test will be performed at T0 (before weaning) and during follow-up at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months for the determination of the Inhibin hormones and testosterone. Sperm analysis at the&#xD;
      different follow-up times will be carried out at CECOS using a standardized methodology&#xD;
      (WHO). Two tests of analysis will be used in this study on each sample: the TUNEL test and&#xD;
      the SCSA. A measurement of DNA oxidation will also be performed, as well as a study of&#xD;
      spermatic aneuploidy (in situ hybridization technique of fluorescent centromeric chromosomal&#xD;
      probes).&#xD;
