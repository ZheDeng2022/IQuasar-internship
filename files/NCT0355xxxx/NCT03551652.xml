  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people, especially geriatric patients, account for a growing share of patients&#xD;
      receiving anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients over 75 years of age the annual rate of anesthesia represents 16.8 / 100&#xD;
      inhabitants for women and 19.6 / 100 for men. It is a growing population, but also the most&#xD;
      fragile population with a mortality amounting to 44.4 / 10000 anesthesia. After 85 years, one&#xD;
      out of every two patients is ASA 3 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cause of death related to anesthesia today remains respiratory complications,&#xD;
      particularly infectious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a major public health issue right now. The studies on the use of curare and&#xD;
      particularly rocuronium are old and did not study a population of elderly people (with an&#xD;
      average age of 70 years). Several studies show an increase in the duration of neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade in patients older than 70 years irrespective of any renal failure, with sometimes&#xD;
      persistent curarizations more than 2h after a single dose. But no study to date has studied&#xD;
      the duration of deep-intensity neuromuscular block (TOF).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Scientific justification Elderly patients, especially geriatric patients, represent an&#xD;
      increasing percentage of patients receiving anesthesia. Thus, among the population over 75&#xD;
      years old, the annual rate of anesthesia represents 16.8 / 100 inhabitants. women and 19.6 /&#xD;
      100 in men. This is a growing population, but also the most fragile population with a&#xD;
      mortality amounting to 44.4 / 10000 anesthesia. After 85 years, one out of every two&#xD;
      anesthetized patients is ASA 3 or higher. The first cause of mortality linked to anesthesia&#xD;
      today remains respiratory complications, particularly those of infectious origin. The care of&#xD;
      this population presents a major public health challenge. Studies on the use of curare and&#xD;
      especially rocuronium are relatively old and did not study a geriatric population, so in the&#xD;
      group aged the average age was 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies show an increase in the duration of neuromuscular blockade in patients over&#xD;
      the age of 70, regardless of any renal failure, with extremes of persistent curarization more&#xD;
      than 2 h after a single dose. However, no study to date has investigated the duration of&#xD;
      deep-tissue neuromuscular blocking (train of four (TOF) &lt;1) required for performing certain&#xD;
      surgical procedures, including laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies show that elderly patients have increased sensitivity to residual&#xD;
      curarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, a study on the kinetics of the curare and in particular rocuronium is&#xD;
      necessary in order to evaluate if the &quot;standard&quot; induction dose of 0.6 mg / kg is adapted to&#xD;
      this population or if this dose requires an adjustment to reduce the respiratory risks&#xD;
      associated with residual curarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General description of the research Objectives To compare the duration of curarization&#xD;
      induced by rocuronium (0.6 mg / kg of real weight) between young patients (18-50 years old)&#xD;
      and old men (&gt; 80 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary judgment criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total curarization time (DCT, defined as the sum of the installation time + deep curarization&#xD;
      time + recovery time The installation time (Dinstall) is defined as the time between the&#xD;
      injection of rocuronium and the disappearance of the responses to the train of four (TOF =&#xD;
      0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deep block duration (Dprof) is defined as the time between the disappearance of the&#xD;
      responses to the train of four (TOF = 0) and the reappearance of the first response to a&#xD;
      train of four (TOF = 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovery time (Drécup) will be evaluated for both a T4 / T1 recovery ≥ 0.9 (Drécup0.9)&#xD;
      and a T4 / T1 ratio ≥ 1.0 (Drécup1.0). recovery will also be assessed by the ratio of&#xD;
      T4/Tref, i.e. the ratio of the 4th response to a TOF stimulation and the mean of the 4&#xD;
      responses to a TOF stimulation before administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent. This&#xD;
      ratio is measured by the TofScan (IdMed, Marseille, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methodology Patients will be anesthetized, as in clinical routine, with propofol in&#xD;
      target controlled infusion anesthesia (TCI) according to the Schnider model at the effect&#xD;
      site. Analgesia will be provided either by remifentanil or sufentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular block will be monitored using TofScan (IdMed, Marseille, France), with&#xD;
      accelerometry measurement at the adductor pollicis. The TOF-WatchSX will be calibrated in cal&#xD;
      2 mode, as defined by the manufacturer. (12) Neuromuscular blockade will be induced by a&#xD;
      single dose of rocuronium 0.6 mg / kg of actual weight. The intensity of the neuromuscular&#xD;
      block will be measured by a train of four every 15 s from the curare injection to TOF = 0&#xD;
      (Dinstall): then every minute until TOF = 1 (Dprof); then every minute until T4/T1 ≥ 0.9&#xD;
      (Drécup0.9) and T4/T1 ≥ 1.0 (Drécup1.0). Dinstall, Dprof, Drécup0.9 and Drécup1.0 will be&#xD;
      recorded, as well as time to recovery of T4/Tref of 0.9 and 1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection: inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, recruitment modality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient aged 18 to 50 or ≥ 80 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 35&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention requiring general anesthesia with intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of non-inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rocuronium allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for rapid sequence induction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically apparent hepatocellular insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal insufficiency requiring dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA&gt; 2 in the group of 18 to 50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and techniques used Monitoring of the TofScan (IdMed, Marseille, France) monitor at&#xD;
      the level of the adductor pollicis. The electrodes are placed at the ulnar edge of the arm 2&#xD;
      cm apart.12 Registration of the Tref value before administration of rocuronium. Measurement&#xD;
      of the neuromuscular block intensity every 15s from the neuromuscular blocking facility to&#xD;
      TOF = 0, then measured every minute of the neuromuscular block up to TOF = 1(Dprof) and&#xD;
      finally measured every minute until decurarisation spontaneous T4 / T1 ≥ 0.9 (Drécup0.9) and&#xD;
      T4 / T1 ≥ 1.0 (Trécup1.0). The time to recovery of T4/Tref to 0.9 and 1.0 ill also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normothermia is maintained (temperature&gt; 36 ° C) by the use of a forced air system (Bair&#xD;
      Hugger) with temperature monitoring by oesophageal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the number of patients to be included in each group, we postulate that the DCT of&#xD;
      patients 80 and over is, on average, at least 30% greater than the CSD of patients under 50&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean DCT of the under-50 group is around 60 minutes and a standard deviation of 11&#xD;
      minutes. By setting the alpha risk at 5% and the expected power 80%, it will be necessary to&#xD;
      include 14 patients per group, or 28 in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis: calculation of%, means, standard deviations, quartiles and extreme&#xD;
      values Principal analysis: the mean DCT will be compared by a matched series average&#xD;
      comparison test, then by a linear regression model with adjustment for potential confounders,&#xD;
      excluding matching factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyzes: The secondary endpoints will be compared by a MacNémar test and a&#xD;
      Student's t-test on matched series and possibly by conditional logistic and linear regression&#xD;
      models to allow an adjustment for potential confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Threshold of significance: 5% Software: SAS v9.4&#xD;
