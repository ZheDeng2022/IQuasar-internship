  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Niraparib can help to control&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied. Niraparib is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Its use in this&#xD;
      study is investigational.&#xD;
