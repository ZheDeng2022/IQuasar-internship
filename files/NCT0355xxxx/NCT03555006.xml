      This study tries to evaluate the non-inferiority quality and safety of ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations realise by electro-radiology assistant with a remote radiologist compared to&#xD;
      those realize by electro-radiology assistant with a referent radiologist on site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of requests for medical imaging examinations is clearly growing while there is an&#xD;
      understaffing among the radiologists. The solution is the amelioration of information&#xD;
      transmission technologies, for organize a territorial teleradiology in order to care duty.&#xD;
      Currently, in the ultrasound field, the investigators can't realize image transfer because&#xD;
      analyse and expertise are made during examination and only reading of fixed images can't be&#xD;
      enough for the examination interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most part of other developed countries recognize a paramedical job devoted to ultrasound.&#xD;
      Tele-ultrasound is used in expert resort, for example during high-risk pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A French society commercializes tele-ultrasound robots, arranged by a caregiver beside sick&#xD;
      person and a tele-radiologist realize acquisition of information and images with remote&#xD;
      commands from robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHR Metz-Thionville has a cooperation protocol between electro-radiology assistants and&#xD;
      radiologists for the ultrasound practical, endorsed by Lorraine ARS and HAS (French health&#xD;
      organizations) since 2012, and currently national impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study purpose to evaluation the non-inferiority of agreement between two interpretations&#xD;
      of the same ultrasound realize by an electro-radiology assistant on the one hand by two&#xD;
      radiologists present in the radiology service and on the other hand, one radiologist in by&#xD;
      the radiology service and one remote radiologist.&#xD;
