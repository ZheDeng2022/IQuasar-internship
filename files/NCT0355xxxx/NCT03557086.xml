  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot randomized trial is to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of an advanced care planning (ACP) video decision support tool for improving patients'&#xD;
      knowledge regarding their goals of care options and end of life (EOL) decision-making in&#xD;
      patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD).&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Knowledge Scores From Baseline to Post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention, by 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess patients' knowledge of goals of care before and after the intervention using 5 true/false questions and 1 multiple choice question, each worth 1 point, for a summary score of 0 to 6 (higher score reflects greater knowledge). We have used this knowledge questionnaire in prior studies. Changes in knowledge scores from before and after the intervention will be compared between the intervention and control arms.</description>

    <measure>Preferences for Life-prolonging Care, Preferences to Receive Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), and Preferences to Receive Intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>By 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after the intervention, patients will report their post-intervention preferences for life-prolonging care: life-prolonging care, limited medical care, comfort care, or unsure. Before the intervention, patients will report their preferences to receive CPR as follows: &quot;Yes, attempt CPR&quot;, &quot;No, do not attempt CPR&quot;, or &quot;Not sure.&quot; Before the intervention, patients will report their preferences to receive intubation as follows: &quot;Yes, attempt intubation&quot;, &quot;No, do not attempt intubation&quot;, or &quot;Not sure.&quot;&#xD;
Post-intervention preferences for life-prolonging care (life-prolonging care, limited medical care, and comfort care), preferences to receive CPR, and preferences to receive intubation will be compared between the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Answered That They Felt &quot;Very Comfortable&quot; Seeing the Video in Response to First Question of Acceptability Questionnaire (Acceptability - Comfort)</measure>
    <time_frame>By 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the video intervention arm alone, we will administer 3-items assessing patients' comfort with watching the video, whether they find the video helpful in their understanding of the EOL care options, and whether they would recommend it to others. For the outcome of &quot;comfort&quot; we asked patients whether they felt comfortable watching the video by asking the question: &quot;Did you feel comfortable seeing the video in order to help you answer the questions regarding medical care?&quot;. Response choices were on a Likert scale with answer choices as follows: 1) very comfortable; 2) somewhat comfortable; 3) not comfortable; 4) don't know. We report below the percentage of patients who answered &quot;very comfortable&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Answered That They Felt the Video Was &quot;Very Helpful&quot; in Response to Second Question of Acceptability Questionnaire (Acceptability - Helpful)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the video intervention arm alone, we will administer 3-items assessing patients' comfort with watching the video, whether they find the video helpful in their understanding of the EOL care options, and whether they would recommend it to others. For the outcome of &quot;helpful&quot; we asked patients whether they felt the video was helpful by asking the question: &quot;Was the video helpful in improving your understanding about your choices for medical care?&quot;. Response choices were on a Likert scale with answer choices as follows: 1) very helpful; 2) somewhat helpful; 3) a little helpful; 4) not helpful. We report below the percentage of patients who answered &quot;very helpful&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Answered That They Would &quot;Definitely Recommend&quot; the Video to Other Patients in Response to Third Question on Acceptability Questionnaire (Acceptability - Recommend to Others)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the video intervention arm alone, we will administer 3-items assessing patients' comfort with watching the video, whether they find the video helpful in their understanding of the EOL care options, and whether they would recommend it to others. For the outcome of &quot;recommend to others&quot; we asked patients whether they would recommend the video to other patients by asking the question: &quot;Would you recommend the video to other patients with advanced liver disease who are facing a similar decision?&quot;. Response choices were on a Likert scale with answer choices as follows: 1) I would definitely recommend it; 2) I would probably recommend it; 3) I would probably not recommend it; 4) I would definitely not recommend it. We report below the percentage of patients who answered &quot;I would definitely recommend it&quot;.</description>

    <description>We designed a 3-minute advance care planning video to provide patients with advanced liver disease general understanding of the types of medical care patients may receive at the end of life (EOL) and a description of medical interventions such as hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and intubation. The video begins by addressing the importance of the patient's personal goals and perspectives by asking the viewer to reflect on their concerns about getting sick and their overall goals for their EOL care. The physician narrator then introduces a framework for choices of medical care at the EOL including: 1) life-prolonging care; 2) limited medical care; and 3) comfort care followed by visual images illustrating each of these EOL care choices. All three sequences of video images accompanying the narration attempt to help the viewer imagine the experience and likely outcomes of receiving these medical interventions at the EOL.</description>

            <description>We designed a 3-minute advance care planning video to provide patients with advanced liver disease general understanding of the types of medical care patients may receive at the end of life (EOL) and a description of medical interventions such as hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and intubation. The video begins by addressing the importance of the patient's personal goals and perspectives by asking the viewer to reflect on their concerns about getting sick and their overall goals for their EOL care. The physician narrator then introduces a framework for choices of medical care at the EOL including: 1) life-prolonging care; 2) limited medical care; and 3) comfort care followed by visual images illustrating each of these EOL care choices. All three sequences of video images accompanying the narration attempt to help the viewer imagine the experience and likely outcomes of receiving these medical interventions at the EOL.&#xD;

The physician narrator then introduces a framework for choices of medical care at the EOL including: 1) life-prolonging care; 2) limited medical care; and 3) comfort care followed by visual images illustrating each of these EOL care choices. All three sequences of video images accompanying the narration attempt to help the viewer imagine the experience and likely outcomes of receiving these medical interventions at the EOL.&#xD;

          <description>Before and after the intervention, patients will report their post-intervention preferences for life-prolonging care: life-prolonging care, limited medical care, comfort care, or unsure. Before the intervention, patients will report their preferences to receive CPR as follows: &quot;Yes, attempt CPR&quot;, &quot;No, do not attempt CPR&quot;, or &quot;Not sure.&quot; Before the intervention, patients will report their preferences to receive intubation as follows: &quot;Yes, attempt intubation&quot;, &quot;No, do not attempt intubation&quot;, or &quot;Not sure.&quot;&#xD;
Post-intervention preferences for life-prolonging care (life-prolonging care, limited medical care, and comfort care), preferences to receive CPR, and preferences to receive intubation will be compared between the two groups.</description>
