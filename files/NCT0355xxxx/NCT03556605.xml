      The study seeks to demonstrate the clinical value and user acceptance of the Bluetooth&#xD;
      enabled OneTouch Verio® Flex meter (Flex) used in combination with the OneTouch Reveal®&#xD;
      Mobile APP to support overall diabetes care, glycemic control and patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes in an undeserved population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel arm, open-label, randomized controlled, partial cross-over study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized into intervention group or control group in a 2:1 ratio. Intervention&#xD;
      group will use the Flex blood glucose meter and OneTouch Reveal Mobile App and receive text&#xD;
      messages every 2 weeks from the Health Care Professional for 12 weeks. The intervention group&#xD;
      will continue under the same conditions until 24 weeks to explore durability of effects. The&#xD;
      control group will use their own blood glucose meter without connectivity to a diabetes app&#xD;
      for the first 12 weeks of the study. At that point, control group subjects will cross-over to&#xD;
      the same treatment as the intervention group for an additional 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target of 100 subjects will be enrolled in the Intervention arm and a target of 50 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the Control arm. Randomization will be stratified based on type of&#xD;
      diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) and A1c (above or below 9.0%). Each subject will attend visits at&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after Baseline. In most cases, Screening and&#xD;
      Baseline will occur on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Periods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline): All screening procedures will be performed including informed&#xD;
      consent, demographics, medical history, a capillary blood draw for POC A1c determination and&#xD;
      evaluation of entrance criteria. If subject A1c meets inclusion criteria and subject meets&#xD;
      all other inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, subject will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of two arms via randomization scheme. The time of randomization becomes Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Week 12 ± 7 days): A capillary blood draw will be performed for measurement of POC&#xD;
      A1c. The HCP will discuss diabetes management progress with all subjects: for the control&#xD;
      group based on their own meter data; for the intervention group, the HCP will download SMBG&#xD;
      data from Flex meters and discuss diabetes management based on OTRM APP and Flex meter&#xD;
      information. The HCP will review and consider if the glucose range limits on the Flex meter&#xD;
      and/or OTRM need to be updated. Intervention subjects will continue in the same group for an&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks. Control subjects will be switched to Flex and OTRM for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Week 24 ± 7 days): A capillary blood draw will be performed for measurement of POC&#xD;
      A1c. The HCP will download SMBG data from all Flex meters. Subjects will return study&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
