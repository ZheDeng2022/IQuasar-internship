  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient or disrupted sleep, lack of physical activity and poor diet are linked with&#xD;
      obesity and are now potential targets to combat obesity. Sleep related issues have become&#xD;
      more important as people have been able to work, socialize, and use electronic devices&#xD;
      outside of daylight hours. This has also altered how we eat and how we exercise. All of these&#xD;
      factors can cause the body to not handle glucose (sugar) well resulting in insulin&#xD;
      resistance. In time this could lead to type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      Experimental Design: Subjects will have preliminary screening tests. Two conditions&#xD;
      (with/without exercise) will be completed in a randomized, crossover design. Subjects will&#xD;
      wear an activity monitor (actigraph) and sleep monitor (actiwatch) for 14 days. For the first&#xD;
      7 days this is the lead in period for us to get baseline sleep day. For the following 5 days&#xD;
      they will be asked to reduce their sleep with a specified bed time (ie. 11 pm - 5 am)&#xD;
      followed by 2 days of ad libitum sleep hours, totaling 14 days for each condition. On one&#xD;
      condition we will let them do their usual physical active and on the other condition during&#xD;
      the shortened sleep they will be asked to exercise for 45 min each day at a moderate&#xD;
      intensity (65% VO2max). Meal tests will be assessed after 7 days of normal habits, after 5&#xD;
      days of sleep deprivation, and after 2 days of ad libitum sleep, totaling 6 meal tolerance&#xD;
      tests throughout the entirety of the study. Testing will be conducted at the MU Physical&#xD;
      Activity and Wellness (MUPAW) center in Gwynn Hall and in McKee Gymnasium. Sleep logs will be&#xD;
      done for 3 days prior to the meal test days and food diaries will be done 4 days prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Subjects will be provided a verbal explanation of the study and will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent if interested. They will then complete questionnaires assessing health&#xD;
      history, sleep, and physical activity habits. A DXA scan and anthropometrics will also be&#xD;
      recorded. Participants will also perform a maximal peak oxygen consumption test (VO2max) on a&#xD;
      treadmill for calculations during exercise regimen, 65% VO2max. A resting blood pressure will&#xD;
      be measured three times with a sphygmomanometer. A mask will be securely fitted to the&#xD;
      subject's face, covering the nose and mouth, and connected to the Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400&#xD;
      (Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT) metabolic cart via a flexible hose to monitor carbon dioxide&#xD;
      expulsion and oxygen consumption. Heart rate will be monitored through a polar heart rate&#xD;
      monitor chest strap (Polar Elctro, Kempele, Finland). Subjects will be sent home with a pulse&#xD;
      oximeter to sleep with to ensure the subjects do not have sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Subjects will collect physical activity monitor (actigraph) and sleep monitor&#xD;
      (actiwatch) along with surveys to fill out each day about dietary consumption, sleep habits&#xD;
      and physical activity, lasting for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3-5: Subjects will have their resting energy expenditure (REE) measured and then do a&#xD;
      meal test. Subjects will arrive at MUPAW at ~7 am, following at least a 10 hour fast, abstain&#xD;
      from caffeine for &gt;10 hours and alcohol for 24 hours prior to arriving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REE: A ParvoMedics TrueOne2400 metabolic measurement system (Sandy Lake, UT) will be used to&#xD;
      measure REE. The REE measurement will occur in the morning after an overnight fast and after&#xD;
      ingestion of the meal during testing. During the REE, participants will lay supine in a&#xD;
      recliner for 30 min while all expired air is collected in a canopy that will be placed over&#xD;
      the participants head and analyzed for O2 and CO2 content. The participants will be able to&#xD;
      breath room air normally during the procedure. Expired air will be collected and the O2 and&#xD;
      CO2 values in the expired air will be converted to a REE estimate using the ParvoMedics&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal test: An IV catheter will be placed in a forearm vein (usually the antecubital vein). A&#xD;
      mixed meal tolerance test will consist of a commercially available shake (16 ounces) that&#xD;
      will be consumed within 10 minutes. Blood samples (~5 mL) will be collected over a 3 hour&#xD;
      period from the start of the test meal ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6: Repeat of Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7-9: Repeat of Visit 3-5. Exercise Sessions will be at McKee Gymnasium which will last&#xD;
      45 minutes for 5 days. A mask will be used to monitor oxygen consumption for 10 minutes at&#xD;
      the start of the session to ensure appropriate work load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reminded not to do any distance driving during their 5 days of shortened&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial. Describe&#xD;
      un-blinding procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be told at the beginning of the condition if they are going to be in the&#xD;
      exercise condition or just being monitored for physical activity.&#xD;
