    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and salivary hypoxia&#xD;
      inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in different periodontal diseases. A total of 87&#xD;
      individuals, 20 patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis, 20 with chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis, 26 with gingivitis and 21 periodontally healthy individuals were included.&#xD;
      Whole-mouth and site-specific clinical periodontal parameters including probing depth,&#xD;
      clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, gingival index and plaque index were&#xD;
      recorded. GCF and salivary HIF-1α, VEGF and TNF-α levels were measured by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was performed by using non-parametric tests.&#xD;

      Study Population and Clinical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty-seven participants were recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria were as follows:&#xD;
      1) systemic diseases that could affect the periodontium; 2) smoking; 3) current pregnancy or&#xD;
      lactation; 4) nonsurgical/surgical periodontal treatment received for the past year; and 5)&#xD;
      use of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full-mouth clinical periodontal examination included measurement of probing depth (PD),&#xD;
      clinical attachment level (CAL), presence of bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival index (GI)&#xD;
      and plaque index (PI) at 6 sites per tooth. Presence and extent of alveolar bone loss were&#xD;
      assessed radiographically. Based on clinical and radiographic diagnostic criteria proposed by&#xD;
      1999 International Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions, the&#xD;
      participants were categorized into four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) group (n=20). These individuals had minimum PD&#xD;
      ≥6 mm and CAL ≥5 mm on eight or more teeth; at least three of these were other than central&#xD;
      incisors or first molars. Radiographic alveolar bone loss was ≥30% of root length affecting&#xD;
      at least three permanent teeth other than first molars and incisors. The severe destruction&#xD;
      pattern was not commensurate with amount of plaque accumulation or other local risk factors&#xD;
      for a given age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Chronic periodontitis (CP) group (n=20). These individuals had at least four non-adjacent&#xD;
      teeth with sites with PD ≥6 mm and CAL ≥5 mm. They had also ≥50% alveolar bone loss in at&#xD;
      least two quadrants that was commensurate with amount of plaque accumulation. BOP was &gt;50% in&#xD;
      the whole mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Gingivitis group (n=26). These individuals had varying degrees of gingival inflammation.&#xD;
      They exhibited no sites with CAL &gt;2 mm and no detectable alveolar bone loss in the&#xD;
      radiography. BOP was &gt;50% in the whole mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Healthy group (n=21). These periodontally healthy volunteers exhibited no sites with PD&#xD;
      &gt;3 mm and CAL &gt;2 mm as well as no radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss. BOP was &lt;15%&#xD;
      in the whole mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole unstimulated saliva samples were collected. Each participant was asked first to rinse&#xD;
      the mouth completely with tap water for 2 minutes, wait for 10 minutes, and then expectorate&#xD;
      into sterile polypropylene tube for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized filter paper strips were used for GCF sampling. Two GCF samples were taken from&#xD;
      the buccal aspects of two non-adjacent interproximal sites of each individual. In patients&#xD;
      with periodontitis, GCF were sampled from two sites exhibiting PD ≥6 mm and CAL ≥5 mm. GCF&#xD;
      samples of gingivitis patients were obtained from the sites that exhibit BOP but no clinical&#xD;
      attachment loss. In the healthy group, GCF samples were collected the sites exhibiting PD &lt;3&#xD;
      mm without BOP and clinical attachment loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) Levels in GCF and Saliva Samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIF-1α, VEGF and TNF-α levels in GCF and saliva samples were measured by the enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercial kits according to the manufacturer's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data analyses were performed using a statistical software package. Comparisons of&#xD;
      clinical and biochemical parameters between the study groups were performed using the&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;
