  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine is a key micronutrient in the diet, essential for healthy growth, and is particularly&#xD;
      important during pregnancy and breastfeeding when demands are increased to support the&#xD;
      developing baby. Many people are thought to lack all the iodine they need, and this is a&#xD;
      greater issue during and shortly after pregnancy when the body's iodine requirements are&#xD;
      greatest. Iodine deficiency complications are potentially serious for both mother and child.&#xD;
      Iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid enlargement, lower production of important hormones&#xD;
      produced by the thyroid, pregnancy complications in the mother, and impaired growth and&#xD;
      developmental problems in babies and children. This research will focus on providing an&#xD;
      up-to-date estimate of how many pregnant women do not have enough iodine, and what different&#xD;
      levels of iodine might mean in terms of health risks during pregnancy and for childhood&#xD;
      development. The investigators will investigate how iodine levels vary over the course of&#xD;
      pregnancy and lactation, how this is affected by diet, associated changes in thyroid size and&#xD;
      function, and what levels of iodine are linked with greater risk of subsequent health&#xD;
      problems. The research will take advantage of existing urine samples collected from mothers&#xD;
      during pregnancy in the Born in Bradford birth cohort study, where the investigators also&#xD;
      know of any adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as any developmental problems for the baby&#xD;
      and in early childhood.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency as&#xD;
      requirements increase to support fetal development. There is limited information concerning&#xD;
      how maternal iodine status changes during pregnancy. Severe iodine deficiency is associated&#xD;
      with deleterious health outcomes during pregnancy including gestational diabetes,&#xD;
      preeclampsia, stillbirth, and increased mortality. For the fetus, severe iodine deficiency&#xD;
      results in reduced birthweight, increased mortality and neurodevelopmental issues. Several&#xD;
      studies suggest 40% of pregnant mothers in the United Kingdom (UK) may not meet the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) definition of iodine sufficiency. Although the effects of severe&#xD;
      iodine deficiency are known, the impact of mild-to-moderate deficiencies on maternal health&#xD;
      and associated fetal and childhood development are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide up-to-date information on iodine status in pregnant women in the UK,&#xD;
           including changes during pregnancy and lactation, and the role of diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To quantify any associations between iodine status during pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes,&#xD;
           and cognitive and motor development of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the iodine status of mothers in the Born in Bradford cohort to a more&#xD;
           nationally representative sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and methods: The investigators will utilize the Born in Bradford (BiB) birth&#xD;
      cohort which recruited over 12000 pregnant women between 2007- 2009, and has deposited in a&#xD;
      biobank 6971 spot urine samples collected at 26-28 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are available on health outcomes during pregnancy including gestational diabetes,&#xD;
      preeclampsia, blood pressure, length of gestation, mortality, mental health. Child outcome&#xD;
      measures at birth include weight, length, head circumference, small-for-gestational-age.&#xD;
      Childhood developmental measures include height, weight, growth trajectories, motor skills,&#xD;
      literacy, numeracy and mental health (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ). Linkage&#xD;
      with educational outcomes has been achieved, including Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)&#xD;
      outcomes and Standard Assessment Tests (SATS) at both Key Stage 1 (KS1) and Key Stage 2&#xD;
      (KS2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure all maternal urine samples in BiB to allow sufficient power to&#xD;
      detect potential modest-sized associations. This will be conducted using Inductively Coupled&#xD;
      Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS). All maternal baseline characteristics and associated&#xD;
      outcome data are available for extraction from the primary BiB database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will apply multiple logistic regression and multiple linear regression to&#xD;
      ascertain potential associations between maternal iodine status and health and developmental&#xD;
      outcomes. Cubic splines will be used to model any nonlinear dose-response associations,&#xD;
      making no assumptions regarding any predefined thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also conduct a longitudinal substudy to ascertain how iodine status&#xD;
      varies between trimesters (The Hiba study). 200 pregnant women will be recruited at 12 week&#xD;
      dating scans and the following collected: baseline characteristics, urine samples for iodide&#xD;
      analysis, blood for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and&#xD;
      triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroglobulin, Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) based on serum&#xD;
      creatinine, visual inspection of the thyroid using standard methods, dietary intake using a&#xD;
      validated online 24h recall tool (myfood24). Data collection will be repeated at 26 and 36&#xD;
      weeks' gestation, and 6, 18 and 30 weeks postpartum. The proposed substudy will clarify how&#xD;
      iodine status alters in pregnancy and lactation, and any associated thyroid hormone changes.&#xD;
      The investigators will identify key sources of iodine in the diet and ascertain dietary&#xD;
      patterns associated with different iodine status. To compare results to a more nationally&#xD;
      representative sample, spot urines will be analysed from approximately 650 women in the SCOPE&#xD;
      birth-cohort (London, Leeds and Manchester).&#xD;
