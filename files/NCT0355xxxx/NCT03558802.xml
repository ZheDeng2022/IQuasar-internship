  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Pelvic floor symptoms (PFS) are prevalent and often impair quality of life. They&#xD;
      include micturition problems, defecation problems, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual problems and&#xD;
      genito-pelvic pain. The pelvic floor is an anatomical and functional unit, and therefore&#xD;
      different PFS may co-occur. However, literature on prevalence of clusters of PFS is scarce.&#xD;
      Furthermore, PFS is understudied in the male population and when studies are performed in&#xD;
      male subjects, studies do not assess the complete scope of possible PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To generate a cohort, which provides information on sex- and gender differences&#xD;
      in: prevalence and incidence of (clinically relevant clusters of) PFS, risk factors and&#xD;
      prognostic factors for PFS, factors that reveal the impact of PFS on daily life, help seeking&#xD;
      behavior and use of health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective observational population-based cohort study with follow-up moments&#xD;
      after 1 year and 2 years. Data of the questionnaire will be connected to medical record data&#xD;
      from the participating general practitioners (GPs). A representative sample of female and&#xD;
      male subjects with and without PFS will be invited for a physical examination to assess&#xD;
      pelvic floor disorders and muscle function. Furthermore, a subsample of patients will be&#xD;
      invited for a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured face-to-face interviews on&#xD;
      healthcare seeking behavior, including barriers and facilitators, preferences and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: At least 2,500 female subjects and 2,500 male subjects, aged â‰¥16 years of&#xD;
      age, from the general population will be included. Exclusion criteria are: terminal disease,&#xD;
      or dementia, cognitive impairment or current psychological condition precluding informed&#xD;
      consent, not suitable or too ill to participate based on the judgement of the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: To evaluate the sex- and gender difference in prevalence and incidence&#xD;
      of (clinically relevant clusters of) PFS, the following primary parameters are assessed:&#xD;
      lower urinary tract symptoms, bowel symptoms, urogenital prolapse (females only), sexual&#xD;
      functioning, and pain. Secondary study parameters are factors associated with the development&#xD;
      of PFS ('risk factors'), factors that predict the course of PFS ('prognostic factors'),&#xD;
      factors that reveal the impact of PFS on daily life, help seeking behavior, and health care&#xD;
      use (consultations for PFS and consultation frequency, diagnostic tests, diagnoses,&#xD;
      treatment, and referrals).&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore sex- and gender differences in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the prevalence of (clinically relevant clusters) of PFS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the incidence of (clinically relevant clusters) of PFS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To explore sex- and gender differences in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. factors associated with the development of PFS ('risk factors')&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. factors that predict the course of PFS ('prognostic factors')&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. factors that reveal the impact of PFS on daily life&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. help seeking behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. health care use (consultations for PFS and consultation frequency, diagnostic tests,&#xD;
           diagnoses, treatment, and referrals) among those who sought care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study a mixed-methods approach will be used, combining quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      study designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step is to set-up a prospective population-based cohort study with a 2-year&#xD;
      follow-up based on annual self-administered questionnaires. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      invited by general practices in a well-defined region: the municipality of Coevorden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic medical record data (extracted from the Huisartsen Informatie Systeem, HIS) will&#xD;
      be matched with outcomes of the questionnaire, by a trusted third party (TTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of female (n=200) and male (n=200) subjects with and without PFS will be invited for&#xD;
      physical examination to assess pelvic floor disorders and pelvic floor muscle function (sub&#xD;
      study 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of patients with PFS will be invited for a qualitative study consisting of a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview on help seeking behavior, including barriers and facilitators,&#xD;
      preferences and satisfaction (sub study 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the upcoming period before the baseline questionnaire the study will be given attention by&#xD;
      flyers/posters in the waiting room of the participating practices and local press.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible persons will receive an information letter, with informed consent form attached,&#xD;
      from their GP about the cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People can provide informed consent by sending a signed informed consent form to the&#xD;
      coordinating investigator using the pre-stamped and self-addressed envelope included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to fill in the informed consent form for&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. participation in the cohort study (i.e. filling in the questionnaire),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. permission to collect medical GP record data&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. permission to be approached for future sub-studies&#xD;
&#xD;
           Filling in the questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
           After providing informed consent, participants will receive an e-mail including the&#xD;
           website of the questionnaire and their unique personal code for filling in the&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When subjects have not finished the questionnaire within 2 weeks, they will receive an&#xD;
           automatically generated reminder by e-mail. When 1 week after the e-mail reminder, the&#xD;
           subject has not finished the questionnaire, a second reminder by SMS will be sent. If a&#xD;
           subject will not respond to these reminders, he/she will be considered as nonresponder&#xD;
           (baseline) or lost to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The questionnaire consists of 11 parts for women and 10 parts for men, with a filling in&#xD;
           time of approximately 45-60 minutes. Subjects may interrupt completing the questionnaire&#xD;
           and continue it later on. In the online version there will be a button that enables&#xD;
           completing the questionnaire in another time (details on the questionnaire can be found&#xD;
           in the Methods section of this protocol). The questions in the online questionnaire will&#xD;
           have audio support, to stimulate participation and prevent drop-out of participants with&#xD;
           low literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects, who do not have access to the internet can use a laptop of the research team,&#xD;
           made available in the local general practice (in a private room). Subjects who indicated&#xD;
           that they want to fill in a paper version of the questionnaire will receive a paper&#xD;
           version at their home address including a pre-stamped and self-addressed envelope. The&#xD;
           paper questionnaires (provided only with the subject identification code) will be&#xD;
           entered into the online RoQua system by the coordinating researcher or research&#xD;
           assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case participants need support with filling in the questionnaires, such support is&#xD;
           provided through the research team in the municipality of Coevorden. For this, medical&#xD;
           students (males and females) with different native languages will be deployed. Due to&#xD;
           the privacy sensitive nature of the study, we actively discourage participants to ask&#xD;
           support from their peers or family.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Invitation and procedure for sub-studies Eligible participants (see information on&#xD;
           sub-studies), who provided informed consent for receiving information on sub-studies,&#xD;
           will receive a participant information leaflet for the specific sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sub study 1 physical examination When participants want to participate they fill in the&#xD;
           reply form and send it to the research team. A member of the research team will schedule&#xD;
           an appointment for the physical examination. The participant and a member of the study&#xD;
           team will sign informed consent face to face before the start of the physical&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sub study 2 interview When participants want to participate they fill in the informed&#xD;
           consent form and send it to the research team. A member of the research team will&#xD;
           schedule an appointment for the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who completed the baseline questionnaire will be invited after 1 year and&#xD;
           after 2 years to participate in the follow-up questionnaire rounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. List with potential participants (key file) In order to invite subjects (after&#xD;
           informed consent), to send reminders to the subjects, and to eventually connect the&#xD;
           questionnaire database with the medical record data, this data file contains information&#xD;
           about sex, name, date of birth, address, postal code, place, email-address, and&#xD;
           telephone number, and the RoQua ID number. Furthermore, preference of way of filling in&#xD;
           the questionnaire (online or paper, with or without guidance), and permission to collect&#xD;
           medical GP record data, and permission to be approached for future sub-studies will be&#xD;
           included in this data file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A subject identification code will be made for each subject. This code is not based on&#xD;
           patient initials and birth-date. The data file is safeguarded by the coordinating&#xD;
           investigator and the research assistant that is part of the research team, and will be&#xD;
           stored in a separate place apart from other files, without access from outside. A&#xD;
           password will be needed for entering this key file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2a. Data file with personal data in MedoQ In order to connect subjects to the&#xD;
           questionnaire database, and to send reminders to the subjects, this data file contains&#xD;
           information about sex, name, email-address, telephone number, a unique RoQua ID number&#xD;
           and the subject identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This system with personal data will be filled in by predefined research members (i.e.&#xD;
           the coordinating researcher and research assistant of the study) and access to the&#xD;
           system is restricted to those predefined research members. Next to a login account, the&#xD;
           system is secured by Google Authenticator. The predefined research members have&#xD;
           restricted options, such as filling in the personal data and inviting subjects for&#xD;
           filling in the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2b. Questionnaire database by RoQua RoQua will be used to collect and store data&#xD;
           generated from the questionnaires. Data are stored on RoQua-servers under the management&#xD;
           of 'het Centrum voor Informatie Technologie (CIT)' of the RuG. The database is not&#xD;
           directly accessible for the researcher, but will be made available to the researcher&#xD;
           according to the approved Research Data management plan. Data will not be anonymized,&#xD;
           but pseudonymized as it is necessary to trace data to an individual subject. This&#xD;
           procedure will be performed by a Trusted Third Party (ZorgTTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Medical data GPs Medical data will be collected through the electronic medical&#xD;
           records (Huisarts Informatie Systeem, HIS) systems used by the different general&#xD;
           practices. Data from those HIS systems will be collected via VIPLive and transformed by&#xD;
           Calculus/Proigia in order to generate a generic structure of the data. The structured&#xD;
           data will then be returned to VIPLive and will be sent to ZorgTTP for pseudomization.&#xD;
           The pseudonymized data are sent to the AHON (Academisch Huisarts Ontwikkel Netwerk)&#xD;
           database. The time scale for medical record review is 5 years prior to baseline&#xD;
           measurement up to the end of follow-up in the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Research database The different databases (questionnaire database from RoQua and a&#xD;
           subset of the AHON database) can be connected via the unique pseudomization codes&#xD;
           provided by ZorgTTP, eventually resulting in a secured research database. This raw data&#xD;
           file will be locked for editing after closure of the study. Data cleaning and processing&#xD;
           will be executed using syntaxes in program SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring and Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           As this study is with negligible risks a monitor from the University Medical Center&#xD;
           Groningen (UMCG) will monitor the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary study parameter(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
           To identify distinct classes of patients with clinically relevant clusters of PFS we&#xD;
           will perform Latent Class Analyses (LCA). LCA is a type of cluster analysis used to&#xD;
           group patients into k number of unique categories, where, within each category patients&#xD;
           are most similar to each other regarding PFS, and between the categories patients are&#xD;
           most different. The prevalence and incidence of those clinically relevant clusters of&#xD;
           PFS will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To explore whether sex- and gender-differences are present, we will perform most of the&#xD;
           analyses separately for sex (male and female subjects). The main reason for this is that&#xD;
           the questionnaires to measure PFS among women (female subjects) and men (male subjects)&#xD;
           are different to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary study parameter(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Univariate analyses will be performed to assess which parameters will be used in the&#xD;
           multivariable regression-analyses. In addition to those univariate parameters,&#xD;
           parameters known from literature will be added to the regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multivariable regression-analyses will be used to assess which factors are associated&#xD;
           with cluster membership. We aim to distinguish factors associated with the development&#xD;
           of PFS ('risk factors'), factors that predict the course of PFS ('prognostic factors'),&#xD;
           factors that reveal the impact of PFS on daily life, and explore sex and gender&#xD;
           differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine which factors are potential risk factors, a subsample consisting of&#xD;
           participants without PFS at baseline will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multivariable regression-analyses will be used to identify baseline factors that are&#xD;
           associated with the development of PFS at follow-up measurements. To determine which&#xD;
           factors are prognostic factors, a subsample consisting of participants reporting PFS at&#xD;
           baseline will be selected. Subsequently, a predictive model will be made to assess which&#xD;
           characteristics are associated to the course of (clusters of PFS) during follow-up. To&#xD;
           explore whether sex- and gender-differences are present, we will perform most of the&#xD;
           analyses separately for sex (male and female subjects). The main reason for this is that&#xD;
           the questionnaires to measure PFS among women (female subjects) and men (male subjects)&#xD;
           are different to each other. We would introduce bias if we would use the complete set of&#xD;
           data and add sex as interaction term in the regression analyses. To explore the&#xD;
           influence of gender-specific variables, we will add the gender identity variable and&#xD;
           gender role variables in the regression analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Variables will be entered into the model using the ''enter'' method of regression (ie,&#xD;
           all variables are forced into the model simultaneously, without making a decision about&#xD;
           the order in which the variables are entered.&#xD;
