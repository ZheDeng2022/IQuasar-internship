      The study aims to evaluate safety, feasibility and effectiveness of local injections of&#xD;
      autologous and micro-fragmented adipose tissue obtained with the Lipogems® system in patients&#xD;
      with refractory complex fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complex perianal fistulas represent one of the most challenging manifestations of Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. Combined surgical and medical therapy with biologic drugs today represents the&#xD;
      first-line treatment option but the overall success rate does not exceed 60%. The treatment&#xD;
      of patients in which complete closure cannot be achieved despite the combination of&#xD;
      biological therapy and surgery, is still not well defined. These patients may benefit from&#xD;
      innovative therapeutic approaches such as mesenchymal stromal cells. The adipose tissue is an&#xD;
      ideal source, due to its abundance and easy access. The investigators evaluate safety,&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of local injections of micro-fragmented adipose tissue in&#xD;
      patients with refractory complex fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a no profit interventional prospective study without drugs. A cohort of&#xD;
      patients (15) with complex perianal Crohn's Disease, refractory to standard treatment with&#xD;
      biologic drugs, or with secondary failure after initial effectiveness or presenting clinical&#xD;
      contraindications to biological treatment are enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the enrolment, medical history and clinical data are collected and pre-operatory exams,&#xD;
      pelvic MRI, and laboratory tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) are&#xD;
      performed. Health-related quality of life is assessed by a disease-specific (Inflammatory&#xD;
      Bowel Disease Questionnaire) and a generic (Short-Form 36 Health Survey) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Harvesting of the adipose tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower/lateral abdomen or, eventually, the inner/outer thigh are chosen as donor site for&#xD;
      adipose tissue harvesting under general or spinal anaesthesia. Before the harvesting, the&#xD;
      donor site is injected with 100 cc of Klein Solution (500 cc saline, 1 cc epinephrine 1/1000&#xD;
      IU, and 40 cc lidocaine 2%) using a disposable 17 gauge blunt cannula connected to a 60-cc&#xD;
      luer-lock syringe. The fat is then harvested (50-100 cc) using a 13 gauge blunt cannula&#xD;
      connected to a 20-ml VacLok® syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Processing of the adipose tissue with the Lipogems® device&#xD;
&#xD;
      The harvested fat is immediately processed in the Lipogems® processing kit (Lipogems&#xD;
      International Spa, Milan, Italy). Lipogems® is a disposable device that mechanically reduces&#xD;
      the size of the adipose tissue clusters while eliminating oily substances and blood residues&#xD;
      with pro-inflammatory properties. The entire process is carried out in one surgical step in&#xD;
      complete immersion in physiological solution minimizing any traumatic action on the cells and&#xD;
      microarchitecture. The processed micro-fragmented fat is collected in a 60-cc syringe and&#xD;
      positioned to decant the excess of saline solution. At the end, the product is transferred in&#xD;
      several 5-cc syringes to be re-injected in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Surgical procedure and micro-fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems®) injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination under anaesthesia is performed in order to identify all the fistula tracts and&#xD;
      abscesses; eventual purulent material is drained and the fistula tracts curetted. Necrotic&#xD;
      and inflamed tissues are excised using a &quot;cone-like&quot; fistulectomy at each fistula tract.&#xD;
      After local surgical drainage of the perianal disease, 20 cc of micro-fragmented adipose&#xD;
      tissue are injected circumferentially into the submucosa surrounding the internal fistula&#xD;
      orifice and in the perianal tissue along the residual fistula tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Follow-up visits and outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are assessed at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks after the procedure. During all&#xD;
      follow-up visits, laboratory tests and clinical examination are performed. health related&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires are also administered. A second pelvic MRI is performed at 24&#xD;
      weeks to radiologically assess the results.&#xD;

    <description>Health-related quality of life assessed by changes from baseline evaluation to 6 months follow-up of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). The questionnaire is made of 32 questions grouped into four dimensions: bowel, systemic, social, and emotional. Scores range from 1 (denoting a very severe problem) to 7 (denoting no problem at all). Scale range: worst quality of life: 32 - best quality of life: 224. Meaningful change is estimated at 16 points for the overall score.</description>

The SF-36 is a generic questionnaire with 36 items that measure functional health and well-being. It comprises eight domains and two psychometrically-established summary components, each derived from four domain scores. Domain and summary component scores range from 0-100; higher scores correspond to better health status or well-being.</description>
