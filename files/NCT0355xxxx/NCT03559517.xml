    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Remission Based on 2-item Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined by 2-item PRO subs-cores of average worst daily abdominal pain less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3 (based on 11 point numerical rating scale [NRS] ranging from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]); and average daily stool frequency &lt;=2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as per the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) over the 7 most recent days. BSFS ranges from 1 (separate hard lumps, hard to pass), 2 (sausage-shaped, but lumpy), 3 (like a sausage but with cracks on the surface), 4 (like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft), 5 (soft blobs with clear-cut edges), 6 (fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool), 7 (watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid). Participants with missing data at Week 16 or discontinuation before Week 16 were considered failures. Number of participants with clinical remission were reported.</description>

        <description>Endoscopic response was defined as a decrease in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of at least 25 percent (%) from baseline. The SES-CD considers ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, rectum in terms of: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface and presence of narrowing. Each graded from 0-3. Scale ranges from 0-56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease. Participants with missing data at Week 16 or who discontinued before Week 16 were considered failures.

          <description>Clinical remission was defined by 2-item PRO subs-cores of average worst daily abdominal pain &lt;=3 (based on 11 point NRS ranging from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency &lt;=2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as per BSFS ranging from type 1 (separate hard lumps-like stools) to type 7 (entirely liquid stools) over the 7 most recent days. Endoscopic response was defined as a decrease in SES CD of at least 25% from baseline. The SES-CD considers ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, rectum in terms of: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface and presence of narrowing. Each graded from 0-3. Scale ranges from 0-56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease. Participants with missing data at Week 16 or who discontinued before Week 16 were considered failures.

        <description>Clinical response is measured by at least a 100-point reduction in the CDAI from baseline (CDAI-100 response).

CDAI score is equal to sum of weighted scores for subjective and objective items which range from 0-149 points: asymptomatic remission, 150-220 points: mild to moderate active CD, 221-450 points: moderate to severe active CD, &gt;451 points: severely active to fulminant disease.

          <description>Endoscopic healing is measured by SES-CD &lt;=4 and at least 2-point reduction versus baseline and no sub-score &gt;1 in any individual variable. The SES-CD considers ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, rectum in terms of: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface and presence of narrowing. Each graded from 0-3. Scale ranges from 0-56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Total (Absolute) Score at Weeks 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>The IBDQ is a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) in participants with IBD, including CD. The IBDQ consists of 32 items, which are grouped into 4 domains and scored as: bowel function (10 to 70), systemic symptoms (5 to 35), emotional status (12 to 84), and social function (5 to 35). The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicates better HRQL. A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points is considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>
