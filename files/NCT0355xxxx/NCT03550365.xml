  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wholegrain fibre is known to affect on the gut health, but also may cause intestinal&#xD;
      discomfort. Thus, many individuals may avoid the consumption of whole grain cereals in spite&#xD;
      of their known health benefits, and may in this regard consume more restricted diets. In the&#xD;
      preset study the aim was to technologically modify the cereal fibres to improve its usability&#xD;
      and to maintain its health beneficial properties. The objective was to investigate intestinal&#xD;
      fermentation of grain dietary fibre and associated effects on gut-mediated metabolic health,&#xD;
      such as immunological health and adipose tissue function. The hypothesis was that whole grain&#xD;
      products maintain their original beneficial health effects and may be better tolerable when&#xD;
      the bran is technologically modified. Additionally, it was hypothesized that gut-mediated&#xD;
      bioavailability of plant cell wall compounds and their metabolites affect the metabolic&#xD;
      health through their immunomodulatory effects.&#xD;

      Cereal foods are the most important source of dietary fibre in the Northern European diet.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that diets rich in whole grain foods reduce the&#xD;
      risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Cereal fibre complex has been&#xD;
      suggested as one of the main constituents behind the protective effects. The dietary fibre&#xD;
      complex is composed of biopolymers and small molecular weight compounds, that formulate the&#xD;
      structure, content and interactions which change during processing. It has been proposed,&#xD;
      based on animal data, that the shift in gut microbiota communities is a potential mechanism&#xD;
      linking dietary fibre with reduced diabetes risk. Today it is known that gut microbita is&#xD;
      actively interacting with dietary fibre producing active functional compounds to the&#xD;
      circulation, and thus contribute to health benefits of dietary fibre. The hypothesis that&#xD;
      insoluble fibre is a major contributor of the protective effects of whole-grain type cereal&#xD;
      foods emphasizes the importance of dietary fibre structure and the conversions of both&#xD;
      carbohydrates and polyphenols in the large intestine. The importance of structural features&#xD;
      of grain foods in relation to their protective effect against type 2 diabetes was also&#xD;
      pointed out in the previous review. On the other hand, soluble arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides&#xD;
      have been shown to be selectively fermented by bifidobacteria in in vitro studies, and may&#xD;
      thus also be health-protective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large intestinal fermentation of the non-digested material causes both hydrolysis of the cell&#xD;
      wall matrix and also liberation, further metabolism and absorption of the associated&#xD;
      compounds, such as polyphenols. The interactions between dietary factors, gut microbiota and&#xD;
      host metabolism are increasingly demonstrated to be important for maintaining homeostasis and&#xD;
      health, but research into the role of fibre structure and phytochemicals in gut microbiota&#xD;
      mediated signalling is in its early phases.The physiological effects of dietary fibre are&#xD;
      dependent on the physico-chemical properties, which are mainly influenced by particle size,&#xD;
      cell wall architecture, solubility, degree of polymerisation and substitution, distribution&#xD;
      of side chains and degree of cross-linking of the polymers. Insoluble dietary fibres are&#xD;
      generally more resistant to colonic fermentation than soluble dietary fibre. Solubility of&#xD;
      dietary fibre has a major effect also on the bioavailability of fibre associated nutrients&#xD;
      and phytochemicals. It has been showed in vitro that enzymatic solubilisation of insoluble&#xD;
      dietary fibre stimulated the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Additionally, it has&#xD;
      been shown that the effect of wheat-bran derived arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides on SCFA&#xD;
      production and bifidobacterial numbers in rat faeces depended on the average degree of&#xD;
      polymerisation (avDP) of the AXOS preparations - the low avDP preparations increased colonic&#xD;
      acetate and butyrate production and boosted the bifidobacteria, whereas the higher avDP&#xD;
      preparation suppressed branched SCFA concentrations (a marker for protein fermentation).&#xD;
      When, the prebiotic effect of whole-grain wheat and wheat bran breakfast cereals was compared&#xD;
      in a human PCT, whole grain cereals proved to be more efficient prebiotics for bifidobacteria&#xD;
      whereas ingestion of both products resulted in a significant increase in ferulic acid&#xD;
      concentrations in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate intestinal fermentation of grain dietary fibre and associated&#xD;
      effects on gut-mediated metabolic health, such as immunological health and adipose tissue&#xD;
      function. Part of the population, however, suffers from discomfort of gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      after consumption of whole grain products, especially rye. The hypothesis is that whole grain&#xD;
      products maintain their original beneficial health effects and may be better tolerable when&#xD;
      the bran is technologically modified. Moreover, it is hypothesized that gut-mediated&#xD;
      bioavailability of plant cell wall compounds and their metabolites affect the metabolic&#xD;
      health through their immunomodulatory effects.&#xD;
