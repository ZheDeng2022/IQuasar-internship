  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FIL_VERT study is a phase II, open label, multicenter clinical trial. The primary of&#xD;
      objective of the Study is to evaluate the efficacy of Venetoclax ABT-199/GDC-0199) in terms&#xD;
      of overall response rate (ORR) in patients with relapsed/refractory BCL-2 positive peripheral&#xD;
      T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL)&#xD;
      and other nodal T-cell lymphomas of T-follicular helper origin (TFH)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm phase II trial, with a two-stage design, to&#xD;
      evaluate the activity and safety of ABT-199 single agent in patients with BCL-2 pos R/R&#xD;
      PTCL-NOS, AITL, TFH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-screening evaluation of immunohistochemical positivity of BCL-2 will be performed in&#xD;
      the relapse biopsy, if available, or otherwise in the initial biopsy. BCL-2 evaluation will&#xD;
      be centralized (FIL Laboratories). Only patients with a percentage of BCL-2 positive tumor&#xD;
      cells ≥ 25% will be included onto the study. Patients will receive ABT-199 until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent and/or the investigator determines&#xD;
      that further therapy is not in the patient's best interest. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is ORR which will be evaluated after 3 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABT-199 will be administered orally at the dose of 800 mg once daily. Patients will receive&#xD;
      ABT-199 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent and/or the&#xD;
      investigator determines that further therapy is not in the patient's best interest (e.g., due&#xD;
      to non-compliance, toxicity...) Response evaluation will be performed initially after 3&#xD;
      cycles from the beginning of treatment with ABT-199 (Response Assessment 1) and then every 3&#xD;
      cycles during the first 12 cycles, every 4 cycles from cycle 13 to 24; for those patients&#xD;
      still on therapy after 24 cycles, the response evaluation, after this time, will be performed&#xD;
      every 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be evaluated according to the Lugano 2014 classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLS is an important identified risk for ABT-199 in oncology studies, especially in CLL. Since&#xD;
      there are no available data on the risk of TLS in PTCL, the risk of TLS development should be&#xD;
      closely monitored during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLS prophylaxis includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ABT-199 will be administered according the following ramp up:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  week 1 day 1: 20 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  week 1 day 2-3: 50 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  week 1 day 4-7: 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  week 2: 200 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  week 3: 400 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  week 4 and following: 800 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hospitalization and monitoring of the subject should occur for a minimum of 72 hours&#xD;
           after the initial dose. Discharge of the subject is dependent upon review of chemistry&#xD;
           labs 72 hours after the first dose of ABT-199&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IV hydration (150 cc/hr, as tolerable) must be started upon admission and continued&#xD;
           during hospitalization at least for 72 hours after the initial dose of ABT-199. Urine&#xD;
           output must be monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Allopurinol 300 mg daily to be initiated 3 days before treatment and continued for up to&#xD;
           5 weeks based on the ongoing risk of TLS development. Subjects allergic to allopurinol&#xD;
           must use another anti-hypeuricemic drug. Consider use of rasburicase if subjects&#xD;
           baseline uric acid level is elevated&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The investigator decision to proceed with ABT-199 treatment initiation and subsequent&#xD;
           ramp up will be after having evaluated the normal value of the following biochemistry&#xD;
           (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium and creatinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biohemistry labs (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium and creatinine) must be performed&#xD;
      as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  week 1 (ABT-199 dose from 20 to 100 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, within 4 hours&#xD;
           from ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours after the first dose of ABT-199.&#xD;
           Day 2 dose should not be administered until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by&#xD;
           the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  week 2 (ABT-199 dose 200 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, with-in 4 hours from&#xD;
           ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24 hours after. Day 2 dose should not be administered&#xD;
           until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  week 3 (ABT-199 dose 400 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, with-in 4 hours from&#xD;
           ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24 hours after. Day 2 dose should not be administered&#xD;
           until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  week 4 (ABT-199 dose 800 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, with-in 4 hours from&#xD;
           ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24 hours after. Day 2 dose should not be administered&#xD;
           until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by the investigator Nephrology (or other&#xD;
           acute dialysis service) must be consulted/contacted on admission (per institutional&#xD;
           standards to ensure emergency dialysis is available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy interim analysis will be performed after enrollment of 18 patients. It is to be&#xD;
      planned a stop in recruitment of at least 3 months to have the results of response&#xD;
      assessment. The primary efficacy analysis will consist of an estimate of ORR on the efficacy&#xD;
      population after the first 3 cycles of therapy, with 90% confidence intervals (according to&#xD;
      1-sided alpha error of 0.05). To proceed to the second stage, the minimum number of patients&#xD;
      with an ORR is 3/18.&#xD;
