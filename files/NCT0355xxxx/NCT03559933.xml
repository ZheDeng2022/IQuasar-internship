  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the PEPNS&#xD;
      System in patients that need to be mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours and up to 7&#xD;
      days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a life saving technology but can also cause damage to the lungs and&#xD;
      diaphragm such as ventilator induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). Research has shown&#xD;
      that after being on mandatory mechanical ventilation and sedation the diaphragm begins to&#xD;
      atrophy within as little as 18 hours. The PEPNS System consists of a console and disposable&#xD;
      lead and will be used to stimulate the patient's diaphragm to contract in synchrony with the&#xD;
      inspiratory cycle of the ventilator. The proprietary phrenic nerve to diaphragm stimulation&#xD;
      (pdSTIM) Lead incorporates multipolar electrodes that align with the left and right phrenic&#xD;
      nerves in order to stimulate the nerves to the diaphragm. This feasibility trial will&#xD;
      investigate the safety and performance of the PEPNS System as a therapy by stimulating the&#xD;
      diaphragm over a 48 hour period to facilitate weaning from the mechanical ventilator. The&#xD;
      patient population includes those need to be mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours&#xD;
      and up to 7 days in the ICU.&#xD;

    <measure>Percent Capture of Left and/or Right Phrenic Nerve</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Capture of the Left and/or Right Phrenic Nerve &gt; 80% with an output parameter of &lt; 10.5 volts. Capture was defined as diaphragmatic movement as a direct consequence of electrical phrenic nerve stimulation. Capture for this analysis was defined as synchrony of the stimulated breath with the output parameter &lt;10.5 volts and Work of Breath between 0.2 and 2.0 Joules/L. Synchrony was achieved if the lag time between start of inspiration and start of stimulation was less than 88 ms. The proportion of successful capture was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model accounting for subject and stimulation within subject as random effects, and the outcome of capture was yes/no based on whether the stimulation captures the diaphragm with multiple observations per subject.</description>

        <description>Capture of the Left and/or Right Phrenic Nerve &gt; 80% with an output parameter of &lt; 10.5 volts. Capture was defined as diaphragmatic movement as a direct consequence of electrical phrenic nerve stimulation. Capture for this analysis was defined as synchrony of the stimulated breath with the output parameter &lt;10.5 volts and Work of Breath between 0.2 and 2.0 Joules/L. Synchrony was achieved if the lag time between start of inspiration and start of stimulation was less than 88 ms. The proportion of successful capture was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model accounting for subject and stimulation within subject as random effects, and the outcome of capture was yes/no based on whether the stimulation captures the diaphragm with multiple observations per subject.</description>
