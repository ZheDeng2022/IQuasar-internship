    <textblock>
      This cohort study (participants with CMT and control participants) has two parts (Part 1:&#xD;
      CMT1A cohort; Part2: CMT1B, CMT2A and CMTX1 cohort) and is proposed to take place over 3&#xD;
      years across three sites. Participants with CMT aged 5-60 for potential enrolment in the&#xD;
      trial will be identified through the existing inherited neuropathy clinics at each site and&#xD;
      control participants will be identified among the unaffected relatives and carers of the&#xD;
      participants with CMT. If they show interest in participating, they will be given the&#xD;
      relevant Patient Information Sheets, Written Consent forms and/or Assent forms. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will be recruited at the UK sites (NHNN and GOSH) and the other half at the US&#xD;
      collaborating site. Each participant will be invited to two separate research visits (12&#xD;
      months apart) for which travel expenses (return journey) will be reimbursed. Each research&#xD;
      visit is expected to last approximately 3 hours and during it, relevant detailed clinical&#xD;
      data will be collected (CMTPedS for participants with CMT aged 5-20, CMTESv2-R for&#xD;
      participants with CMT over the age of 10, CMT-HI for participants with CMT over the age of&#xD;
      16) and the participant will also undergo an MRI scan (up to 45 minutes) of the lower limbs&#xD;
      (feet and calves or calves and thighs). Two separate neuromuscular MRI protocols with&#xD;
      specific sequences will be used for the scans of foot and calf muscles and scans of calf and&#xD;
      thigh muscles. Blood samples for plasma NEFL levels will be optional at both research visits&#xD;
      for the participants at the UK trial sites; plasma NEFL levels will be processed according to&#xD;
      our previously published protocol&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study we will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of skeletal muscle to&#xD;
      better delineate the natural history of intramuscular fat accumulation in Charcot Marie Tooth&#xD;
      disease (CMT ) and investigate the use of muscle MRI and plasma neurofilament light chain&#xD;
      (NEFL) levels as outcome measures in children and adults with specific subtypes of CMT&#xD;
      (CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A and CMTX1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ascertain the value of MRI-determined fat accumulation in foot, calf and thigh&#xD;
      muscles as an independent outcome measure, by analysing its correlation with validated&#xD;
      clinical measures [CMT Paediatric Score (CMTPedS) and/or CMT Examination Score version 2 -&#xD;
      Rasch (CMTESv2-R)] and sensitivity to change over time compared to matched controls. We will&#xD;
      also ascertain the utility of plasma NEFL levels as an independent outcome measure and a&#xD;
      potential predictive biomarker of muscle fat accumulation over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this trial, easily implemented outcome measures will be immediately available for&#xD;
      clinical trials seeking to evaluate novel therapies in CMT and data from this trial will also&#xD;
      be available to establish sample size for future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study (participants with CMT and control participants) has two parts (Part 1: CMT1A&#xD;
      cohort; Part2: CMT1B, CMT2A and CMTX1 cohort) and is proposed to take place over 3 years&#xD;
      across three sites. Participants with CMT aged 5-60 for potential enrolment in the trial will&#xD;
      be identified through the existing inherited neuropathy clinics at each site and control&#xD;
      participants will be identified among the unaffected relatives and carers of the participants&#xD;
      with CMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately half of the participants will be recruited at the UK sites (NHNN and GOSH) and&#xD;
      the other half at the US collaborating centre (University of IOWA). Each research visit is&#xD;
      expected to last approximately 3 hours and during it, relevant detailed clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected (CMTPedS for participants with CMT aged 5-20, CMTESv2-R for participants with CMT&#xD;
      over the age of 10, CMT-HI for participants with CMT over the age of 16) and the participant&#xD;
      will also undergo an MRI scan (up to 45 minutes) of the lower limbs (feet and calves or&#xD;
      calves and thighs). Two separate neuromuscular MRI protocols with specific sequences will be&#xD;
      used for the scans of foot and calf muscles and scans of calf and thigh muscles. Blood&#xD;
      samples for plasma NEFL levels will be optional at both research visits for the participants&#xD;
      at the UK trial sites; plasma NEFL levels will be processed according to our previously&#xD;
      published protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to define the responsiveness of MRI-determined fat accumulation in&#xD;
      foot and calf muscles (in children/young adults aged 5-20 with CMT1A) or calf and thigh&#xD;
      muscles (in adults aged 16-60 with CMT1B, CMT2A and CMTX1) over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are a) to assess the validity of MRI-determined muscle fat&#xD;
      accumulation as a biomarker by correlating it with validated clinical scores (CMTPedS and/or&#xD;
      CMTESv2-R), b) investigate the responsiveness of plasma NEFL in patients with CMT compared to&#xD;
      matched controls over 12 months, and c) to investigate the utility of multi-level T2-weighted&#xD;
      STIR (short T1 inversion recovery) and plasma NEFL levels as potential predictive biomarkers&#xD;
      of muscle fat accumulation over the subsequent 12 months.&#xD;
