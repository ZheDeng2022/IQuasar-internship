      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate neurogenic dysphagia in Multiple Sclerosis patients&#xD;
      using dysphagia questionnaires and endoscopic study; and to correlate that to MS types,&#xD;
      severity, duration, and imaging modalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational, descriptive study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of study and disease condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egyptian patients with Clinically Definite Multiple sclerosis according to the MAGNIMS&#xD;
      consensus Guidelines and MCdonald's criteria 2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients will be all Multiple Sclerosis patients attending Neurology Outpatient&#xD;
      Clinic &amp; Neurology Department at Kasr Alainy Hospital within a definite time interval&#xD;
      (January 2018- June 2018) with an estimate of 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written consent, approved by the ethical committee of Neurology Department, faculty of&#xD;
      medicine, Cairo University will be obtained for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will be submitted to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Through history taking and meticulous neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical &amp; assessment scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Expanded Disability status scale (EDSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 10-item Dysphagia in Multiple Sclerosis questionnaire (DYMUS): Ten-item&#xD;
                questionnaire for assessment of dysphagia in multiple sclerosis. The questionnaire&#xD;
                can be divided into two subscales; for the assessment of dysphagia for solids (7&#xD;
                items, in bold), and for the assessment of dysphagia for liquids (3 items, in&#xD;
                italics). Instructions for the patient: This questionnaire is about your ability to&#xD;
                swallow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Dysphagia handicap index (DHI): new, easy-to-complete, statistically robust,&#xD;
                patient-reported outcomes measure for assessing the handicapping effect of&#xD;
                dysphagia. These statements were 60 in number and were sorted into three subscales&#xD;
                based on their content. The emotional subscale consisted of 16 statements&#xD;
                representing a person's affective response to their dysphagia. There were 27&#xD;
                statements representing a person's self-perception of physical discomfort due to&#xD;
                dysphagia. There were 27 statements representing a person's self-perception of&#xD;
                physical discomfort due to dysphagia. In order to evaluate an overall picture of&#xD;
                the patient's perception of their dysphagia, all subscales were combined to provide&#xD;
                an overall total DHI score. At the completion of the test, subjects were asked to&#xD;
                self-rate the severity of their dysphagia on a 7-point equal appearing interval&#xD;
                scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES): will be performed to MS patients&#xD;
           with dysphagia as detected by dysphagia questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neuro-imaging: Magnetic Resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord with contrast&#xD;
           were performed for patients on a 1.5 Tesla Phillips InteraÂ® Scanner at the Magnetic&#xD;
           Resonance unit, Department of Radio-diagnosis, Cairo University. The following protocols&#xD;
           were used:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T1-weighted images (axial &amp; sagittal)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T2-weighted images (axial &amp; coronal)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation of endoscopy result with type of MS (whether RRMS or progressive form), severity&#xD;
      of disease (as assessed by EDSS), duration of disease (number of years since first symptom),&#xD;
      and lesion load (assessed by MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncommon complications of FEES as epistaxis and vasovagal attack (very rare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To screen the prevalence of neurogenic dysphagia in Egyptian MS patients attending Neurology&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic &amp; Neurology Department at Kasr Alainy Hospital within a definite time&#xD;
      interval( January 2018 - June 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome parameters (other outcomes to be assessed) To depict neurogenic dysphagia&#xD;
      in MS and assessment of its efficiency as a biomarker for disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be evaluated statistically by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences &quot;SPSS&quot;&#xD;
      version 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be summarized using mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables and&#xD;
      percent for qualitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between groups will be done using chi square test for quantitative variables &amp;&#xD;
      ANOVA (analysis of variance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple comparisons will be done using post Hoc test for normally distributed quantitative&#xD;
      variables and parametrical. Mann-Whitney test for not normally distributed quantitative&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
