  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-stage qualitative and quantitative study to provide insight into consumers' awareness&#xD;
      of energy in alcoholic beverages, and how energy labelling effects consumer behaviour.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In 2016/2017, one in five (19.5%) New Zealand adults (≥15 years and older) had an&#xD;
      alcohol drinking pattern that carriers a risk of harming the drinker or another, and one in&#xD;
      three (32.9%) young adults aged 18 to 24 years are hazardous drinkers. To reduce&#xD;
      alcohol-related harm and help New Zealanders make positive decisions about their alcohol use,&#xD;
      strategies are needed that not only inform them about health risks but also alter the&#xD;
      environment they find themselves in on a daily basis. Unlike most packaged food products,&#xD;
      alcoholic beverages are not required to present a statement of the composition of the&#xD;
      product, such as amount of alcohol, energy or the nutrient content. It has been suggested&#xD;
      that in the absence of this information, consumers of alcohol have no idea how much energy,&#xD;
      alcohol or kilojoules they are consuming. Research indicates that nutrition labelling of food&#xD;
      and non-alcoholic beverage products does impact consumer perceptions and product evaluations.&#xD;
      A recent poll by Stuff showed that 83% of 3,300 New Zealanders indicated that they want to&#xD;
      know what they are consuming and supported placement of ingredients and nutritional&#xD;
      information on alcohol products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To provide insight into consumers' awareness of energy in alcoholic beverages,&#xD;
      and in their views on energy labelling of alcoholic beverages. The project also aims to&#xD;
      explore the effects of different types of energy labelling on consumers alcohol purchase&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Two-staged qualitative and quantitative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative stage: Focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative stage: Four-arm randomised controlled trial. This qualitative stage aims to&#xD;
           test the effects of three different types of alcohol energy labels on alcoholic&#xD;
           beverages on (online) purchase behaviour, compared to a control (no label) condition,&#xD;
           using an 'online shopping cart'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Qualitative stage: n=36 (six focus groups with six people per group);&#xD;
      Quantitative stage: n=600 (n=150 participants per experimental condition).&#xD;
