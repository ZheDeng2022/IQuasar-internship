      The investigators plan on using riboflavin (a Vitamin that can easily be taken orally each&#xD;
      day) and having the children involved in the study play outside (where there is UV light&#xD;
      created by the sun) in order to prevent the eye from becoming progressively more&#xD;
      near-sighted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is equivalent to the colloquial term known as near-sightedness. This, in short, means&#xD;
      that the image of one's environment is projected in front of the retina (rather than directly&#xD;
      on the retina, which is ideal). Of course, glasses can be used to correct the image disparity&#xD;
      that is created by being near-sighted (that is why a lot of people need glasses for blurry&#xD;
      vision). However, glasses and spectacles and contacts do not correct the underlying problem.&#xD;
      Most near-sightedness is due to the eye being &quot;too long&quot; and therefore the image projects in&#xD;
      front of the retina. Ideally, if we could prevent the eye from becoming abnormally &quot;long&quot;,&#xD;
      then we could prevent the progression of near-sightedness. Indeed, a child may only be&#xD;
      slightly near-sighted early in life, but as he/she continues to perform activities within an&#xD;
      arms length of their environment, they can become progressively near-sighted. Besides&#xD;
      spectacle correction, people have tried topical atropine drops (medicated eye drops) and&#xD;
      rigid contact lenses (orthokeratology) to attempt to correct near-sightedness. Atropine drops&#xD;
      take a lot of cooperation from parent and child. Orthokeratology also requires a lot of&#xD;
      cooperation, but also, does not permanently stall myopic progression. The investigators&#xD;
      suggest a different means of potentially preventing near-sightedness from getting worse (and&#xD;
      thus prevent the eye from getting &quot;too long&quot;). The investigators plan on using riboflavin (a&#xD;
      Vitamin that can easily be taken orally each day) and having the children involved in the&#xD;
      study play outside (where there is UV light created by the sun) in order to prevent the eye&#xD;
      from becoming progressively more near-sighted.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 1:1:1 double-blinded randomized study for children ages 6-12 year old with axial myopia who will be treated with one of three different doses of oral riboflavin. Expected number of participants is 100.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>The researchers involved, the project investigator, and the patients will be blinded from knowing which patient will get which treatment by assigning a number to each patient and having that patient take that number to the pharmacy where they will pick up their riboflavin. The dosage of riboflavin given to the patient will be chosen by the &quot;number&quot; that the patient gives to the pharmacy. There will be no labels revealing the dose of riboflavin that the patient receives. There will be placebo dose which contains a small dose of riboflavin that has been shown to not reach therapeutic levels.</masking_description>
