      Objectives: Primary Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics of two&#xD;
      isosorbide -5 -mononitrate extended -release tablets 40 mg of Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd,&#xD;
      China and ISMO Retard (isosorbide -5 -mononitrate extended -release tablet) 40 mg,&#xD;
      distributed by RIEMSER Pharma GmbH. following a single oral dose administration in healthy&#xD;
      Chinese subjects under fed condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To monitor the safety profile of the subjects exposed to the&#xD;
      Investigational Medicinal Product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: a randomized, open label, balanced, 3-way crossover, single dose study under&#xD;
      fed conditions.12 subjects will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment sequences. Each&#xD;
      treatment sequence will consist of 3 periods, separated by a washout period of at least 7&#xD;
      days. For sequence 1, first reference drug, then test formulation 1 and test formulation 2&#xD;
      will be administered. The order for sequence 2 is test formulation 2, reference drug and test&#xD;
      formulation 1. The order for sequence 3 is test formulation 1, test formulation 2 and&#xD;
      reference drug.&#xD;
