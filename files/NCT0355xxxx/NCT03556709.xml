      The purpose of this research study is to test the utility of an ankle robot, when used during&#xD;
      treadmill walking, in people with ankle weakness and foot drop from a peripheral nervous&#xD;
      system injury due to neuromuscular or orthopedic injury.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with central nervous system (CNS) injuries (e.g., a stroke) or peripheral&#xD;
      nervous system (PNS) injuries (e.g., peroneal nerve injury, neuropathy, radiculopathy, and/or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury) that affect their ankle movement have residual impairments that&#xD;
      affect their walking and balance. These impairments include the disability &quot;foot drop,&quot; which&#xD;
      increases the risk for falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on PNS injuries that cause foot drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapy to address foot drop is limited primarily to the use of ankle foot orthoses&#xD;
      (braces) that help keep the foot from hitting the ground to prevent falling. Also, some&#xD;
      individuals with foot drop use functional electrical stimulation to the leg nerve to lift the&#xD;
      foot. Regardless, none of these, or other existing, methods to address foot drop cures or&#xD;
      even improves significantly the underlying neurological deficit behind this disability.&#xD;
      Braces improve walking safety only while they are worn, and functional electrical stimulation&#xD;
      does not work when it is turned off, or when the nerve has been severely damaged. Thus, the&#xD;
      increased fall risk due to foot drop is generally considered life-long and incurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a shoe-interfaced ankle robot with an adaptive control&#xD;
      system, to assist an individual with ankle movement only as needed. Data from the&#xD;
      investigators' previous studies on foot drop due to stroke show great promise for this ankle&#xD;
      robot as a new rehabilitation tool for invididuals with foot drop, when used during treadmill&#xD;
      walking. The investigators would like to utilize our findings from these stroke studies in&#xD;
      learning how they can be used for PNS-related foot drop.&#xD;
