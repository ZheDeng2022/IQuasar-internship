  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, single-center, 3-part, FIH study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK, or how the drug behaves in the body), and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD, or what the drug does to the body) of single and multiple doses of&#xD;
      CC-99677 and to characterize the effect of food on the single-dose PK of CC-99677 in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human (FIH) study aims to identify a safe and tolerable dose of CC 99677 in&#xD;
      support of phase 2 and/or phase 3 studies to be conducted in subjects with underlying&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to evaluate the PK of CC-99677 following administration of single and&#xD;
      multiple oral doses, including assessment of the effect of food on the single dose PK of CC&#xD;
      99677, and to assess the effect of CC 99677 on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects. The pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacogenomics (PG) of CC 99677 will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts 1 and 2 are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single and&#xD;
      multiple ascending doses of CC 99677, respectively. The study has been designed to allow for&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK data to be gathered in a stepwise fashion. Part 1 will consist&#xD;
      of escalating single doses in sequential groups. Approximately 48 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      into 6 planned dose level cohorts. Part 2 will consist of escalating multiple doses&#xD;
      (administered for 14 days) in sequential groups. In Part 2, approximately 40 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled into 5 proposed dose level cohorts. Each dose level cohort will consist of 8&#xD;
      subjects; 6 subjects will receive CC-99677 and 2 subjects will receive placebo according to&#xD;
      the randomization schedule. In both Part 1 and Part 2, a higher daily dose level will not be&#xD;
      initiated until adequate information on the preceding dose level is available and reviewed.&#xD;
      Parts 1 and 2 will also employ strict dose escalation, individual subject, and intra cohort&#xD;
      stopping criteria. Parts 1 and 2 will be placebo controlled to appropriately characterize the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of CC 99677.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 is designed to characterize the effect of food on the single dose PK of CC 99677.&#xD;

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form&#xD;
             (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related&#xD;
             assessments/procedures being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is in good health, as determined by the Investigator based on a physical&#xD;
             examination at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to the&#xD;
                  first dose of IP. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course&#xD;
                  of the study, and prior to discharge from the study site. This applies even if&#xD;
                  the FCBP subject practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to&#xD;
                  use, and be able to comply with, one highly effective method and one effective&#xD;
                  barrier method of contraception without interruption, during the study (including&#xD;
                  any dose interruptions), and for at least 30 days after discontinuation of IP.&#xD;
                  The female subject's chosen form of highly effective contraception must be&#xD;
                  effective by the time the female subject is enrolled into the study (eg, hormonal&#xD;
                  contraception should be initiated at least 28 days prior to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects NOT of childbearing potential must:&#xD;

             documentation is required) at least 6 months before screening, or be postmenopausal&#xD;
             (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before screening, with a&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable,&#xD;
             and source documented) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant&#xD;
             female or a FCBP while participating in the study, during any dose interruptions, and&#xD;
             for at least 90 days after discontinuation of IP, even if he has undergone a&#xD;
             successful vasectomy. In addition, any non-pregnant FCBP partner of a male subject&#xD;
             must use an approved method of effective contraception, without interruption, during&#xD;
             the study (including any dose interruptions) and for at least 30 days after&#xD;
             discontinuation of IP. Examples of approved methods of effective contraception for&#xD;
             non-pregnant FCBP partners include progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception; male&#xD;
             or female condom with or without spermicide; or cap, diaphragm, or sponge with&#xD;
             spermicide.&#xD;

             screening and on Day -1 (of Period 1, when applicable [ie, in Part 3]).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject is afebrile, with supine systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 140 mmHG,&#xD;
             supine diastolic BP ≥ 50 and ≤ 90 mmHg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 110 bpm at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG. In addition:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  If male, subject has a QTcF value ≤ 430 msec at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has any significant medical condition (including but not limited to&#xD;
             neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological,&#xD;
             pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or&#xD;
             other major disorders), laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would&#xD;
             prevent the subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which&#xD;
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days&#xD;
             preceding the first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug,&#xD;
             if known (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not&#xD;
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exceptions may apply on a case-by-case basis if considered not to interfere with the&#xD;
             study objectives as agreed to by the Investigator and Sponsor's Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including&#xD;
             vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose administration. Exceptions may apply on a case-by-case basis if considered not to&#xD;
