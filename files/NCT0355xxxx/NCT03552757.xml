  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the change in the participant's body weight from the start to the end&#xD;
      of the study. This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a&#xD;
      new medicine) and people taking &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. In addition to taking the study medicine,&#xD;
      the participant will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more&#xD;
      physically active and what else the participant can do to lose weight. Overweight and obesity&#xD;
      is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, weight loss has shown to&#xD;
      have a beneficial impact on the blood sugar levels. The participant will either get&#xD;
      semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine - which treatment the participant get is decided by chance.&#xD;
      The participant will need to take 2 injections at the same time once a week. The study&#xD;
      medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm.&#xD;
      The study will last for about 1.5 years&#xD;

    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured 8 domains of functional health and well-being as well as 2 component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). This endpoint shows results for 'physical functioning domain'. The 0-100 scale scores from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively. Change from week 0 in the domain scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from in-trial observation period.</description>

    <measure>Participants Who Achieve (Yes/no): Responder Definition Value for SF-36 Physical Functioning Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 68</time_frame>
    <description>The observed number of participants experiencing a meaningful within participant improvement in SF-36 Physical function after 68 weeks was determined based on two thresholds. The threshold of 4.3 is the default generic responder threshold defined in SF-36 manual for a general population. The threshold of 3.7 is specific for overweight or obese population included in the study and calculated using patient global rating anchor questionnaires to reflect participants' own perspective based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations. In the reported data, &quot;Yes&quot; infers the number of participants who have achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold and &quot;No&quot; infers number of participants who have not achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold. Endpoint was evaluated based on in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from randomization (week 0) to last trial related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

        <description>Number of participants who achieved weight reduction ≥5% of their baseline body weight (yes/no) at week 68 is presented. Results are based on the data from both in-trial and on-treatment observation periods. In-trial observation period: the uninterrupted time interval from the start of randomisation (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact. On-treatment observation period: the interval from the date of first trial product administration (week 0) to the date of last trial product administration (week 68) plus a 2 week follow-up period and excluding any off-treatment time intervals. Off-treatment time interval: time period with at least two consecutive missed doses.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form 36 v2.0 Acute (SF-36) (Physical Functioning Score)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured 8 domains of functional health and well-being as well as 2 component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). This endpoint shows results for 'physical functioning domain'. The 0-100 scale scores from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively. Change from week 0 in the domain scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from in-trial observation period.</description>

          <title>Change in Short Form 36 v2.0 Acute (SF-36) (Physical Functioning Score)</title>
          <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured 8 domains of functional health and well-being as well as 2 component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). This endpoint shows results for 'physical functioning domain'. The 0-100 scale scores from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively. Change from week 0 in the domain scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from in-trial observation period.</description>

        <description>The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT) is designed to assess the impact of changes in weight on patients' quality of life within the context of clinical trials. IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 20-item questionnaire-based instrument used to assess the impact of body weight changes on participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). All IWQOL-Lite-CT composite scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better levels of functioning. This endpoint shows results for 'physical function domain'. Results are based on the data from in-trial observation period which was defined as the uninterrupted time interval from the start of randomisation (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact.</description>

          <title>Change in IWQOL-Lite for CT (All Scores Except Physical Function)</title>
          <description>The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT) is designed to assess the impact of changes in weight on patients' quality of life within the context of clinical trials. IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 20-item questionnaire-based instrument used to assess the impact of body weight changes on participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). All IWQOL-Lite-CT composite scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better levels of functioning. This endpoint shows results for 'physical and psychosocial domains, and for total'. Results are based on the data from in-trial observation period which was defined as the uninterrupted time interval from the start of randomisation (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact.</description>

        <title>Participants Who Achieve (Yes/no): Responder Definition Value for SF-36 Physical Functioning Score</title>
        <description>The observed number of participants experiencing a meaningful within participant improvement in SF-36 Physical function after 68 weeks was determined based on two thresholds. The threshold of 4.3 is the default generic responder threshold defined in SF-36 manual for a general population. The threshold of 3.7 is specific for overweight or obese population included in the study and calculated using patient global rating anchor questionnaires to reflect participants' own perspective based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations. In the reported data, &quot;Yes&quot; infers the number of participants who have achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold and &quot;No&quot; infers number of participants who have not achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold. Endpoint was evaluated based on in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from randomization (week 0) to last trial related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

        <description>Hypoglycaemic episodes with onset during the on-treatment observation period were considered treatment-emergent. On-treatment observation period was defined as the interval from the date of first trial product administration (week 0) to the date of last trial product administration (week 68) plus a 7 week follow-up period and excluding any off-treatment time intervals. Off-treatment time interval: time period with at least 7 consecutive missed doses. Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or take other corrective actions. plasma glucose (PG) concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of PG to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration. Blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that is BG confirmed by PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

Results are based on the data from on-treatment observation period, which was defined as the interval from the date of first trial product administration (week 0) to the date of last trial product administration (week 68) plus a 2 week follow-up period and excluding any off-treatment time intervals. Off-treatment time interval: time period with at least two consecutive missed doses.</description>
