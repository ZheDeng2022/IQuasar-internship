      This project will investigate the duration of apnea without desaturation when using&#xD;
      transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) vs. low flow nasal&#xD;
      oxygen at anesthesia induction in obese patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Providing safe anesthesia for surgery in obese patients requires specific&#xD;
      consideration of the pathophysiological changes and respiratory complications are frequent.&#xD;
      Anesthesia induction needs special attention in this patient population. A decrease in&#xD;
      functional residual capacity (FRC) after induction of anesthesia dramatically shortens the&#xD;
      duration of apnea without desaturation (DAWD) during which the airway can be secured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measures such as positioning in a semi sitting position, preoxygenation with PEEP and&#xD;
      passive insufflation of oxygen during laryngoscopy have been shown to prolong the DAWD. None&#xD;
      of these measures is able to produce positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) during&#xD;
      laryngoscopy which would counteract the loss of FRC and therefore prolong the DAWD further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilator exchange (THRIVE, also knowns as &quot;high&#xD;
      flow nasal oxygen therapy&quot; and &quot;heated and humidified nasal oxygen&quot;) devices have been used&#xD;
      for several years in intensive care and are available from numerous vendors. With THRIVE,&#xD;
      heated and humidified oxygen is insufflated via nasal prongs at a rate up to 120 l/minute and&#xD;
      it has been shown that this creates levels of PEEP, proportional to the amount of gas flow.&#xD;
      Using THRIVE during the apneic phase of anesthesia induction in obese patients might be&#xD;
      superior compared to low flow oxygen techniques as THRIVE generates PEEP during laryngoscopy,&#xD;
      which might counteract the loss of FRC and consequently might prolong the DAWD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the project This project will investigate the DAWD when using THRIVE vs. low flow&#xD;
      nasal oxygen at anesthesia induction in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The duration of apnea without desaturation is longer in the &quot;THRIVE&quot; group&#xD;
      compared to the &quot;low flow oxygen&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study will be conducted as a single center, prospective, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty adult patients of the ASA classification 2 and 3 with a BMI &gt;40 undergoing elective&#xD;
      surgery under general anesthesia will be included. Patients with expected difficult airway,&#xD;
      patients with an oxygen saturation &lt;98% despite preoxygenation, patients with nasal&#xD;
      obstruction, smokers (&gt;10 cigarettes/day), patients with chronic respiratory disease,&#xD;
      patients unable to give consent, and pregnant or breastfeeding patients will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (&quot;low flow oxygen&quot; or &quot;THRIVE&quot; group)&#xD;
      and anesthesia will be induced in a standardized fashion in both groups. During laryngoscopy,&#xD;
      patients in the low flow group will receive nasal oxygen insufflation at a rate of 10 l/min&#xD;
      and patients in the THRIVE group will receive oxygen at a rate of 120 l/min via a THRIVE&#xD;
      system. Difficult laryngoscopy will be simulated and intubation will be performed as soon as&#xD;
      oxygen saturation drops to 95%. The time from anesthesia induction until oxygen saturation&#xD;
      drops to 95% (DAWD) will be measured.&#xD;
