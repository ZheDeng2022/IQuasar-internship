  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      My study will employ a convergent mixed methods two-arm parallel randomized controlled&#xD;
      design. The qualitative strand will primarily rely on semi-structured interview procedures to&#xD;
      answer the following questions: (1) How do adolescents perceive and experience the phenomenon&#xD;
      of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI)? (2) What do adolescents believe needs to be done to&#xD;
      address NSSI? The quantitative strand will primarily rely on clinical interview data,&#xD;
      self-report measures, and an experimental task protocol to answer the following question:&#xD;
      What is the impact of a brief mindfulness induction (versus a control condition) on&#xD;
      self-injury attentional bias among self-injuring adolescents?&#xD;
