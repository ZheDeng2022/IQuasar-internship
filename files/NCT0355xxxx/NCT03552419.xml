      Investigators propose a four-category triaging system to delineate and facilitate the&#xD;
      communication and action plan for all types of obstetric OR cases via a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach. Investigators omitted ambiguous terms and developed an algorithm to categorize&#xD;
      patients according to acuity and risk. Investigators' quality improvement intervention allows&#xD;
      for rapidly changing circumstances and accounts for both obstetric and anesthetic&#xD;
      considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several metrics will be collected to evaluate this multidisciplinary quality improvement&#xD;
      project, including maternal demographics, labor characteristics, and indication for surgical&#xD;
      intervention. Additional data include level assigned, time of patient arrival in OR, type of&#xD;
      surgery performed, and anesthetic delivered. Investigators will collect fetal delivery data,&#xD;
      including Apgar scores and umbilical cord gases, as well as maternal delivery data, including&#xD;
      estimated blood loss, time to uterine incision and delivery, and surgical complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At investigators' institution, a triage (or leveling) system for emergency surgeries in the&#xD;
      general operating rooms (OR) exists with the goal of optimizing patient care and reducing&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. In the obstetric field, while medical terminology exists for these&#xD;
      situations to delineate and convey the urgency of a particular peripartum situation, for&#xD;
      example &quot;stat, emergent, or urgent,&quot; it is generally acknowledged that this terminology is&#xD;
      not universal and is somewhat ambiguous, causing confusion and unnecessary delays in patient&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a quality improvement project which will delineate terminology for&#xD;
      obstetrical triaging to the OR and discuss metrics for evaluation of this quality improvement&#xD;
      intervention. Investigators developed a multidisciplinary stratification system at&#xD;
      investigators' institution to triage obstetric patients into a four-level system with clear&#xD;
      guidelines for all OR cases. Investigators' categorization system accounted for maternal and&#xD;
      fetal stability, indication for surgical intervention, role for obtaining additional studies,&#xD;
      nil per os (NPO) status, and surgical and anesthetic concerns. Within each of the four&#xD;
      classifications, investigators defined the expectations for each team member's role,&#xD;
      including the obstetrician, anesthesiologist, charge nurse, nursing staff, neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care unit (NICU) team, and the surgical and clinical technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several metrics will be collected to evaluate this multidisciplinary quality improvement&#xD;
      project, including maternal demographics, labor characteristics, and indication for surgical&#xD;
      intervention. Additional data include level assigned, time of patient arrival in OR, type of&#xD;
      surgery performed, and anesthetic delivered. Investigators will collect fetal delivery data,&#xD;
      including Apgar scores and umbilical cord gases, as well as maternal delivery data, including&#xD;
      estimated blood loss, time to uterine incision and delivery, and surgical complications.&#xD;

        In obstetrics, triage assessment incorporates both maternal and fetal considerations.&#xD;
        Priority is given to situations with obvious threat to life to the mother or to the fetus.&#xD;
        While medical terminology exists for these situations to delineate and convey the urgency&#xD;
        of a particular peripartum situation, for example &quot;stat, emergent, or urgent,&quot; it is&#xD;
        generally acknowledged that this terminology is not universal and is somewhat ambiguous,&#xD;
        causing confusion and unnecessary delays in patient care. Furthermore, simply classifying&#xD;
        the need for cesarean into a single &quot;emergency&quot; category is insufficient as varying levels&#xD;
        of &quot;emergencies&quot; exist. In the modern-day era, the obstetrical decision for surgical&#xD;
        intervention prompts the mobilization of a team of providers, including the obstetrician,&#xD;
        anesthesiologist, nursing and surgical technicians, and supporting OR staff. Thus,&#xD;
        effective communication among team members is essential.&#xD;
