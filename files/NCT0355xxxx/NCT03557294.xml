  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed research is to test whether varenicline (Chantix) is safe&#xD;
      and effective as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the recent research on varenicline showing that it is more effective than nicotine&#xD;
      patch and bupropion, and with the removal of the box warning, research is needed to assess&#xD;
      whether smokers can use varenicline without a prescription and formal behavioral support. To&#xD;
      test this, the primary goal of the proposed research is to test whether varenicline is a&#xD;
      candidate for switching from prescription (Rx) to OTC, and whether a dose lower than that&#xD;
      currently approved is as effective in an OTC environment. To understand the within-person&#xD;
      mechanisms explaining how and when OTC varenicline might improve cessation outcomes, the&#xD;
      investigators also propose to assess experience with OTC varenicline via (a) ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety and effectiveness of the current FDA-approved 1 mg b.i.d.&#xD;
           varenicline for smoking cessation in comparison with placebo when used in a simulated&#xD;
           OTC study condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety and effectiveness of .5mg b.i.d. varenicline in comparison with 1mg&#xD;
           b.i.d. varenicline and placebo when used in a simulated OTC study condition.&#xD;
