  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa or Verneuil's disease (HS) is a neglected and often overlooked&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory skin disease. Nevertheless, it is frequent (1% of the general&#xD;
      population) and deeply affects quality of life in patients with moderate and severe forms of&#xD;
      HS. This disease is characterized by the occurrence of deep, recurrent and painful nodules,&#xD;
      progressing to abscess formation and suppuration. It is usually localized in the axillary,&#xD;
      inguinal and anogenital areas. The pathogenesis of HS remains partly unknown but is probably&#xD;
      multifactorial (inflammatory, genetic, infectious, etc.) and related to many risk factors&#xD;
      (mostly smoking and obesity). An association can be found with other inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      such as gastrointestinal and rheumatic diseases like Crohn's disease and spondylo-arthritis&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal diseases are a heterogeneous group of infectious diseases with an inflammatory&#xD;
      component. Their clinical expression results in more or less rapid destruction of tooth&#xD;
      supporting tissues. Without treatment, these lesions may progress ultimately to tooth&#xD;
      exfoliation, the rate of disease progression being unevenly distributed in the population.&#xD;
      Various epidemiological studies in France indicate that 12 to 13% of middle-aged adults have&#xD;
      severe periodontal damage. In addition, a recent study shows that while 50% of adults in&#xD;
      France are suffering from severe attachment loss, generalized forms are rare and about 10% of&#xD;
      individuals seem to require special care. The bacterial factor is the main etiological factor&#xD;
      of these diseases but their progression depends primarily on the host immune response and on&#xD;
      modifying factors (genetic, systemic, environmental and behavioural). Some of these factors&#xD;
      are identified such as uncontrolled diabetes, smoking, stress, etc.. Finally, it is well&#xD;
      established that periodontal disease may also trigger the development of some systemic&#xD;
      diseases such as diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, many common etiopathogenic factors between HS and periodontal diseases such as&#xD;
      inflammatory components and tobacco are found. This is corroborated by observations collected&#xD;
      from some patients with HS complaining of oral pain exacerbated during acute flares of HS.&#xD;
      Hence the aim of this project is to clarify existing potential association between&#xD;
      Hidradenitis suppurativa and periodontal diseases using a multicenter cross-sectional&#xD;
      descriptive clinical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients with HS will be included in the departments of dermatology at the&#xD;
      University Hospital in Reims and at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. They will be compared&#xD;
      with one hundred patients without HS recruited from &quot;general practice&quot; consultations in the&#xD;
      departments of Odontology at the University Hospital in Reims and at Bretonneau Hospital in&#xD;
      Paris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of HS will be assessed with Hurley's score by the dermatologist. The periodontal&#xD;
      status will be evaluated with clinical indices and radiographical parameters by a&#xD;
      periodontist according to the &quot;Armitage&quot; classification of periodontal disease and to CDC-AA&#xD;
      case definitions updated in 2012. Meanwhile, human saliva is a biological fluid taken to&#xD;
      reflect the health status of an individual and is or may be used for diagnosis and prognosis&#xD;
      of some oral cancers, some systemic diseases (type 2 diabetes, sarcoidosis, etc.) or&#xD;
      periodontal diseases. The saliva will be collected and analysed by proteomics and&#xD;
      metabolomics techniques in order to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and prognostic of HS&#xD;
      associated or not to periodontal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These unpublished works could demonstrate a predisposition to develop periodontal disease in&#xD;
      a subgroup of HS patients and help to unravel new etiopathogenic mechanisms common to both&#xD;
      diseases as well as ultimately lead to early periodontal management in order to avoid disease&#xD;
      progression and tooth losses.&#xD;

      The principal hypothesis of this project is the existence of an association between&#xD;
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and periodontal diseases (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate this association using a multicenter cross-sectional&#xD;
      clinical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the association between the severity of PD and the severity of HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To search, using saliva collected from a population with clinical signs of HS and from&#xD;
           no HS population, proteomic and metabolomic biosignatures by liquid chromatography&#xD;
           tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), by vibrational spectroscopies and by 1H-NMR&#xD;
           spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare vibrational biosignatures from saliva from patients with and without HS and /&#xD;
           or MP to determine a unique salivary spectral profile of HS patients with and without&#xD;
           PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the relevance of vibrational spectroscopy versus that of LC-MS and LC-MS / MS&#xD;
           and 1H-NMR in the analysis of salivary markers identified from an overall non-targeted&#xD;
           spectroscopy profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyse and to compare proteomic and metabolomic biosignatures of unstimulated saliva&#xD;
           samples depending on the severity of HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be included patients with HS (regardless of Hurley score) followed in the dermatology&#xD;
      department of Reims University Hospital or the Institut Pasteur in Paris, and patients&#xD;
      without HS from the service Odontology of the University Hospital of Reims or the Bretonneau&#xD;
      Hospital (Paris) (whatever the reason for consultation), even also from the dermatology&#xD;
      departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients with HS will be included. At the same time, 100 patients without HS will&#xD;
      be also included. Subjects without HS will be matched to subjects with HS on age (± 5 years).&#xD;
      Given the percentage of non-HS patients for whom periodontal disease will be diagnosed&#xD;
      (approximately 40%), this included number of patients will demonstrate an odds ratio of 2.6&#xD;
      (ie a percentage of patients with periodontal disease of 63% in the group with HS) with an α&#xD;
      risk of 5% and a power of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the presence of periodontal disease in both patients with HS and&#xD;
      without HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic of periodontal disease will be posed in consultation by a periodontist and will be&#xD;
      determined by clinical and radiographic assessments including in this research context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Gingival bleeding (Bleeding on Probing, BOP) ii. Depth of periodontal pockets using a&#xD;
      calibrated periodontal probe iii. Clinical attachment loss iiii. Interproximal bone loss.&#xD;
      Bone loss will be taken in consideration when the distance between the alveolar ridge and the&#xD;
      cement-enamel junction will be ≥ 2mm. A digital orthopantomogram will be performed with or&#xD;
      without six retroalveolar X-rays of Ramfjord teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the bacterial etiology of periodontal diseases, it is important to note the&#xD;
      amount of dental plaque directly in relation with the oral hygiene level performed with the&#xD;
      dichotomous index &quot;Plaque Control Record&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these indexes will be assessed at six sites per tooth corresponding to a maximum of 168&#xD;
      values per patient. The third molar was excluded from analysis. The reliability of clinical&#xD;
      measurements intra and inter- periodontists was verified. In retrospect, the causes of tooth&#xD;
      loss will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical diagnosis of HS will be based on the presence of recurrent abscesses in the&#xD;
      folds, which can be multi-site, with residual scars according to the diagnosis criteria of&#xD;
      European guidelines published in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The severity of HS will be based on the score of Hurley.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The extent and severity of PD, their progression will be posed according to the&#xD;
           &quot;consensus&quot; classification of periodontal diseases (Armitage et al., 1999).&#xD;
           Periodontitis cases were defined according to CDC-AAP case definitions updated in 2012&#xD;
           (Eke et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semi-quantification and characterization of spectral biosignatures will be performed on&#xD;
           saliva samples from patients with HS and non-HS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, at least 5mL of unstimulated saliva will be collected from HS or non-HS patients. The&#xD;
      pH will be measured. They will be frozen at -80°C before analysis by liquid chromatography&#xD;
      tandem-mass spectrometry and vibrational spectroscopies and, at -20°C by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.&#xD;
