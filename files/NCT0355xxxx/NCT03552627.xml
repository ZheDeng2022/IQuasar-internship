  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organisation recommends that all patients having a general anaesthetic for&#xD;
      surgery should be given 80% oxygen as this might reduce their risk of getting an infection&#xD;
      after their operation. However there remains a lot of uncertainty about how much oxygen&#xD;
      patients should be given whilst undergoing surgery. In other areas of medicine evidence is&#xD;
      slowly emerging to suggest that giving less oxygen may be as safe or even safer than giving&#xD;
      high amounts of oxygen (e.g. after a heart attack, patients unnecessarily given oxygen seem&#xD;
      to do worse than those given air). The amount of oxygen currently given to patients having&#xD;
      surgery varies widely; in a recent study of almost 400 procedures across 29 hospitals, we&#xD;
      found values ranged from below 30% to almost 100% oxygen. The aim of this research is to&#xD;
      explore if giving less oxygen will generate less strain on parts of the body, particularly&#xD;
      the lungs as they are always exposed to all of the oxygen that enters the body. Participants&#xD;
      undergoing major elective surgical procedures will be randomised to receive either 80%, 55%&#xD;
      or 30% throughout their general anaesthetic and levels of inflammation, oxidative stress and&#xD;
      perioperative recovery will all be measured for upto 7 days after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 3 million patients receive oxygen (O2) during general anaesthesia (GA) in the UK&#xD;
      annually, and a large number of these also have co-morbid respiratory diseases such as Asthma&#xD;
      or COPD. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently recommended that all surgical patients&#xD;
      receive 80% O2 throughout GA and for 6 hours in recovery to reduce Surgical Site Infections&#xD;
      (SSIs). However, a recent Cochrane systematic review found no evidence of benefit from this&#xD;
      approach and some evidence that harm could be increased (including mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excess oxygen has been associated with worse outcomes in many areas of medicine (including&#xD;
      acute respiratory illnesses), possibly due to increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#xD;
      production: ROS can cause oxidative stress and damage proteins, DNA, and lipids.&#xD;
      Observational data from our group shows most surgical patients currently receive nearer 55%&#xD;
      O2 under GA. The effect of intraoperative O2 concentration on other surgical outcomes remains&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will determine whether giving lower concentrations of oxygen to surgical&#xD;
      patients during anaesthesia can reduce levels of oxidative stress during surgery&#xD;
      (particularly in the lungs); investigate how this affects other organs; and evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of performing a large (multi-centre) effectiveness study to define 'safe' oxygen&#xD;
      administration concentrations during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient undergoing elective major surgery will be randomised to receive 80% (WHO's&#xD;
      recommendation); 55% (current usual care) or 30% oxygen (intervention) throughout&#xD;
      anaesthesia. Endotracheal aspirates will be sampled along with paired central venous and&#xD;
      arterial blood samples throughout surgery to monitor levels of oxidative stress and organ&#xD;
      function. Patients will be followed up for 7 days after surgery.&#xD;
