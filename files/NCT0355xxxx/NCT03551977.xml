  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Research evidence shows that prevalence of pain in adolescents is increasing and&#xD;
      is therefore recognized as a growing health problem. Psychological interventions delivered&#xD;
      remotely through the internet may reduce intensity or severity of pain among children and&#xD;
      adolescents with chronic pain. The iCanCope with Pain program is an existing web- and&#xD;
      mobile-based self-management program, which is developed as a multi-center study funded by&#xD;
      the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and is based on identified health care needs and&#xD;
      current best practices for pain self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objectives are to describe the translation and cultural adaptation of&#xD;
      the Norwegian version of the iCanCope with Pain mobile application and evaluate the effect in&#xD;
      an upcoming randomized controlled trail with adolescents with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample: 16-19-year-old adolescents with self-declared persistent and/or chronic pain.&#xD;
      Recruited from high schools in Southern Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical framework: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is explained by an integration of&#xD;
      behavioral and cognitive theories of human behavior and psychopathology and is often the&#xD;
      preferred treatment of choice for adolescents with different health disorders. The&#xD;
      theoretical framework of CBT is integrated in the iCanCope with Pain app in terms of five&#xD;
      components. The intervention group will receive the app with all five components: (I) symptom&#xD;
      trackers for pain, sleep, mood, physical, and social function; (II) goal setting to improve&#xD;
      pain and function; (III) coping toolbox of pain self-management strategies; (IV) social&#xD;
      support; (V) age-appropriate pain education. The control group will receive the app with only&#xD;
      the first self-registration component (I) symptom trackers for pain, sleep, mood, physical,&#xD;
      and social function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Both qualitative and quantitative data will be gathered for evaluating the Norwegian&#xD;
      version of the iCanCope with Pain app. Usability testing are assessed in both laboratory&#xD;
      settings and in field using observation, interviews and questionnaires, which provide&#xD;
      necessary information for an upcoming randomized controlled trail (RCT). Outcomes will in the&#xD;
      RCT be measured at baseline (mid-April) and after an 8 weeks intervention (mid-June).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is part of a PhD project.&#xD;
