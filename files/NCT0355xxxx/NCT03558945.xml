    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effect of personalized neoantigen vaccines,&#xD;
      which are based on next-generation sequencing and MHC affinity prediction algorithm. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that personalized neoantigen vaccines will be safe and capable of&#xD;
      generating measurable neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety and effect of&#xD;
      personalized neoantigen vaccines for pancreatic tumors. It is known that pancreatic tumors&#xD;
      have various mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual&#xD;
      patient and tumors. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear&#xD;
      very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a&#xD;
      vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any&#xD;
      tumor cells that could cause the pancreatic tumors to come back after radical surgery. The&#xD;
      study will examine the safety and effect of the vaccine when given at several different time&#xD;
      points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an&#xD;
      immune response. Finally we will establish the typical flow to assess efficiency and safety&#xD;
      of vaccines according to the different reactivity of patients, as a result, to explore the&#xD;
      most suitable practical approaches for applying personalized pancreatic tumor vaccines.&#xD;
