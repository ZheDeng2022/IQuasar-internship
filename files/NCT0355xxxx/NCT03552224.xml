  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, all the electrophysiological methods for auditory testing rely on the measure on&#xD;
      synchronous evoked auditory nerve activity. This measure only takes into account the response&#xD;
      of the first action potential in every auditory fibber, but provides no information about the&#xD;
      neural response during a sustained activity. This can explain why in experimental models, a&#xD;
      loss of more of 80% of auditory nerve fibbers cannot be detected by usual&#xD;
      electrophysiological measurements. In this study we aim at investigating the global&#xD;
      spontaneous and sound evoked auditory nerve activity by recording directly the electrical&#xD;
      field by an electrode placed directly on the auditory nerve of subjects during a skull base&#xD;
      surgical procedure. We expected to demonstrated differences in the electrical activity&#xD;
      between subjects with or without hearing loss.&#xD;
