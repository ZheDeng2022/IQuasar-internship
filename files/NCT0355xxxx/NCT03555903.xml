  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a common gynaecologic disease affecting 5 to 15% women of reproductive age&#xD;
      and up to 40% of infertile women. It is characterized by the presence of active endometrial&#xD;
      tissue outside the uterine cavity, potentially causing invalidating chronic pelvic pain and&#xD;
      infertility. It is therefore crucial to limit the progression and/or recurrence of the&#xD;
      disease, and to improve the quality of life of affected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), an advanced form of the disease, is defined by the&#xD;
      invasion of an anatomical structure and organ close to the uterus (i.e. uterosacral ligament,&#xD;
      rectovaginal space, recto-sigmoidal colon or bladder), or by a peritoneal invasion greater&#xD;
      than 5mm. The management of DIE is unfortunately not yet based on high-level evidence data;&#xD;
      it mainly depends on the localization of the disease, the extend of the invasion and the&#xD;
      severity of the symptoms. In the absence of clear guidelines based on empirical data, the&#xD;
      choice between surgical or medical treatment remains difficult and controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve optimal DIE management, the investigators aim to create a prospective database&#xD;
      reporting on DIE surgically treated in a teaching hospital in Lyon/France (Centre hospitalier&#xD;
      universitaire Lyon Sud)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on known risks factors, symptoms (pain), quality of life, infertility history and&#xD;
      disease management will be obtained using self-questionnaires, clinic, paraclinic, surgical&#xD;
      and histological records as follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each patient will be asked to fill in electronics protected on-line forms: the first one&#xD;
           before surgery, followed by three follow-up forms at 1, 2 and 5 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The surgeon will be asked to fill in two electronic protected on-line forms: the first&#xD;
           one at the time of surgery and the second one during a post-operative consultation (one&#xD;
           month after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires used in this study are similar to those used for the Endometriosis&#xD;
      database &quot;CIRENDO&quot; (explain briefly what it is), which will ultimately allow us to pool the&#xD;
      data from the 2 databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This French prospective study will advance the scientific knowledge on DIE surgical treatment&#xD;
      and, by helping evaluate the impact of the surgery on the quality of life and fertility of&#xD;
      affected women, will guide future recommendations for an optimal management of this&#xD;
      invalidating disease.&#xD;
