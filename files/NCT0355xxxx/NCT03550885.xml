      Determine in the context of a controlled crossover diet-intervention trial the role of&#xD;
      taurocholic acid metabolism by gut bacteria in African American subjects at elevated risk for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Two isocaloric diets, an animal-based diet high in taurine and&#xD;
      saturated fat (HT-HSAT) and a plant-based, low in taurine and low saturated fat (LT-LSAT)&#xD;
      will be used to determine the extent to which the relationship between diet (independent&#xD;
      variable) and mucosal markers of CRC risk including epithelial proliferation, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, DNA damage, and primary and secondary bile acid pools and biomarkers of inflammation&#xD;
      (dependent variables) is explained by the abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria and hydrogen&#xD;
      sulfide (H2S) concentrations &amp;/or deoxycholic acid (DCA) and DCA-producing bacteria&#xD;
      clostridium scindens (mediator variables).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our research is designed to determine mechanistically why consumption of a high red meat and&#xD;
      saturated fat diet imparts risk for CRC development and to demonstrate that primary microbial&#xD;
      risk factors (sulfidogenic and bile acid metabolizing bacteria) are modifiable by diet. The&#xD;
      focus is on taurine, an overlooked sulfur amino acid (SAA) that is abundant in red meat or&#xD;
      provided by bacterial deconjugation of the bile salt TCA, which is increased in subjects&#xD;
      consuming a diet high in saturated fat. Rationale for focusing the diet intervention study on&#xD;
      AAs comes from the previously mentioned observation that a taurine respiring bacterium&#xD;
      distinguished AA but not NHW CRC patients from healthy controls, and the previous work by PI&#xD;
      Gaskins in AA subjects focused on mechanisms underlying the increased risk for CRC associated&#xD;
      with consumption of a Western type diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our strong collection of past publications and new preliminary data support our hypothesis&#xD;
      that dietary sources of organic sulfur increase the abundance of microbes that generate H2S&#xD;
      through taurine metabolism and that H2S activates proinflammatory pathways and serves as a&#xD;
      genotoxin in the colonic mucosa. We're examining, for the first time bacteria that utilize&#xD;
      taurine, which can be provided directly from red meat or indirectly through TCA in response&#xD;
      to saturated fat. Our study will be the first to examine the consequences of such specific&#xD;
      dietary manipulation on genotoxic or inflammatory pathways implicated in CRC development in&#xD;
      at-risk AAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our results will provide novel information regarding the in vivo interactions between diet&#xD;
      and cancer that heretofore have not been explored in humans, particularly AAs. Food taurine&#xD;
      content is not currently provided in either the University of Minnesota Nutrition Data System&#xD;
      for Research (NDSR) or the USDA Standard Reference (USDA SR) nutrient databases, which are&#xD;
      the gold standard sources for the nutrient content of food. Evidence that taurine is capable&#xD;
      of inducing biomarkers of CRC risk through promoting growth of Sulfidogenic B. wadsworthia or&#xD;
      other untargeted bacteria would be an important novel observation justifying the addition of&#xD;
      this SAA to these nutrient databases. If our hypothesis is substantiated, simple vigilance of&#xD;
      taurine intake might diminish susceptibility to CRC in all individuals, especially AAs at&#xD;
      elevated risk. Further, if our hypothesis is upheld, it might be possible to reduce risk not&#xD;
      only by dietary intervention but also by microbiota modification (potentially through pre-,&#xD;
      pro- or synbiotics). Finally, if our study reveals particular modes of bacterial sulfur or&#xD;
      bile acid metabolism correlating with epithelial proliferation or inflammation in AAs, the&#xD;
      endpoints identified can potentially predict non-invasively elevated risk individuals who&#xD;
      should be: a) advised on specific dietary interventions (those investigated herein); b)&#xD;
      offered specific therapy to reduce risk; or c) counseled on regular colonoscopic screening&#xD;
