    <textblock>
      The study is investigating the efficacy and safety of UroGen's UGN-102 to treat patients with&#xD;
      Low Grade (LG) Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) at intermediate risk of recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase 2b trial designed to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of UGN-102 treatment instilled in patients diagnosed with LG&#xD;
      NMIBC, including newly diagnosed patients, and determined to have intermediate risk of&#xD;
      progression, defined as 1 or 2 of the following: multiple tumors, solitary tumor &gt;3 cm, or&#xD;
      recurrence (≥ 1 occurrence of LG NMIBC within 1 year of the current diagnosis). Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be treated with 6 weekly instillations of UGN-102.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UGN-102 is a reverse thermal hydrogel formulated with MMC. The product is specifically&#xD;
      formulated to achieve a liquid state at 4°C and to transition to a water-soluble gel at body&#xD;
      temperature. The advantage of delivering Mitomycin to the urinary bladder using UGN-102&#xD;
      relies on preclinical and clinical literature documenting that concentration and dwell time&#xD;
      correlate directly with the therapeutic efficacy of MMC when used to treat Urothelial&#xD;
      Carcinoma (UC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ablative effect of UGN-102 will be evaluated at the Primary Disease Evaluation (3 MONTH)&#xD;
      assessment, which will take place 5 weeks ±1 week after the last weekly instillation (3&#xD;
      months after initiation of study medication). Response will be determined based on visual&#xD;
      evaluation by cystoscopy (appearance, number, size, and location of the lesions) and, if&#xD;
      there are remaining lesions, by histopathology of the remaining lesions. CR is defined as&#xD;
      having no detectable disease (NDD) and will be assessed visually during cystoscopy and also&#xD;
      upon urine cytology. In the event that the investigator is not sure, and there is suspect&#xD;
      tissue, a small biopsy will be taken from the suspect tissue to confirm CR in addition to&#xD;
      cystoscopy and urine cytology. Patients who achieve a CR will continue to have monthly&#xD;
      telephone contacts to document any adverse events and changes in concomitant medications and&#xD;
      will be assessed at 6, 9, and 12 months after the first instillation of UGN-102 for evidence&#xD;
      of disease recurrence. The group of patients considered nonresponders (non-CR) will&#xD;
      discontinue the study and continue with standard of care according to their treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be determined based on physical examination, laboratory assessments, and a review&#xD;
      of AEs. All safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, including close review and&#xD;
      follow up of any unexpected AE related to UGN-102 and qualified per National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) as Grade 3 or 4.&#xD;
