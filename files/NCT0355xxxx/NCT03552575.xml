  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to reperfusion therapy, the major therapeutic breakthrough in myocardial infarction was&#xD;
      the demonstration that ACE inhibitors or ARBs, given to prevent adverse &quot;remodelling&quot;&#xD;
      (progressive dilatation and decline in systolic function) in high risk patients, reduced the&#xD;
      likelihood of developing heart failure and the risk of death. The neurohumoral systems which&#xD;
      are activated in patients after myocardial infarction (and in heart failure) are not all&#xD;
      harmful and some endogenous systems may be protective. The best recognised of these is the&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- and B-type natriuretic peptides are secreted by the heart when it is stressed and these&#xD;
      peptides promote vasodilation (reducing left ventricular wall stress), stimulate renal sodium&#xD;
      and water excretion (i.e. antagonising the retention of salt and water characterising heart&#xD;
      failure) and inhibit pathological growth i.e. hypertrophy and fibrosis (key components of the&#xD;
      adverse left ventricular remodelling that occurs after infarction and in heart failure).The&#xD;
      augmentation of plasma levels of endogenous natriuretic peptides can be achieved through&#xD;
      inhibition of neutral endopeptidase, also known as neprilysin (NEP), which is responsible for&#xD;
      the breakdown of natriuretic peptides. Recently, the addition of neprilysin inhibition to&#xD;
      blockade of the RAAS (using sacubitril/valsartan), compared with RAAS blockade alone, reduced&#xD;
      the risk of heart failure hospitalisation and death in patients with HF-REF. These exciting&#xD;
      findings may lead to a new approach to the treatment of heart failure, with an angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) replacing an ACE inhibitor as one of the fundamental&#xD;
      treatments for this condition. We believe that the same approach may be beneficial in&#xD;
      highrisk survivors of myocardial infarction. Recently, sacubitril/valsartan was shown to&#xD;
      ameliorate adverse left ventricular remodelling in an experimental model of acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. The objective of the present proposal is to gather &quot;proof-ofconcept&quot;,&#xD;
      mechanistic, evidence in humans to support adoption of this new approach in patients at high&#xD;
      risk after myocardial infarction as a result of residual left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present proposal is to obtain information, which is currently not&#xD;
      available, on the cardiac effects of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with LVSD, better&#xD;
      characterise the neurohumoral actions of sacubitril/valsartan and gather &quot;proof-ofconcept&quot;,&#xD;
      mechanistic, evidence in humans to support adoption of this new treatment in patients at high&#xD;
      risk after myocardial infarction as a result of residual LVSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly, there is currently limited evidence about how sacubitril/valsartan works in&#xD;
      humans. PARADIGM-HF was a large pragmatic mortality/morbidity trial with no mechanistic&#xD;
      sub-studies and this is also true of a ongoing trial (PARADISE-MI) in acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Moreover, both trials either used or will use an ACE inhibitor (enalapril and&#xD;
      ramipril, respectively), rather than an ARB as the active comparator for&#xD;
      sacubitril/valsartan; use of valsartan in our study will allow us to precisely define the&#xD;
      effects of neprilysin inhibition. A-type (or atrial) natriuretic peptide (ANP), C-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (CNP) and adrenomedullin are substrates for neprilysin and may play a&#xD;
      role in the action of sacubitril/valsartan but have not been measured in existing clinical&#xD;
      trials (in part because of the instability of these peptides and unfeasibility of measuring&#xD;
      them in multi-centre, multi-national trials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, ANP and CNP are more specific substrates for neprilysin than BNP. As has been&#xD;
      mentioned above, cardiac fibrosis appears to be important in the process of LV remodelling in&#xD;
      patients with asymptomatic LVSD and the development of HF-REF and is reflected in circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers which may be influenced by sacubitril/valsartan&#xD;
