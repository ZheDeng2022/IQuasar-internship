  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of Levosimendan for 24hrs in patients with ADHF who will be hospitalized with ADHF&#xD;
      and continue to have symptom of dyspnea at rest(NYHA Class III or IV) despite with treatment&#xD;
      of SOCs(include intravenous diuretics, vasodilators and/or positive inotropic drugs but&#xD;
      except amrinone and milrinone) within 48hrs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy is measured by Clinical composite classification(Improved, No change, Worse),&#xD;
      bio-marker(change of BNP and ST-2), Patient's Global Assessment, NYHA functional&#xD;
      Classification, hospitalization period and renal function tests(change of creatinine, BUN and&#xD;
      NGAL) Safety is measured by recording the incidence of adverse events(AEs), vital signs,&#xD;
      clinical blood safety tests(biochemistry, hematology) and concomitant medications&#xD;
