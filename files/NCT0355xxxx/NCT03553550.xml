    <textblock>
      Every type of cancer is associated with changes in genes and protein structure or function in&#xD;
      the body known as &quot;biomarkers&quot;. These biomarkers can help diagnose cancer, as well as to&#xD;
      track the disease and response to treatment. Over the last 10 years, technology has led to&#xD;
      the identification of many cancer biomarkers; the use of cancer biomarkers has become an&#xD;
      important part in the treatment and management of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For solid tumors, biomarker testing is usually done on the tumor tissue from a biopsy or&#xD;
      surgery. Although testing tumor tissue provides a lot of information, there are some&#xD;
      challenges with the process. First, tumor cells can be different even within small tumors. To&#xD;
      overcome this, the pathologist (doctor that examines tumor tissue) needs to test cells from&#xD;
      different parts of the tumor. Often, there may not be enough of the tissue to test for&#xD;
      biomarkers. In addition, tumor cells change when the patient undergoes treatment and there&#xD;
      might be a need to repeat biopsies. Sometimes it may not be possible to repeat a biopsy to&#xD;
      study the changes in biomarkers because some patients cannot have a repeat biopsy done&#xD;
      safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many advantages to tracking biomarkers in the blood instead of on tissue. We can&#xD;
      study changes in biomarkers more often (because it is a blood draw), and therefore will be&#xD;
      able to determine how your treatment is working, learn if the cancer is coming back, or find&#xD;
      drugs that may target the changed tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about changes in cell-free tumor DNA in&#xD;
      blood samples, also known as a liquid biopsy, as they relate to treatment and response to&#xD;
      treatment. Cell-free tumor DNA is genetic material that is released into your bloodstream&#xD;
      from tumor cells as they die. Genes are a unique combination of molecules (called DNA) that&#xD;
      are found in all human cells. In some cases, these genes may be changed in cancer and tumor&#xD;
      cells. These changes, or tumor markers are substances produced by cancer cells that are found&#xD;
      in the blood, body fluids or tissues, and may be made of DNA, RNA, proteins, cells or&#xD;
      components of cells. In the future, the &quot;markers&quot; may help doctors decide which treatments&#xD;
      could be most beneficial for NSCLC. Tumor markers may be used to help predict a response to&#xD;
      certain cancer treatments and to check how the patiet's type of cancer responds to the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Tissue - The participant will be asked to provide a tissue sample collected during a&#xD;
      clinically-indicated surgery for NSCLC. This sample will be divided and put on to slides to&#xD;
      be seen under a microscope. The slides will be stored at the ALCMI Biorepository for future&#xD;
      lung cancer research purposes. The slides may be selected to study circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      (cells from the tumors that circulate in the bloodstream) and their patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood - The blood will be sent to a company named, IniVata, to study the changes&#xD;
      in circulating tumor cells (cells from the tumors that circulate in the bloodstream) as well&#xD;
      as DNA (parts of the cell that carry genetic information) most often seen in NSCLC. We expect&#xD;
      the research testing to consume the entire blood specimen. However, if any residual blood&#xD;
      specimen remains, it will be stored at IniVata however, it cannot be used without ALCMI's&#xD;
      permission.&#xD;
