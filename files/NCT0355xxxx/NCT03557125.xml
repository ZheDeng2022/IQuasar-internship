      Evaluate difference in postoperative opiate consumption when patients do or do not receive a&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum block preoperatively for hip arthroscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of hip arthroscopy cases has surged with over a 200% increased experienced between&#xD;
      2007 and 2011]. This increased number of cases is due to both improved techniques and an&#xD;
      increased number of indications]. As with most newer operative techniques, the optimal method&#xD;
      of perioperative pain control is still emerging and past publications indicate that the&#xD;
      majority of patients experience moderate to severe pain postoperative pain. In the wake of a&#xD;
      national opioid epidemic, consistent and reliable implementation of non-opioid analgesic&#xD;
      strategies is exceedingly important and regional anesthesia often plays a key role in&#xD;
      postoperative pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although quadratus lumborum blocks were first described in 2007 as an truncal block, numerous&#xD;
      publications have recently highlighted its effectiveness as an analgesic technique for hip&#xD;
      fracture and hip arthroplasty and possibly the ideal regional technique for hip arthroscopy.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, prospective randomized studies are lacking. This prospective study would&#xD;
      randomize patient to receive or not receive a quadratus plane block prior to surgery. The&#xD;
      primary end point would be opioid consumption in the postoperative anesthesia care unit. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that quadratus lumborum blocks will decrease postoperative opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadratus lumborum blocks is fascial plane block. Originally described for abdominal&#xD;
      surgery, numerous case reports and editorial publications have highlighted the effectiveness&#xD;
      of quadratus lumborum blocks as an analgesic technique for hip fracture and hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      and possibly the ideal regional technique for hip arthroscopy. Unfortunately, prospective&#xD;
      randomized studies are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadratus lumborum block is performed by injecting local anesthetic deep to the&#xD;
      transversus abdominus abdominus apnoneurosis and superficial to the fascia transversalis with&#xD;
      direct ultrasound guidance. After completing consent, placing monitors and providing mild&#xD;
      sedation, the patient is positioned laterally and the muscular anatomy (external oblique,&#xD;
      internal oblique, transverse abdominis, quadratus lumborum and latissimus dorsi muscles)&#xD;
      identified. After placing a subcutaneous skin wheel with lidiocaine, a blunt regional&#xD;
      anesthesia needle is inserted using in-plane ultrasound guidance. Local anesthetic is&#xD;
      deposited incrementally with frequent aspiration in the anterolateral border of the quadratus&#xD;
      lumborum muscle at the junction of the transversalis fascia, outside the anterior layer of&#xD;
      the thoracolumbar fascia and superficial to the fascia transversalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of the quadratus lumborum block are similar to most truncal blocks and include&#xD;
      infection, bleeding, bowel perforation or local anesthethetic toxicity (LAST). Infection risk&#xD;
      is minimized by utilizing appropriate antiseptic and sterile technique as is standard for any&#xD;
      regional procedure. Risk of a retroperitoneal hematoma is increased with the deep (QL3)&#xD;
      approach to the quadratus lumborum block because of its transmuscular approach and likelihood&#xD;
      of abdominal branches of lumbar arteries in the path of the needle. For this reason, this&#xD;
      (QL3) approach to the quadratus lumborum block will not be used for this study. The risk of&#xD;
      LAST is a risk with any regional procedure and is minimized by frequent aspiration,&#xD;
      incremental local anesthetic injection and vital signs monitoring throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadratus lumborum block is already a block utilized daily at MUSC for a variety of&#xD;
      surgical procedures to decrease postoperative pain. Additionally, the block has been offered&#xD;
      at MUSC to patients with uncontrolled postoperative pain following hip arthroscopy with&#xD;
      excellent resulting analgesia. Unfortunately, whether a patient undergoing hip arthroscopy at&#xD;
      MUSC is offered a quadratus lumborum block for postoperative pain is currently highly&#xD;
      provider dependent. We hypothesize that preoperative quadratus lumborum blocks will reduce&#xD;
      opioid consumption following elective hip arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined using G*Power version 3.1.9.2 software. Using preliminary data, we&#xD;
      estimate that we will need 19 subjects in each group (N=38) to have sufficient power (80%) at&#xD;
      alpha=0.05 to test the hypothesis of a 30% decrease in IV ME opioid consumption in patients&#xD;
      having a QL block vs. those with no block. Accounting for a possible 20% withdrawal, we&#xD;
      anticipate the need to enroll 46 total subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to participate by a study team member that is IRB approved, CITI&#xD;
      certified and trained on the protocol. Eligibility will be determined by screening the&#xD;
      operating room schedule for patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled on the day of surgery in the preoperative holding area. After&#xD;
      discussion with surgeons, patients will be educated on the role of regional anesthesia in&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia and a quadratus lumborum block described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pre-operative appointments the surgeons will notify potential participants that they&#xD;
      may be invited to participate in this study on the day of surgery. The surgeon will provide&#xD;
      potential participants with the consent document to review prior to day of surgery. After&#xD;
      discussion in the preoperative holding area regarding risks and benefits of the study and the&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum block, patients will be consented if they choose to participate. Consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from patient by an IRB approved CITI certified study team member that has&#xD;
      been trained on the protocol. Copies of all documents will be provided to the patients. Once&#xD;
      patients are consented, they will be assigned a two digit enrollment number. Prior to patient&#xD;
      enrollment, randomization will done by a statistician and randomized group (no block (current&#xD;
      practice) or quadratus lumborum block) assigned based on the patient enrollment number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, single blinded clinical trial will randomize patient to receive or not&#xD;
      receive a preoperative quadratus lumborum block prior to elective hip arthroscopy. The&#xD;
      consent form will be distributed to patients preoperatively in the surgeon's office. On the&#xD;
      day of surgery in the preoperative holding area, patient undergoing elective hip arthroscopy&#xD;
      would be informed about the trial and the block with both the risks and benefits. If they are&#xD;
      interested in participating, informed consent would then be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients have signed an informed consent, they would be assigned a two-digit&#xD;
      identification number. Numbers would be assigned sequentially with the first enrolled patient&#xD;
      receiving &quot;01,&quot; the second patient receiving &quot;02,&quot; and the last patient receiving number&#xD;
      &quot;38.&quot; Randomization will be created prior to the study starting by a statistician with half&#xD;
      of the research subject number being assigned to receive a nerve block and the other half&#xD;
      assigned to not receive a block, which is our current standard of care. The regional&#xD;
      anesthesia team will open the envelope labeled with the patient's assigned number to reveal&#xD;
      the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, all patients will be positioned, prepped and sedated for a&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum block in the preoperative holding area to blind the patient, surgeon,&#xD;
      intraoperative anesthesia team and data collectors. The patient will be positioned in the&#xD;
      lateral decubitus position with the operative side up and pulse oximetry and blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff placed for monitoring. As part of routine care, the patient will receive sedation for&#xD;
      their comfort. The relevant anatomy will then be identified using an ultrasound. The skin&#xD;
      will be cleaned with chlorhexidine. If the subject has been randomized to the &quot;no block&quot;&#xD;
      group, a subcutaneous saline skin wheel will be placed and the procedure would end at this&#xD;
      point. If the subject has been randomized to the block group, a subcutaneous lidocaine skin&#xD;
      wheel placed will be placed followed by a quadratus lumborum regional block with 40 ml, 0.25%&#xD;
      ropivacaine deposited deep to the transversus abdominus apnoneurosis and superficial to the&#xD;
      fascia transversalis with direct ultrasound guidance. Local anesthetic will be injected in 5&#xD;
      ml aliquots with aspiration for blood performed before and after the injection of each&#xD;
      aliquot. Local anesthetic injection will also be observed with real time ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care in the perioperative period will otherwise be standardized. As part of routine care, all&#xD;
      patients will receive general anesthesia. After receiving 100µg of fentanyl intraoperatively,&#xD;
      hydromorphone or morphine will be administered and titrated by the anesthesia care team for&#xD;
      postoperative pain control. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), hydromorphone or&#xD;
      morphine would continue to be titrated by the PACU nurse for the patient's comfort. The total&#xD;
      opioids administered after the initial 100µg of fentanyl would be compared between groups in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the effect of the quadratus lumborum block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will begin after informed consent is completed. Data collection will include&#xD;
      demographic data, operative date/time, medications administered intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative, time to meet discharge criteria in PACU and visual analog scores (VAS) for&#xD;
      pain and satisfaction. VAS scores for pain will be collected prior to surgery, on PACU&#xD;
      arrival (when aware enough to do so) and upon meeting PACU discharge criteria. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction will be recorded upon meeting PACU discharge criteria. Effects of the block&#xD;
      (numbness or motor weakness) will be recorded. Opioid side effects including nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, and itching will also be noted. Patients will be called on postoperative day one to&#xD;
      assess block duration and satisfaction with care.&#xD;
