  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an endoscopic technique that allows the removal of&#xD;
      lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy&#xD;
      (ESGE) suggests to consider ESD for the removal of colorectal lesions that cannot be removed&#xD;
      enbloc with standard polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and for lesions that&#xD;
      are &gt; 20 mm in diameter, with a high probability of having a limited submucosal invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESD is a technically difficult and time-consuming procedure that is very difficult to learn&#xD;
      and to perform, but it allows higher enbloc resection rates compared to other endoscopic&#xD;
      techniques and is less invasive than surgery requiring less length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several new techniques and devices have been developed to facilitate ESD and to&#xD;
      overcome difficulties related to challenging situations. The main difficulties are related to&#xD;
      the instability of the operating field, due to the physiologic peristalsis, and to the loss&#xD;
      of traction, due to the single operating channel.&#xD;

      Tissue Retraction System (TRS, Boston scientific) is a new endoscopic platform, that consists&#xD;
      of an expandable and dynamically-controlled intra-luminal chamber, mounted on a flexible&#xD;
      overtube, and two associated specifically designed retractor graspers. The system is&#xD;
      front-loaded over the colonoscope and introduced into the colon. When the target area is&#xD;
      reached, the retractor system is deployed creating an expanded, optimally reconfigured and&#xD;
      stable operating field around the target lesion. Then endoscopic removal of the lesion is&#xD;
      performed using available endoscopic instruments (injection needles, knives, snares, etc)&#xD;
      through the operating channel of the colonoscope with assistance of two retractor graspers.&#xD;
      Each accessory within the TRS can be moved forward and backward, left or right, rotated 360&#xD;
      degrees, and can be advanced out and pulled in, regardless of the TRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the TRS can improve visualization of lesions and stabilize&#xD;
      the work environment by allowing retraction and tissue resection during ESD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRS is a new device not yet commercially available, thus no study has been already performed&#xD;
      in humans to evaluate its feasibility and safety to speed up the ESD of left colon and rectum&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's proposal is to perform a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, the&#xD;
      efficacy and the safety in patients undergoing ESD of colorectal lesions with the assistance&#xD;
      of the TRS.&#xD;
