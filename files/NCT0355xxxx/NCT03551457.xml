  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical models of urogenital carcinoma have been emerging as a way to pre-determine drug&#xD;
      resistance before therapy is targeted. The implantation of tumor specimens in the&#xD;
      chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo results in a high-efficiency graft, thus&#xD;
      allowing large-scale studies of &quot;tumor avatar&quot;. The aim of the study is to develop a tumor&#xD;
      culture platform for treatment evaluation. Biopsies will be collected from primary tumors of&#xD;
      patients and grafted onto the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. After tumor&#xD;
      implantation at the CAM, tumor growth will be accompanied by imaging that will quantify tumor&#xD;
      vascularization, tumor volume, and tumor blood flow. Following tumor growth, &quot;avatars&quot; will&#xD;
      be divided into different treatments. Using the &quot;tumor avatar&quot; model together with patient&#xD;
      tumors, the investigators will be able to observe the individualized tumor response for each&#xD;
      patient in a treatment context, as well as determine the potential drug to be used in each&#xD;
      case. These results may support a phenotype-based reading within 7-10 days.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phenotypic Evaluation Model&#xD;
&#xD;
           In 1874, William Roberts and John Tyndall observed the inhibition of cell growth on the&#xD;
           agar plate. In the 1940s, Heatley suggested the use of filter paper discs containing&#xD;
           antimicrobial solutions and introduced the &quot;radial disc method&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           WHO released a report on the methodology and the reference method in 1975, which support&#xD;
           the international standard of Clinical Laboratory Standards. The phenotype response of&#xD;
           microorganisms to antibiotic treatment, comparing the proliferation of colonies might&#xD;
           offer a rationale to the herein proposed tumor treatment response phenotype platform&#xD;
           (patient-derived tumor avatar).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cancer Treatment on Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX)&#xD;
&#xD;
           To propose an individualized treatment, it is necessary to know the tumor treatment&#xD;
           response phenotype, which varies with the host. Studies using xenografts are being used&#xD;
           to predict a response to certain drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chorioallantoic Membrane&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay has been used as a fast, reproducible method for&#xD;
      antitumor drug testing in vivo. This assay has been widely used for the study of angiogenesis&#xD;
      and has also been successfully developed in a xenograft tumor model, including urogenital&#xD;
      tumors, due to the total non-development of the lymphoid system of the embryo. The new&#xD;
      techniques have been studied, generating consequently new protocols. The major challenge for&#xD;
      the xenograft model in CAM is a relatively high occurrence of embryonic death after egg&#xD;
      removal, with a mortality rate between 25 and 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chick eggs will be used because they present a favorable vascularization environment.&#xD;
      After the growth of the CAM, which is after 8 days of egg fertilization, access to the blood&#xD;
      vessels is highly facilitated, causing them to be manipulated and observed. This makes it&#xD;
      able to sustain systems and cells in the way that complex cancer studies can be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood vessels in addition to nourishing the development of -allo and xenografts, this&#xD;
      redefined a supportive environment unique to intravasation and dissemination of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAM is highly vascularized, which makes it a rich medium for tumor implantation, in&#xD;
      addition to other factors such as proteins. This support ends up being exclusive to the&#xD;
      invasion, dissemination, and vascularization of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of genitourinary tumors is not yet individualized, due to the high heterogeneity of&#xD;
      the tumors. The choice of treatment that the patient will get is defined by population&#xD;
      studies that present inadequacies when transferred to the context of the individualized&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cell culture and organoids are a simple model to be applied, having a low cost and fast&#xD;
      results. However, when the method is applied to the study of tumors, the results do not&#xD;
      represent tumor environment conditions, forcing the cells to an adaptation that interferes&#xD;
      with their growth and response to treatments patterns. Thus the xenografts models overcome&#xD;
      some restrictions of the culture so that the framework is solid for its development. In&#xD;
      contrast, the creation of a xenografts protocol becomes more complex, but it is a more&#xD;
      representative method of cancer in its natural environment. CAM was studied with two strands,&#xD;
      in-ovo, and ex-ovo. For in-ovo studies, the protocol was exposed by cutting eggshell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ex-ovo studies focus on improving the accessibility of the CAM and the embryo, enabling&#xD;
      its documentation and manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it has been described a correlation between renal tumors and drug resistance using&#xD;
      exogenous CAM xenograft model. This causes other aspects to be monitored, studied and&#xD;
      improved, especially regarding angiogenesis and research with tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that the diversity of the patient and cancer represent the main&#xD;
      challenge in their treatment, which justifies the search for a clinical tool capable of&#xD;
      providing information on the phenotype of response to treatment using the chorioallantoic&#xD;
      tumor (CTA) platform/avatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just as the antibiogram already established in clinical practice anticipates the&#xD;
      susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics, there is room for individualized treatment with&#xD;
      potential benefit in cancer outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define and anticipate the best treatment (&quot;tumor chemogram&quot;) for each patient with&#xD;
      urogenital cancer using treatment response phenotype platform, as the tumor avatar in the&#xD;
      chorioallantoic membrane can transform the clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the efficiency of the sowing of fresh (immediate) and frozen tissue -80&#xD;
           degrees (in 24 and 48h) as a strategy in cases of failure of primary sowing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the stability of the neoplastic tissue and the maintenance of its&#xD;
           characteristics (genomic, proteomic, metabolic and phenotypic) in the proposed platform;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the response phenotype to the treatment of urogenital carcinomas in&#xD;
           xenograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the impact of the proposed platform implementation on individualized&#xD;
           treatment, its cost and results (oncological and functional) in patients with urogenital&#xD;
           carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational study including 30 biopsies of urogenital tumors from patients of&#xD;
      the respective hospitals. Each biopsy will generate up to 12 tumor explants of 1 to 2 mm2,&#xD;
      which will be implanted individually on the chorioallantoic membrane of 1 chicken embryo to&#xD;
      test the 10 proposed drugs, plus 2 control eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, 12 embryos will be needed for each biopsy. Biopsies of urogenital primary tumors&#xD;
      of patients after consent will be collected, provided by the &quot;Hospital das Clínicas da&#xD;
      Unicamp&quot; and &quot;Hospital Municipal de Paulínia&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The material will be collected and placed in culture medium (McCoy) and kept on ice within 24&#xD;
      hours after resection. Part of the tissue fragments will be rapidly frozen and stored at&#xD;
      -80oC for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be reserved a safety sample in ideal conditions of refrigeration for a sowing of&#xD;
      rescue in cases of failure of the previous attempt. Samples will be divided where possible&#xD;
      in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fresh tumor: mitochondrial assay, culture, western blot&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor formol: histopathology, immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor culture: chorioallantoic membrane, frozen For the tumor biopsy graft, the CAM will&#xD;
           be used when the embryos are 8 to 10 days old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the CAM layer will be gently ruptured with the aid of a forceps, then the biopsy of&#xD;
      the tumor will be placed near a Y-shaped bifurcation of a blood vessel. After placement of&#xD;
      the tumor, 200ul of PBS will be placed to prevent contamination. After the graft comes into&#xD;
      contact with the vascularization of the CAM, tumor growth will be monitored in a period of 3&#xD;
      to 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process will be evaluated and if there is tumor growth the system will go to the&#xD;
      treatment phase. Since there was tumor growth, the treatments will be performed from 17 days&#xD;
      after the embryo. The treatments used will be doses of the following medicines: cisplatin,&#xD;
      gemcitabine, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, carboplatin, pazopanib, sunitinib, sorafenib,&#xD;
      methotrexate, and vinblastine. For the concentration of the drugs, they will be placed next&#xD;
      to the filter paper in the tumor regions. This treatment will take from 3 to 4 days, after&#xD;
      which analyzes will be carried out to determine the potentiality of each drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Euthanasia of the embryo will occur by decapitation (according to the protocol approved CEUA&#xD;
      4874-1 / 2018) since it already has a developed pain system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scissor cut through the CAM around the attached graft, transferred to a Petri dish with PBS.&#xD;
      The excess of CAM will then be removed, leaving only the graft to be analyzed by&#xD;
      histopathology, immunohistochemistry, western blotting and mitochondrial evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks involved in the participation of this study are minimal, as there is no&#xD;
      interference in the treatment of the subject of the research, only the use of a small part of&#xD;
      material withdrawn in the surgery that will be filed to be used in the laboratory in order to&#xD;
      know even more about the disease, specifically identify future treatments with the best&#xD;
      chances of results if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow a greater knowledge of the disease with a potential benefit in the&#xD;
      choice of future treatments, without altering any aspect of the current treatment that the&#xD;
      research subject is receiving (the best standard treatment available at the time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between primary tumor groups versus cultivated in xenograft will be performed&#xD;
      using one-way ANOVA with the post hoc Bonferroni test. Data will be analyzed using Student&#xD;
      t-tests or ANOVA repeated measures (Bonferroni post hoc test). The level of significance will&#xD;
      be defined as less than 0.05 using Prism 5 (GraphPad software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platform efficiency (tumor take in percentage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platform representativeness (similarity between fresh and cultivated tumor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of tumor response phenotype to different therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of the proposed platform implementation on individualized treatment, its cost and&#xD;
           results (oncological and functional)&#xD;
