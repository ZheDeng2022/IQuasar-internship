  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational non-invasive study which aims to collect data from patients under&#xD;
      general anesthesia in the operating room; this data will then be used for characterization&#xD;
      and detection of artifacts that affect the EEG signal.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational, non-invasive study will be performed in order to identify the effects of&#xD;
      physiological and environmental artifacts on the EEG raw data collected by the BIS™. This&#xD;
      study will include 100 screened subjects (not more than 60 valid cases) and will take place&#xD;
      in the Department of Anesthesiology at Rambam Health Care Campus. During the study, raw data&#xD;
      from the BIS™ will be recorded simultaneously with EMG, EOG and ECG in order to diagnose&#xD;
      their effects on the EEG signals as recorded by the BIS™. The raw data will be considered as&#xD;
      the main parameters of the study. Additionally, a study coordinator will stay in the&#xD;
      operating room during the surgery and will indicate the following parameters -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical treatment (drug, dosage and time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in hypnotic state (state, time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any activity that may affect the EEG signals (i.e. electrical and mechanical artifacts&#xD;
           from medical devices)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any activity that deviates from the clinical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Any adverse events or unusual outcomes From the list above, parameters a, c and d will&#xD;
           also be considered as main parameters and parameters and parameters d and e will be&#xD;
           considered as safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If applicable, BIS™ will be recorded after the surgery, at the PACU, for part of time the&#xD;
      subject will be at the PACU or until the subject will be released from the department. The&#xD;
      study coordinator/investigator will perform POD assessment at that time. The subject will be&#xD;
      considered as valid case even if the data from the recovery room is missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic details and medical history will be copied by the study coordinator from the&#xD;
      subjects' medical records.&#xD;
