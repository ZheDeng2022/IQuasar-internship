    <textblock>
      This early phase I pilot trial studies how well vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab&#xD;
      work in treating patients with high-risk stage III melanoma. Vemurafenib and cobimetinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab and tiragolumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Giving vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating high-risk stage III melanoma. Giving atezolizumab and tiragolumab together may also&#xD;
      work better in treating high-risk stage III melanoma.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in T cell receptor clonality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>A waterfall plot of the percent change will be constructed by pCR status. A two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to assess whether the percent change in intra-tumoral T cells from the primary lesion or in peripheral blood T cells differ among those who have a pCR and those who do not. Also, the proportion of patients who have a change in intra-tumoral T cell clonality and the proportion of patients who have a change in peripheral blood T cell clonality will be determined. For each of these parameters, a 95% binomial confidence interval for the difference in the parameter between those who have a pCR and those who do not will be constructed. Finally, the ratio of the intra-tumoral T cell clonality in the involved lymph node to the intra-tumoral T cell clonality in the uninvolved lymph node will be determined. This ratio will be summarized descriptively using median and inter-quartile range.</description>
