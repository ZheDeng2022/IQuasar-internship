  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and related disorders (PRD) are debilitating, costly, and&#xD;
      understudied conditions. Improving access to comprehensive, specialized, in-home patient care&#xD;
      offers the potential to minimize the downward spiral of morbidity and preventable healthcare&#xD;
      utilization. The aim of this study is to test whether and to what degree an interdisciplinary&#xD;
      home visit program will improve patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes, and to identify&#xD;
      unmet needs in this population.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Participants can elect to complete either the Home Visit Arm of the study or the Usual Care&#xD;
      Arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Visit Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This interdisciplinary home visit program consists of 4 visits to patients' homes over the&#xD;
      course of one year from a team of a movement disorders doctor, a nurse, a research&#xD;
      coordinator, and a social worker. The team will come to a patient's home and assess the needs&#xD;
      of both the patient and caregiver (if present), and connect the patient with any needed&#xD;
      services. These visits can replace or be in addition to seeing another movement disorders&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected from the home visit participants will be compared to data collected&#xD;
      from participants who elect to complete the usual care arm of the study. These participants&#xD;
      and their caregivers (if available) will be invited to complete an online version of the&#xD;
      survey. They will be contacted 12 months after their initial completion of the survey to&#xD;
      complete a follow-up survey.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in patient quality of life as measured by the EuroQol 5-D (EQ-5D) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a brief, 6-item instrument measuring five specific domains of health-related quality of life (mobility, self-care, activities of daily living, anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort) and overall well-being. Items are scored on a 1-5 scale, with 5 indicating the highest level of perceived problems. Scores at Visits 1 and 4 will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in caregiver strain as measured by the Multidimensional Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>An 18-item tool measuring 6 dimensions of subjective response to stressors. Subscales include physical strain, social constraints, financial strain, time constraints, interpersonal strain, and elder being demanding/manipulative. Respondents are asked about the frequency with which items apply, ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot; on a 5 point scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of caregiver strain. Scores at Visits 1-4 will be compared.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the home visit program as measured by the Client Satisfaction Inventory- Short Form (CSI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A 9-item instrument developed within the field of social work to assess client satisfaction with multidisciplinary programs like the home visit program in this study. Each item is scored on a 1-7 scale, with higher scores indicating greater client satisfaction. This measure will be completed at our last home visit (Visit 4).</description>
