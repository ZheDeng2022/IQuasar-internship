    <textblock>
      Smartphone app-based health interventions are an innovative way to deliver psychosocial&#xD;
      cancer-care. In the SEAMLESS study, the investigators aim to evaluate a 4 week smartphone&#xD;
      app-based mind-body intervention (MBI) in cancer survivors post-treatment. This is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, with a waitlist control group. Participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      either receive the intervention immediately after enrollment or will need to wait for 3&#xD;
      months to receive the intervention.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Cancer patients who are in the transition phase to survivorship after completing&#xD;
      their final treatments need psychosocial interventions to manage stressors such as anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and fear of cancer recurrence. Smartphone app-based health interventions are an&#xD;
      innovative way to deliver psychosocial cancer-care. In the SEAMLESS study, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to evaluate an app-based mind-body intervention (MBI) in cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors has been highlighted by the&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine in their landmark survivorship report appropriately titled, &quot;Lost in&#xD;
      Transition.&quot; Cancer survivors are often unable to participate in face-to-face interventions&#xD;
      because of difficulties such as compromised immunity, treatment-related side-effects,&#xD;
      scheduling conflicts and geography. A smartphone-app based MBI can overcome several such&#xD;
      difficulties, since patients can participate at their own convenience without the burden of&#xD;
      travel and scheduling classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION DESIGN The AM smartphone app supports personalized mindfulness practices through&#xD;
      lessons and personalized guided-meditation playlists; AM reportedly reduced anxiety in a&#xD;
      study with college students. AM interprets its users' emotional state, e.g. angry, elated,&#xD;
      from a user-inputted digital emotion-mapping board; and heart-rate data through algorithms&#xD;
      that analyze facial bio-signals. The SEAMLESS study is a randomized wait-list controlled&#xD;
      trial, which will evaluate AM's effectiveness for reducing stress (primary outcome), anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, fatigue and fear of cancer recurrence in cancer survivors who have completed all&#xD;
      treatments for 2 weeks or more. Outcomes will be assessed online using validated PROMIS&#xD;
      measures at 1) baseline, 2) mid-point 3) immediately post-intervention, 4&amp;5) 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE Cancer-care providers are uncertain about the efficacy of app-based&#xD;
      interventions for patients, which are available in great supply in today's digital world.&#xD;
      This study will provide rigorously evaluated efficacy data for an app-based MBI for cancer&#xD;
      survivors, which if helpful, could be made easily available for psychosocial care at cancer&#xD;
      centers worldwide.&#xD;
