      This study employs a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) and aims to&#xD;
      determine the most effective adaptive intervention combining four efficacious treatments&#xD;
      (enhanced physical activity monitor, motivational text messages, motivational personal calls,&#xD;
      group meetings) to increase physical activity and improve cardiovascular health among&#xD;
      sedentary employed women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research program is to develop cost-effective strategies to&#xD;
      increase moderate- intensity physical activity among sedentary women. Fewer than half of U.S.&#xD;
      women meet recommendations for moderate-intensity physical activity, and thereby are at&#xD;
      increased risk for cardiovascular disease. When provided a physical activity program, between&#xD;
      25-60% of women either fail to adopt it or fail to adhere after six months. Physical activity&#xD;
      health benefits are further negatively impacted by the fact that sedentary behavior at many&#xD;
      worksites exacerbates low physical activity. Among efficacious treatments for increasing&#xD;
      physical activity for women, four have had promising results: (1) enhanced physical activity&#xD;
      monitor treatment (PA monitor with goal setting and a physical activity prescription); (2)&#xD;
      motivational text messages; (3) motivational personal calls; and (4) group meetings. While&#xD;
      each of these treatments has proven efficacy, they differ on resource use and cost, and there&#xD;
      is heterogeneity in response. When treatments have heterogeneity of response, adaptive&#xD;
      interventions can help close that gap. Adaptive interventions start with an initial treatment&#xD;
      and then transition to an augmented treatment for non-responders. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine the most effective adaptive intervention combining four efficacious treatments&#xD;
      (enhanced physical activity monitor, motivational text messages, motivational personal calls,&#xD;
      group meetings) to increase physical activity (step counts per day, minutes moderate/vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity per week) and improve cardiovascular health (aerobic fitness, body&#xD;
      composition) among sedentary employed women. The investigators will also assess treatment&#xD;
      effects on intervention targets (physical activity benefits, physical activity barriers,&#xD;
      physical activity self-efficacy, and social support). A Sequential Multiple Assignment&#xD;
      Randomized Trial (SMART) design will address the following aims: 1) Among non-responders to&#xD;
      the initial treatments (enhanced physical activity monitor and enhanced physical activity&#xD;
      monitor+ motivational text messages), compare the two augmented treatments (motivational&#xD;
      personal calls and group meetings); 2a) Compare the two initial treatments and; 2b) Compare&#xD;
      the four adaptive interventions embedded in the SMART on physical activity and cardiovascular&#xD;
      health; 3) Identify mediators and moderators of the initial and augmented treatments on&#xD;
      physical activity and cardiovascular health; 4) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the four&#xD;
      adaptive interventions from the societal perspective which includes both program costs and&#xD;
      participant costs. The investigators will recruit 312 sedentary women, aged 18 to 70, who are&#xD;
      employed at a large urban academic medical center. Data will be collected on physical&#xD;
      activity (self- report, device), cardiovascular health, physical activity benefits, physical&#xD;
      activity barriers, physical activity self-efficacy, social support, and program and&#xD;
      participant costs. Data will be collected at baseline, weeks 9-10 (when response to initial&#xD;
      treatment is assessed), weeks 35-36, and weeks 51-52. The investigators expect to identify an&#xD;
      optimal adaptive intervention for improving physical activity and cardiovascular health that&#xD;
      minimizes costs and burden to women who respond to less intensive treatments, while&#xD;
      maximizing benefits for those who need a more intensive approach.&#xD;

    <description>At Week 8, it will be determined if a women has met her physical activity step goal. If she has, then she will be classified as a responder, and will continue with the same initial treatment component for weeks 9-34 (later adoption).&#xD;
If a woman has not met her physical activity step goal she will be classified as a non-responder. In addition to the initial treatment component non-responders to initial treatments will be randomly assigned to one of two augmented treatment components: a) personal calls, or b) group meetings for Weeks 9-34 (later adoption phase).</description>
