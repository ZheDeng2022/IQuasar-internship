  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining approval from the research Ethics Committee of the Suez Canal University&#xD;
      Hospitals and written informed consent from the parents of each participant, 74 American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and ІІ children aged 3-10 years&#xD;
      scheduled for adenotonsillectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned into one of two equal groups on alternative basis using&#xD;
      closed envelope method; 37 patients for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (D): Patients who received oral dexmedetomidine (4 µg/kg) mixed with apple juice to&#xD;
      fill the syringe up to 10 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (MK): Patients who received a combination of oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and oral&#xD;
      ketamine (1 mg/kg) mixed with apple juice to fill the syringe up to 10 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I- Preoperative visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preoperative visit, the following was done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A written informed consent from the parents of each participant was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The techniques were explained to the parents including benefits and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II- Preoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Medical history:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical disorders (as diabetes, heart, chest, liver or kidney diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Past history of operations, hospitalization or blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Past anesthetic history with impact on previous airway problems during previous&#xD;
           surgeries, hypersensitivity to anesthetic medications, any previous postoperative&#xD;
           complications that could be attributed to anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Family history for specific anesthetic problems like malignant hyperthermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- General examination. 2- Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and&#xD;
      temperature). 3- Heart, chest and abdominal examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Anesthetic assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examination of the limbs for prediction of difficult cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Airway assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fasting hours: none of children were given any solid food 6 hours before the operation,&#xD;
           but they were allowed to take clear fluids, soft drink or water until 2 hours before&#xD;
           induction of anaeshesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete blood count (CBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR) and partial tissue&#xD;
           thromboplastin time (PTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III- Demograghic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's age, sex, weight, height and body mass index (BMI)were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV-Intraoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Airway devices, anesthesia machine, ventilator, flowmeters and equipments were checked&#xD;
           promptly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization: participants were randomly allocated to one of two equal groups, (group&#xD;
           D) using orally given dexmedetomidine and (group MK) using orally given&#xD;
           midazolam/ketamine using block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concealed allocation: closed envelope method for randomization containing code for&#xD;
           dexmedetomidine group (D) or midazolam/ketamine group (MK). To ensure allocation&#xD;
           concealment, the envelopes will be prepared by anesthesia nurse not involved in the&#xD;
           study. Those enrolled after written informed consent were asked to pick one concealed&#xD;
           envelope from the box and hand it over to the investigator concerned. The investigator&#xD;
           then assigned to either (D) or (MK) according to the envelope code.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding: patients were blinded after assignment to interventions and randomly assigned&#xD;
           into one of two equal groups. It was double blinded since the investigator was not aware&#xD;
           of both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the preoperative visit, the researcher explained to the child and family what was&#xD;
           done in the morning of surgery. The child was blinded to the used drug and was asked to&#xD;
           choose a sealed envelope with his/her code number inside. The name, file number and body&#xD;
           weight were recorded on the sealed envelope after been chosen. The on duty anesthetist&#xD;
           was blinded to the premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parents were not aware of the premedication components, but oriented and agreed with our&#xD;
           protocol. In the morning of operation, the study medications were prepared by a trained&#xD;
           nurse into identical 10 ml syringes that were sequentially numbered. Each labeled&#xD;
           syringe was mixed with apple juice to be given to the children. Premedication was given&#xD;
           by one of the parents under supervision of anesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Premedication phase:The attending anesthetist in pre-anesthesia area reported the onset&#xD;
           of premedication and level of sedation and the occurrence of vomiting was also&#xD;
           monitored; children who vomited were excluded from the study. Thirty minutes after&#xD;
           premedication, Parents accompanied their children till the Red-Line of the operating&#xD;
           room, but their presence in the induction room was not be permitted according to the&#xD;
           policy of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication was given orally to the children in the preanaesthetic room. (Group D) patients&#xD;
      received dexmedetomidine(4 µg/kg) mixed with apple juice to fill the syringe up to 10 ml&#xD;
      given orally and (group MK) patients received a combination of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and&#xD;
      ketamine (1 mg/kg) mixed with apple juice to fill the syringe up to 10 ml and given orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of Sedation was assessed by Sedation Score (adapted from Wilton et al)(125)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation and anxiolytics were evaluated in untouched patients. Then additional evaluation of&#xD;
      cooperation e.g. (placement of the pulse oximetry sensor, electrocardiogram electrodes and&#xD;
      mask induction of anesthesia) was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sedation score values were condensed to a variable consisting of three categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Levels 1 and 2) Unacceptable conditions. (Levels 3 and 4) Acceptable conditions. (Level 5)&#xD;
      Unacceptable deep sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The behavior of the child during preoperative period was evaluated by the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      using sedation score; the rating was performed at five different times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) 2.5 minutes after oral drug administration. (2) 5 minutes after oral drug administration.&#xD;
      (3)During separation from parents (at levels 3 and 4). (4) During introduction of the&#xD;
      anesthesia mask to the child. (5) Immediately postoperative in PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whatever satisfaction of sedation was achieved or not after 60 min, anesthesia induction was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onset of sedation was defined as: the minimum time interval necessary for the child to become&#xD;
      drowsy or asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peak sedative effect was defined as: the time interval from drug administration to reach the&#xD;
      maximum level of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of onsets of sedation and peak sedative effect were recorded. Sedation and Anxiety&#xD;
      levels were recorded every 15 min for a maximum time of 60 min after premedication In case a&#xD;
      child came to the operating room already asleep, a steal induction was attempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of drug reaction after drug administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1=Crying 2=Not crying 3=Excessive salivation 4=Sneezing 5=cough&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of drug taste by 4-point scale after oral drug administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Good 3= Bitter&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Indifferent 4= Unpleasant&#xD;
&#xD;
      6- Induction Phase: Children were transferred to the operating room; inhalational induction&#xD;
      via transparent face mask (Jackson-Rees modification of Ayer's T-piece) was done using&#xD;
      sevoflurane (Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA)started at a concentration of 1% and then&#xD;
      increased every three breaths to a maximum of 8 % in 100% oxygen (6 L /min).The anesthetist&#xD;
      asked the child to blow the balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five-point scale was used to assess Mask acceptance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = Combative, crying&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. = Moderate fear of the mask, not easily calmed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. = Cooperative with reassurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. = Calm, cooperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. = Asleep&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mask induction scores of 1 and 2 were considered unsatisfactory. Scores of 3-5 were&#xD;
           considered a successful response to premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After loss of consciousness, an intravenous line was inserted and when adequate depth of&#xD;
           anesthesia was reached, endotracheal tube of appropriate size for the age and weight of&#xD;
           the child was placed and patient was allowed to breathe spontaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7- Intraoperative Monitoring: Monitoring equipment (Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland™) was&#xD;
      connected to each patient with standard monitoring including ECG, Non invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, Respiratory Rate, Pulse oximetry, Temperature and both inspiratory and&#xD;
      end-expiratory Capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before premedication as a baseline then every 15&#xD;
      min until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8- Maintenance phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anesthetic was delivered in concentration that maintained a stable heart rate, blood&#xD;
           pressure and respiratory rate (base line ±20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sevoflurane was reduced to 1.5-2 vol% in (30: 70%) oxygen and air ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilation was assisted if the end-tidal carbon dioxide increased to ≥ 45 mmHg to be&#xD;
           stabilized between 35-40 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of procedure, anesthetic gas was discontinued and maintained on O2 100% &gt;&#xD;
           5L/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endotracheal tube was removed when the child showed adequate recovery from anesthesia;&#xD;
           child was transferred to PACU for monitoring of vital signs till discharge to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of anesthesia and before leaving operating room, assessment of recovery according&#xD;
      to Modified Aldrete Recovery Score was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate recovery was achieved if the score =10&#xD;
&#xD;
      9- Postoperative Period: Child was transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) for&#xD;
      monitoring of vital signs till discharge to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PACU, parents were allowed to remain at the child's bedside immediately upon&#xD;
      admission. A trained anesthesiologist, blinded to patient group assignment had been stayed&#xD;
      with the patient until discharge to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Pain Discomfort Score: was assessed, the intensity of pain immediately&#xD;
      postoperatively, 30, 60 and 120 min thereafter (Objective Pain Discomfort Scale &gt; 6 means&#xD;
      pain and discomfort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters of this scale were:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 = &gt; 20% preoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 = 11-20 % above preoperative 0 = &lt; 11% preoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crying:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 =Crying not responding to TLC (Tender, Loving, Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = Crying but responds to TLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 = Not crying&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moving:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 = Thrashing&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 = Restless 0 = None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavior:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 = Hysterical&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 = Mild 0 = Patient asleep or calm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal evaluation (language):&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 = Moderate pain (localizes verbally or pointing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 = Mild pain (cannot localize) 0 = Asleep or no pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of agitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The state of agitation was assessed at arrival in the recovery room 30, 60 and 120 min&#xD;
      postoperatively by means of a modified objective pain discomfort scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified objective pain Discomfort scale include movement, crying, and behavior items&#xD;
      from the full OPS. For these three items, which constituted the modified OPS, the total&#xD;
      possible score was 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agitation was defined by a total score of ≥ 3 for these three items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were discharged when they were awake, had stable vital signs for at least 1 hour,&#xD;
      had no pain or only mild pain, had not vomited for 1 hour, were able to tolerate clear fluid&#xD;
      by mouth, and had no bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of anaesthesia, duration of surgery, emergence time (time from the end of surgery&#xD;
      till extubation) and recovery time (time from extubation till discharge from recovery): were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to the first request of postoperative analgesia: was recorded. The rescue analgesic was&#xD;
      i.v.paracetamol at a dose of 15 mg/kg and if ineffective, fentanyl 0.5µg/kg bolus up to a&#xD;
      total dose of 2µg/kg was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of level of sedation (such as bradycardia, postoperative pain, shivering, PONV&#xD;
      and emergence delirium): were recorded.&#xD;
