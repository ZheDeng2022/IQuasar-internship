  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the rationale for the practice of performing an&#xD;
      oral reintroduction test without previous skin tests in children at low risk of IgE-mediated&#xD;
      reaction or drug-induced toxidermia, and to confirm the criteria for a drug reintroduction&#xD;
      test could be performed without previous skin tests, without subsequent risk of reaction for&#xD;
      the child. The primary endpoint will be the risk of a severe IgE-mediated or delayed&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction in children who received beta-lactam drug reintroduction protocol&#xD;
      prior to skin testing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children under 16 years of age coming for a consultation for a beta-lactam oral&#xD;
             reintroduction test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refusal of the legal representatives of the subject for their child to participate in&#xD;
             the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If his age permits, refusal of the subject to participate in the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject aged over 16,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of affiliation of the subject to a social security scheme,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skin tests with incriminated beta-lactam already made before the consultation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existence of contraindications to the realization of oral reintroduction drug test&#xD;
             with the suspected antibiotic,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existence of criteria in the initial reaction suggestive of a non-low risk of&#xD;
             IgE-mediated or delayed hypersensitivity to the incriminated beta-lactam, Taking&#xD;
             antihistamine, corticosteroids or beta-blockers within 5 days prior to the oral&#xD;
             reintroduction drug test,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Travel abroad of the child scheduled within 7 days of the oral reintroduction drug&#xD;
             test.&#xD;
