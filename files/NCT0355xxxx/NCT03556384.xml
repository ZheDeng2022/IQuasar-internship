&#xD;
      FDA-approved products for patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST include therapies&#xD;
      such as imatinib and sunitinib. Although there are FDA-approved products for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic GIST, these therapies are known to be ineffective in the&#xD;
      SDH-mutant/deficient subtype and no known effective therapies exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate SDH-Mutant/Deficient Gastrointestinal Stromal&#xD;
      cancer's response to the drug Temozolomide (TMZ) and aim to improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide is approved by the FDA for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide is considered experimental because it is not approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of SDH-Mutant/Deficient Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor.&#xD;

      This oncology study will be a phase 2 study for patients with advanced or metastatic GIST.&#xD;
      This study will determine overall response rate at 6 months for TMZ therapy in patients with&#xD;
      SDH-mutant/deficient GIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue for 6 months (with option to continue if benefiting treatment) or&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first). All patients&#xD;
      will have regular evaluations for assessment of safety parameters. Temozolomide dose may be&#xD;
      held and/or modified for the management of adverse treatment effects according to&#xD;
      pre-specified criteria. Patients will have radiographic imaging (CT or MRI) every 8 weeks to&#xD;
      assess tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of treatment visit for clinical evaluations and safety assessments will be performed&#xD;
      approximately 28 days (7 days) after the last dose of study drug. Patients discontinuing&#xD;
      study treatment will be followed every 3-6 months for disease recurrence and survival.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Any concurrent condition which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for&#xD;
             the subject to participate in this trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
