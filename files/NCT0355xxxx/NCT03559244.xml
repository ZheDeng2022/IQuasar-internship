  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus carinatum (PC) is a deformity of the anterior chest wall which is a common pediatric&#xD;
      condition, characterized by an idiopathic overgrowth of the costal cartilages resulting in&#xD;
      protrusion of the sternum. Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone position,&#xD;
      increased respiratory effort during exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and kyphotic&#xD;
      position are some of the physical signs and symptoms. Unlike pectus excavatum, PC is rarely&#xD;
      associated with significant cardiopulmonary involvement except in severe cases. Pectus&#xD;
      carinatum is not just a simple aesthetical problem. The effect of patient's self-esteem, body&#xD;
      image and confidence can be variable and lead to significant deterioration in mental health.&#xD;
      It can be responsible of physical signs and symptoms and also has significant psychological&#xD;
      impact. Deformity and its psychological impact tend to worsen during pubertal rapid phases of&#xD;
      growth and even during adult life. The management of pectus deformities used to include&#xD;
      surgical techniques, however, recently compression brace which is a dynamic orthosis which is&#xD;
      custom-fitted, rigid aluminum brace that is adjustable to any thoracic shape is widely&#xD;
      applied instead of surgery. Pressure applied to the patient, in the most protruding area of&#xD;
      the chest, needed to accomplish a proper shape of the thorax, the pressure of correction can&#xD;
      be measured via a pressure measuring device in pounds per square inches (PSI). Treatment&#xD;
      choices of surgery or bracing is determined according to pressure of correction and type of&#xD;
      deformity. Surgical correction is indicated if the presence of chondro-manubrial type PC and&#xD;
      pressure of correction &gt; 10 PSI. Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone&#xD;
      position, increased respiratory effort during exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and&#xD;
      kyphotic position are some of the physical signs and symptoms. Despite the fact that patients&#xD;
      with PC have impaired posture, exercise intolerance and increased scoliosis occurrence, there&#xD;
      is no consensus on the exercise program for patients with PC. Also, there is not enough&#xD;
      scientific evidence about the wear time of orthosis. The aim of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of exercises and compression brace in children with PC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pectus carinatum (PC) is a deformity of the anterior chest wall which is a common pediatric&#xD;
      condition, characterized by an idiopathic overgrowth of the costal cartilages resulting in&#xD;
      protrusion of the sternum. There are two subtypes of PC: the chondro-gladiolar variant, which&#xD;
      is the most common type, and presents with protrusion of the sternal body, and the&#xD;
      chondro-manubrial variant, showing protrusion of the component of the sternum (manubrium). PC&#xD;
      usually involves the lower sternal costal cartilages, pushing the sternum forwards and can be&#xD;
      symmetrical (bilateral) or often asymmetrical (unilateral) with the right for some reason&#xD;
      being more obviously affected. PC may occur as a solitary abnormality or in association with&#xD;
      other genetic disorders or syndromes (eg, trisomy 18, Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria,&#xD;
      Morquio syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Of the musculoskeletal abnormalities,&#xD;
      scoliosis is most frequently associated with PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone position, increased respiratory&#xD;
      effort during exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and kyphotic position are some of the&#xD;
      physical signs and symptoms. Unlike pectus excavatum, PC is rarely associated with&#xD;
      significant cardiopulmonary involvement except in severe cases. Pectus carinatum is not just&#xD;
      a simple aesthetical problem. It can be responsible of physical signs and symptoms and also&#xD;
      has significant psychological impact. Deformity and its psychological impact tend to worsen&#xD;
      during pubertal rapid phases of growth and even during adult life. It has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that patients with PC are at risk for a disturbed body image and reduced quality of life and&#xD;
      many patients refer feelings of discomfort, shame, shyness, anxiety, and even depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classical management of pectus deformities, both carinatum and excavatum, has been&#xD;
      primarily surgical. Modification of the Ravitch technique involves resection of the deformed&#xD;
      costal cartilages along with sternal osteotomy. Because the results of this technique&#xD;
      resulted in worse cosmetic results, a new less invasive procedure, the Nuss procedure was&#xD;
      developed. Nuss procedure includes remodeling of the chest wall cartilage with an internal&#xD;
      support bar. These techniques have demonstrated the plasticity of the chest wall and led&#xD;
      clinicians to hypothesize that carinatum defects would also remodel in response to chronic&#xD;
      pressure, leading to a cosmetically superior, nonoperative technique: compression brace.&#xD;
      Compression brace is a dynamic orthosis which is custom-fitted, rigid aluminum brace that is&#xD;
      adjustable to any thoracic shape. Complications of brace use include uncommon (4.6%), mild&#xD;
      and easy to resolve: back pain, hematoma and skin ulceration. Pressure of correction is the&#xD;
      pressure applied to the patient, in the most protruding area of the chest, needed to&#xD;
      accomplish a proper shape of the thorax. It is an indirect parameter of the chest wall's&#xD;
      flexibility. It can be measured with a pressure measuring device in pounds per square inches&#xD;
      (PSI). Some special designed braces contain a part in which pressure measuring device can be&#xD;
      docked. This enables measuring of pressure of treatment. Pressure of treatment can be&#xD;
      different from pressure of correction since skin breakdown occurs with corrections at high&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Calgary protocol, wearing brace 23 hours a day during the correction phase until the&#xD;
      development of the axial skeleton is completed and afterwards 8 hours of wear is recommended&#xD;
      in the continuation phase.Martinez-Ferro et al developed pressure measuring device and&#xD;
      special designed braces contain a part in which pressure measuring device can be docked. They&#xD;
      suggested that patients with pressure of correction &lt;10 should be braced. De Beer et al. also&#xD;
      recommended the surgical treatment in the presence of chondro-manubrial type PC and pressure&#xD;
      of correction &gt; 10 PSI. However, recommendations are based on prospective or retrospective&#xD;
      cohort studies other than randomized controlled trials which corresponds to low level of&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that patients with PC have impaired posture, exercise intolerance and&#xD;
      increased scoliosis occurrence, there is no consensus on the exercise program for patients&#xD;
      with PC. Postural impairment aggravates psychological burden caused by disease itself.&#xD;
      Patients with pectus carinatum may get benefit from exercises to improve posture. Also,&#xD;
      disease itself or compression brace use may result in abdominal flare and increased lateral&#xD;
      diameter of chest wall as an unwanted effect. Strengthening of abdominal muscles may prevent&#xD;
      from abdominal flare. Strengthening of chest wall muscles, strengthening the pectoralis and&#xD;
      sacrospinalis muscles as well as expanding the chest through deep breathing, strengthening&#xD;
      core muscles including abdominal muscles, increasing flexibility of muscles, manipulation and&#xD;
      mobilization of costae may lead improvements in the management of PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus about exercises, and there is not enough scientific evidence about the&#xD;
      wear time of orthosis. The existing treatment protocols are non-standardized protocols&#xD;
      developed by the researchers of previous studies investigating the effectiveness of orthosis.&#xD;
      Martinez-Ferro et al., the developer of the dynamic compression brace, recommends the daytime&#xD;
      wear of orthosis for patients with low pressure of correction. They recommend duration of&#xD;
      clothing to be shorter and the pressure of treatment should be kept lower in patients with&#xD;
      high pressure of correction. However, every compression brace may not contain dock and&#xD;
      pressure of treatment cannot be measured. In the present study we aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of exercises and compression brace in children with PC. Also, safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of the orthosis will be evaluated. Patients with chondro-gladiolar, symmetrical or&#xD;
      asymmetric, compressible PC (compression test positive) and with correction pressure ≤10 PSI,&#xD;
      aged 5-18 years old will be included to study. They will be randomized to three groups using&#xD;
      closed envelope system. All groups will be given exercises to strengthen the muscles of the&#xD;
      respiratory muscles of the posture exercises, deep breathing exercises, ribs manipulation and&#xD;
      mobilization exercises and core exercises for 1 hour a day, five days a week for 3 weeks. The&#xD;
      first group will use the orthosis for 8 hours during the night and the second group for 23&#xD;
      hours except for sports activities, exercise and bath. The control group who will receive&#xD;
      exercise therapy only will be selected from the wait-in list for the orthosis. Pectus&#xD;
      carinatum protrusion, pressure of correction, anteroposterior and lateral diameter of thorax&#xD;
      at the most protruded part of deformity, Haller index, Cobb and kyphosis angle, Pectus&#xD;
      Evaluation Questionnaire will be assessed at before treatment and after treatment, 1 month&#xD;
      and 3 months and 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
