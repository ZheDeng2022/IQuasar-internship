  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to examine energy metabolism in patients with pulmonary MAC and clarify the causes of&#xD;
      emaciation. We will also investigate the following: the relation between energy metabolism&#xD;
      and degree of pulmonary MAC progression; relations among hospitalization, mortality rate, and&#xD;
      time-course of changes in energy metabolism; and factors that affect energy metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pulmonary MAC with a lower BMI than healthy individuals also have a&#xD;
      significantly poorer prognosis than those of normal weight. Emaciation in such patients is&#xD;
      thought to be caused by destruction of lung structure from disease progression and an&#xD;
      increased resting metabolic rate caused by the increased load from breathing; however, causes&#xD;
      of emaciation and details of energy metabolism in these patients have not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elucidating details of energy metabolism and causes of emaciation in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      MAC could provide the basis for improvement in nutritional status and activities of daily&#xD;
      living through early nutrition therapy and rehabilitation. We propose to clarify the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy metabolism in patients with pulmonary MAC, including resting metabolic rate, calorie&#xD;
      intake and consumption, and hormonal secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relation between energy metabolism and degree of pulmonary MAC progression.&#xD;
