    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a multifactorial disease caused by mainly bacterial, genetic,&#xD;
      immunological, and environmental factors. Chronic periodontitis, one of the widely prevalent&#xD;
      forms of periodontal disease, is characterized by loss of attachment apparatus of the tooth;&#xD;
      it can lead to tooth loss. Many non surgical and surgical approaches have been adapted time&#xD;
      and again to prevent, intercept, and to treat the various forms of chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
      But, these treatment modalities are not approachable by all individuals, because of the&#xD;
      various factors such as: low socioeconomic status, illiteracy, high cost of the treatment, no&#xD;
      availability of easy and uncomplicated treatment nearby etc. Considering these factors, there&#xD;
      are still a need of preventive, practical, and affordable treatment options specially for the&#xD;
      population of underdeveloped and developing countries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory process accompanied by destruction of&#xD;
      attachment apparatus of tooth and may lead to loss of teeth. It is a multifactorial disease,&#xD;
      dental plaque being considered as primary etiologic factor in initiation and progression of&#xD;
      disease. Control of periodontal disease by eliminating all pathogenic organisms of the&#xD;
      microflora is, as yet, impossible but, it is theoretically an attractive aspect. Based on&#xD;
      epidemiological studies there is a very strong correlation between the localization of&#xD;
      dentogingival plaque and periodontal disease. Studies have clearly demonstrated that the&#xD;
      ability to control the onset or progression of periodontal diseases is improved by regular&#xD;
      plaque control practices. Although data shows that oral health can be improved through&#xD;
      effective plaque control by mechanical means of cleaning but it fails to deliver optimal&#xD;
      levels of oral health because the techniques are not being practiced consistently or&#xD;
      thoroughly by all the individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, various antimicrobial compounds have been investigated for their&#xD;
      effectiveness to control plaque, but, chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) is still being&#xD;
      considered to be the most effective plaque inhibitor against which other antiplaque agents&#xD;
      are measured. Chlorhexidine mouthwash is regarded as Gold standard mouthwash but has many&#xD;
      local side effects: extrinsic brown staining of teeth and tongue, taste disturbance, enhanced&#xD;
      supragingival calculus formation, desquamation of oral mucosa, and even liver damage in rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness of chlorhexidine also matters especially in underdeveloped and developing&#xD;
      countries where prevalence ratio of periodontal diseases are very high. The prevalence of&#xD;
      gingivitis and periodontitis, along with their severity and rate of progression is found to&#xD;
      vary worldwide; high in developing countries with approximately 80% prevalence in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plant essential oils (EO) have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for chronic&#xD;
      gingivitis and periodontitis conditions that have both bacterial and inflammatory components.&#xD;
      These are useful as their long term daily use has no adverse effects on the health of an&#xD;
      individual. Also, these are more cost-effective and easily available as over-the-counter&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is need of the hour / high time to conduct the research work on various traditional oral&#xD;
      hygiene practices / medicines to see their efficacy in the field of periodontics, as various&#xD;
      uses of traditional medicine are still untouched &amp; unexplored and few/no any such scientific&#xD;
      documents are available, worldwide. And thus, attempts should be made to search for an&#xD;
      alternative; Antiplaque, Plaque inhibitory, Anti gingivitis, Host modulating agent, and any&#xD;
      other way acting on various levels of prevention of Gingival / Periodontal diseases by using&#xD;
      traditional oral hygiene practices/ indigenous products/ homemade remedies/ medicines for&#xD;
      maintenance of oral hygiene. Such research work may not only give an alternate antiplaque /&#xD;
      plaque inhibitory, and anti-gingivitis agents but, at the same time may give different&#xD;
      avenues in imparting treatment modalities on various levels of prevention of Gingival and&#xD;
      Periodontal diseases. They may be more effective, more practical, less time consuming, and&#xD;
      within the reach of each &amp; every individual of the world in comparison to gold standard&#xD;
      'Chlorhexidine Gluconate Mouthrinse' and various other expensive therapeutic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) (Family: Fabaceae) is one of the most important herbs and has&#xD;
      been commonly utilised as ayurvedic medicine. It has been described as 'The grandfather of&#xD;
      herbs' (Ody, 2000). In almost every Indian household you may find this herb chewed whenever&#xD;
      someone's voice goes down. The earliest evidence regarding the use of licorice comes from the&#xD;
      samples of licorice found in the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs, including those found in tomb of&#xD;
      King Tut (1343 to 1325 BC). The main usage of licorice as a medicinal plant in European&#xD;
      culture have been in the treatment of peptic ulcers and bronchial catarrhs. In Chinese herbal&#xD;
      medicine, licorice is used as an expectorant, an analgesic, drug to treat asthma, drug to&#xD;
      alleviate abscesses and abdominal pain. Licorice, since years is known for its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antiprotozoal, antioxidative, hepatoprotective,&#xD;
      cardioprotective, immunomodulatory and antitumour activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been some indications that suggests licorice can be beneficial for oral health. One&#xD;
      of the most important research has focussed on the benefits of water extract of licorice root&#xD;
      for treatment of apthous ulcers. Glycyrrhizin, the sweet component of licorice root has&#xD;
      antiplaque property. Pterocarpenes isolated from G. uralensis root extract exerts an&#xD;
      antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans. So far, hardly any study has been&#xD;
      conducted to see the antiplaque and antigingivitis effect of licorice as a traditional&#xD;
      medicinal herb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life cannot exist without salt. Salt in various forms is being used since ages. 'Salt water'&#xD;
      has been used by many cultures over countless generations to clean wounds and rinse mouths.&#xD;
      Use of hot salt water rinsing is in practice to reduce the symptoms of pain in both gums and&#xD;
      throat. It is also being routinely recommended following dental extraction, to keep food&#xD;
      debris out of healing wounds and to reduce the incidence of alveolar osteitis. The antiseptic&#xD;
      and bactericidal qualities of salt help in removing plaque which is a cause of gingivitis and&#xD;
      caries. Warming water with a pinch of table salt can reduce or even be an alternative to&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs intra-orally. Its high osmolality reduces inflammation and can be&#xD;
      microbicidal. Moreover, efficacy of luke warm hypertonic salt solution has shown&#xD;
      antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties but its antiplaque efficacy&#xD;
      is yet to be established with stabilised formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Above stated background have stimulated and encouraged us to conduct the study so,&#xD;
      theinvestigators hypothesized the antiplaque efficacy of Licorice extract mouthrinse (LE) ,&#xD;
      5% Hypertonic salt solution (HSS) as mouth rinses. Hence, the investigators planned this&#xD;
      study titled &quot;Evaluation of Antiplaque Efficacy of Licorice Extract Mouthrinse &amp; 5%&#xD;
      Hypertonic Salt Solution and their Comparison with Essential Oil &amp; Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      Mouthrinses-An Invitro &amp; Invivo Study&quot; with aforementioned aims and objectives.&#xD;
