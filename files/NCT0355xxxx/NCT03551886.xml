    <textblock>
      Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are vulnerable to substance substance use disorder&#xD;
      (SUD). This developmental period, termed &quot;emerging adulthood&quot; includes leaving home, entering&#xD;
      college or working for the first time; and for some, aging out of foster care or state&#xD;
      custody, which end at age 18. The emerging-adulthood period is prime for experimentation with&#xD;
      substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems. A major challenge for TAY is&#xD;
      the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of&#xD;
      this stage of life. Indeed, substance use can be a short-term way to regulate emotion. The&#xD;
      importance of ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition&#xD;
      to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a&#xD;
      major challenge. In the phase 1 project a mobile app was developed that uses automated&#xD;
      emotion detection to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD. We found&#xD;
      positive results in our phase 1 study. Phase 2 will see the continuation of the development&#xD;
      of the app features. Phase 2 also includes a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the app&#xD;
      among TAY with SUD in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and&#xD;
      post-evaluation to compare outcomes between the app condition and a control-app condition.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are substance use and emotion regulation. User satisfaction, feedback at&#xD;
      the end of phase 2 and app metrics will also be explored. The app can potentially have major&#xD;
      public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY's ability to become more aware&#xD;
      of emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via emotion-focused technoloy. If the&#xD;
      product is successful it could be expanded to other populations.&#xD;

      Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use,&#xD;
      misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the &quot;age of&#xD;
      instability&quot; and &quot;emerging adulthood&quot; includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college;&#xD;
      identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes;&#xD;
      coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which&#xD;
      end at age 18. The emerging-adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and&#xD;
      the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the&#xD;
      influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm,&#xD;
      and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the&#xD;
      capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of&#xD;
      this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate&#xD;
      emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion&#xD;
      regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental&#xD;
      literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful&#xD;
      transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is&#xD;
      itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their&#xD;
      feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health&#xD;
      disorders that often co-occur with SUD. The phase 1 project developed and evaluated a mobile&#xD;
      app that uses exciting new technology (automated emotion detection) to help TAY better&#xD;
      recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. Highly positive results were found in&#xD;
      the phase 1 feasibility / pilot study and are now proposing a phase 2 project to continue&#xD;
      this work. In phase 2 the app will continue to be developed based on user experience based on&#xD;
      end-user feedback and an expert consultant team. Phase 2 also includes a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the app among TAY with SUD. They will have six weeks to use the&#xD;
      app in their natural environment, such as home, and will complete pre- and post-evaluation&#xD;
      using validated instrumts to compare outcomes between two conditions: the app condition and a&#xD;
      control-app condition. The primary outcomes are substance use and emotion regulation.&#xD;
      End-user satisfaction with the app will also be obtained as well as app metrics. The app&#xD;
      product could have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY's&#xD;
      ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an&#xD;
      exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be&#xD;
      expanded to other populations. The collaborative team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical&#xD;
      innovations, technology, and app development.&#xD;
