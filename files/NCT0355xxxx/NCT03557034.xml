    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation is a widely used strategy for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation. After successful pulmonary vein isolation (no atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation on transtelephonic rhythm recordings for 3 months following ablation), heart&#xD;
      rhythm is not routinely monitored. The goal of this study is to determine whether the Kardia&#xD;
      Mobile device detects AF at a different rate compared to our standard of care. The study also&#xD;
      hopes to understand how this Kardia Mobile device and Kardia Pro platform affect health care&#xD;
      utilization and patient anxiety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a widely used strategy for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). After ablation, patients are usually discharged with&#xD;
      transtelephonic monitor. Patients are encouraged to send their electrophysiologist&#xD;
      transmissions of their heart rhythm at least once a week or anytime they have symptoms. After&#xD;
      3-4 months of remote monitoring, patients come for their first visit after the ablation. At&#xD;
      this visit, the electrophysiologist reviews the heart rhythm transmissions since the ablation&#xD;
      and based on the findings, decisions are made regarding anticoagulation or antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      drug therapy. If all transmissions show sinus rhythm and the patient is doing well, he or she&#xD;
      is normally followed clinically based on symptoms without any rhythm monitors. Usually, these&#xD;
      patients follow up in another 6 months with an ECG at the time of the visit with the caring&#xD;
      electrophysiologist. During these 6 months, patients might experience palpitations or&#xD;
      recurrent arrhythmias. These episodes usually trigger phone encounters with the provider and&#xD;
      this can trigger additional testing. Sometimes it might lead to clinic or emergency room&#xD;
      encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kardia Mobile is an FDA approved device that allows one lead ECG recording for 30 seconds&#xD;
      using the patient's smart phone. The device has a built-in algorithm that detects AF.&#xD;
      KardiaPro is a secure platform that allows the physician to access the patient's recording at&#xD;
      any time. The platform can also be programmed to send a notification to the healthcare&#xD;
      provider if AF is detected by the software. The goal of our study is to determine whether&#xD;
      detection of AF with Kardia Mobile is different than the current standard approach and to&#xD;
      assess the value of using Kardia Mobile and the KardiaPro platform in decreasing health care&#xD;
      utilization and reducing patient anxiety following AF ablation.&#xD;

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 is a scale to measure the severity of anxiety. It consists of asking patients to respond to a simple questionnaire and each answer is assigned a point based on the frequency of a given symptom (0=Not at all, 1=Several days, 2= More than half the days, 3=Nearly everyday). Total scores ranging from 0 to 21 with higher scores reflecting greater anxiety severity. A total score of 5-9 indicates mild anxiety, 10-14 moderate anxiety, and &gt;15 severe anxiety.</description>

This is our current standard of care for following patients after successful AF ablation. Patients will be followed clinically based on symptoms (no monitor is provided). They will be seen for follow up 6 months after enrollment into the study. During these 6 months, patients can call if they have symptoms. The caring team will order any additional testing or monitors as deemed necessary by the patient's primary electrophysiologist. At the 6 months follow up visit with the patient's primary electrophysiologist, a 12 lead ECG is performed. The GAD7 will be administered at this visit.</description>

Score ranges 0 - 6. Oral anticoagulation is recommended for those patients with a score of 2 or greater, and oral anticoagulant or aspirin may be considered for a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1.</description>

This is our current standard of care for following patients after successful AF ablation. Patients will be followed clinically based on symptoms (no monitor is provided). They will be seen for follow up 6 months after enrollment into the study. During these 6 months, patients can call if they have symptoms. The caring team will order any additional testing or monitors as deemed necessary by the patient's primary electrophysiologist. At the 6 months follow up visit with the patient's primary electrophysiologist, a 12 lead ECG is performed. The GAD7 will be administered at this visit.</description>

        <title>Change in Level of Anxiety From the Date of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation to the End of Study Period</title>
        <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 is a scale to measure the severity of anxiety. It consists of asking patients to respond to a simple questionnaire and each answer is assigned a point based on the frequency of a given symptom (0=Not at all, 1=Several days, 2= More than half the days, 3=Nearly everyday). Total scores ranging from 0 to 21 with higher scores reflecting greater anxiety severity. A total score of 5-9 indicates mild anxiety, 10-14 moderate anxiety, and &gt;15 severe anxiety.</description>

            <description>Standard of Care&#xD;
This is our current standard of care for following patients after successful AF ablation. Patients will be followed clinically based on symptoms (no monitor is provided). They will be seen for follow up 6 months after enrollment into the study. During these 6 months, patients can call if they have symptoms. The caring team will order any additional testing or monitors as deemed necessary by the patient's primary electrophysiologist. At the 6 months follow up visit with the patient's primary electrophysiologist, a 12 lead ECG is performed. The GAD7 will be administered at this visit.</description>

            <description>Kardia Mobile/Kardia Pro&#xD;
Kardia Monitoring: Kardia Mobile is an FDA approved device that allows one lead ECG recording for 30 seconds using the patient's smart phone. The device has a built-in algorithm that detects AF. KardiaPro is a secure platform that allows the physician to access the patient's recording at any time. The platform can also be programmed to send a notification to the healthcare provider if AF is detected by the software.</description>
