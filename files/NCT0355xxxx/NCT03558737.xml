  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight infants are at increased risk of requiring prolonged duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and multiple intubations, both of which are risk factors for&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury and BPD. Thus, it is important to investigate respiratory&#xD;
      support methods that are able to effectively oxygenate and ventilate these high risk preterm&#xD;
      infants while reducing their risk of lung injury. Nasal high-frequency ventilation is one&#xD;
      potential intervention that may decrease the risk of respiratory failure in very low birth&#xD;
      weight infants. Small studies have shown effective respiratory support over short time&#xD;
      periods in infants, however these studies use nasal high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge there is no published studies looking at the use of nasal&#xD;
      high-frequency jet ventilation in this high risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of non-invasive high frequency ventilation (HFV) has been described as a rescue method&#xD;
      following failure of other non-invasive ventilator modes or as a means to increase the&#xD;
      success post-extubation. When used as invasive high frequency ventilation, high frequency&#xD;
      oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) utilize&#xD;
      supraphysiologic respiratory rates and small tidal volumes which has been shown to inflict&#xD;
      less lung injury than conventional modes of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a mechanical newborn lung model, nasal HFV has improved CO2 removal when compared to&#xD;
      conventional NIPPV. Animal studies in the lab of Kurt Albertine have shown improved&#xD;
      ventilation and oxygenation in the high frequency nasal ventilation group versus the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation group in a preterm lamb model leading towards better alveolar&#xD;
      formation noted histologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that extubation of very preterm infants to nHFJV will&#xD;
      significantly decrease the rates of reintubation compared to those infants extubated to&#xD;
      NIPPV.&#xD;
