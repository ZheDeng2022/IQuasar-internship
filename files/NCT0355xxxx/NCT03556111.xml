      The aim is to evaluate the value and efficiency of sticky bone in the augmentation of&#xD;
      alveolar ridge deficiency when being used with or without xenogenic bone graft for esthetic&#xD;
      implant placement.&#xD;

      Modern Dentistry aims to restore what is missing, no matter what the difficulty is. As many&#xD;
      patients have lost their teeth to a number of factors, either trauma or disease or lack of&#xD;
      care. Now the individuals are seeking to restore the function and esthetics. The more the&#xD;
      number of teeth is missing along with ridge deficiencies can present serious challenges to&#xD;
      the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant supported prosthesis is an attractive option for restoring edentulous or partially&#xD;
      edentulous patients. However, extensive loss of the alveolar bone is a complex problem that&#xD;
      faces many surgeons. This era has witnessed numerous trials and research for bone&#xD;
      augmentation for the defective alveolar ridge. The goal is to create sufficient space for&#xD;
      endosseous implant placement in a knife edge ridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alveolar bone resorption occurs in either a horizontal or vertical direction. It can also be&#xD;
      composite. There are 3 classes of bone-grafting materials based upon the mode of action.&#xD;
      Autogenous bone is an organic material and forms bone by osteogenesis, osteoinduction, and&#xD;
      osteoconduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allografts such as demineralized freeze-dried bone are osteoinductive and osteoconductive and&#xD;
      may be cortical and/or trabecular in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alloplasts such as hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate may be synthetic or natural, vary&#xD;
      in size, and are only osteoconductive. They can be divided into three types based upon the&#xD;
      porosity of the product and include dense, macroporous, and microporous materials. In&#xD;
      addition, alloplastic materials may be crystalline or amorphous. These materials have&#xD;
      different properties and therefore indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that although the autogenous bone is considered as the Gold&#xD;
      Standard of bone grafting for its osteogenic potential, many drawbacks exist which limits its&#xD;
      application. For instance, donor site morbidity is of concern. Bone harvesting procedures may&#xD;
      put adjacent anatomical structures at a risk of damage. During chin bone harvesting, the&#xD;
      mental nerve may be pulled under undue traction and the incisive nerve become interrupted&#xD;
      when the harvesting depth is inordinate. Ramus bone harvesting can damage the inferior&#xD;
      alveolar nerve. In addition, some patients may be reluctant to the harvesting procedures,&#xD;
      especially when extra-oral donor sites are concerned. General anesthesia is mandatory for&#xD;
      such operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research studies have looked into modifying the surgical techniques in order to regain&#xD;
      the space for an implant along with finding satisfying esthetic outcomes. The literature&#xD;
      shows the positive use of ridge splitting technique and alveolar distractors, with or without&#xD;
      the aid of xenograft material and/or alloplastic material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from the early 2000s, a new drift of guided bone regeneration research blew by.&#xD;
      Platelet concentrates (PC); platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF)] were&#xD;
      used for surgical procedures in medical and dental fields, particularly in Oral and&#xD;
      Maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery and sports medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were utilized to accelerate healing of bone graft over the bony defects, many techniques&#xD;
      utilizing platelet and ﬁbrinogen concentrations have been introduced in the literature.&#xD;
      Platelet is known to contain high quantities of growth factors, such as transforming growth 4&#xD;
      . Factors ß-1 (TGFß-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epithelial growth factor&#xD;
      (EGF), insulin growth factor-I (IFG-I) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), which&#xD;
      stimulates cell proliferation and upregulates angiogenesis.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be a Sticky bone augmentation of defect. It is prepared using particulate autologous graft only along with fibrin glue and growth factors obtained from the patients' blood.&#xD;
The sample is withdrawn and placed in plastic tubes which are spun twice in a centrifuge at a certain speed and time. The first spin to obtain the fibrin glue and the second to obtain the growth factors. The mixture is added to the harvested autogenous bone to form a semi-solid bone graft that is easily manipulated in the recipient site.</description>

The venous blood sample is placed in plastic tubes to be centrifuged at a certain speed and time to obtain the fibrin glue and growth factors.&#xD;
