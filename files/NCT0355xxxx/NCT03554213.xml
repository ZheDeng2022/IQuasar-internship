      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a government-led typhoid conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine introduction program on typhoid disease burden in Navi Mumbai, India.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new generation of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) have been shown to be safe and provide&#xD;
      long-lasting immunity in children. In India, Typbar TCV Vi-TT (Vi capsular polysaccharide&#xD;
      conjugated with tetanus toxoid protein) is manufactured by Bharat Biotech International&#xD;
      Limited (BBIL). Immunogenicity studies by BBIL showed &gt;90% detectable antibodies to Typbar&#xD;
      TCV vaccine at 42 days and &gt;70% at 720 days in persons 2-45 years old. A single dose of&#xD;
      vaccine was effective in children 6-23 months old with 98% seroconversion at 42 days and&#xD;
      persistent high antibody titers at 720 days. Another randomized controlled trial study by&#xD;
      University of Oxford tested Vi-TT with a human challenge model of typhoid fever in which&#xD;
      participants ingested Salmonella Typhi after vaccination. Typhoid fever was diagnosed by&#xD;
      clinical criteria and/or positive blood culture at 2 weeks in 77% of controls (n=31) as&#xD;
      compared to 35% in the Vi-TT group (n=37) to give vaccine efficacy of 54% (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of 26-71). Typbar TCV has been licensed in India for children &gt;6 months old since&#xD;
      2013 and is currently used in the private sector. In January 2018, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) recommended the use of typhoid conjugate vaccines especially in those&#xD;
      countries with the highest burden of disease and the highest burden of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance. However, there are no field effectiveness studies yet for Typbar TCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a hybrid facility- and community-based typhoid surveillance strategy will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the impact of a government-led typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction&#xD;
      program on typhoid disease burden in Navi Mumbai, India. Navi Mumbai is a metropolitan area&#xD;
      extending from Mumbai with approximately 1.4 million people and wide demographic and&#xD;
      socioeconomic strata, including slums. Navi Mumbai is comprised of 13 area nodes, and 8 of&#xD;
      these nodes are under the jurisdiction of the local government body, Navi Mumbai Municipal&#xD;
      Corporation (NMMC). Navi Mumbai has high enteric fever burden: a 2008 study found 98 blood&#xD;
      culture-confirmed pediatric cases over 16 months in 2 hospitals with a majority of isolates&#xD;
      exhibiting multi-drug resistance. Data from one private laboratory in 2015 showed over 225 S.&#xD;
      Typhi cases including 3 cases with ceftriaxone resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMMC has decided to introduce TCV into public sector routine immunization services and will&#xD;
      vaccinate all children 9 months to &lt;15 years old within its jurisdiction - estimated 390,000&#xD;
      children - with TCV over 2 years. NMMC government officials are collaborating with&#xD;
      researchers from WHO India, Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Stanford University to implement the TCV&#xD;
      introduction in a two-phase cluster-randomized program in order to allow rigorous evaluation&#xD;
      of population impact. NMMC has 22 urban health posts (UHPs) that give routine childhood&#xD;
      immunizations. UHPs were first grouped into 3 strata based on % of population living in&#xD;
      slums: low, medium, or high. Half of the UHPs within each stratum were then randomly selected&#xD;
      to receive TCV in 2018 (Phase 1) and the remaining UHPs to receive TCV one year later in 2019&#xD;
      (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation studies of NMMC's TCV introduction program include: impact on blood-culture&#xD;
      confirmed typhoid fever; impact on clinical syndromes of febrile illness; vaccine safety;&#xD;
      vaccine efficacy; vaccination campaign coverage and acceptability surveys; environmental&#xD;
      water contamination with Salmonella Typhi; seroconversion associated with typhoid infection;&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of typhoid conjugate vaccination campaign.&#xD;

      -  In the hospital surveillance component, blood cultures will be collected and tested for&#xD;
           Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi. Purified bacterial isolates of Salmonella Typhi and&#xD;
           Paratyphi will be tested for antimicrobial resistance and stored for possible future&#xD;
           genetic/genomic testing of the bacterial DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a subset of the community surveillance component, dried blood spots will be collected&#xD;
           onto filter paper and stored to test for antibodies against typhoid.&#xD;

        The focus of this study is children age 6 months to 16 years living in areas governed by&#xD;
        Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC). The age range of children eligible to receive&#xD;
        typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in NMMC's TCV introduction program is 9 months to 15 years.&#xD;
        For community surveys, only households with children &lt;16 years old will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The evaluation study will examine a slightly broader age range than NMMC's TCV vaccination&#xD;
        program because TCV is licensed for &gt;6 month old children and because the vaccine&#xD;
        introduction will occur over 1 year thus the oldest eligible children will be 16 years old&#xD;
        at study end.&#xD;
