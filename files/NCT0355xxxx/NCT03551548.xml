      Study hypothesis : Pre-operative aldosterone receptor blockade may reduce post-operative&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurrence within 5 days after coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery (CABG) ± aortic valve replacement (AVR) without any heart failure or any mitral&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy criterion : occurrence of POAF occurring from randomization and within 5&#xD;
      days after surgery, assess, in a standardized manner, by continuous ECG monitoring (during&#xD;
      the ICU stay) or Holter-ECG monitoring (during the stepdown unit stay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To establish whether pre-operative administration of spironolactone leads&#xD;
      to a reduction in POAF incidence occurring from randomization and within 5 days after&#xD;
      surgery, compared with placebo, in patients referred for on-pump elective CABG surgery ± AVR&#xD;
      without heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design : Phase III drug trial - Randomized, double blind, multicentre, prospective&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in surgical and perioperative care, postoperative complications after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery remain frequent, leading to substantial increases in mortality, morbidity,&#xD;
      and costs. Postoperatively, 30% of patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)&#xD;
      present atrial fibrillation (AF). The presence of POAF is associated with a greater short and&#xD;
      long term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (death, stroke, heart failure, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction) and is at the origin of a significant increase in hospitalization stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms underlying POAF are multifactorial and complex but require at least the&#xD;
      presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate, cardiac fibrosis and electrical remodelling.&#xD;
      Aldosterone is a key component in this context. The link between aldosterone, cardiac&#xD;
      fibrosis and adverse electrical remodelling is now very well established and a significant&#xD;
      association between plasma aldosterone levels, MRA and AF incidence is now well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study, the investigators established the relationship between preoperative&#xD;
      plasma aldosterone levels and post-operative AF occurrence in patients addressed for CABG&#xD;
      without any systolic heart failure or mitral valve surgery associated (NCT 02814903). The&#xD;
      investigators have thus demonstrated that plasma aldosterone levels were strongly predictive&#xD;
      of post-operative AF occurrence. These results permitted to establish a risk score called&#xD;
      &quot;Aldoscore&quot; (including the patient's age and the aldosterone level) to detect patients at&#xD;
      high risk to develop post-operative AF. The investigators also validated this score in an&#xD;
      independent and external Japanese population issued from the NU-HIT trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to perform a randomized, multicenter, double-blind versus placebo study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of spironolactone administrated 14 days before heart surgery and&#xD;
      continued during 30 days after surgery, on POAF incidence in patients referred for CABG&#xD;
      without any heart failure or mitral valve surgery associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALDOCURE trial will be a multicenter, landmark, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial of the MRA, spironolactone, in 1500 adults referred for on-pump elective CABG surgery ±&#xD;
      AVR without any heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each center, all patients referred for CABG ± AVR will be systematically considered for&#xD;
      inclusion. After assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria and following collection of&#xD;
      the patient's written consent, the 1500 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      receive 25 mg oral spironolactone once daily or placebo on top of standard therapy, started&#xD;
      14 ± 4 days before cardiac surgery and continued during 30 days after surgery. All subjects&#xD;
      are to be treated using the most adapted therapy based on international guidelines. Such&#xD;
      treatments may also be adjusted by the local medical practitioner, if necessary.&#xD;
      Investigators and patients will be aware of study group allocation. The randomization will be&#xD;
      done via an e-CRF randomization system and will be stratified by center using random&#xD;
      sequences of block sizes to keep the treatment group sizes similar. All randomized subjects&#xD;
      will be followed even if study drug is discontinued ahead of schedule, except in the case&#xD;
      that the subject refuses to participate further in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial duration is 3 years, with 1 month of follow-up and a total duration participation&#xD;
      for the patient of 44 ± 4 days. Follow-up study visits are summarized in the flow chart 1.&#xD;
      Patients will begin the treatment (spironolactone or placebo) at V0 and continue until V3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary endpoints can be found in the dedicated sections. The study&#xD;
      population will include those who meet the inclusion criteria (see in the dedicated&#xD;
      sections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria can be found in the dedicated sections. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and at each follow-up visits and a continuous ECG monitoring (in the&#xD;
      ICU or by Holter-ECG in the stepdown unit stay) will be performed during the first 5 days&#xD;
      after surgery to detect AF. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, before&#xD;
      randomization, at the planned preoperative assessment, to measure aldosterone level added to&#xD;
      other classical examinations. Blood sample will be then stored in the Caen University CRB for&#xD;
      later use in ancillary studies. All clinical endpoints will be adjudicated by a clinical&#xD;
      events committee in a blinded fashion. The 25 mg dose of spironolactone was evoked to reduce&#xD;
      the risks and side-effects associated with this drug and according to previous clinical trial&#xD;
      using this drug in a cardiovascular context. The DSMB will be meeting at least twice (for the&#xD;
      intermediate analyses after the first 460 and 918 inclusions) to ensure the continued&#xD;
      scientific validity and merit of the study but it also will be able to be convened at any&#xD;
      time in case of any safety event occurrence. The DSMB chair will be notified of any events&#xD;
      considered probable or definitely related to study drug occurring from randomization and&#xD;
      until the end of the study. At the time of notification, he/she will determine if an&#xD;
      additional DSMB meeting is required. The study will be conducted according to the provisions&#xD;
      of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)&#xD;
      Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable national and local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALDOCURE will assess the cardiovascular benefit of a low-cost aldosterone receptor blocker on&#xD;
      top of standard therapy in patients experiencing CABG surgery ± AVR without heart failure on&#xD;
      the risk of developing POAF, an issue that never been assess. The preliminary results&#xD;
      obtained by the investigators allow to have a strong rational to perform this interventional&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators believe that this large landmark study, in case of a reduction of POAF&#xD;
      incidence by spironolactone, will have an immediate effect on patients care and a major&#xD;
      positive impact from an economic point of view, since it will shift the balance of preventive&#xD;
      strategies to the use of spironolactone, a freely available, low-cost and well tolerated&#xD;
      medication in high risk patients referred for CABG ± AVR.&#xD;
