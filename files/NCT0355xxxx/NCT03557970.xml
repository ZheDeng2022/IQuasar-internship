  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well edicotinib (JNJ-40346527) works in treating participants&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. JNJ-40346527&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate preliminary efficacy of JNJ-40346527 in participants with relapsed/refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Best objective response rate (&gt; PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess safety and survival associated with JNJ-40346527 to treat participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML. Assess the duration of disease response associated with&#xD;
      JNJ-40346527.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall incidence of treatment-related and non-treatment related toxicity. II. Duration of&#xD;
      response. III. 12-month event-free survival. IV. 12-month overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-40346527 and effective inhibition of CSF-1R in marrow&#xD;
      aspirates using plasma inhibitory assays, with established CSF-1R-sensitive cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify the effect of JNJ-40346527 on leukemia cells and the immune microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Identify and quantify the specific subpopulation of cells that express CSF-1R in&#xD;
      participants and correlate these with clinical response to JNJ-40346527.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Analyze the frequency of mutations using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from&#xD;
      leukemia participants to determine if there is a genetic signature that predicts response to&#xD;
      JNJ-40346527.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), identify an expression signature in&#xD;
      CSF-1R+ cells that predicts patient response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate the effect of JNJ-40346527 on immune cell populations (cytotoxic T cells, etc.)&#xD;
      and phospho-signaling proteins by mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis in pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      samples in order to identify biomarkers that predict patient response and prioritize&#xD;
      potential combination strategies for future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine how leukemia cells change in response to CSF-1R inhibition by assessing cells&#xD;
      collected pre- and post-treatment using an ex vivo sensitivity to a panel of small molecule&#xD;
      inhibitors to determine what new drug sensitivities may emerge in AML cells after CSF-1R&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive JNJ-40346527 orally (PO) twice a day (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up within 2 weeks, at 4-6&#xD;
      weeks until death or minimum of 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>A Simon 2-stage minimax design will be used to determine best objective response. The best objective response and exact confidence interval will be determined using the binomial distribution for each arm separately. Response assessment will be based on best objective response rates within the first 2 cycles of study drug, including complete response (CR), CR with inadequate bone marrow recovery, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease.</description>
