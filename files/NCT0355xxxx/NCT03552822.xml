  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have been proven to be very successful in&#xD;
      specific patient populations. An example is with ERAS for colorectal surgery. ERAS protocols&#xD;
      in this patient population have been shown to reduce overall morbidity and hospital length of&#xD;
      stay (LOS). At the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), the institution has had&#xD;
      successful implementation of ERAS protocols for several surgical specialties including&#xD;
      colorectal, breast, spine, gynecology, and gynecology-oncology. However, the institution&#xD;
      currently does not have a protocol in place for the most commonly performed surgical&#xD;
      procedure - cesarean delivery. At UAB, the institution performs approximately 1,000 cesarean&#xD;
      deliveries per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that an ERAS protocol will be beneficial for these patients.&#xD;
      Currently, there is very little data published on ERAS protocols. Although this patient&#xD;
      population is ideal for an ERAS protocol, there are several barriers that have to be&#xD;
      overcome. The data published show promising results for ERAS protocols with cesarean&#xD;
      delivery. A larger tertiary care center showed earlier discharge with lower re-admission&#xD;
      rates with an ERAS pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the investigators have created a multidisciplinary group at UAB to establish an&#xD;
      ERAS protocol for patients undergoing cesarean delivery. This group includes&#xD;
      anesthesiologists, obstetricians, nursing, neonatology, pharmacy, and informatics. Once the&#xD;
      investigators have implemented this protocol, the investigators would like to perform a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis to determine if there are any significant changes in our desired&#xD;
      outcomes the investigators will study. Our goal is to demonstrate significantly improved&#xD;
      outcomes in the investigators' measured endpoints. The investigators believe that this&#xD;
      information will be very useful because although there is a national interest in creating&#xD;
      ERAS protocols for cesarean deliveries, there currently is very little published on the&#xD;
      subject. The investigators would like to publish the investigators' results and protocol as a&#xD;
      resource for other institutions to adopt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are implementing an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol for&#xD;
      patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The purpose of the ERAS protocol is to optimize care&#xD;
      provided to patients (patient education, nutrition, pain management, early ambulation, etc.).&#xD;
      The anticipated date of protocol initiation is May 2018. Once this protocol has been in place&#xD;
      for approximately 6 months to one year, the investigators would like to retrospectively&#xD;
      review data on these patients and compare outcomes to a similarly-matched group of patients&#xD;
      the year preceding protocol implementation. Specific outcomes the investigators will assess&#xD;
      are: hospital length of stay, post-operative pain scores, opioid consumption, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction [through IRB-approved survey (protocol X300001121)], surgical site infection&#xD;
      rates, readmission rates, and unscheduled clinic and maternal evaluation unit (MEU) visits&#xD;
      before the first scheduled postpartum visit. The investigators also plan to track compliance&#xD;
      monthly with the adherence to the protocol. Since the investigators want to track compliance&#xD;
      (both as a quality improvement project as well as research), the investigators are requesting&#xD;
      (Institutional Review Board) IRB approval now.&#xD;

    <description>Measurement of pain score post-cesarian section will be obtained using clinical data gathered by the care team providing routine clinical care, and asking routine pain score questions. The scale used is the standard 1-10 pain scale, with 1 being no pain or very mild discomfort, and 10 being very severe pain. Thus, higher values indicate a worse outcome.</description>
