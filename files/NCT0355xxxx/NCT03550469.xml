  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety and clinical utility of using an&#xD;
      adaptive model to wean oxygen by computer assistance. Investigators hypothesize that weaning&#xD;
      oxygen using this model will decrease duration of exposure to hyperoxia, decrease duration of&#xD;
      exposure to hypoxia, decrease exposure to increased oxygen requirement, and decrease the&#xD;
      number of manual fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) adjustments as compared to manual weaning&#xD;
      of oxygen therapy.&#xD;

      Investigators will perform a feasibility study followed by a randomized, controlled study on&#xD;
      critically ill neonatal and pediatric patients on oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use a model-based adaptive control architecture to regulate FiO2 settings.&#xD;
      A major advantage of using an &quot;adaptive&quot; control system is that the response of the patient&#xD;
      to previous FiO2 settings are used to recompute the most appropriate FiO2 setting in fixed&#xD;
      time intervals. As a result of this iterative and self-correcting process, the FiO2 value&#xD;
      converges to the most appropriate value over a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children &lt;18 years of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit requiring oxygen&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen patients will be recruited for the feasibility study and 50 patients for the efficacy&#xD;
      trial. Sample size was calculated to provide 85% power with a type I error rate of 0.05 to&#xD;
      detect a 10% decrease in duration of time in hyperoxic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia: oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) &lt;91% &gt;1 min Prolonged hypoxia: hypoxia&#xD;
      for &gt;2 min Severe hypoxia: SpO2 &lt;85% Prolonged severe hypoxia: SpO2 &lt;85% for &gt;1 min&#xD;
      Hyperoxia: SpO2 &gt;96% on FiO2 &gt;0.21 &gt;1 min Target saturation range: SpO2 91-96% Increased FiO2&#xD;
      requirement: FiO2 &gt;0.60&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened daily for eligibility. Informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      parents of eligible patients. A randomization table created by the statistician will be used&#xD;
      to randomized patients in a 1:1 ratio to either the manual or computer-assisted weaning&#xD;
      group. The study will be carried out after the patient has been admitted to the unit for&#xD;
      greater than 24 hours.Two hours of respiratory stability without the need for a sustained&#xD;
      increase in FiO2 or change in ventilator settings will be required prior to initiation of the&#xD;
      study. Target SpO2 range will be 91-96% for pediatric intensive care unit patients. If part&#xD;
      of their usual care, patients will receive their scheduled respiratory treatments (e.g.&#xD;
      suctioning, chest physical therapy) before the study period starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 4-hour study period, patients in the manual weaning group will be cared for&#xD;
      routinely with FiO2 changes made by the nurse or respiratory therapist according to the order&#xD;
      placed by the clinician. A second pulse oximeter will be used for monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the computer-assisted group, a dedicated investigator will be at the bedside during the&#xD;
      4-hour study. Oxygen saturation will be monitored using a second pulse oximeter connected to&#xD;
      a programmed computer. The computer will provide clinical decision support by making an FiO2&#xD;
      weaning recommendation every 5-10 min. If more frequent changes occur in the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation above or below the target, the computer will make more frequent recommendations&#xD;
      (every 30-60 sec) until the saturation is in target range. The investigator will wean the&#xD;
      FiO2 based on the computer recommendation, if the suggested change is determined to be safe.&#xD;
      If the recommendation is rejected, the investigator will document the reason. No other&#xD;
      changes will be made during this time unless patient is hypoxic or hyperoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory support settings (flow, inspiratory pressure, tidal volume, positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP), pressure support) will remain unchanged during the study period,&#xD;
      unless escalation of settings is necessary due to changes in clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of hypoxia or hyperoxia, a manual adjustment in FiO2 may be made and any clinically&#xD;
      necessary interventions (e.g. suctioning, nebulized treatments) will be performed if a&#xD;
      recommendation is not made by the computer by 1 min. If an intervention other than an&#xD;
      increase in FiO2 is necessary, the investigator may suspend further weaning recommendations&#xD;
      until the intervention is complete. Data acquisition may be suspended if artifact is&#xD;
      detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for suspension of weaning by computer-assistance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute respiratory deterioration &gt;2 min: oxygen desaturation requiring suctioning or&#xD;
           nebulized treatment. During this time, the FiO2 may be adjusted manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute hemodynamic deterioration &gt;2 min: hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia (defined&#xD;
           by age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute neurologic deterioration &gt; 2 min: agitation that interferes with respiratory&#xD;
           support and affects oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Artifact in oxygen saturation reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total time study is suspended will be recorded for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for termination of the study for an individual subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory deterioration persists &gt;5 min and higher level of support is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic deterioration persists &gt;5 min and inotropes or vasopressors are initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient develops altered mental status relative to pre-study condition or seizure&#xD;
           activity &gt;2 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parental request for withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned a unique subject identification (ID) number. Identifiable data&#xD;
      (e.g. medical record number, date of birth) with the corresponding ID will be listed&#xD;
      separately from other data and saved on a secure password-protected database (Box.com through&#xD;
      Stanford University). During the study data will be collected under the subject ID number&#xD;
      (de-identified). All electronic data will be stored in Box and collection sheets will be&#xD;
      maintained in a locked locker in the pediatric intensive care unit until information is&#xD;
      transferred to electronic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data: age, gender, race, height, weight, acute diagnosis, chronic diagnoses,&#xD;
      baseline oxygen/respiratory support requirement, date of admission, hours on respiratory&#xD;
      support, type of respiratory support, blood gas results if obtained, hospital day. Blood will&#xD;
      not be collected specifically for this study, but if a blood gas has been obtained on the&#xD;
      patient, it will be recorded. Imaging results will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature every 1 min. Medication&#xD;
      administered during and within 1 hour prior to study period. FiO2 changes (computer&#xD;
      recommendations and otherwise), respiratory support settings, and acute interventions (e.g.&#xD;
      suctioning, breathing treatment, sedation) and reason. Blood gas result if ordered by&#xD;
      clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The primary outcome will be duration of exposure to hyperoxia. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be incidence and duration of hypoxia, duration of oxygen saturation in target&#xD;
      range, incidence and duration of increased oxygen requirement, and number of manual FiO2&#xD;
      adjustments. The durations of time will be calculated as a proportion of total time recorded.&#xD;
      Oxygen saturation and FiO2 will be averaged for patients in the manual group and compared&#xD;
      with that of patients in the computer-assisted group using a two-sample, one-sided t-test&#xD;
      with margin to test whether the computer-assisted group performs at least 10% better than the&#xD;
      manual group. The average number of manual changes to the FiO2 for patients in the manual&#xD;
      group and the average number of manual changes in the computer-assisted group will also be&#xD;
      compared using a t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior measurements in neonatal patients and after adjusting for potential data&#xD;
      dropouts, investigators estimate that a population of 25 patients each for the manual and&#xD;
      computer-assisted groups would be sufficient to test the hypothesis. While parametric&#xD;
      two-sample, one-sided t-tests were used for this calculation, the results of using&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics (based on Wilcoxon rank tests) are not expected to be significantly&#xD;
      different. In the investigators' calculations, they used a Type-I error estimate of 0.05&#xD;
      (false positive) and a power of 0.85 (Type-II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to monitor the efficacy of the experiment, investigators will also be evaluating the&#xD;
      experiment's performance at the half way stage after examining 25 patients. In addition, the&#xD;
      principal investigator will also be closely monitoring the results of each experiment to&#xD;
      watch for any significant deviations in performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study involves minimal risk, site monitoring or auditing are not part of the plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and entry into the registry and monitoring will be done by 2 investigators.&#xD;
      If data are missing, the patient may be excluded from statistical analysis if missing data is&#xD;
      significant enough to lead to false conclusions.&#xD;
