  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled phase II study to test&#xD;
      the addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib to anti-hormonal treatment as maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in patients with disease control (at least stable disease) after 1st line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although 1st line chemotherapy is effective in women with HR-positive HER2-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer, PFS is usually around 6-8 months and 2nd or 3rd line treatments are by far less&#xD;
      effective. Well tolerated maintenance treatments with the potential to prolong PFS and even&#xD;
      OS are urgently needed. This study evaluates the impact of the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
      to an anti-hormonal maintenance treatment of physicians´ choice.&#xD;

             expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and follow-up, must be obtained&#xD;
             and documented according to the local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Histologically confirmed HER2-/HR+ locally advanced or metastatic invasive breast&#xD;
             carcinoma assessed on the primary tumor and/or on the metastatic lesions (preferred).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness and ability to provide archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue&#xD;
             block or a partial block from primary surgery and/or tumor or metastasis biopsy, which&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Maintenance endocrine therapy could have already been started up to 6 weeks before&#xD;
             randomization, but after achievement of tumor response or stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Maintenance therapy must be preceded prior to randomization by at least 4 cycles of a&#xD;
             mono- or polychemotherapy. Tumor response or stable disease needs to be maintained to&#xD;
             allow entry into the trial. Study treatment must start within 8 weeks of the last dose&#xD;
             of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Previous therapy with maximum one line of anti-hormonal treatment is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy is allowed. In case of cancer other than breast&#xD;
             cancer, treatment should be completed more than 5 years before study entry.&#xD;

             postmenopausal or post hysterectomy) or B) childbearing potential with negative&#xD;
             urinary pregnancy test (in this case patients need to use highly effective&#xD;
             non-hormonal contraceptive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT/SGPT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous malignant disease being disease-free for less than 5 years (except CIS of the&#xD;
             cervix and non-melanomatous skin cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence for active infection including wound infections and anamnestic HIV or&#xD;
             hepatitis.&#xD;

             drug (i.e. hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any of the following within 6 months prior to randomization: myocardial infarction,&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Other severe acute, uncontrolled or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical&#xD;
             trial with any investigational not marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients treated within the last 7 days prior to randomization with drugs known to be&#xD;
             CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (see section 11.4) or drugs that are known to prolong&#xD;
             the QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnant and lactating women.&#xD;
