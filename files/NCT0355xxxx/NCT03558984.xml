      Prospective, Multinational, Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel Controlled, Two arms, Single&#xD;
      Blind, Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of D-PLEX Administered Concomitantly with the&#xD;
      Standard of Care (SOC) IV Prophylactic Antibiotic Treatment vs. SOC in Prevention of&#xD;
      Post-Cardiac Surgery Sternal Infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study to assess D-PLEX efficacy and safety in preventing sternal infections over a period of&#xD;
      90 days (3 months) post cardiac surgery with median sternotomy, in patients with high risk&#xD;
      for infection compared to the control arm.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase III study to evaluate the anti-infective efficacy and safety of D-PLEX, a new&#xD;
      formulation of extended release of Doxycycline, over a period of 3 months post operation by&#xD;
      preventing sternal infection post cardiac surgery in patients above the age of 18, including&#xD;
      high risk patients for infection. Study will be conducted in about 45 sites in US (about 15&#xD;
      sites), Europe and Israel, recruitment period will last about 18 months. D-PLEX will be&#xD;
      administered as a single application. For subjects randomized to the investigational&#xD;
      treatment arm, D-PLEX treatment will be applied at the end of the index surgery just before&#xD;
      closing the chest, as an adjunct to the SOC prophylactic antibiotic treatment. For subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the control arm, the surgical treatment will be as per the SOC. Pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative care for both arms will be performed per site SOC. Patients will followed-up&#xD;
      during 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
