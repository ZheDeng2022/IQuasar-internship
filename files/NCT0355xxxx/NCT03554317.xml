    <textblock>
      Single arm, multicenter, open-label Phase II study of the effects of parenteral testosterone&#xD;
      in combination with nivolumab in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who&#xD;
      previously progressed on at least one novel androgen-receptor targeted therapy (i.e.&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate, Enzalutamide). Up to one taxane agent is permitted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will enroll up to 44 participants. Eligible participants will continue on androgen&#xD;
      ablative therapy with a GnRH analogue (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard, or Lupron) if they&#xD;
      have not undergone orchiectomy. Following enrollment, participants will receive an&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of testosterone cypionate 400mg every 4 weeks for a lead-in period of&#xD;
      12 weeks. After the lead-in period, all participants will be treated with nivolumab 480mg IV&#xD;
      every 4 weeks and maintained on testosterone cypionate 400mg IM every 4 weeks. Assessments&#xD;
      for response to testosterone + nivolumab will be performed approximately every 3 months.&#xD;
      Treatment [with a minimum drug exposure of 12 weeks] will be continued until PSA progression&#xD;
      (Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3] criteria) or clinical/radiographic progression&#xD;
      (whichever comes first), or until unmanageable toxicity requiring drug cessation.&#xD;
