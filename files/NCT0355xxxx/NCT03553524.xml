      High intensity interval training (HIIT) is a promising intervention for treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of type 2 diabetes. In spite of the interplay between circadian rhythms and&#xD;
      exercise, the time of day in which the most robust adaption to HIIT can be achieved is&#xD;
      unknown. The main goal of the study is to compare the efficacy of morning and afternoon HIIT&#xD;
      in lowering blood glucose values in participants with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      High intensity interval training (HIIT) is a promising intervention for treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of type 2 diabetes. In spite of the interplay between circadian rhythms and&#xD;
      exercise, the time of day in which the most robust adaption to HIIT can be achieved is&#xD;
      unknown. The main goal of the study is to compare the efficacy of morning and afternoon HIIT&#xD;
      in lowering blood glucose values in participants with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we aim&#xD;
      to to elucidate the underlying hormonal changes and fuel utilization preference responsible&#xD;
      for the differing blood glucose response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized cross-over trial with 40 participants with type 2 diabetes will be performed.&#xD;
      The participants will be examined on three occasions on an in-patient basis (36-hour hospital&#xD;
      visits). On visit 1 baseline (no exercise) measurements will be established. On visit 2 the&#xD;
      participants will perform a single bout of HIIT either in the morning (08:30) or afternoon&#xD;
      (19:30). After a 1-week washout period, the participants will return for visit 3 and an&#xD;
      opposing exercise time. Primarily, the efficacy of the morning and afternoon HIIT will be&#xD;
      judged by the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) -based glycaemia measurements. Additionally,&#xD;
      during the visits the investigators will collect repeated blood samples to assess the effect&#xD;
      of exercise timing on the diurnal hormonal rhythms. Fuel utilization preference will be&#xD;
      measured by respiratory exchange ratio (RER)during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that afternoon HIIT will be more efficacious in controlling blood glucose&#xD;
      values, based on the preliminary data gathered from the 'free living' pilot study. The&#xD;
      current study will aim to compare the morning and afternoon exercise in controlled&#xD;
      conditions, eliminating the effects of dietary intake, medication and sleep cycle disruption.&#xD;
      Additionally, the specific factors responsible for the differing glycaemic response to&#xD;
      morning and afternoon exercise will be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised cross-over pilot study with 11 participants with type 2 diabetes in 'free&#xD;
      living' conditions has been performed. Glycaemia measurements were collected by continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitors (CGMs) for 2 weeks pre-training and for the duration of the study. The&#xD;
      participants were assigned to either morning (08:00) or afternoon (16:00) training regime&#xD;
      consisting of 6 HIIT occasions over 2 weeks. Following a 2-week 'wash-out' period, the&#xD;
      participants performed the opposing exercise training regime. The preliminary results show&#xD;
      that HIIT is more efficacious in improving glycaemia when performed in the afternoon, rather&#xD;
      than in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot was a field-based study in 'free-living' individuals, thus the specific factors&#xD;
      responsible for the differing blood glucose levels between morning and afternoon exercise&#xD;
      trials remain to be elucidated. Now is the aim to perform a study in controlled condition,&#xD;
      limiting the effects food intake, medication and sleep-wake cycle disruption and measuring&#xD;
      the effects of a single HIIT bout on glycaemia. The hypothesis is that HIIT bout at different&#xD;
      times of day diversely affects diurnal hormonal rhythms, accounting for the differing&#xD;
      glycaemic responses.&#xD;
