  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has previously been shown in healthy subjects, that a carbonated water containing a mix of&#xD;
      amino acids and chromium picolinate can decrease postprandial blood glucose. Based on these&#xD;
      findings, a flavored sparkling water product called Good Idea® with a proprietary blend of&#xD;
      five amino acids and chromium picolinate has been developed. This product, along with an&#xD;
      identical placebo, are included in this study to evaluate the effects on postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose in healthy, overweight adults when consumed with a standardized, high glycemic test&#xD;
      meal. The study will be conducted in a cross-over design, double-blinded and placebo&#xD;
      controlled, including 45 participants. The primary endpoint of the study is the incremental&#xD;
      area under the curve (iAUC) for capillary blood glucose within 180 minutes after ingestion of&#xD;
      the meal.&#xD;
