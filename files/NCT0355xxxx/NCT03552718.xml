    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, the RP2D, and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      personalized neoepitope yeast-based vaccine, YE-NEO-001, in subjects who have completed&#xD;
      potentially curative therapy for their type of solid cancer (eg, colorectal cancer, breast&#xD;
      cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) and would otherwise be entering a&#xD;
      period of surveillance for recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts: part 1 will involve dose escalation, and part 2&#xD;
      will involve the expansion of the RP2D to further evaluate the safety of YE-NEO-001. In part&#xD;
      2 of the study, dose expansion will occur when the RP2D has been determined. An additional 4&#xD;
      subjects may be enrolled in part 2, for a total of up to 10 subjects at the RP2D.&#xD;
