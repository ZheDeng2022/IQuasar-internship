    <textblock>
      In this study, using 18F-FDG and Gd-DTPA PET/MRI, we are aiming to perform a dynamic PET/MRI&#xD;
      imaging using 18F-FDG and Me4FDG for a group of type 2 diabetic patients scheduled for&#xD;
      Glifozine therapy due to the bad metabolic control to assess changes in renal function before&#xD;
      and 1 to 2 weeks after initiating therapy with Gliflozine. Furthermore we aim to study the&#xD;
      temporal behavior of 18F-FDG and Me4FDG activity in certain kidney regions of the diabetic&#xD;
      participants to estimate basic kidney parameters using time activity curve. Further, we&#xD;
      intend to find a kinetic model that describes the behavior of glucose in each part of the&#xD;
      kidney can be acquired mathematically and to find out whether conclusions about the glucose&#xD;
      reabsorption capability of the kidney in diabetes can be achieved in general. In addition, we&#xD;
      aim to simultaneously determine renal lesions as well as obstructions with the fused, high&#xD;
      definition, and three dimensional images of the kidney and estimate kidney function&#xD;
      parameters from the dynamic Gd-DTPA MRI scan and compare them to the kidney function&#xD;
      determined with the kinetic model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Independent of insulin, inhibition of sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal&#xD;
      tubular cells prevents glucose reabsorption and promotes glucose excretion by causing&#xD;
      glycosuria. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors known as Gliflozine are recently authorized for the&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), whether as monotherapy or in combination with&#xD;
      other anti-diabetic medications including insulin. To our knowledge, there is still no&#xD;
      established kinetic model that describes precisely the reabsorption mechanism of glucose in&#xD;
      the proximal tubules and that shows the impact of Gliflozine on renal function in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, the temporal behavior of glucose in the various kidney regions needs to&#xD;
      be studied. Currently, the most promising tool is a combined positron emission tomography and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) using radioactive glucose analog&#xD;
      2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). The MRI scan in combination with the kidney-specific&#xD;
      gadolinium based contrast agent diethylenetriaminepentacetate (Gd-DTPA) images the organ with&#xD;
      high resolution allowing an estimation of kidney parameters; the PET scan on the other hand&#xD;
      shows the dynamic behavior of the glucose analog FDG. However, the reabsorption process of&#xD;
      FDG in the kidney is controversial. For this reason, a dynamic PET/MRI image using 18F-FDG&#xD;
      will be performed for diabetic patients, need the Gliflozine therapy, directly before and 1&#xD;
      to 2 weeks after therapy initiation. We aim, generally, to study the chronological behavior&#xD;
      18F-FDG activity in kidneys and to show, particularly, the reabsorption process under the&#xD;
      influence of SGLT2 inhibition. Furthermore, conclusions about the glucose reabsorption&#xD;
      capability of the kidney in these patients might be achieved and a kinetic model that&#xD;
      describes the exact behavior of glucose in each part of the kidney can be mathematically&#xD;
      acquired. We aim, additionally, to compare the PET/MRI images with the levels of diabetic&#xD;
      metabolic control before and 1 to 2 weeks after initiating therapy with Gliflozine to show&#xD;
      whether conclusions about therapy response can be drawn with FDG among the participants which&#xD;
      arises from a broader peak in case of medication. A possible explanation is that the Patlak&#xD;
      slope is among other influenced by the re-absorption process: if re-absorption is lowered due&#xD;
      to the medication, the peak gets broader leading to a lower Patlak slope. We therefore&#xD;
      conclude that reabsorption might be studied with FDG. Furthermore, a first draft of a kinetic&#xD;
      model could be developed with the collected data According to this model, the re-absorption&#xD;
      is mainly covered by the rate-constant k3. However, there was no correlation found between k3&#xD;
      and the above mentioned Patlak slope which most likely is a measure for re-absorption.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the fit algorithm not always leads to meaningful results. This leads to the&#xD;
      assumption that the model is not yet finished and further input data are needed. The model&#xD;
      allows calculating the TACs of the visible renal sub-regions (Cortex, Medulla and Pelvis). In&#xD;
      comparison with the measured TACs, the calculated ones deliver similar shapes. Although it&#xD;
      seems from these results promising to study diabetes type II with a routine tracer like FDG,&#xD;
      the kinetic model is hampered by the low affinity of FDG for the SGL transporter, which makes&#xD;
      a quantification difficult. Therefore, an alternative radiopharmaceutical shall be applied&#xD;
      which is similar to FDG but mainly re-abosrbed via SGLT: alpha-Methyl-4-[18F]FDG (Me4FDG).&#xD;
