  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The removal of Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) in children may be associated with&#xD;
      respiratory adverse events. The incidence of these adverse events may be influenced by the&#xD;
      type of anesthesia maintenance. It is not clear whether Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA)&#xD;
      with propofol is associated with a lower incidence of respiratory events upon removal of LMA&#xD;
      as compared to maintenance with sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: The primary aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of respiratory&#xD;
      adverse events following LMA removal in patient receiving TIVA versus sevoflurane&#xD;
      inhalational anesthesia in a pediatric population aged between 6 month and 6 years old.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include quality of induction, maintenance and emergence from anesthesia&#xD;
      between the 2 groups as evidenced by ease of LMA insertion, absence of bucking or movement&#xD;
      during the procedure, time to LMA removal, and absence of emergence agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this prospective randomized clinical trial, children will be enrolled in one of&#xD;
      two groups: Group 1 will receive propofol for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, Group&#xD;
      2 will receive sevoflurane for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. In both groups&#xD;
      patients will be mechanically ventilated. At the end of the procedure, LMAs will be removed&#xD;
      when patients are fully awake as defined by the return of reflexes, eye opening, and&#xD;
      purposeful movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Data comparing the influence of TIVA and sevoflurane on the occurrence of&#xD;
      respiratory adverse events after LMA removal are limited. Both techniques are standard of&#xD;
      care at our institution. However, as per our clinical observations, we hypothesize that TIVA&#xD;
      is superior to sevoflurane. This study will identify the technique that provides optimal&#xD;
      anesthetic conditions and improved patient's safety.&#xD;
