  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic arsenal of metastatic melanoma has changed considerably over the past 10&#xD;
      years. The treatment of metastatic melanoma is now based on immunotherapy and targeted&#xD;
      therapies, while the place of conventional chemotherapy becomes more restricted. Targeted&#xD;
      therapies are indicated for BRAF mutated melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mutation BRAF leads activation of MAP Kinases pathway and the proliferation of melanoma&#xD;
      cell in the body . About 50% of metastatic melanoma is BRAF mutated. The most frequent&#xD;
      mutation is the V600E. The targeted therapy by anti BRAF and anti MEK allows the double&#xD;
      bloking of the MAP Kinases pathway. This treatment is more efficient than that of the anti&#xD;
      BRAF alone. The association of anti BRAF and anti MEK have a global survival global rate of&#xD;
      41% at the 1 year, against 9% for the anti BRAF .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, a program of extended access to the association of anti BRAF and anti MEK&#xD;
      (dabrafenib and trametinib) started in many french hospitals (Protocol Mekinist, Novartis&#xD;
      laboratory). Patients who were included in this program and followed in Poitiers Hospital,&#xD;
      had frequent abnormalities of albumin level without any sign of undernutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoabuminemia is a poor prognosis factor described in many cancers, including metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only prognostic factor in metastatic melanoma is the rate of LDH . The level of albumin&#xD;
      and its prognostic impact have not been studied for patients with a metastatic melanoma and&#xD;
      treated by anti BRAF and anti MEK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this studie was to analyze the variations of albumin level in patients with&#xD;
      unresecable stage IIIc or stage IV melanoma treated in our Center by dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib&#xD;
