  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this work is to measure the efficiency of 18 days SPA Therapy in&#xD;
      orientation rheumatology associated with an educational intervention in patients with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis on a priority objective, personalized and determined by the patient, chosen in&#xD;
      the list of 5 objectives determined during the educational assessment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This program begin with a shared educational balance assessment allowing to set up the&#xD;
      individual program adapted to the objectives personalized by the patients. The objectives to&#xD;
      achieve are to allow the patients to acquire knowledge and skills (attitudes, behavior)&#xD;
      concerning their pathology and the existing treatment. A multidisciplinary team trained in&#xD;
      the therapeutic education of the patient assure the educational interventions. The proposed&#xD;
      educational activities (7 educational workshops) concern major axes of the care of the knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis: knowledge of the pathology, the adapted physical exercise, the dietetics, the&#xD;
      management of the pain, the articular hygiene and the technical helps.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Month 06</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from effectiveness of the educational workshops, personalized and determined for every patient, measured by a GAS GAS (Goal Attainment Scaling in Rehabilitation) is a method of scoring the extent to which patient's individual goals are achieved in the course of intervention. In effect, each patient has their own outcome measure but this is scored in a standardized way as to allow statistical analysis.&#xD;
Each goal is rated on a 5-point scale, with the degree of attainment captured for each goal area:&#xD;
If the patient achieves the expected level, this is scored at 0.&#xD;
If they achieve a better than expected outcome this is scored at: +1 (more than expected), +2 (much more than expected)&#xD;
If they achieve a worse than expected outcome this is scored at: -1 (less than expected) or -2 (much less than expected) GAS depends on two things - the patient's ability to achieve their goals and the clinician's ability to predict outcome, which requires knowledge and experience.</description>

    <description>Score on WOMAC&#xD;
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:&#xD;
Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), physical Function (17 items). The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score, however there are other methods that have been used to combine scores.&#xD;
Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <description>Average change from baseline in the pain intensity measured on a Visual Analogical Scale (VAS) Visual analog scale (VAS) and its corresponding visual analog pain scale, is a psychometric scale that is generally used to conduct pain scale surveys to understand varying degrees of pain or discomfort experienced by a patient. The score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

    <measure>Life quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 01, Day 18, Month 03, Month 06, Month 09, Month 12.</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from baseline of the Life quality, measured by a SF36. It is one of the most widely used generic measures of health-related quality of life and has been shown to discriminate between subjects with different chronic conditions and between subjects with different severity levels of the same disease. The SF-36 has also demonstrated sensitivity to significant treatment effects in a variety of patient populations. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>Average change from baseline of the comprehensive evaluation of patient education programs , measured by a HEIQ.&#xD;
The Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ): an outcomes and evaluation measure for patient education and self-management interventions for people with chronic conditions.&#xD;
There are 8 sections: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 2 or 3 questions for each section. Scoring within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). For each section the score given to that section is the worst score within the section, i.e. if one question is scored 1 and another 2, then the score for the section is 2.</description>
