    <textblock>
      A multicenter, prospective, single arm, non randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the C2 CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System (CbFAS) for the treatment of&#xD;
      persistent dysplasia or intestinal metaplasia (IM) in the tubular esophagus after 3 or more&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablations (RFA) for dysplastic BE, or &lt;50% eradication of Barrett's Esophagus&#xD;
      (BE) after 2 RFA treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligibility will be determined based on historical local pathology and medical record&#xD;
      information. Informed consent will be obtained and eligible subjects will be treated with the&#xD;
      Cryoballoon Focal Ablation System (CbFAS) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return every 3 months +/- 6 weeks for repeat treatment for up to 12 months OR&#xD;
      until complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM) and complete eradication of&#xD;
      dysplasia (CED) are achieved (at which point subjects enter the follow-up phase), whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures will be performed on an outpatient basis according to the site's&#xD;
      standards of care for anesthesia and sedation during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)&#xD;
      procedures. EGD examinations will be performed using high definition White Light Endoscopy&#xD;
      (WLE), plus Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) or i-SCAN to assess BE Prague Score and identify tissue&#xD;
      landmarks and ablation zones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high definition endoscope will be used for all ablations performed with the CryoBalloon&#xD;
      Focal Ablation System (CbFAS). The System will be used according to the instructions for use&#xD;
      provided with the product and in accordance with the current standard of care for treatment&#xD;
      of BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat cryoablation may be performed if esophageal columnar mucosa is visible on EGD or if&#xD;
      intervening biopsies (if a site chooses to obtain intervening biopsies as standard of care)&#xD;
      are positive for any esophageal columnar epithelium until complete eradication of all&#xD;
      unwanted tissue is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervening endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)&#xD;
      after enrollment may be performed for nodular areas detected after baseline. EMR/ESD may be&#xD;
      performed at the same session as the cryoablation if the EMR/ESD site is &gt;=3cm away from the&#xD;
      ablation target site. Cryoablation should be performed before EMR/ESD. If the EMR/ESD site is&#xD;
      within 3cm of target treatment area, then CbFAS will be delayed for at least 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual islands of columnar mucosa of &lt;5 mm in diameter each and &lt;= 3 total can be treated&#xD;
      with Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) and/or CbFAS at the discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
      to avoid over treatment of neo-squamous mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stenosis requiring treatment based on the physician's discretion, which develops after&#xD;
      enrollment, will be treated with standard of care balloon- or wire-guided dilation.&#xD;
      Cryoablation may be performed at the same session if the dilated site is &gt;= 3 cm from the&#xD;
      target cryoablation site. Otherwise, cryoablation will be postponed to another visit within 1&#xD;
      month +/- 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When CbFAS treatment is received, subjects will be asked to complete assessments immediately&#xD;
      after CbFAS treatment, and will be contacted 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no visible BE is present during the endoscopy, then biopsies will be taken following the&#xD;
      standard Seattle biopsy protocol (4 quadrant biopsies at 1cm intervals starting at the&#xD;
      gastric cardia 1cm distal to the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) (top of the gastric folds)&#xD;
      and continuing proximally throughout the length of the original extent of BE, including any&#xD;
      neosquamous or re-epithelialized tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will be read by local expert pathologist. If biopsies indicate CEIM and CED, then&#xD;
      subjects will enter the 12 month follow-up phase. If biopsies do not indicate CEIM and CED,&#xD;
      then subjects will return for additional CbFAS treatment in 3 months +/-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-responders are defined as subjects who have not achieved CEIM and CED at 12 months post&#xD;
      baseline CbFAS treatment. Non-responders at 12 months will exit the study and continue&#xD;
      treatment at the physician's discretion and according to standard of care at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who achieve CEIM and CED within 12 months of the baseline CbFAS procedure will enter&#xD;
      a 12 month follow-up phase. Subjects will be followed per routine care guidelines for their&#xD;
      condition, described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with baseline LGD will return at 6 and 12 months from the initial CEIM and CED date&#xD;
      for follow-up (+/-2 weeks). Subjects with baseline HGD or IMC will return at 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months from initial CEIM and CED date for follow-up (+/- 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up procedures, high definition WLE, plus NBI or i-SCAN will be used to assess&#xD;
      Prague score, and biopsies will be taken following the standard Seattle biopsy protocol (4&#xD;
      quadrant biopsies at 1cm intervals starting at the gastric cardia 1cm distal to the&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) (top of the gastric folds) and continuing proximally&#xD;
      throughout the length of the original extent of BE, including any neosquamous or&#xD;
      re-epithelialized tissue). Biopsies will be read by local expert pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If recurrent BE is detected during follow-up endoscopy with biopsy demonstrating compatible&#xD;
      histology, then subjects will be exited from the study and treated at the physician's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation is complete if: 1) Subject has not reached CEIM and CED at 12 month post&#xD;
      baseline treatment; or 2) If BE or dysplasia recur after initial CEIM and CED post&#xD;
      enrollment; or 3) After completion of the 12 month follow-up EGD with biopsies.&#xD;
