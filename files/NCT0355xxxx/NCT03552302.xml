      Tinnitus is the auditory phantom sensation in the absence of external sound stimulation.&#xD;
      Tinnitus that persisted more than six months without improvement can be called chronic&#xD;
      tinnitus. One report proposed the neurophysiological model of tinnitus. In addition, tinnitus&#xD;
      patients suffered from insomnia, irritability, anxiety and/or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management of tinnitus is a drug-based treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.&#xD;
      Music therapy, hearing aid therapy, and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), were also applied&#xD;
      for patients with tinnitus. Even though, success rates of various tinnitus treatments were&#xD;
      still unsatisfactory till now.&#xD;
&#xD;
