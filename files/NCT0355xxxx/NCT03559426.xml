  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosis and schizophrenia are common and costly mental health problems. Psychosis is the&#xD;
      name given to a group of mental conditions in which cause people to perceive or interpret&#xD;
      things differently from those around them. One of the most common causes of psychosis is&#xD;
      schizophrenia, a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including&#xD;
      hallucinations (hearing and/or seeing things) and delusions (believing something that is not&#xD;
      true). One of the main treatment options for psychosis and schizophrenia is long-term&#xD;
      treatment with antipsychotic medication, but many patients still find life difficult.&#xD;
      Antipsychotic drugs can also have dangerous and unpleasant side effects. Finding alternatives&#xD;
      to long-term drug treatment is a priority for patients and services. This study is testing&#xD;
      the effects of gradually reducing antipsychotic medication in people with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      psychosis or similar conditions in order to see if it can help improve day-to-day functioning&#xD;
      and how it affects their chance of suffering a relapse (worsening of their condition).&#xD;

      The RADAR trial is a randomised controlled trial that will compare a flexible and gradual&#xD;
      strategy of antipsychotic reduction and possible discontinuation with maintenance&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment in people with schizophrenia or who have recurrent psychotic&#xD;
      episodes. In the reduction group, a guideline reduction schedule will be devised by the&#xD;
      research team for each participant taking into account starting dose and number of&#xD;
      antipsychotics prescribed. This may be adjusted by treating clinicians in discussion with&#xD;
      participants. Antipsychotics will be discontinued in cases where reduction progresses well.&#xD;
      The reduction schedule will be flexible, and will include guidance on monitoring and treating&#xD;
      symptoms and signs of early relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be individually randomised to the two treatment strategies, which will be&#xD;
      administered by treating clinicians. They will be followed up for two years. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is social functioning, and secondary outcomes include relapse, symptoms, side&#xD;
      effects, employment and medication adherence.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants and treating clinicians will not be blinded because participants will start on different antipsychotic regimes, and those within the antipsychotic reduction intervention will follow an individualised reduction protocol.&#xD;
Following trial extension the sample size was reduced from 402 to 218. The study is now powered to the primary outcome 'social functioning'.&#xD;
Members of the research team conducting outcome assessments will be blinded to treatment allocation.</masking_description>
