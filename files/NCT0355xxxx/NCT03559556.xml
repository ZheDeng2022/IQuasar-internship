    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Radiosurgery is a preferable treatment option for patients with Arteriovenous&#xD;
      malformation (AVM) that are not surgically accessible or in patients with comorbidities that&#xD;
      make them poor surgical candidates At University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW),&#xD;
      investigator routinely perform interventional cerebral arteriography on the day of the SRS&#xD;
      procedure for improved target delineation. Even though the addition of angiography is time&#xD;
      consuming and requires multi-modality team care, this approach has allowed UTSW to treat the&#xD;
      smallest possible target, yet achieve excellent obliteration rates of AVM with very low&#xD;
      toxicity from the procedure. At UTSW the investigator also use CT angiogram at the treatment&#xD;
      team's discretion to further enhance the accurate delineation of the final treatment target&#xD;
      volume. However, it had not been routinely done due to uncertain benefit in treatment&#xD;
      planning and a concern for renal burden from additional intravenous (IV) contrast usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective enrollment and conduct open-label, retrospective analysis study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether a target volume based on CT angiography can serve as a reliable substitute&#xD;
      for a target based on interventional cerebral arteriography. Patients on this protocol will&#xD;
      still get treated based on target generated by interventional cerebral arteriography but also&#xD;
      receive CT angiography. If the target volume based on CT angiography are adequate compared to&#xD;
      their invasive counterpart, future investigators may selectively omit performing&#xD;
      interventional cerebral arteriography in the treatment planning for SRS of AVM. Use of CT&#xD;
      angiography may lead to reduction in the risk from the procedure and cost, improve the&#xD;
      efficiency of the treatment process ideally without compromising the success of the&#xD;
      procedure, with greater patient comfort and satisfaction.&#xD;
