  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the use of a two-week very low calorie diet (VLCD) in obese&#xD;
      general surgery patients in a randomized single-blinded trial. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the VLCD will positively impact the perceived surgical difficulty, operative time,&#xD;
      hospital length of stay and 30-day complications. Additionally, the investigators anticipate&#xD;
      reduced perioperative blood glucose levels and a reduced need for perioperative insulin&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

      The investigators' objective for this project is to determine the impact of a preoperative&#xD;
      VLCD on outcomes for patients undergoing elective general surgery. Included are patients who&#xD;
      are obese, BMI &gt;30, and scheduled by a Christiana Care-employed general surgeon for elective&#xD;
      general surgery. Eligible patients are those scheduled for elective cholecystectomy, ventral&#xD;
      or incisional hernia, umbilical hernia, and inguinal hernia surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also be determining the feasibility of introducing a preoperative VLCD&#xD;
      for patients undergoing elective general surgery in a Community Hospital setting.&#xD;
