      This phase Ib trials studies the side effects and how well talimogene laherparepvec works&#xD;
      when given together with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy in treating patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer that does not express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein and&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable), or has come back (recurrent). Biological therapies, such as talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may attack specific tumor cells&#xD;
      and stop them from growing or kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel,&#xD;
      gemcitabine, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Drugs used as endocrine&#xD;
      therapy, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, tamoxifen or fulvestrant, may lessen the&#xD;
      amount of estrogen made by the body or may may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      estrogen from connecting to the cancer cells. Giving talimogene laherparepvec with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or endocrine therapy may work better in treating patients with HER2-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intra-lesional talimogene laherparepvec&#xD;
      injections in combination with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic,&#xD;
      unresectable, or locoregionally recurrent HER2-negative breast cancer who have injectable&#xD;
      sites of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with chemotherapy or&#xD;
      endocrine therapy in the study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I (CHEMOTHERAPY): Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intra-tumorally (IT) on&#xD;
      day 1 of cycle 1, on days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, on day 8 of cycle 3, then on day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Patients also receive paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      60 minutes on days 1, 8, and possibly 15, or gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes and&#xD;
      carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II (ENDOCRINE THERAPY): Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec IT every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      the first 10 weeks and then every 3 weeks thereafter. Patients also receive letrozole orally&#xD;
      (PO), anastrazole PO, exemestane PO, tamoxifen PO on days 1-28 or fulvestrant intramuscularly&#xD;
      (IM) every 2 weeks for 3 doses then every 4 weeks for the subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
