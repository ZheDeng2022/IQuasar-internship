  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent developments in chemotherapy, particularly VEGF-inhibitor (VEGFI) drugs, have markedly&#xD;
      improved the prognosis of patients with cancer. However, these drugs frequently cause high&#xD;
      blood pressure (hypertension) which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and stroke and&#xD;
      can limit their use for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelin-1 is a hormone that causes blood vessels to tighten and may contribute to high&#xD;
      blood pressure associated with VEGFI drugs. Blocking the effects of endothelin-1 may&#xD;
      therefore reduce or prevent VEGFI-associated blood pressure changes, although this has never&#xD;
      been tested in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to assess the protective effects of endothelin-1 blocker drugs in&#xD;
      patients treated with VEGFI. Before doing so, we must better explore whether VEGFIs cause&#xD;
      blood vessel narrowing and if endothelin-1 blockers prevent this. We will assess this in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers using a special technique called 'forearm plethysmography'. We will&#xD;
      examine the effect of VEGFI on blood flow and also the effect of simultaneous administration&#xD;
      of endothelin-1 blockers. These will be given at doses that produce local effects in the arm&#xD;
      without affecting the rest of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies study will show whether endothelin-1 blockers may help treat VEGFI-associated&#xD;
      hypertension to enable more patients safely to receive vital cancer treatments.&#xD;

      Developments in chemotherapy have improved the prognosis for patients with cancer.1,2&#xD;
      Angiogenesis is essential for tumour growth and metastasis and vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) is fundamental to this process.3,4 Chemotherapeutic VEGF inhibitor (VEGFI)&#xD;
      drugs have revolutionised therapy and improved the prognosis and survival of patients with&#xD;
      previously untreatable malignancies.1,2 Blood pressure elevation is a common complication&#xD;
      that occurs in up to 80% of patients treated with VEGFI and almost all patients have an&#xD;
      absolute increase in blood pressure, with 30-60% developing frank hypertension.1,5 Patients&#xD;
      are at risk of acute hypertensive complications, including stroke, acute coronary syndrome or&#xD;
      reversible leukoencephalopathy and the development of VEGFI-associated hypertension may&#xD;
      mandate the premature discontinuation of these important anti-cancer therapies. Those who&#xD;
      survive their cancer are at risk of developing end-organ damage leading to ischaemic heart&#xD;
      disease, heart failure, renal failure and stroke.1,5 Indeed, with substantially increased&#xD;
      cancer survivorship patients often survive long enough to allow cardiovascular morbidity to&#xD;
      take precedence over their initial cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms contributing to the development of VEGFI-associated hypertension may include&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, capillary rarefaction and vascular remodelling.1,5 Endothelin-1&#xD;
      (ET-1) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. 3,6,7 However, the effects of VEGFI on&#xD;
      endothelial function and the role of ET-1 in VEGFI-associated hypertension are incompletely&#xD;
      defined. Indeed, there is a paucity of information on mechanisms contributing to&#xD;
      VEGFI-induced hypertension and our study will address this key issue.&#xD;
