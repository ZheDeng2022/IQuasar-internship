  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder dysfunction is one of the most important factors influencing duration and quality of&#xD;
      life in children with spinal cord injury. Effective bladder control comprises a major aspect&#xD;
      of a child's life with SCI and is especially challenging due to the rapid changes in a&#xD;
      child's physical and cognitive development. Urological consequences secondary to a neurogenic&#xD;
      bladder are responsible for many clinical complications post-spinal cord injury, including&#xD;
      repeated urinary tract infections, autonomic dysreflexia, lifelong urologic care, and many&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Alternative approaches to bladder management that focus on recovery of&#xD;
      function and age-appropriate independence are needed. Prior research findings in our lab in&#xD;
      adult participants indicate a benefit of locomotor training on bladder function. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine with quantitative unbiased urodynamic outcome measures if&#xD;
      locomotor training, provided to children with spinal cord injury, impacts the developing&#xD;
      urinary system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overall hypothesis is that spinal cord injury-induced bladder dysfunction, facilitated by&#xD;
      the loss of supra-spinal connections and subsequent alterations of the lumbosacral circuitry,&#xD;
      can be ameliorated through activity-based therapy that regulates the state of&#xD;
      detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and normalizes release of neurotrophic factors known to&#xD;
      contribute to bladder hyper-reflexia. The primary study aim is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion (stepping on a treadmill) after&#xD;
      incomplete and complete spinal cord injury in children on bladder storage, voiding,&#xD;
      biomarkers, and quality of life (parent-reported during baseline and exit interview). A&#xD;
      secondary aim is to develop a scale for classifying bladder recovery after spinal cord injury&#xD;
      based either on the pattern of storage and voiding prior to injury (if the child had bladder&#xD;
      control prior to injury) or on established patterns of micturition development (if the child&#xD;
      was injured prior to experiencing bladder control).&#xD;

        Children, 2 to 18 years old, who sustained an upper motor neuron spinal cord injury and are&#xD;
        medically approved for enrollment in an outpatient, standardized locomotor training program&#xD;
        at the University of Louisville (either clinic or research-based) are eligible for&#xD;
        participation. Each participant will serve as his/her own control reducing the variability&#xD;
        among individuals related to the injury itself, time since injury, medications taken,&#xD;
        therapies received, differences in degree of bladder dysfunction, capacity to independently&#xD;
        void prior to injury, and many other factors that cannot be controlled in the human&#xD;
        experience.&#xD;
