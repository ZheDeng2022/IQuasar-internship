  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a study drug&#xD;
      known as LY3471851 in participants with SLE. The study will last about 79 days for each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LY3471851 is a potential first-in-class therapeutic that may address an underlying immune&#xD;
      system imbalance in people with many autoimmune conditions. It targets the interleukin (IL-2)&#xD;
      receptor complex in the body in order to stimulate proliferation of inhibitory immune cells&#xD;
      known as regulatory T cells. By activating these cells, LY3471851 may act to bring the immune&#xD;
      system back into balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunologic&#xD;
      effects of multiple doses of LY3471851 in participants with minimal to moderate SLE. The&#xD;
      effects on SLE disease activity will also be evaluated. SLE participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of LY3471851 or receive placebo. After receiving&#xD;
      the last dose of LY3471851 or placebo, participants will be followed for an additional 50&#xD;
      days to evaluate safety, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy.&#xD;
