  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of patients have persistent motor disability following stroke. Current&#xD;
      treatment approaches with conventional physiotherapy have limited efficacy. Repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and Functional electrical stimulation (FES) have&#xD;
      been shown to improve the neuronal plasticity and motor control in few preliminary studies.&#xD;
      Their efficacy in human stroke subjects is unproven. We planned to study their efficacy in&#xD;
      improving the motor functions of stroke patients in a randomized trial. Sixty consecutive&#xD;
      haemodynamically stable adult patients with first ischemic stroke within last 7-30 days were&#xD;
      randomized into three treatment groups to receive either physiotherapy alone, or&#xD;
      physiotherapy combined with either FES or rTMS. Outcome was assessed using Fugl Meyer&#xD;
      assessment for physical performance of upper limb. Three groups were compared for the outcome&#xD;
      measures using intention to treat analysis.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present management strategies involving conventional physiotherapy (PT) have limited efficacy&#xD;
      in facilitating the motor recovery following stroke. Finding an effective intervention to&#xD;
      improve motor recovery in individuals with hemiplegia is very important for improving the&#xD;
      functional outcome and enabling independent living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an injury, the brain undergoes significant reorganization of its functions&#xD;
      resulting in functional recovery, which occurs over a period of weeks to months. This&#xD;
      postlesional reorganization occurs mostly in the premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex and supplementary motor area which are thought to play the most important role in&#xD;
      recovery following any type of brain injury. Treatment approaches which can facilitate this&#xD;
      reorganization process by enhancing the cortical plasticity might have a very important role&#xD;
      in improving the functional outcome following neuronal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both central and peripheral stimulation has potential to improve the cortical reorganization&#xD;
      and functional recovery following acute stroke. Previous studies have established that&#xD;
      following an acute stroke, the depressed excitability of the ipsilesional hemisphere can be&#xD;
      increased by stimulating the ipsilesional hemisphere or by inhibiting the contralesional&#xD;
      hemisphere.This happens because of the fact that one hemisphere has inhibitory effect on the&#xD;
      other hemisphere through transcallosal inhibition. In preliminary studies, application of&#xD;
      high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to motor cortex has been&#xD;
      shown to produce an increase in corticospinal excitability leading to enhancement of motor&#xD;
      functions. Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS), which is a novel method of delivering rTMS at lower&#xD;
      intensities without the risk of any major adverse effects, has been found to be safe in&#xD;
      chronic and acute stroke patients. In this regard, intermittent TBS (iTBS) has a stimulatory&#xD;
      effect on the brain and continuous TBS (cTBS) has inhibitory effect on the brain. In&#xD;
      preliminary studies, intermittent TBS (iTBS) applied to the ipsilesional hemisphere and&#xD;
      continuous TBS (cTBS) applied to the contralesional hemisphere have been shown to improve the&#xD;
      motor functions and corticospinal output in the paretic hands during experimental settings.&#xD;
      However, long term effects of this strategy on functional outcome have not been previously&#xD;
      studied. Similarly, functional electrical stimulation (FES), a form of peripheral&#xD;
      stimulation, when applied to the paretic upper limb muscles has been shown to improve the&#xD;
      upper limb functional activity in patients with acute or subacute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus both the TBS and FES has a potential of improving the motor functions and the functional&#xD;
      outcome following ischemic stroke. However, these strategies have not been used in clinical&#xD;
      setting and their usefulness in promoting motor recovery over and above that of conventional&#xD;
      PT has not been proven. If proven to be useful, these techniques have a potential of&#xD;
      improving the otherwise dismal functional outcome following stroke. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine efficacy of TBS or FES as an adjunctive to physical therapy for the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study Setting and Participants This study is a single blind randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to assess the efficacy of TBS and FES in improving motor functions over and above that&#xD;
      of standard PT following acute stroke. This study was carried out at the Department of&#xD;
      Neurology, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum,&#xD;
      Kerala, India. We recruited consecutive patients over a 28 months period from the outpatient&#xD;
      clinics and inpatient wards. Patients with first ever ischemic stroke in middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery territory who presented within 10 days to 30 days of onset and had ability to give&#xD;
      informed consent and comprehend instructions were included in this study. All the patients&#xD;
      underwent 1.5 T MRI and had documented single infarct in MCA territory with no other lesion.&#xD;
      All the patients received standard medical and rehabilitative care including passive and&#xD;
      active PT. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (SCT/IEC/223). All&#xD;
      the patients provided written informed consent to undergo the trial. Consecutive patients who&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized to one of the three groups:&#xD;
      (1) those who received TBS as per the predefined protocol along with standard PT (Group A);&#xD;
      (2) those who received FES as per the predefined protocol along with standard PT (Group B);&#xD;
      and (3) those who received PT (PT) alone (Group C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation and sequence generation The patients were randomly allocated into three&#xD;
      groups by block randomization method. Concealed allocation was done by principle investigator&#xD;
      who blindly allocated the subjects into different groups according to the block randomization&#xD;
      table to receive the designated intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding After providing the informed consent, a subject fulfilling the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria was initially assessed by first co-investigator for all the outcome&#xD;
      measures and neurophysiological parameters. Patients who were eligible for the study were&#xD;
      allocated to different intervention groups by principle investigator. Interventions were done&#xD;
      by second co-investigator for all the subjects. Follow-up assessments were done by the first&#xD;
      co-investigator who was blinded to the allocation to intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures As we mainly wanted to assess upper extremity functions, we used Fugl Meyer&#xD;
      Assessment (FMA) scale as the primary outcome measure to assess the upper limb motor&#xD;
      functions. This is a 66-point scale to evaluate upper limb functions, a standard tool for&#xD;
      this purpose. In addition, we used Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to assess global outcome,&#xD;
      National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) to assess stroke severity and Barthel Index&#xD;
      (BI) to assess activities of daily living. These three scales were used as secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome scales were applied at baseline (T1) and then subsequent assessments were done at one&#xD;
      month (T2), three months (T3), six months (T4) and at one year (T5) after the enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Primary outcome measure for this study was the Fugl Meyer Assessment&#xD;
      of upper limb functions at one year. Previous studies have shown that FMA score increases by&#xD;
      16.5 Â± 9.4 at one year in control subjects.21 We hypothesized that for a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful outcome, the intervention should produce an increase of 10 points over and above&#xD;
      the control group. To achieve this, a sample size of 14 patients in each arm was required for&#xD;
      a power of 80% with alpha fixed at 5%. In a previous study conducted at our institute, the&#xD;
      post stroke mortality was 27.2 % at one year, of these 72.1% died within 10 days after the&#xD;
      stroke.2 As have planned to include patients between 10 to 30 days of stoke onset, to account&#xD;
      for the mortality rate of 7.6% after 10 days, the required sample size was 16 in each group.&#xD;
      Considering a dropout rate of 20 %, we calculated a sample size of 20 patients in each group&#xD;
      as adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS Protocol We assessed resting motor threshold (RMT) for both the hemispheres at baseline&#xD;
      using Magstim Rapid2 (Whitland, Wales, UK) stimulator with a figure-of-eight coil having an&#xD;
      external loop diameter of 9 cm. After making the patient seated comfortably in an armchair,&#xD;
      posterior-anterior orientation was used over the motor cortex (M1) to assume the optimal&#xD;
      scalp position to elicit MEP in the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. RMT&#xD;
      was assessed from ipsilesional hemisphere initially and followed by contralesional hemisphere&#xD;
      as per the standard techniques. Surface electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the FDI&#xD;
      muscles bilaterally using Ag-AgCl electrodes with a gain of 1-2 mv. Signals were filtered&#xD;
      (10Hz-10 KHz), and then stored for off-line analysis. Audio-visual feedback of the EMG signal&#xD;
      at high gain were given to assist subjects to maintain complete relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group A were subjected to TBS in addition to standard PT as described below.&#xD;
      Intermittent TBS (iTBS), which is facilitatory, was given to the ipsilesional hemisphere and&#xD;
      continuous TBS (cTBS), which is inhibitory, was given to contralesional hemisphere. The&#xD;
      stimulation was given at an intensity of 60% of RMT. The iTBS protocol of 10 bursts of&#xD;
      high-frequency stimulation (3 pulses at 50 Hz) was applied at 5 Hz every 10 s for a total of&#xD;
      600 pulses. When no MEP was elicited from the ipsilesional motor area (&lt;0.05mV), 100%&#xD;
      stimulator intensity as that of contralesional hemisphere was applied at the mirror location&#xD;
      of the contralesional motor area.14 Continuous TBS was given with an intensity of 60% of RMT,&#xD;
      3 pulses at 50 Hz, repeated every 200 ms for a total of 600 pluses. Both iTBS and cTBS were&#xD;
      delivered for three times in a week for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Electrical Stimulation. Electrical stimulation was given with Mega XP (Cybermedic&#xD;
      Corporation, South korea). The patient received the electrical stimulation in sitting&#xD;
      position with affected arm positioned over the pillow and electrodes were positioned&#xD;
      according to pattern 3 [Grasp/Flexion/Extension, PATT (pattern movement)] of the FES (F) mode&#xD;
      of the instrument. The stimulator controller unit of the machine could deliver alternating&#xD;
      current at a frequency of 35 Hz, pulse width of 200 Âµs and intensity of 10~50 mA. The&#xD;
      stimulator was set to deliver interrupted trains of pulses with the contraction and&#xD;
      relaxation so as to simulate the lifting of upper limb in a functional position. The FES&#xD;
      group stimulation session was given for 30 minutes for each day, 3 times in a week (alternate&#xD;
      days) for 4 weeks and it was concurrently synchronized with the physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy treatment protocol The following physical therapy regimens were followed for&#xD;
      all the patients in the study: Passive/Active Range of Motion (ROM) at all joints; weight&#xD;
      bearing and supportive reaction; reaching activities; grasping, holding and release; and&#xD;
      upper extremity activities of daily living (ADL). Physical therapy intervention was given to&#xD;
      all the patients five days per week for one month. Modifications in the physical therapy was&#xD;
      made by second co-investigator for each patient so that he or she was able to practice&#xD;
      independently or with assistance from a family member after the intervention and was&#xD;
      instructed to practice one hour per day. In addition, all patients continued to receive&#xD;
      in-home physical therapy 1-2 times per week by a home care physical therapist who was guided&#xD;
      by second co-investigator. The investigators used a logbook to monitor the actual amount of&#xD;
      time that each patient exercised at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods We used descriptive statistics to summarize the data. Baseline&#xD;
      comparability of groups, in terms of demographic data and baseline measurements were assessed&#xD;
      with chi-square test and ANOVA. Non-normal data was subjected to reciprocal, logarithmic and&#xD;
      exponential transformation and Komogrov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks tests were done to assess&#xD;
      normality. Parametric measures were analyzed with ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis with&#xD;
      bonferroni correction. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to find out between group and within&#xD;
      group variability. Non parametric measures were analyzed with Kruskal Wallis test followed by&#xD;
      post hoc analysis with Mann Whitney U test. Friedmans test and Kendalls W test was done to&#xD;
      find the changes in three groups over a period of one year. All analyses were done using SPSS&#xD;
      version 17.0 and p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
