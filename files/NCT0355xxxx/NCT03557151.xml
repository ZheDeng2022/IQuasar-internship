  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a randomized controlled trial to test a novel Transdisciplinary&#xD;
      Care (TC) model of delivery of care for type 1 diabetes in adolescence. Adolescents and their&#xD;
      parents/caregivers (n=150) will be randomized to Usual Care or TC care in a 1:2 ratio.&#xD;
      Approximately half of those in TC care will received TC in person and half will receive it&#xD;
      through telehealth. TC visits will consist of conjoint management of T1D by a TC team&#xD;
      consisting of an Advanced Practice Nurse, Dietitian and Psychologist who will see&#xD;
      parent-adolescent dyads together within the same visit. TC team members have trained each&#xD;
      other in their respective disciplines. Outcome measures include glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) and&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing diabetes self management behaviors and adolescent and parent coping&#xD;
      with T1D and its treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large epidemiologic studies show that &lt;25% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) achieve&#xD;
      targeted glycohemoglobin levels advocated by the American Diabetes Association (&lt; 7.5%) or&#xD;
      International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (&lt; 7.0%). Optimal self-management&#xD;
      of T1D requires daily insulin replacement by multiple injections or insulin pump, 4-6 daily&#xD;
      blood glucose checks, regulation of carbohydrate intake and physical activity,&#xD;
      prevention/correction of glycemic fluctuations and perhaps use of a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitor. This regimen places pervasive affective, behavioral, cognitive and social demands on&#xD;
      adolescents with T1D and their families and psychosocial variables greatly impact their&#xD;
      success in T1D self-care. Struggling with maintaining adequate glycemic control is&#xD;
      essentially normative among adolescents, suggesting that conventional systems of care are not&#xD;
      meeting the needs of this population. A substantial, growing literature provides an evidence&#xD;
      base for psychosocial screening and behavioral intervention strategies targeting improved&#xD;
      coping with the demands of T1D, but this evidence base has not penetrated fully into routine&#xD;
      T1D care. Rigorous integration of this evidence into routine care for T1D could yield many&#xD;
      benefits. Behavioral barriers to effective care are major concerns of all stakeholders, but&#xD;
      conventional care is not well-equipped to address these issues. Concomitantly, the supply of&#xD;
      board-certified pediatric endocrinologists is not keeping pace with growth of the T1D patient&#xD;
      population, amplifying the need to validate alternative delivery systems that multiply the&#xD;
      effective workforce of T1D health professionals. We will develop and test a novel&#xD;
      Transdisciplinary Care (TC) approach (conjoint TC visits conducted by an Advanced Practice&#xD;
      Nurse, Psychology Postdoctoral Fellow and Dietitian) to improve adolescents' T1D outcomes and&#xD;
      justify a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). In Year 1, crowdsourcing methods will&#xD;
      engage youths with T1D, parents and health care providers (HCP) in planning a feasible,&#xD;
      acceptable, safe and effective TC model that addresses youths' and families' psychosocial&#xD;
      needs and capitalizes on the expertise of advanced practice nurses co-managing T1D with&#xD;
      psychologists and dietitians. The Wallander et al. stress and coping model and the D'Zurilla&#xD;
      and Goldfried problem solving model provide a sound conceptual framework for the TC model of&#xD;
      care. The TC team will learn each discipline's skills in T1D management, develop a detailed&#xD;
      TC manual to guide this work and others' future studies, see adolescents and parents together&#xD;
      as a team, screen for potentially modifiable psychological impediments to T1D care, and&#xD;
      promote families' coping resources by enhancing family-centered communication and problem&#xD;
      solving, implementing empirically validated behavioral interventions and facilitating&#xD;
      additional appropriate services for complex problems. Telehealth delivery of TC care carries&#xD;
      several potential advantages, justifying its inclusion within a RCT comparing the effects of&#xD;
      UC to TC delivered via various modalities on glycemic control and treatment adherence&#xD;
      (primary outcomes) as well as quality of life and other psychosocial variables (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes). Qualitative and economic analyses will follow the RCT, providing perspectives on&#xD;
      mechanisms of TC effects and its sustainability. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods&#xD;
      will validate an innovative model of T1D care for adolescents that could then be tested in a&#xD;
      future definitive, multi-site RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will address these specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1. In Year 1, with methods used effectively in our ongoing DP3 study of parents&#xD;
      of children &lt;6 years old with T1D, we will engage separate &quot;crowds&quot; of adolescents with T1D,&#xD;
      parents, and HCPs in planning/refining a feasible, safe, acceptable and efficacious&#xD;
      Trans-Disciplinary care model (TC) for T1D in adolescence. This crowdsourcing effort should&#xD;
      yield a TC model that meets the needs of all key stakeholder groups, ensuring its&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptance and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2. With study oversight by a diverse stakeholder panel and guided by a detailed&#xD;
      intervention manual, 150 families of adolescents treated for T1D at Nemours practices in the&#xD;
      Delaware Valley or Florida will participate in a rigorous Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
      in years 2 and 3. The RCT will compare Usual Care (UC) with Trans-Disciplinary Care on&#xD;
      glycohemoglobin (HbA1C), treatment adherence, health care use, T1D-related distress, quality&#xD;
      of life, and treatment satisfaction. Delivery mode of Trans-Disciplinary Care will also be&#xD;
      explored (e.g., Face-to-Face, Telehealth, Combined). The proposed trial will yield&#xD;
      substantial information that could justify a definitive future test of this model, inform&#xD;
      methodological planning for subsequent studies, and explore whether certain modes of delivery&#xD;
      (e.g., Telehealth) are justified for evaluation in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 3. Qualitative interviews of adolescents, parents, and health care providers&#xD;
      completed at the midpoint and end of the RCT will identify possible mediators or moderators&#xD;
      of TC efficacy and guide refinements to the TC model. We will interview third party payers&#xD;
      about the feasibility of dissemination of the TC model into practice and collect health care&#xD;
      cost data. These analyses will strengthen the justification for a future, larger trial of TC,&#xD;
      and guide refinements to the TC model to further enhance its efficacy.&#xD;

    <description>Usual Care participants will receive the same excellent multidisciplinary care they would receive at the same center were they not enrolled in the trial. In clinic visits scheduled at approximately 3-month intervals, they will see subspecialty board certified or eligible pediatric endocrinologists, supplemented as needed with involvement of certified diabetes educators, dietitians, social workers or psychologists. HbA1c target is &lt; 7.5% with no severe hypoglycemia and acceptable quality of life. About half are expected to be on insulin pumps and carbohydrate counting, while the great majority of others are following basal-bolus multiple daily injection regimens, also based on carbohydrate counting. A rising proportion of patients use continuous glucose monitors and this trend is likely to accelerate during the study.</description>
