  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To implement and evaluate a health information technology platform designed to support the&#xD;
      management of patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer in an urban,&#xD;
      publicly-funded outpatient setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to implement and evaluate a health information technology (HIT) registry at an urban,&#xD;
      public delivery system. We will use systems engineering methodologies to design, develop, and&#xD;
      implement the platform. The platform will be implemented in the Urology clinic that cares for&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer. We are conducting a prospective non-randomized pilot study&#xD;
      that will follow men who choose active surveillance as a management strategy for prostate&#xD;
      cancer. We aim to assess the impact of the HIT registry on patient monitoring and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIT platform seeks to improve the monitoring and alerting functionality of existing&#xD;
      systems. Specifically, it replaces paper-based or ineffective computer-based systems&#xD;
      previously used by the clinic to monitor its active surveillance patients. It will be&#xD;
      implemented clinic-wide for all patients being monitored by an active surveillance protocol.&#xD;
      The platform is approved for clinical use and research by the San Francisco Health Network&#xD;
      and the University of California, San Francisco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research involves materials that are collected for nonresearch purposes, as well as low-risk&#xD;
      research employing survey, interview, focus group, program evaluation, and human factors&#xD;
      methodologies. We will solicit structured feedback from registry users designed to&#xD;
      continuously evaluate and improve performance in a clinical area to reduce patient safety&#xD;
      gaps. Patient medical records will be reviewed, but patients monitored on the registry will&#xD;
      not be contacted by researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures are in place to monitor the registry. First, quality assurance is performed by the&#xD;
      research team, information technology analysts in the San Francisco Health Network, as well&#xD;
      as by the third-party software provider. This includes checking that data in the platform&#xD;
      matches source data, such as data entered in the electronic health record. In addition, users&#xD;
      are audited on a weekly basis. A data dictionary defining variables used in the platform&#xD;
      exists and is updated as needed. The HIT platform users include clinicians who are&#xD;
      responsible for monitoring patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer. Patients who&#xD;
      are enrolled in the active surveillance program will be added to the registry by a clinician.&#xD;
      The research team will support the clinicians in data analysis, although this will be&#xD;
      performed with population-level, de-identified data. However, if unmediated adverse events&#xD;
      are identified by the research team, the research team will alert the clinicians&#xD;
      appropriately. The research team will also develop training materials and conduct training&#xD;
      sessions to ensure that all clinicians responsible for monitoring patients on active&#xD;
      surveillance are provided with up-to-date resources and accessible support. The HIT platform&#xD;
      is designed to supplement, but not replace, the existing electronic health record. Data on&#xD;
      the registry will be validated with source data and users will still engage with the source&#xD;
      data and electronic health record as appropriate clinically and operationally.&#xD;
