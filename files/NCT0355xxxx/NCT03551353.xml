      Video-assisted feedback (VAF) is an educational method used by educators in various areas of&#xD;
      medicine. It is possible to gain technical and non-technical skills for practical&#xD;
      applications such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and surgical procedures . VAF is an&#xD;
      objective proof of an individual's performance because by giving feedback it provides non&#xD;
      debatable, accurate, real-time data. By allowing awareness on certain issues it helps&#xD;
      correcting the mistakes. Studies have shown improvement in clinical skills after VAF&#xD;

&#xD;
      Inaccurate or incomplete control of anesthesia equipment before use is associated with&#xD;
      serious postoperative morbidity and mortality risk. For this reason, a number of control&#xD;
      methods have been developed before the anesthesia application. This is one of these methods&#xD;
      that checklists are created and repeated in intermittent periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) published a guideline to improve patient safety&#xD;
      in 2008 . This guideline is summarized as mentioned below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASA Checklist:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Verify Auxiliary Oxygen Cylinder and Self-inflating Manual Ventilation Device are Available&#xD;
      &amp; Functioning 2: Verify patient suction is adequate to clear the airway 3: Turn on anesthesia&#xD;
      delivery system and confirm that ac power is available 4: Verify availability of required&#xD;
      monitors, including alarms. 5: Verify that pressure is adequate on the spare oxygen cylinder&#xD;
      mounted on the anesthesia machine 6: Verify that the piped gas pressures are â‰¥ 50 psig 7:&#xD;
      Verify that vaporizers are adequately filled and, if applicable, that the filler ports are&#xD;
      tightly closed. 8: Verify that there are no leaks in the gas supply lines between the&#xD;
      flowmeters and the common gas outlet 9: Test scavenging system function. 10: Calibrate, or&#xD;
      verify calibration of, the oxygen monitor and check the low oxygen alarm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11: Verify carbon dioxide absorbent is not exhausted 12: Breathing system pressure and leak&#xD;
      testing. 13: Verify that gas flows properly through the breathing circuit during both&#xD;
      inspiration and exhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14: Document completion of checkout procedures. 15: Confirm ventilator settings and evaluate&#xD;
      readiness to deliver anesthesia care. (ANESTHESIA TIME OUT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten anesthesia residents will be included in this study. Preoperative evaluation in terms of&#xD;
      general anesthesia will be completed for a patient before anesthesia induction. After&#xD;
      receiving informed consent from the patient resident will complete the preparations by&#xD;
      checking the above-mentioned list (anesthesia machine, operating room desk, monitorization&#xD;
      methods, aspirator systems, operating room gas systems, waste systems and other anesthesia&#xD;
      equipment) then induction will be started. All these steps will be recorded with a camera&#xD;
      system. Once the anesthetic application is completed and all stages are recorded, the video&#xD;
      records will be evaluated in terms of ASA guideline. Before the second phase of the study,&#xD;
      the resident will be informed about the guideline by a staff. Then induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia in another patient will be recorded at all stages. Once the anesthesia application&#xD;
      is complete, the camera record will be monitored. Differences and developments or possible&#xD;
      similar mistakes between the records will be discussed. After evaluating the records -twice&#xD;
      for each resident- the applicability and effectiveness of the VAF training course will be&#xD;
      investigated in the direction of the results of 20 records, before and after VAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the compliance of anesthesiology and reanimation residents&#xD;
      with the ASA guideline in Kocaeli Derince Training and Research Hospital.&#xD;
