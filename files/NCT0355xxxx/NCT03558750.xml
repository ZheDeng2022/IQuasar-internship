    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given in&#xD;
      combination with rituximab and nivolumab and how well they work in treating participants with&#xD;
      non-germinal center type diffuse large B cell lymphoma or primary central nervous system&#xD;
      lymphoma that has come back or isn't responding to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      rituximab and nivolumab, may interfere with ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Giving rituximab, lenalidomide, and nivolumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating participants with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of lenalidomide in combination&#xD;
      with standard doses of rituximab and nivolumab in relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (non-germinal center B cell [non-GCB]) and in primary central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) (Phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with standard doses of rituximab and&#xD;
      nivolumab in R/R non-GCB type DLBCL and PCNSL (Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab when combined with lenalidomide and&#xD;
      rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to progression (complete response, partial response or stable&#xD;
      disease), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the difference in overall response rate between those with and without&#xD;
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression in tumor (subgroup analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the difference in overall response rate between those with and without MYD88&#xD;
      mutation in tumor (subgroup analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform PD-L1, PD-1 expression on tumor cells by immunohistochemistry including double&#xD;
      staining for PAX-5 and PD-L1 and CD68 and PD-L1, CD3/CD4/CD8 for T cell infiltration, CD68&#xD;
      for tumor associated macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess for presence of MYD88 L265 mutation by allele specific polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) in tumor tissue and /or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (where lumbar puncture is&#xD;
      clinically performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 9p24.1/ PD-L1/PD-L2 locus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate MYD88 PCR on CSF (where available). V. To perform gene expression panel for&#xD;
      tumor immune response in tumor samples (prioritizing cases in which a second serial biopsy is&#xD;
      available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, rituximab&#xD;
      IV on day 1, and lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients with partial response (PR) or stable disease at the end of 8 cycles will&#xD;
      be offered lenalidomide and nivolumab maintenance for up to 12 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 2 years&#xD;
      and then every 6 months until year 4.&#xD;
