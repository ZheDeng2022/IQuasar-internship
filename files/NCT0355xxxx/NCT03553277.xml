  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are the most medically important arthropod-borne pathogens worldwide, with&#xD;
      transmission occurring in most tropical and sub-tropical regions. An estimated 390 million&#xD;
      infections occur yearly. Although, there are considerable ongoing efforts to develop a&#xD;
      vaccine, vector control remains the only option for reducing dengue virus (DENV) transmission&#xD;
      and disease burden. The recent emergence of Aedes-borne Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya viruses&#xD;
      (CHIKV) highlight need for novel vector control tools. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of a spatial repellent (SR) product (active ingredient transfluthrin)&#xD;
      for reducing contact between household residents and vector mosquitos and as a result reduce&#xD;
      DENV, ZIKV, and/or other Aedes-borne virus transmission. Henceforth the investigators will&#xD;
      designate the combined risk of Aedes-borne dengue, Chikungunya, Zika virus transmission by&#xD;
      (DCZV). Spatial repellency is used here as a general term to refer to a range of insect&#xD;
      behaviors caused by airborne chemicals that reduce contact between people and disease&#xD;
      vectors. This can include movement away from a chemical stimulus, and interference with host&#xD;
      detection (attraction-inhibition) and/or feeding response.&#xD;

      Protection provided by this product will be measured using entomological and virological&#xD;
      approaches, comparing entomological indices will be measured through standard household&#xD;
      monitoring of Aedes aegypti population densities, while DCZV transmission will be measured&#xD;
      through door-to-door surveillance for active dengue disease and through serological&#xD;
      monitoring for DCZV exposure in a randomized cluster trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will establish a cohort of 3,400 persons, primarily children 2-12 years of&#xD;
      age and adults who have not been previously infected with DCZV who will provide annual blood&#xD;
      samples when they are healthy (longitudinal cohort), whereas in the same clusters the&#xD;
      investigators expect to monitor up to 27,500 residents for active dengue disease (febrile&#xD;
      surveillance cohort). The cohort will be monitored for a period of 2 years. The use of&#xD;
      spatial repellents has never been tested on a large scale to reduce disease and could change&#xD;
      vector control practices worldwide, reducing the amount of chemical insecticides applied and&#xD;
      also prevent the development of insecticide resistance. The investigators plan to implement a&#xD;
      short questionnaire to determine levels of acceptability and perceived efficacy amongst&#xD;
      participating households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be carried out in the Amazonia City of Iquitos, Peru, which has a&#xD;
      well-established infrastructure for studying urban dengue fever. The study will generate&#xD;
      rigorous evidence, documenting and evaluating the impact of SR products on human infection&#xD;
      rates, to be considered and used by academia, industry and public health key stakeholders at&#xD;
      the global, regional, national and/or local level and drive efforts to acquire full&#xD;
      recommendation of SR products for inclusion in disease control programs.&#xD;
