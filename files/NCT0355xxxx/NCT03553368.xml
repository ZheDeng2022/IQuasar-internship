  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging of chest disorders is mainly achieved by using computed tomography. This is&#xD;
      especially the case for detection, morphologic assessment and followup of pulmonary nodules.&#xD;
      A positron emission tomography (PET) /CT may be additionally required for lung nodule&#xD;
      management in some conditions including a size greater than 8 mm with morphologic or growing&#xD;
      characteristics suspicious of malignancy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents however&#xD;
      an interesting alternative diagnostic radiation-free method, in particular owing to the&#xD;
      recent development of sequences dedicated to lung parenchyma analysis. A major limitation&#xD;
      remains the control of respiratory artefacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Frequency non-invasive ventilation, HF-NIV, has the potential to allow chest&#xD;
      stabilization and is currently used in the department of radio-oncology at the Lausanne&#xD;
      University Hospital. It has been recently applied to perform MRI and PET examinations at end&#xD;
      inspiration during an &quot;apnea &quot; generated by the system. Continuous periods of respiratory&#xD;
      stabilization of several minutes at end-inspiration are thus obtained, allowing prolonged MR&#xD;
      and PET acquisitions with improvement of image quality as observed in our preliminary studies&#xD;
      (Beigelman-Aubry et al., Prior et al.). Interestingly, the lung volume explored by using this&#xD;
      ventilation technique is similar to that of CT studies, conversely to respiratory gated MR&#xD;
      sequences which are currently performed at end-expiration, this potentially generating&#xD;
      underevaluation of lung disorders especially at lung bases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims to determine the impact of HF-NIV in the management of patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary nodule(s). After a first step of optimization of acquisition parameters of&#xD;
      HF-NIV-MR in healthy volunteers, the performances of MRI and PET/CT (when required) under&#xD;
      this ventilation technique will be compared to the current method(s) of reference in cases of&#xD;
      pulmonary nodule(s) (CT scan and PET when required) and histological data when available. All&#xD;
      MRI and PET/CT (when required) acquisitions will be performed without the ventilation&#xD;
      technique, as used in current practice, and with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was completed with an amendment to investigate MRI under continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP). The MR-CPAP combination will be evaluated with optimized parameters&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers and compared to free-breathing acquisitions without any device.&#xD;
