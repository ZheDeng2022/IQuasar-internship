  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the influence of donor and recipient pharmacogenetics (PG), drug&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and T cell phenotypes and how it may permit a tailored dosing strategy&#xD;
      to improve the therapeutic index of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and optimize the&#xD;
      graft versus tumor effect, while minimizing acute and chronic graft versus host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this single-arm, pilot study is to determine whether&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics (PG) of Cy-related candidate genes from the recipients and/or donors&#xD;
      (haploidentical and matched related donor HCTs only) germ-line DNA is associated with&#xD;
      incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD. Secondary objectives include determining&#xD;
      whether pharmacogenetics (PG) of Cy-related candidate genes from the recipients and/or donors&#xD;
      (haploidentical and matched related donor HCTs only) germ-line DNA is associated with Cy (and&#xD;
      metabolites) exposure and toxicities; quantifying Cy (and related metabolites) exposure&#xD;
      measured as the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from zero to 24 hours both&#xD;
      before (day -6) and after transplant (day +3), and correlate exposure with incidence of acute&#xD;
      and chronic GVHD, and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs); and determining whether&#xD;
      immune activation or polarization prior to or following Cy GVHD prophylaxis is associated&#xD;
      with grade of acute or chronic GVHD grade and AESIs. Safety objects include evaluating Cy&#xD;
      administered, adverse events of special interest (including deaths while on study therapy),&#xD;
      selected laboratory parameters (including time to neutrophil recovery), and immunosuppressant&#xD;
      concomitant medications administration. Initially, 20 participants (HCT recipients and their&#xD;
      respective haploidentical or matched related donors) will be enrolled with a subsequent 100&#xD;
      additional subjects enrolled.&#xD;
