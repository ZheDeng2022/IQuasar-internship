  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) has been recently introduced to&#xD;
      non-invasively evaluate coronary artery pathology. Histology and intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging studies have demonstrated that CTCA enables identification of plaque characteristics&#xD;
      associated with increased vulnerability (i.e., plaque burden and composition) and allows&#xD;
      assessment of vessel physiology (i.e., local haemodynamic forces), and reports have shown&#xD;
      that CTCA can predict atherosclerotic evolution and detect lesions that will progress and&#xD;
      cause cardiovascular events. Despite the wealth of data provided, CTCA has still a limited&#xD;
      role in the study of atherosclerosis. Prior to unlocking the full potential of CTCA and&#xD;
      enable its broad use, further work is needed to develop user-friendly processing tools that&#xD;
      will allow fast and accurate analysis of CTCA, and examine in detail the accuracy of modern&#xD;
      CTCA imaging in assessing plaque pathology. In this application, the investigators aim 1) to&#xD;
      develop a CTCA analysis system that will enable fast segmentation, reliable coronary&#xD;
      reconstruction and blood flow simulation in a user-friendly environment and 2) validate the&#xD;
      efficacy of state-of-the-art CTCA for assessment of coronary plaque morphology and physiology&#xD;
      against intravascular plaque imaging using hybrid near infrared spectroscopy-intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patent recruitment Seventy patients with typical angina symptoms who had elective&#xD;
           coronary angiography showing at least one complex (i.e., bifurcation lesion, long&#xD;
           lesion, calcified lesion) obstructive lesion (&gt;70% diameter stenosis on coronary&#xD;
           angiography, or a fractional flow reserve &lt;0.80) that is considered suitable for&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) under IVUS guidance will be included in the&#xD;
           study. Exclusion criteria are: 1) age &gt;75 years, 2) ACS within &lt;3 months, 2) eGFR&#xD;
           &lt;60ml/min/1.73m², 3) previous coronary artery bypass surgery, 3) decompensated heart&#xD;
           failure, or left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%, 4) intravenous contrast allergy or&#xD;
           inability to receive treatment with aspirin, heparin, or thienopyridines, 5) anticipated&#xD;
           life expectancy &lt;1 year, 6) history of heart transplantation, 7) patient that requires&#xD;
           surgical revascularization, and 8) extensive coronary artery disease (i.e., multiple&#xD;
           chronic total occlusions) or tortuous coronary anatomy that does not allow assessment of&#xD;
           the coronary arteries with NIRS-IVUS imaging. The recruited patients will provide&#xD;
           informed consent and undergo CTCA imaging using a dedicated 3rd generation CT&#xD;
           dual-source scanner (Siemens Force). The first 4 months of the study effort will be made&#xD;
           to optimise image acquisition protocols so as the obtained CTCA data to be suitable for&#xD;
           automated segmentation. Efficient imaging matrixes will be used to improve in-plane&#xD;
           spatial resolution and sharper reconstruction kernels and iterative reconstruction&#xD;
           algorithms will be implemented to enhance image segmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two weeks after CTCA imaging the patients will undergo planned PCI. During PCI effort&#xD;
           will be made to study all the 3 epicardial coronary arteries - including the stenotic&#xD;
           lesion - and some of their major side branches (i.e., large diagonals, obtuse marginals,&#xD;
           the posterior descending artery or the left ventricular branch of the right coronary&#xD;
           artery) with the combined NIRS-IVUS catheter. Following PCI the participants will be&#xD;
           discharged on optimal medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Segmentation of the CTCA imaging data and reconstruction of coronary artery anatomy&#xD;
           Imaging data will be anonymised and analysed blinded to clinical details by an expert&#xD;
           operator using dedicated workstation. Anatomical landmarks (i.e., side branches) will be&#xD;
           identified in the CTCA and NIRS-IVUS imaging data and will be used to define segments of&#xD;
           interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of the CTCA data will be performed using dedicated software that enables&#xD;
           automated extraction of the luminal centreline, semi-automated detection of the lumen&#xD;
           and outer vessel wall borders, and quantification of the plaque burden and incorporates&#xD;
           a plaque characterisation algorithm that allows automated characterisation of the&#xD;
           composition of the plaque. The plaque characterisation algorithm takes into account&#xD;
           predefined fixed intensity cut-off values of the Hounsfield units and an adaptive&#xD;
           approach that allows modification of these cut-off values according to image&#xD;
           attenuation. Currently the segmentation process takes on average 3h per patient. In this&#xD;
           project the investigators aim to optimise CTCA image acquisition and segmentation&#xD;
           algorithms so as this process to become automated and reduce the time for CTCA&#xD;
           segmentation to &lt;1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Segmentation of the NIRS-IVUS imaging data and reconstruction of coronary artery anatomy&#xD;
           The NIRS-IVUS data portraying the segments of interest will be analysed by an expert&#xD;
           operator, blinded to the clinical details and CTCA imaging data, with a 3-month interval&#xD;
           from the analysis of the CTCA data using a software that enables detection of the lumen&#xD;
           and outer vessel wall borders, quantification of plaque burden and annotation of the&#xD;
           calcific tissue component in IVUS. The output of the analysis of the NIRS imaging data&#xD;
           is the chemogram which is a colour coded map of the distribution of the lipid component&#xD;
           along the vessel wall (yellow indicates increased probability and red low probability of&#xD;
           lipid tissue). A metric of the lipid burden is the lipid core burden index (LCBI) which&#xD;
           is computed as the fraction of the yellow pixels that correspond to lipid component&#xD;
           divided by 1000. In addition, for each 2mm segments the block chemogram is generated&#xD;
           that provides a summary of the chemogram for this segment and displays the probability&#xD;
           of the presence of lipid tissue in a 2mm block of the coronary artery. The block&#xD;
           chemogram has been validated against histology and it has been shown that it enables&#xD;
           accurate detection of lipid-rich plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The segmented NIRS-IVUS data will be used to reconstruct the coronary anatomy using an&#xD;
           established and well-validated methodology. Side branches with a diameter &gt;1.5mm will be&#xD;
           reconstructed from the angiographic data and fused with the main vessel geometry&#xD;
           reconstructed from the NIRS-IVUS, since it has been shown that side branches affect ESS&#xD;
           distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood flow simulation Identical boundary conditions will be applied to both IVUS-based&#xD;
           and CTCA-based models. Blood will be considered to be a laminar and incompressible&#xD;
           Newtonian fluid with a dynamic viscosity of 0.0035 Pa•s and a density of 1,050 kg/m3. A&#xD;
           steady flow profile will be imposed at the inflow of the lumen as this reduces&#xD;
           computation time and there is evidence that there is no significant difference in the&#xD;
           estimated ESS when a steady or a pulsatile flow profile is used. Murray's theory of&#xD;
           constant ESS will be used to derive boundary conditions in the main and side branches.&#xD;
           The arterial wall will be considered to be rigid and no-slip conditions will be applied&#xD;
           at the luminal surface. Flow velocity will be estimated from the angiographic data by&#xD;
           measuring the number of frames required for the contrast agent to pass from the inlet to&#xD;
           the outlet of the reconstructed segment, the volume of the segment at baseline, and the&#xD;
           cine frame rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analysis of the NIRS-IVUS and CTCA imaging data It is anticipated that NIRS-IVUS imaging&#xD;
           will be performed on average in 2.5 vessels per patient; from these 40 randomly selected&#xD;
           vessels will be used to train the algorithms for CTCA segmentation and plaque&#xD;
           characterisation (training dataset) and the remaining for validation purposes&#xD;
           (validation dataset).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the training set, the segments of interest reconstructed from the CTCA and NIRS-IVUS data&#xD;
      will be divided in 2mm segments and corresponding 2mm segments will be identified in the CTCA&#xD;
      and NIRS-IVUS models. For each 2mm segment the following metrics will be estimated in the&#xD;
      NIRS-IVUS models: mean lumen area, mean outer vessel wall area, mean plaque area, mean plaque&#xD;
      burden (defined as: 100 x plaque area/vessel area), mean calcific area, the LCBI and the&#xD;
      predominant ESS. In addition each segment will be classified as lipid-rich or non-lipid rich&#xD;
      according to the block chemogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, in the CTCA models the mean lumen area, outer vessel wall area, plaque area,&#xD;
      plaque burden, calcific area and the mean predominant ESS will be estimated for every 2mm&#xD;
      segment and compared with the estimations of NIRS-IVUS. Several approaches will be tested to&#xD;
      optimise the segmentation of the vessel wall borders and the best will be adopted. Segments&#xD;
      with increased calcific burden and blooming artifacts will be identified and in case of&#xD;
      significant differences between CTCA and NIRS-IVUS annotations, machine learning techniques,&#xD;
      that take advantage of the information provided by NIRS-IVUS, will be implemented to optimise&#xD;
      CTCA segmentation. The adaptive Hounsfield unit cut-offs that best identify lipid and&#xD;
      calcific tissue will be defined. Spread-out vessel plots portraying the distribution of the&#xD;
      lipid tissue in the CTCA models will be created and in these the LCBICT will be estimated for&#xD;
      each 2mm segment and compared with the output of NIRS. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis&#xD;
      will be used to identify the best CT-derived plaque burden, LCBI and ESS cut-off values that&#xD;
      correspond to the NIRS-IVUS cutoff values that indicate high-risk plaques (plaque burden:&#xD;
      67%, LCBI: 178 and ESS: 1Pa). The block chemogram in NIRS-IVUS will be used to identify the&#xD;
      2mm LCBICT cut-off that enables accurate classification of the 2mm segments in as lipid or&#xD;
      non-lipid rich. The accuracy of these cut-offs will be tested in the validation dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in the validation dataset the NIRS-IVUS data will be used to identify coronary&#xD;
      lesions - defined as segments with a plaque burden &gt;40% in 3 consecutive frames. For each&#xD;
      lesion its remodelling index will be estimated and used to classify them as lesions with a&#xD;
      positive or negative remodelling. The NIRS-IVUS data will be used to characterise their&#xD;
      phenotype and classify them as: pathological intimal thickening/fibrotic plaques,&#xD;
      fibro-calcific plaques, fibroatheromas (FA), and calcified fibroatheromas. The NIRS-IVUS&#xD;
      lesion classification will be used as reference standard in order to assess the accuracy of&#xD;
      CTCA in characterising lesion phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - POWER CALCULATION The primary endpoint of the study is the ability of&#xD;
      CTCA in detecting FA. In a study of Garcia-Garcia that included 129 patients undergoing singe&#xD;
      vessel IVUS imaging, 1.7 lesions were identified per patient. In the study of Puri et al.,&#xD;
      45% of the lesions were FA on histology. In that study NIRS combined with IVUS enabled&#xD;
      detection of FA with an excellent accuracy (c-index: 0.80). We anticipate that we will be&#xD;
      able to perform NIRS-IVUS imaging in 2.5 coronary arteries per patient and that CTCA imaging&#xD;
      quality will be optimal in 93% of the studied patients. If we recruit 70 patients we&#xD;
      anticipate to successfully study with NIRS-IVUS and CTCA 162 vessels of which 120 (203&#xD;
      lesions - 92 FA) will be used as a validation dataset. This dataset is anticipated to give an&#xD;
      80% power to demonstrate using the 5% significance level, that the sensitivity of CTCA in&#xD;
      identifying FA is not different from NIRS-IVUS (AUC of CTCA range: 0.89-0.71), assuming a&#xD;
      true sensitivity of 0.80 for NIRS-IVUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of the study are the accuracy of CTCA to identify: a) lipid-rich segments&#xD;
      (using the block chemogram of NIRS-IVUS as gold standard), and b) segments exposed to low ESS&#xD;
      (&lt;1Pa, using the ESS estimated in the NIRS-IVUS models as reference standard).&#xD;
