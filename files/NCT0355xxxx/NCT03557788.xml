  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) carries a high prevalence worldwide and imposes substantial&#xD;
      economic burden on patients, healthcare systems and society. In recent years, dysbiosis of&#xD;
      the gut microbiota and bile acid (BA) malabsorption have been identified as putative&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms. Bile acid metabolism and gut microbiota are closely related.&#xD;
      When patients with IBS-D were compared to healthy subjects, total levels of faecal BAs do not&#xD;
      differ, but increased faecal primary BAs and reduced secondary BAs have been repeatedly&#xD;
      observed in patients with IBS-D, suggesting abnormal BA deconjugation. Rifaximin, a&#xD;
      non-absorbable antibiotic, has been shown in a recent meta-analysis to produce a therapeutic&#xD;
      clinical gain compared to other treatment options for IBS, including placebo, paralleled by a&#xD;
      high safety profile. It is also now known that changes in fecal microbiota have been observed&#xD;
      in patients with IBS who have responded positively to Rifaximin. The relationship between&#xD;
      microbiota changes, metabolomics changes after Rifaximin is unclear. There is emerging data&#xD;
      to suggest duodenal dysbiosis as a putative pathophysiology, which in one study, clustered&#xD;
      together with salivary microbiota than with fecal microbiota. However, the oral microbiome in&#xD;
      patients with IBS has never been explored, which could possibly explain the downstream&#xD;
      observations of duodenal and fecal dysbiosis. The investigators aim to assess the changes in&#xD;
      metabolomic and microbiota profile after Rifaximin treatment, between responders and&#xD;
      non-responders. The investigators will also explore the oral microbiome in IBS patients, and&#xD;
      assess its relationship with fecal microbiome between responders and non-responders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the study is that amongst responders to Rifaximin, fecal primary&#xD;
      BAs will be significantly reduced, and faecal secondary BAs significantly increased after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in Escherichia and increase in Lactobacillus after treatment, as a possible&#xD;
           mechanism to explain the increased deconjugation of primary BAs observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oral microbiome correlates with gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBS-D subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rifaximin therapy alters both oral and gut microbiota, and that responders to Rifaximin&#xD;
           harbour different microbiota compared to non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary Objectives Primary Objective: To compare oral microbiome and fecal&#xD;
                microbiome in IBS-D patients before and after Rifaximin, examining differences&#xD;
                between responders and non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives: To examine the differences between stool&#xD;
                and salivary metabolomics, urinary metabolomics and serum immunomics and&#xD;
                metabolomics, between responders and non-responders to Rifaximin in IBS-D subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responders to Rifaximin will be defined as patients having a 50 point or more reduction in&#xD;
      the IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) after treatment. This indicates that the patient has&#xD;
      experienced a significant improvement in the reduction of symptoms. The IBS-SSS is a&#xD;
      well-validated questionnaire that is patient-administered. This questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered at Day 0 and Day 14 of Rifaximin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 subjects with Diarrhoea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) will be&#xD;
      recruited from the National University Hospital Gastroenterology clinic and Singapore General&#xD;
      Hospital Gastroenterology clinic. There will be subject restrictions on race, so as to limit&#xD;
      variation due to inter-racial differences and ensure homogeneity in the subject population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size Adopted from the sample size calculation table for human&#xD;
      microbiome studies by La Rosa (La Rosa et al. 2012), the study will require 15 subjects to&#xD;
      have 80% power at p&lt;0.05 significance level. To account for multiple testing, investigators&#xD;
      will require at least 25 subjects for each category to have 90% power at p&lt;0.01 significance&#xD;
      level. The investigating team will be recruiting a total of 40 respondents and 40&#xD;
      non-respondents from both NUH and SGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Analytical Plans Pair-wise comparison will be conducted between the 2 sample&#xD;
      groups for differences in the microbiome. Concordance will be examined between the oral and&#xD;
      fecal groups, both before and after treatment. Identified species will be examined for&#xD;
      possible metabolic pathways based on their genetic profiles generated by the metagenomic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality Assurance Demographics will be collected from the patient medical records. The&#xD;
      oral conditions will be recorded in data collection form after oral examinations. The data&#xD;
      collection form will be checked and signed off by PI. All the records will be entered twice&#xD;
      into database by the delegated study team members to ensure accuracy of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry and Storage Initial collection will be on paper-based data collection form. All&#xD;
      subjects will be assigned a unique study subject code and the data collection form will be&#xD;
      labelled with subject recruitment number. The de-identified data will be transferred into&#xD;
      analysis software and kept on an encrypted flash drive kept by the delegated study team&#xD;
      members. The data collection form will be put in lockable cabinet for 6 years after study&#xD;
      completion, being accessed by study team only. De-identified data may be provided to a&#xD;
      biostatistician for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Procedures This is a multi-centre open-label prospective cohort study.&#xD;
      Recruited subjects will be patients who are newly diagnosed IBS-D, who undergo a two-week&#xD;
      course of Rifaximin as indicated by their primary physician. Patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      improvement (responders) after treatment will be compared to patients who do not improve&#xD;
      (non-responders), based on a validated IBS Symptom Severity Score. As this is a cohort study,&#xD;
      there will be no randomization or blinding. All patients will receive Rifaximin and no&#xD;
      placebo will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening The screening phase will include assessing eligibility based on the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, obtaining informed consent, followed by a one-week symptom,&#xD;
      bowel and 3-day dietary diary. All subjects will undergo further oral examination to&#xD;
      determine oral status such as caries and periodontal status. This is to accurately evaluate&#xD;
      the patient's baseline symptoms, bowel and dietary habits. Patients will be given a stool&#xD;
      collection kit for collection of stool sample (10-20g) to be returned before or at the next&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Enrolment and treatment (Day 1 Rifaximin) After the screening phase, patients will&#xD;
      complete the IBS-SSS, and will be enrolled if a score of 300 or greater is obtained. Urine&#xD;
      (50ml), saliva (5-10ml), 2 buccal swabs and blood samples (20ml) will be obtained during this&#xD;
      visit as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then initiate Rifaximin for two weeks. During these two weeks, patients will&#xD;
      continue the symptom, bowel and 3-day dietary dairy, and also whether they have remembered to&#xD;
      take their medication, and any side effects observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Follow-up post-treatment (Day 14 Rifaximin) Patients will be asked to provide stool&#xD;
      (10-20g), urine (50ml), saliva (5-10ml), 2 buccal swabs and blood samples (20ml) again at or&#xD;
      1-week after Day 14, and repeat the IBS-SSS. The diaries will be collected, and compliance to&#xD;
      medication will be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who discontinue the study early due to an AE will be followed until resolution or&#xD;
      stabilization of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Review of symptoms 90 days after completing Rifaximin treatment. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to repeat the IBS-SSS. The symptom, bowel and 3-day dietary dairy will be collected and&#xD;
      patients will be asked to provide stool (10-20g), urine (50ml), saliva (5-10ml), 2 buccal&#xD;
      swabs and blood samples (20ml).&#xD;
