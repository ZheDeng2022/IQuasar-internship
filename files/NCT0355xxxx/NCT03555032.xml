  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the safety and effects of combining a new drug called Talimogene&#xD;
      Laherparepvec (T-VEC) with chemotherapy delivered by Isolated Limb Perfusion (ILP). The&#xD;
      investigators want to find out whether these two treatments can be combined safely and&#xD;
      whether T-VEC with ILP is better at treating your cancer than with ILP alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomised, single-centre Phase I/II study of the combination of the oncolytic&#xD;
      virus, TVEC, administered by intra-tumoural (i.t.) injection in combination with isolated&#xD;
      limb perfusion with melphalan and tumour necrosis factor in patients with advanced extremity&#xD;
      tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of T-VEC administered by i.t. injection followed by isolated limb perfusion will&#xD;
      be assessed in an initial safety run in comprised of six subjects as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: The first subject will be recruited and will receive an initial dose of T-VEC 4-6&#xD;
      weeks prior to isolated limb perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further preoperative dose of i.t. T-VEC will be given at 2-3 weeks prior to isolated limb&#xD;
      perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third dose will be given on the day of isolated limb perfusion. Following isolated limb&#xD;
      perfusion, no further doses of TVEC shall be given. No further patients will be recruited&#xD;
      until this patient has passed 30 days from the end of the study treatment. If this patient&#xD;
      experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will meet to&#xD;
      consider termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Assuming no DLTs in Cohort 1, two further patients will be recruited and receive&#xD;
      the study treatment as described above. Once these patients have passed 30 days from the end&#xD;
      of the study treatment, the TSC will meet and perform a safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Assuming TSC approval following Cohort 2, three further patients will be recruited&#xD;
      and receive the study treatment as described above. Once these patients have passed 30 days&#xD;
      from the end of the study treatment, the TSC will meet and perform a safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 4: Open recruitment up to a maximum of 15 patients in total, unless otherwise&#xD;
      indicated by the TSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 1 DLT is observed at any point in the study, the Chief Investigator will notify&#xD;
      the TSC and recruitment will be suspended until further notification from the TSC.&#xD;
