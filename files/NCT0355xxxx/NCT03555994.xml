    <textblock>
      A phase 2 study in two parts (A &amp; B) designed to evaluate the effect of MEDI0382 on Hepatic&#xD;
      Glycogen Metabolism in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Approximately 20&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in Part A and approximately 30 subjects in Part B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part exploratory Phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      MEDI0382 (also known as Cotadutide) administered once daily subcutaneously (SC) for 28 days&#xD;
      on hepatic glycogen metabolism in overweight and obese subjects with T2DM. Part A is planned&#xD;
      to randomise up to 20 subjects. Subjects from Part A will not be re-enrolled in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is an exploratory Phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label&#xD;
      active comparator study to evaluate the effect of MEDI0382 on hepatic glycogen metabolism in&#xD;
      overweight and obese subjects with T2DM. Part B is planned to randomise approximately 30&#xD;
      subjects (not to exceed a maximum of 35 subjects). Subjects in Part B will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive double-blind MEDI0382 or placebo, or open-label liraglutide once daily for 35 days.&#xD;
