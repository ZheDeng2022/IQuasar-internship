  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity) is a common problem which can lead to&#xD;
      distressing symptoms. When caused by cancer, management options are chemotherapy, diuretics&#xD;
      and ascitic drainage. Ascitic drainage is performed by inserting a plastic tube into the&#xD;
      abdomen and draining off the fluid under local anaesthetic, removing the drain afterwards.&#xD;
      For some, the fluid will return and the procedure needs repeating. A relatively new treatment&#xD;
      involves inserting a semi-permanent drain - a small plastic tube under the skin which is left&#xD;
      in place so that the fluid can be drained if it builds up again. The potential benefit to&#xD;
      patients is that afterwards they can have fluid removed at home. This might reduce the number&#xD;
      of hospital admissions, outpatient visits and the number of procedures they need to have in&#xD;
      the last few months of life. In Gloucestershire, the Rocket Indwelling Pleural Catheter (IPC)&#xD;
      is the semi-permanent drain of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group has a particular interest in the management of ascites and we recently&#xD;
      completed the first qualitative interview study with patients with this condition - patients&#xD;
      with ascites secondary to cancer. Patients were pleased to have semi-permanent drains in&#xD;
      place as it meant that repeated admissions to hospital were avoided. They did not have to&#xD;
      wait for a build-up of fluid before more could be drained off; and symptoms never had to&#xD;
      build up as badly as when they were having repeated ascitic drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan a feasibility study to ascertain whether a definitive non-randomised study to detect&#xD;
      differences in quality of life between Rocket IPC and repeat ascitic drainage is possible and&#xD;
      how many patients would be needed for such a study.&#xD;

      Study Objective This feasibility study aims to establish how best to conduct a definitive&#xD;
      prospective non-randomised QOL study for patients with malignant ascites who either have&#xD;
      placement of a Rocket IPC or repeated LVP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an open label, non-randomised observational study. Each patient will&#xD;
      receive verbal and written information followed by signing of an Informed Consent Form prior&#xD;
      to participation. They will be asked to capture data about their QOL by completing paper&#xD;
      diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a relative / next of kin we will ask permission from the patient to&#xD;
      approach them to see if they would be happy to consent to helping with data collection for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients are booked for ascitic drainage in hospitals or hospice a member of the&#xD;
      patient's clinical team will discuss the study with the patient (either in person or via&#xD;
      telephone). If in agreement, the doctor / nurse will pass on their contact details to a&#xD;
      member of the research team who will then telephone the patient and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask the patient if they would be happy to receive a patient information leaflet by post&#xD;
           or email&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask the patient if they would be happy for their relative / next of kin to be contacted&#xD;
           about this study. The relative / next of kin will then be contacted and, if they are&#xD;
           happy to receive it, a participant information leaflet will be posted or emailed to&#xD;
           them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [If the patient is having an IPC fitted the relative may fit the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      related study, Rocket Project 2, so that this study may be discussed at this point and a&#xD;
      participant information leaflet provided too.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of admission for the procedure informed consent will be obtained from the patient&#xD;
      and the following information will be obtained and recorded on a case report form:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's age, gender, diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many LVPs the patient has had up until the current procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's understanding of treatment options for ascites management, in particular&#xD;
           whether Rocket IPC has been mentioned&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why was this option chosen?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opinion about participation in a randomised trial if one was being conducted The&#xD;
           research nurse will ensure that baseline blood tests to include renal function and&#xD;
           albumin have been performed prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rarely, a patient could be referred for the procedure and have it performed later that day.&#xD;
      In that scenario we would like to have permission for a cooling off period to be waived by&#xD;
      the participants - we would argue that this is not a particularly burdensome study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will also be sought from the relative / next of kin. It will usually be&#xD;
      possible to do obtain this when the patient attends for the procedure but a separate&#xD;
      appointment to obtain informed consent may be needed at the relative / next of kin's home or&#xD;
      care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient can be recruited to the study if their relative / next of kin does not consent OR&#xD;
      they have no relative / next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A four week diary will be given to the patient to capture the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of LVPs / Rocket IPC drainage episodes performed*&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Volumes of fluid removed at LVPs OR number of Rocket IPC bottles used at Rocket IPC&#xD;
           drainage*&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any complications - catheter blockage, infections, hospital admissions*&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System:Ascites Modification (ESAS:AM) DAILY&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) as a generic QOL measure DAILY&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core QOL&#xD;
           Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) WEEKLY&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Anti-cancer treatment received by the patient*&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Diuretics received by the patient*&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a relative / next of kin has consented they can help the patient to complete their diary.&#xD;
      They will not be able to give a proxy measure for any of the quality of life scores but will&#xD;
      be able to assist the patient with completion of these and also with objective measures (e.g.&#xD;
      those marked * above) The research nurse will contact the patient frequently by phone, to&#xD;
      provide support with data collection, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is close to completing 4 weeks in the study they will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to complete another 4 week diary. It will be explained to them that this is not&#xD;
      essential but will provide useful information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When close to completing the 2nd 4 week diary (i.e. after 8 weeks) they will, once again, be&#xD;
      offered a further diary. Patients will complete a maximum of three diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be expected to complete questionnaires if they do not feel well enough or&#xD;
      lose capacity. Patients' clinical course can fluctuate and there may be a time when they feel&#xD;
      well enough to complete questionnaires again. Data about fluid volumes removed may still be&#xD;
      collected after a patient loses capacity by healthcare staff, as is routine practice, or&#xD;
      consenting relatives / next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with capacity will be approached for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Tests Renal function and albumin will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks&#xD;
      (the latter 2 time points only if the patient remains in the study after 4 weeks and 8 weeks)&#xD;
      - if necessary performed by the research nurse at patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests will not be performed on patients who have lost capacity for the purposes of this&#xD;
      study. If patients without capacity have blood tests taken for other reasons the results will&#xD;
      be used as part of data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a very small percentage of people living in Gloucestershire are not English speaking. It&#xD;
      has been decided that it is not cost effective to fund translation for this feasibility&#xD;
      study. The information on the numbers of patients / carers who may have been excluded and the&#xD;
      languages that might have been needed will be collected and this will be taken into account&#xD;
      when planning a larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been recommendations about suitable QOL measures for use with patients with&#xD;
      ascites. We discussed these with service users and carers and have agreed on using for this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System:Ascites Modification (ESAS:AM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) as a generic QOL measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core QOL&#xD;
           Questionnaire (QLQ-C30)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition we will ask healthcare professionals, patients or consenting carers (depending on&#xD;
      who manages the drain) to record volumes of fluid removed at each paracentesis and episode of&#xD;
      semi-permanent drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask patients and carers about:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drainage complications and hospital admissions. Chemotherapy use Diuretic use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of subjects from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will cease participation in the study when one of the following criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They choose to withdraw They choose not to complete a further QOL diary They complete their&#xD;
      third monthly QOL diary They lose capacity and it is thought that this will be permanent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers will cease participation in the study when one of the following criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They choose to withdraw The patient dies&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient may remain in the study although a carer / next of kin has withdrawn and vice&#xD;
      versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Percentage presence and percentage completeness of the three QOL&#xD;
      measures will be evaluated. These results will allow an estimation of the number of patients,&#xD;
      resources and time needed to perform a definitive prospective non-randomised QOL study for&#xD;
      patients with malignant ascites who either have placement of a Rocket IPC or repeated LVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analysis will also be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D averaged for each participant for the duration of their participation,&#xD;
           using the area under the curve method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ESAS:AM analysed by estimating the prevalence of individual symptoms at each time point,&#xD;
           as well as the time-weighted average burden of symptoms for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that data from the feasibility study can be used in the definitive study if the&#xD;
      methodology of the two studies remains the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate over a 6-month period approximately 60 patients with ascites secondary to cancer&#xD;
      will have a paracentesis. We plan to recruit 20 patients having a drainage procedure (LVP or&#xD;
      Rocket IPC) within 6 months.&#xD;
