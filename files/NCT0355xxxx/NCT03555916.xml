    <textblock>
      Peripheral painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (PPTTN) are poorly relieved by existing&#xD;
      treatments which in addition induce many adverse effects. BTX, which blocks the exocytosis of&#xD;
      neurotransmitters, can be captured by axonal retrograde transport in primary nociceptive&#xD;
      neurons. Injected in the painful area, it might therefore inhibit the release of algogenic&#xD;
      neurotransmitters, at both the peripheral and central levels and thus reduce pain. One study&#xD;
      reported such an effect in neuropathic spinal pain. A recent study reported an analgesic&#xD;
      effect in trigeminal neuralgia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumas of either physical (shocks, ballistic impacts etc.) or surgical origin are&#xD;
      accompanied by acute pain which disappears in most cases with tissue healing. However, in&#xD;
      some instances pain may persist in spite of an apparently normal tissue repair. Many reports&#xD;
      have pointed to the societal impact of these neuropathic pains which is a major public health&#xD;
      problem in Europe and in the world. In addition to the degradation of the quality of&#xD;
      individual life that affects hedonistic, emotional, social, professional etc. dimensions of&#xD;
      life, the economic cost to society is considerable (treatment costs, work absenteeism, loss&#xD;
      of motivation and concentration, etc.) Among these pains, PPTTN resulting from orofacial&#xD;
      nerve damage after physical or surgical trauma are little studied. Some studies suggest a&#xD;
      high prevalence, ranging from 0.5 to 12% after oral surgery, including endodontic treatment&#xD;
      (root canal treatment), simple or complex dental extractions like wisdom teeth, dental&#xD;
      implants, and surgical interventions (cyst removal, orthognathic surgery etc.). However,&#xD;
      despite significant advances in recent decades, pathophysiological mechanisms of these pains&#xD;
      are still largely unknown. The majority of these pains are clinically resistant to standard&#xD;
      analgesics and therefore extremely difficult to treat, particularly for trigeminal pain.&#xD;
      Understanding these pains is of major interest to determine new strategies and therapeutic&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatology and Pathophysiology The main complaint of patients is moderate to severe and&#xD;
      usually burning but may be stabbing. Most cases are continuous, but may report superimposed&#xD;
      paroxysmal pain attacks. Less frequently, the pain may be short lasting with associated&#xD;
      mechanical trigger areas, mimicking trigeminal idiopathic neuralgia. However, even in these&#xD;
      cases, the pain attacks are usually longer than those associated with trigeminal neuralgia.&#xD;
      Pain is unilateral and may be precisely located to the dermatome of the affected nerve with&#xD;
      demonstrable sensory dysfunction. The pain may be diffuse and spread across dermatomes, but&#xD;
      rarely crosses the midline. Patients may complain of a feeling of swelling, foreign body, hot&#xD;
      or cold, local redness or flushing. Non-painful but annoying dysesthesias such as itching,&#xD;
      numbness, etc. are often present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a pathophysiological point of view, the development of painful symptoms after peripheral&#xD;
      nerve injury is related to peripheral and central changes. Damaged tissue initiate peripheral&#xD;
      changes at the injury site that result in functional changes of neuronal, glial and vascular&#xD;
      cells, followed by ganglionic and central changes. These changes modify both the functioning&#xD;
      and the excitability of individual neurons and the configuration of synaptic networks, at the&#xD;
      spinal cord/ brainstem and brain levels. These events in turn lead to genetic and epigenetic&#xD;
      changes which translate as long term alterations of neuronal phenotypes Our research group&#xD;
      (Team &quot;Neuroinflammation Pain and Stress&quot;, U894, Psychiatry Centre and Neurosciences.) has&#xD;
      been involved for many years in deciphering the actors and events contributing to the&#xD;
      development of post-traumatic neuropathic pain, in both spinal and trigeminal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The diagnostic difficulty is a therapeutic challenge. During the many consultations&#xD;
      (average of 7.5 practitioners visited), patients received different treatments: surgical,&#xD;
      antidepressant, analgesic or alternative which are often ineffective and potentially&#xD;
      iatrogenic and often need to be complemented by a psychotherapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical management of patients with neuropathic pain is controversial. Indeed, the long&#xD;
      term results of micro-neurosurgical procedures are often anecdotal, highly variable, and&#xD;
      operator-dependent. In addition they are difficult to assess because studies are rare and&#xD;
      involve only few patients. A thorough evaluation of these techniques is necessary and many&#xD;
      other authors recommend stopping any surgical procedure at the site of pain and&#xD;
      contraindicate surgery. These could indeed worsen the patient's pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment of PPTTN is the same as for post traumatic spinal neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      It is symptomatic, not curative, and combines systemic medical treatment with topical&#xD;
      treatment (anesthetics). Neuropathic pain responds little or not at all to the classical&#xD;
      analgesics like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and are&#xD;
      treated by other therapeutic classes. Current treatments are based on the recommendations of&#xD;
      different scientific societies, French (SFETD), European (EFNS) and American (APS).&#xD;
      Treatments usually used are tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids and&#xD;
      inhibitors of the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. However these treatments induce&#xD;
      many adverse effects more or less tolerated, sometimes leading to treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      or dose reductions and impaired efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the diagnosis of PPTTN is difficult and is often made after extensive&#xD;
      consultations in specialized centers. The management is unsatisfactory due to the complexity&#xD;
      of physio-pathogenic mechanisms and the lack of specific drugs. It is most often performed by&#xD;
      specialized practitioners and uses multidisciplinary skills (dentist, neurologist,&#xD;
      psychiatrist and psychologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for the study Since its introduction in the 1970s for the treatment of strabismus,&#xD;
      blepharospasm, and focal dystonia, botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has been widely used in the&#xD;
      treatment of conditions characterized by excessive muscle contraction and/or involvement of&#xD;
      the cholinergic system (focal dystonia, spasticity, abnormal sphincter contractions, eye&#xD;
      movement, hyperkinetic and vegetative disorders). Many studies have also been conducted in&#xD;
      the case of painful conditions with a muscular component following a pioneer work observing a&#xD;
      significant decrease in pain after BTX injection. Other studies have also reported pain&#xD;
      relief during several weeks. The neurotoxin has been used in other types of pain disorders&#xD;
      including myofascial pain, blepharospasm, myalgia of the masticatory system (TMD), back pain,&#xD;
      painful myoclonia, urologic, rectal or pelvic pain and cervicogenic, neurovascular and&#xD;
      tension type headaches, and migraine. The results depend on conditions and on the dose used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is at the Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) that the action of botulinum neurotoxin has been&#xD;
      the most studied. It blocks the release of acetylcholine and causes a reversible&#xD;
      deafferentation of the motor endplate (28 days). A first recovery occurs by sprouting and the&#xD;
      restoration of function in the initial innervation and loss of sprouts. Full recovery is&#xD;
      achieved in about 90 days. However, this sole effect appears insufficient to explain all of&#xD;
      the analgesic activity of the neurotoxin, demonstrated in numerous animal studies and&#xD;
      therapeutic clinical trials.Effects on nociceptive system The effects of the neurotoxin can&#xD;
      also be explained by effects other than on the neuromuscular system, including the&#xD;
      nociceptive system. BTX affects the vesicular release of neurotransmitters / neuromodulators.&#xD;
      The analgesic effect may be explained by a peripheral action by blocking the axon reflex that&#xD;
      releases usually neuropeptides (substance P, neurokinin A, CGRP) by small diameter type C&#xD;
      primary afferent nerve fibers and causes the phenomena of neurogenic inflammation including&#xD;
      vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. BTX inhibits the release of substance P and&#xD;
      glutamate and reduces the inflammatory pain induced by formalin injection. In addition, the&#xD;
      toxin can be captured by nerve endings and transported by retrograde and orthograde axonal&#xD;
      transport to remote sites, at the level of primary afferents termination site for example or&#xD;
      at other sites of neuronal interaction with glial cells or other neuronal types. BoNT can&#xD;
      therefore inhibit the release of algogenic neurotransmitters present in nociceptive primary&#xD;
      afferent (SP, glutamate) both peripherally and centrally. BTX also decreases the expression&#xD;
      of TRPV1 receptors on the membrane surface of nociceptors in animals, and humans. These&#xD;
      receptors are involved in the transduction of thermal information and their activation&#xD;
      results in a burning sensation, which is also a frequently encountered qualitative&#xD;
      characteristic in post-traumatic neuropathic pain. Recently it has been shown that&#xD;
      administration of BTX decreases the expression of TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons in a&#xD;
      diabetic model of neuropathic pain. Finally, the toxin also decreases the expression of other&#xD;
      pain receptors such as purinergic receptors P2X3. In humans, the intradermal injection of&#xD;
      BTX-A in healthy volunteers resulted in a marked decrease in specific and painful mechanical&#xD;
      sensitivity without changing the tactile, non nociceptive mechanoreception, without affecting&#xD;
      the density of cutaneous innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injected in the painful area, BTX-A might therefore inhibit the release of algogenic&#xD;
      neurotransmitters, at both the peripheral and central levels and thus reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will therefore explore in a double blind randomized, with two parallel&#xD;
      groups, BTX-A vs placebo, the analgesic effects of BTX-A in PPTTN patients.&#xD;
