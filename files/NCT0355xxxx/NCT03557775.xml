  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presbyphonia is an age-related voice disorder that affects more than 10 million people in the&#xD;
      United States. Presbyphonia is characterized by vocal fold atrophy that impairs older&#xD;
      individuals' ability to communicate, leading to social isolation and reduced quality of life.&#xD;
      Outcomes from current treatment approaches are often suboptimal for patients with&#xD;
      presbyphonia as they do not sufficiently challenge the respiratory system to induce&#xD;
      meaningful change. It is highly likely that the addition of respiratory training would result&#xD;
      in greatly improved outcomes, such as the ability to speak loud and long enough to have a&#xD;
      normal conversation. The purpose of this study will be to examine the effect of adding&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) or expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) to&#xD;
      standard of care voice therapy on respiratory and voice outcomes in patients with an&#xD;
      age-related voice disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight participants diagnosed with presbyphonia will be blocked-randomized into three&#xD;
      intervention groups, using a 3-parallel arm design: IMST and voice exercises, EMST and voice&#xD;
      exercises, and voice exercises during all session. Study endpoints will be the change in&#xD;
      voice and respiratory measures after four treatment sessions compared to baseline values.&#xD;
      Response to treatment will be analyzed to determine if there are subgroups of high- or&#xD;
      low-responders based on baseline voice and respiratory characteristics.&#xD;

    <description>Measure of vocal fold atrophy, calculated as the length of the membranous vocal fold/distance from the edge x100. The index was calculated based on still images from the larynx obtained from videostroboscopy. A smaller bowing index is indicative of less atrophy, and is therefore a better outcome.
