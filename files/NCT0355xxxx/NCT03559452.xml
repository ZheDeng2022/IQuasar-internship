  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limb injury generally requires a period of recovery during which time the limb is often&#xD;
      immobilised (e.g. with a cast or brace) resulting in a rapid loss of skeletal muscle. Despite&#xD;
      the importance of muscle loss during injury, our understanding of how it occurs is&#xD;
      incomplete. Several factors are likely to contribute, including a lack of muscle contraction&#xD;
      and injury induced inflammation. In this study, the investigators will recruit healthy&#xD;
      volunteers who will spend 7 days in a knee brace to replicate leg immobilisation. Prior to&#xD;
      immobilisation, half of the participants will perform a single session of strenuous&#xD;
      resistance exercise which is known to cause muscle damage and initiate an inflammatory&#xD;
      response. This is designed to replicate the muscle damage and inflammation that occurs with&#xD;
      injury. The remaining half of participants will not perform this exercise, allowing us to&#xD;
      look at the additive effect of muscle damage and inflammation on muscle loss with&#xD;
      immobilisation.&#xD;

    <measure>Muscle protein synthesis assessed using the stable isotope Deuterium Oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>After 2 days of immobilisation</time_frame>
    <description>The enrichment of deuterated alanine (from the deuterium oxide heavy water stable isotope tracer) in vastus lateralis biopsy samples will be measured relative to the non-deuterated alanine.
