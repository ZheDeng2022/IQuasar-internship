  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local application of antibiotics directly to the traumatic wound is a promising strategy for&#xD;
      the prevention of infection after open tibia fractures, which are a significant source of&#xD;
      disease burden globally, particularly in low-income countries. This pilot study aims to&#xD;
      assess feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to measure the effect of locally applied&#xD;
      gentamicin on risk of infection for open tibial fractures in Tanzania. If proven effective,&#xD;
      local gentamicin would be a highly cost-effective strategy to reduce complications and&#xD;
      disability from open tibial fractures that could impact care in both high- and low-income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is being conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to assess the feasibility of a&#xD;
      masked, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to compare local gentamicin injection to saline&#xD;
      injection in open tibial shaft fractures. The study will enroll patients within 1 week of&#xD;
      injury. The active or placebo agent will be administered during the initial surgical&#xD;
      debridement based on a web-based randomization tool. Patients will be followed for 1 year&#xD;
      after surgery to assess for the occurrence of fracture-related infection (FRI), a consensus&#xD;
      definition of infection after open fracture or insertion of internal fixation to treat&#xD;
      fracture. Additional clinical and economic endpoints will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, we may undertake a definitive trial to&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of local gentamicin to prevent FRI. If proven effective, local&#xD;
      gentamicin would impact the clinical care of open fracture patients both in Tanzania and&#xD;
      likely in high-income settings as well. These data will also deepen the understanding of the&#xD;
      clinical and economic impact of FRI in open fracture populations.&#xD;

    <measure>Occurrence of fracture-related Infection (FRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for the definitive trial is occurrence of fracture-related infection (FRI), a binary variable. Any of the four following diagnostic criteria are confirmatory for FRI:&#xD;
fistula, sinus or wound breakdown&#xD;
purulent drainage from the wound or presence of pus during surgery&#xD;
phenotypically indistinguishable pathogens identified by culture from at least two separate deep tissue/implant specimens&#xD;
presence of microorganisms in deep tissue taken during an operative intervention, as seen on histopathological examination.&#xD;
All primary events will be reviewed by a masked adjudication committee comprised of 3 non-treating fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeons.</description>

    <measure>Euro-Qol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) measures general health status in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The raw score will be translated to a utility score ranging from 0 (death or no health) to 1 (perfect health) on a continuous scale using health-state valuations from Zimbabwe.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic healing as measured by the modified Radiographic Union Scale for Tibial fractures (mRUST). mRUST scores each cortex on an AP and lateral radiograph from a score of 1 (no callus) to 4 (remodeled, fracture not visible). Thus, mRUST ranges from 4 (worst healing score) to 16 (best healing score).</description>

    <measure>Function index for trauma (FIX-IT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical healing of the fracture will be assessed using the Function index for trauma (FIX-IT) score, which evaluates weight bearing and pain in patients with lower extremity fractures. The FIX-IT score is a clinical outcomes assessment measure ranging from 0 to 12 points in two domains: the ability to bear weight (maximum 6 points) and pain at the fracture site (maximum 6 points). The maximum score of 12 indicates the highest level of function.</description>
