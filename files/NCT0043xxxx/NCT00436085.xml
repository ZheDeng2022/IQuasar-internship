  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically changed the&#xD;
      consequences of an HIV infection, which is now viewed as a chronic disease. As in other&#xD;
      chronic diseases, emotional distress and depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients. Psychological factors such as these have been associated with lower&#xD;
      quality of life, lower adherence to therapy and also with a higher risk for mortality and&#xD;
      disease progression. Psychosocial interventions, such as group-based cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      stress management (CBSM) training, have been shown to reduce distress and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms in HIV-infected patients. These psychosocial effects are paralleled by changes in&#xD;
      physiological parameters, such as cortisol, DHEA-S, testosterones, catecholamines, and naïve&#xD;
      T-cell counts. While these results are congruent with recent evidence of the interaction&#xD;
      between psychological, neuroendocrine and immunological parameters in HIV-infected patients,&#xD;
      it needs to be shown whether the reported effects hold true in the HAART era. Most&#xD;
      importantly, it also needs to be ascertained whether these interventions have an impact on&#xD;
      immunological and virological HIV parameters as well as on mortality and morbidity in HIV&#xD;
      patients. We propose a randomized controlled one-year prospective evaluation of a group-based&#xD;
      CBSM training in 80 HIV-infected patients. Participating patients will be recruited at&#xD;
      cooperating centers of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and randomly assigned to CBSM training or&#xD;
      waiting control group condition. At baseline, post-training and two follow-up (6 and 12&#xD;
      months) assessments, effects of the CBSM on psychological, physiological and clinical&#xD;
      out-come variables in HIV-infected patients under HAART will be evaluated. Additionally, the&#xD;
      effects of CBSM on the neuroendocrine and autonomic stress reactivity in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients will be assessed, thus evaluating a possible direct pathway between emotional&#xD;
      distress and physiological HIV-relevant parameters. In conclusion, the planned research&#xD;
      project evaluates the effectiveness of a standardized psychosocial intervention as a possible&#xD;
      component of a comprehensive disease management in HIV-infected patients under HAART.&#xD;
