      Specific Aim: to implement and evaluate a research protocol for demonstrating the efficacy of&#xD;
      Acupuncture Therapy to improve neurological recovery after incomplete SCI compared to a&#xD;
      control protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: acupuncture treatment results in greater neurological recovery than a control&#xD;
      treatment after an incomplete SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before conducting a larger, more definitive study, this exploratory and developmental work is&#xD;
      focused on assessing whether blinding is possible, reproducibility of the outcome measure,&#xD;
      determine enrollment rates and effect sizes and identify clinical resources needed to conduct&#xD;
      a larger study.&#xD;

      The research design for this exploratory/developmental R21 application will be the same as&#xD;
      the anticipated design for a future definitive R01 investigation. A randomized controlled&#xD;
      treatment study will be used to compare neurological recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI)&#xD;
      in individuals receiving an acupuncture protocol designed to maximize treatment effectiveness&#xD;
      (treatment protocol) with an alternative acupuncture protocol designed to minimize treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness (control). The two acupuncture protocols will be identical except for 1) needle&#xD;
      placement, 2) use of sham, non-penetrating needles and 3) use of electricity for needle&#xD;
      stimulation. The two protocols are designed to be indistinguishable to an individual, so&#xD;
      participants will remain blind to whether they are receiving the treatment or the control&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: to implement and evaluate a research protocol for demonstrating the efficacy of&#xD;
      Acupuncture Therapy to improve neurological recovery after incomplete SCI compared to a&#xD;
      control protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: acupuncture treatment results in greater neurological recovery than a control&#xD;
      treatment after an incomplete SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before proposing a definitive R01 investigation to test this hypothesis, several preliminary&#xD;
      steps are required and will be addressed in this feasibility study. Five objectives have been&#xD;
      identified for the current R21 application as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 - Demonstrate that participants are unable to distinguish between treatment and&#xD;
      control protocols, assuring participant blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 - Verify the inter-rater reliability of the primary outcome measures -the&#xD;
      American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor and sensory scores as defined by the ASIA&#xD;
      Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3 - Collect pilot data for use in power analysis to determine the desired sample&#xD;
      size in the definitive R01 investigation, including effect sizes, enrollment and dropout&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4 - Identify any unanticipated difficulties in implementing the treatment and&#xD;
      control protocols and identify the clinical resources needed to conduct an R01 investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 5 - Prepare an application for an R01 definitive investigation including an&#xD;
      operations manual for the protocol.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals admitted to Craig Hospital immediately following initial acute care&#xD;
        hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of acute SCI will be considered for study&#xD;
        inclusion. Participants must give their informed consent, have medical clearance from their&#xD;
        attending physician and meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Incomplete spinal cord injury - ASIA grade B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 16 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be admitted to Craig and enrolled in the study within 6 weeks of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be able to tolerate lying on side for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The expected length of stay will allow completion of the six-week study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must agree to forego any acupuncture treatment other than the treatments prescribed in&#xD;
             this protocol during the six week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current involvement in any other clinical research trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concomitant treatment with anticoagulation medication (does not include those on&#xD;
             prophylactic doses for deep venous thrombosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any disease, concomitant injury, condition or treatment that interferes with the&#xD;
             performance or interpretation of the neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Acupuncture sites obstructed by immobilization devices, where removal would be&#xD;
             medically contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individuals with cardiac pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Individual has a condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, precludes&#xD;
             successful participation in the study.&#xD;
