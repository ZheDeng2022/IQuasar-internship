  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an opiate detoxification behavior therapy based on&#xD;
      current Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) theory and method, and to test its&#xD;
      feasibility and promise in the context of voluntary methadone detoxification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Stage I pilot study will employ a randomized, controlled, between groups design in which&#xD;
      70 opiate dependent patients seeking methadone detoxification will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      two treatment conditions: ACT opiate detoxification therapy or Drug Counseling. Both&#xD;
      therapies will be delivered in the context of a 5-month methadone dose reduction based on a&#xD;
      linear dosing strategy. Efficacy variables will include: (1) abstinence rates during and&#xD;
      1-month after detoxification as assessed by regular urine screens; (2) retention of patients&#xD;
      in treatment; and (3) patient satisfaction and treatment acceptability. Reduction in&#xD;
      HIV/Hepatitis C risk behaviors and changes in psychosocial functioning (e.g., employment,&#xD;
      family, legal) will also be explored, along with mediators/moderators of the therapy (i.e.,&#xD;
      experiential avoidance). Subjects will be recruited from Houston area methadone clinics and&#xD;
      the general community via advertising and will receive methadone as part of this protocol. A&#xD;
      2-4 week stabilization period will precede the 5-month methadone dose reduction. During the&#xD;
      dose reduction, participants will attend the clinic twice each week and will receive weekly&#xD;
      therapy. Participants will be contacted for follow up assessments up to one month post&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
