  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the poor prognosis of HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and it's still high&#xD;
      incidence in HAART era, more intensive therapy is required in patients with initially severe&#xD;
      stage of NHL or relapsing after first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of an intensive chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      peripheral blood cell transplantation in these patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      of HIV-infected patients by decreasing the incidence of opportunistic infections and&#xD;
      HIV-related malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma. However, the frequency of NHL remains&#xD;
      increased in these patients. Moreover, their prognostic remains poor comparing to HIV&#xD;
      negative patients. This is mainly due to the type of NHL (aggressive B, and frequent stage&#xD;
      IV) but also host factors such as immunodeficiency, co-infections (EBV, HHV8), and&#xD;
      chemotherapy-HAART interactions. In the lack of new and significantly more efficient&#xD;
      treatments, therapeutic intensification such as high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (ASCT), already tested in relapsed or partially&#xD;
      responding HIV negative patients, could be an option in HAART controlled HIV+ patients with&#xD;
      NHL, rather in first complete remission (CR) but with initially high International Prognosis&#xD;
      Index (IPI above or equal to 2), or in second CR, whatever initial IPI. Positive selection&#xD;
      CD34+ cells is an approach for depleting grafts of tumour cells and HIV DNA. However the&#xD;
      delayed lymphocyte recovery following this process, may lead to increased incidence of&#xD;
      opportunistic infections (OI) in HIV-infected patients. OI prophylaxis will be systematically&#xD;
      associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and divided in two&#xD;
      subgroups. Group A with 3-6 x 106 PBSC will not undergo CD34+ selection process and group B&#xD;
      with more than 6 x 106 will undergo this process. The myeloablative conditioning process is&#xD;
      the same in the two groups with total body irradiation before reinfusion of grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed from week2 (W2) up to W60 with clinical and biological evaluations.&#xD;
