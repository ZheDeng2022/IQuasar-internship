      ABSTRACT Background The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant treatment in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic venous thromboembolism is still uncertain . The present study addressed the&#xD;
      possible role of the Residual Vein Thrombosis in assessing the need for a prolonged&#xD;
      anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients with a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked or provoked proximal Vein&#xD;
      Thrombosis (VT) were given Oral Anticoagulant Treatment (OAT) for 3 months. Residual Vein&#xD;
      Thrombosis (RVT), ultrasonographically-detected, will be then assessed. Patients without RVT&#xD;
      did not continue OAT, whereas those with RVT will be randomized to either stop or continue&#xD;
      OAT for 9 more months. Patients were followed-up prospectively focusing on the study&#xD;
      outcomes: occurrence of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding over a period of&#xD;
      at least 12 months after OAT discontinuation.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Long-term anticoagulant treatment with adjusted doses of vitamin K antagonists&#xD;
      is highly effective in preventing recurrent events after a first episode of unprovoked Venous&#xD;
      ThromboEmbolism (VTE), even if the optimal duration of this therapy is still uncertain. Since&#xD;
      the risk of recurrency is greatest in the first year after the initial thrombotic episode and&#xD;
      gradually diminishes thereafter, the benefit of an extended course of anticoagulant treatment&#xD;
      may be offset over time by the persisting risk of clinically important bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential clinically relevant approach for establishing the optimal duration of Oral&#xD;
      AntCoagulant Therapy (OAT) is that of predicting the individual risk for thrombotic&#xD;
      recurrency after the index Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Although the current scheme for&#xD;
      establishing the duration of OAT is based on the nature of index DVT (idiopathic or&#xD;
      provoked), some new data starting to select other parameters to optimize this decision.&#xD;
      Recently, the use of D-dimer has been proven to be effective for selecting OAC duration;&#xD;
      however, this investigation evaluated only patients with idiopathic DVT and, moreover, the&#xD;
      use of D-dimer can not be easily handle by most of Institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In earlier prospective studies conducted in patients with symptomatic DVT, the presence of a&#xD;
      residual thrombus was associated with an increased risk of thrombotic recurrencies either in&#xD;
      idiopathic or provoked venous thrombosis. Interestingly, recurrent events occurred not only&#xD;
      in the previously affected veins but also in other sites, thus suggesting that Residual Vein&#xD;
      Thrombosis (RVT) may express a pro-thrombotic status. Based on these findings, the detection&#xD;
      of RVT may be, therefore, of help in establishing the duration of anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we planned a randomized, prospective, follow-up study in patients&#xD;
      with a first episode of symptomatic DVT treated with OAT for 3 months. Patients without RVT&#xD;
      will not continue anticoagulation, whereas those with RVT will be randomized to either stop&#xD;
      or resume anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study patients. Patients with a first episode of documented unprovoked and provoked&#xD;
      proximal DVT will be eligible for the study if they had completed at least three months of&#xD;
      OAT (target INR 2.5, range 2.0-3.0). Provoked DVTs are defined as thrombotic episodes&#xD;
      associated with pregnancy or puerperium, recent (i.e. within three months) fracture or&#xD;
      plaster casting of a leg, immobilization with confinement to bed for three consecutive days&#xD;
      and surgery with general anesthesia lasting longer than 30 minutes. Unprovoked DVTs are&#xD;
      defined as thrombotic episodes occurred in apparently healthy individuals. Patients with&#xD;
      active cancer, limited life expectancy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or an other known&#xD;
      thrombophilic status (such as antithrombin deficiency), serious liver disease, renal&#xD;
      insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL), those who lived too far from the center will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. The study has been approved by the institutional review boards of&#xD;
      all participating centers. All enrolled patients will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. This is a multicenter prospective study in patients with a first episode of&#xD;
      symptomatic (either provoked or idiopathic) proximal DVT detected by Compression&#xD;
      UltraSonography (C-US) and receiving OAT [warfarin (Coumadin, Bristol Myers Squibb) for 3&#xD;
      months. At this time, subjects who agreed to participate in the study have a physical&#xD;
      examination to assess baseline clinical conditions and to exclude contraindications. C-US of&#xD;
      the proximal deep vein system in both legs will be performed, measuring the diameters of any&#xD;
      detectable thrombus in the Common Femoral Vein (CFV) and Popliteal Veins (PV). Images will be&#xD;
      obtained in transverse section only. Lumen compressibility will be then evaluated on CFV and&#xD;
      PV by gentle pressure of the probe, as previously described. Briefly, the major and the minor&#xD;
      diameters of the vein segment are measured and recorded before and after compression. C-US&#xD;
      findings are scored as &quot;absence of RVT&quot; when residual thrombus occupied, at maximum&#xD;
      compressibility, less than 40% of the vein area. Patients without RVT will not continue&#xD;
      anticoagulation, whereas those with RVT will be randomized to either stop or continue OAT&#xD;
      (INR 2.0-3.0) for additional 9 months. A different randomization sequence for each different&#xD;
      study site is computer generated and encapsulated in a randomization computer program. The&#xD;
      sequences are balanced by blocks of ten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes and Follow-up. From the assignment visit, patients will be followed up for at&#xD;
      least one year after OAT discontinuation; during the follow-up period, patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by the clinical centers every 3 months. C-US will be performed only when recurrent&#xD;
      symptomatic DVT is suspected. The study outcome is the composite of confirmed recurrent&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (including DVT and/or fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism) and major&#xD;
      bleeding events from the index DVT to the last day of follow-up. In cases of suspected DVT&#xD;
      recurrence the results of ultrasonography will be compared with the previous examination. A&#xD;
      diagnosis of recurrent venous thrombosis is made if a previously fully compressible segment&#xD;
      (contralateral or ipsilateral) became incompressible. In absence of a previous normal C-US,&#xD;
      DVT recurrence is diagnosed if a previously non-occlusive thrombus shifted to occlusive&#xD;
      thrombus, provided the vein area before compression had increased by more than 50%); in&#xD;
      undetermined cases, contrast venography was performed. In patients with suspected pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, diagnosis of recurrence is based on objective algorithms using clinical&#xD;
      probability, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning/helical computed tomography, compression&#xD;
      ultrasonography and/or D-dimer if indicated. The diagnosis of clinically relevant haemorrhage&#xD;
      will be made in case of decrease of haemoglobin levels &gt; 2.0 gr/dl, retroperitoneal,&#xD;
      intracranial or life-threatening. Patients has been instructed to contact the clinical center&#xD;
      immediately if symptoms developed suggestive of venous thromboembolism or bleeding. All&#xD;
      suspected outcome events and all deaths will be evaluated by a central adjudication committee&#xD;
      whose members were unaware of the name of the subject, the enrolling center, the C-US&#xD;
      findings and the assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Baseline differences between groups will be assessed by the chi-square&#xD;
      test (Yates' correction) for categorical variables and t-test or Mann-Withney U test for&#xD;
      continuous variables, as appropriate. Data will be analyzed on intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves are plotted to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic&#xD;
      recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding. Patients who during the study will&#xD;
      develop clinical conditions interfering with the study outcomes (such as ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease, cancer, stroke, superficial vein thrombosis, etc) and left the assigned group will&#xD;
      be regularly followed-up and included in analysis. Hazard ratios and their 95 percent&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be calculated using the Cox's proportional hazards model. The data&#xD;
      will be analyzed using the Prism statistical software package (Version 3.0, GraphPad Software&#xD;
      Incorporated, San Diego, CA) and the SPSS statistical package (Version 14.0, SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL).&#xD;
