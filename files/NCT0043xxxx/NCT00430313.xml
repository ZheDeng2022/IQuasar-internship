      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is part of a larger grant funded by the NCI to create an international research&#xD;
      center to study Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). All of the patients enrolled in this&#xD;
      study will be treated at the Cancer Hospital, Fudan University, investigator's sister&#xD;
      institution in Shanghai, China. No patients will be seen at MDACC. This protocol will be&#xD;
      overseen by the Fudan University Institutional Review Board (IRB00002408) which has Federal&#xD;
      Wide Assurance through the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (Approved: April 25,&#xD;
      2002). The research nurses have received training at MDACC and will receive regular oversight&#xD;
      by MDACC personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized, placebo controlled study is to determine the effects of K1&#xD;
      acustimulation at controlling chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of electro-stimulation of&#xD;
           Yongquan (K1) acupoint on preventing nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin or&#xD;
           oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary aim is to observe the effects of electro-stimulation (ES) of Yongquan (K1)&#xD;
           acupoint on pain, insomnia, abdominal distention, dizziness, and general sense of&#xD;
           well-being.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting are common side effects caused by chemotherapy. Some studies have shown&#xD;
      that acupuncture can be helpful in treating nausea and vomiting. Acupuncture uses very thin&#xD;
      needles inserted at certain points on the body that are believed to affect bodily functions.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study the effects on nausea and vomiting of giving electro-stimulation&#xD;
      (using wires attached to the body to provide very small electrical shocks to the skin) to an&#xD;
      acupuncture site, compared to giving electro-stimulation to a inactive site (a site that does&#xD;
      not respond to acupuncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the toss of a coin) to be in 1 of 2 groups. Participants in one group will receive&#xD;
      electro-stimulation at an active (responsive) acupuncture site on the bottom of the foot.&#xD;
      Participants in the other group will receive electro-stimulation at a inactive site on the&#xD;
      bottom of the foot (a &quot;placebo&quot; site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will have electro-stimulation on the feet. You will sit or lie&#xD;
      down in bed. The acupuncturist will wet the points with a cotton ball dipped in water and&#xD;
      attach the electrodes of the electro-stimulating instrument to the bottom of your feet. The&#xD;
      electrodes are little paddles that will be attached with tape. The acupuncturist will begin&#xD;
      slowly increasing the stimulation to a level you can withstand comfortably. This will last&#xD;
      about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation will occur about 1-2 hours before your TAI chemotherapy on the first day, and&#xD;
      then between 7-9 A.M. on the next 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each electro-stimulation procedure, your vital signs will be measured, you will&#xD;
      complete quality-of-life questionnaires, and you will be asked about hiccups and diet&#xD;
      tolerance (how nausea has affected your ability to eat or how much you eat). After your last&#xD;
      electro-stimulation, you will also have a TCM diagnosis. This will include diagnosis by a&#xD;
      doctor as well as by using a heart-rate machine and taking a photograph of your tongue. Blood&#xD;
      (about 1 teaspoon) will also be drawn to check your liver function about 6 days after the&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given the standard medicines if you experience uncontrolled nausea or vomiting&#xD;
      while on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your total participation on this study will last less than 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at the Fudan University Cancer Hospital.&#xD;

    <description>Vomiting and nausea will be classified according to the WHO criteria. The four levels of nausea are defined as: 0=no nausea, 1=slight nausea, 2=obvious nausea affecting normal life, and 3-4=continual and serious nausea. The four levels of vomiting are defined as: 0=no vomiting, 1=vomiting 1-2 times/day, 2=vomiting 2-4 times/day, and 3-4=vomiting 5 times/day.</description>
