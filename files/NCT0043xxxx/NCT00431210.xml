  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of making and giving Epstein-Barr virus&#xD;
      (EBV) immunotherapy products to subjects with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) associated with&#xD;
      EBV that has come back or spread to other parts of the body. EBV immunotherapy product is&#xD;
      made with white blood cells from the participants body that are collected intravenously. This&#xD;
      EBV immunotherapy product may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. EBV immunotherapy&#xD;
      products have been used in several research studies for NPC. Information from these studies&#xD;
      suggests the EBV immunotherapy products may stop the growth of NPC in some subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The first step in this research study is the peripheral blood collection. Approximately&#xD;
           60-90cc's will be collected intravenously and used to prepare the EBV immunotherapy&#xD;
           product. It takes about 12 weeks to make the EBV immunotherapy product. During this&#xD;
           time, the participant will receive standard of care as prescribed by their doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EBV immunotherapy product will be made at a laboratory at the Connell &amp; O'Reilly&#xD;
           Families Cell and Manipulation Core Facility at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The&#xD;
           EBV immunotherapy product will contain T-cells that may react against your EBV-related&#xD;
           tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small amount of the EBV product will be used for research studies that will&#xD;
           investigate components of the immune system that might be important in effective&#xD;
           immunotherapy for NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EBV immunotherapy product will be given to the participant intravenously (infusion) on&#xD;
           the first day of the research study. Fourteen days later, the participant will receive&#xD;
           infusion #2. After infusion #2, the research doctor will do some tests to determine the&#xD;
           effects that the EBV immunotherapy product has had on the tumor. If the research doctor&#xD;
           thinks the participant will benefit from a third infusion then they may receive one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each infusion of EBV immunotherapy product, a physical examination and blood&#xD;
           tests will be performed. During the active treatment phase of this research study, a&#xD;
           physical exam and blood tests will be done every 1-2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each infusion of EBV immunotherapy product, the research doctor may do a&#xD;
           fiberoptic exam of the participants nasopharynx by using a flexible scop to visualize&#xD;
           the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 8 weeks post-infusion, we will evaluate the tumor by using a CT scan and/or MRI. We&#xD;
           will also perform a PET or PET/CT scan if the research doctor feels it is necessary. We&#xD;
           may do a chest CT scan to see if the tumor has spread to the lungs and an&#xD;
           abdominal/pelvic CT scan or MRI if the participant has symptoms that suggesting that&#xD;
           there may be tumor in the liver, or a bone scan to see if there is tumor in the bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to this study, the research doctor may ask permission to participate in&#xD;
           optional research studies. We would like the participants permission to take a biopsy of&#xD;
           the tumor after they have received infusion #2. The biopsy will be done by a surgeon who&#xD;
           will review the risks of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit where the response of&#xD;
           the tumor will be evaluated, blood tests and a physical exam will be performed at the&#xD;
           following intervals: for the first 2 months after the final infusion, every 2-4 weeks;&#xD;
           for month 4 to month 12 after the final infusion, every 2 months; for the second year&#xD;
           after the final infusion, every 3 months.&#xD;
