      We are carrying out this study to determine whether Keppra (a drug usually used to treat&#xD;
      epilepsy) is an effective treatment for tremor in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Tremor is&#xD;
      one of the most common symptoms in MS, but also one of the most difficult to treat. A very&#xD;
      small previous study has indicated that Keppra may be effective in this role, but we need to&#xD;
      reproduce these results in many more patients before we can reliably confirm this.&#xD;

      Multiple Sclerosis is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS and is&#xD;
      the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults in the UK (~ 90,000 patients'&#xD;
      affected). It has been estimated that the direct cost to the National Health Service is over&#xD;
      £300 million/year and the total cost to UK society exceeds £1.3 billion/year. The personal&#xD;
      cost in terms of disability is also high with 50% of patients requiring aids to walk or being&#xD;
      wheelchair bound within 16 years of disease onset. Recently, attention has focused on disease&#xD;
      modifying drugs, including b-Interferon, which have demonstrated a significant reduction in&#xD;
      clinical relapse rate associated with a dramatic reduction in disease activity on brain&#xD;
      MRI4-7. However, the evidence for any sustained long term benefit is poor. Therefore,&#xD;
      symptomatic therapies remain a key part of patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebellar tremor and cerebellar gait instability are present in up to 70% of chronic MS&#xD;
      patients and account for a significant amount of clinical morbidity. Cerebellar tremor is a&#xD;
      major therapeutic problem in MS since currently there are no effective treatments. To date&#xD;
      medical therapies including propranolol, clonazepam, carbamazepine, isoniazid,&#xD;
      phenobarbitone, ondansetron, topiramate, gabapentin and cannabis have all been studied with&#xD;
      little sustained benefit. More radical surgical treatments including thalamotomy and Deep&#xD;
      Brain Stimulation have also been attempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a recent pilot study, with a small number of patients, suggested that Keppra&#xD;
      (Levetiracetam) is effective in treating MS tremor. This study relied upon a rather&#xD;
      subjective assessment of tremor and did not assess patients using quantitative physiological&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol involves a collaboration between a clinical neurologist, with a recognised&#xD;
      expertise in MS, and a research group with an established expertise in the&#xD;
      electrophysiological and pharmacological investigation of human tremor11. The protocol&#xD;
      describes a study, in MS patients, designed to establish whether Keppra (Levetiracetam)&#xD;
      produces:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiologically measurable reduction in tremor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjective and qualitative reduction in tremor;&#xD;
