  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the use of an educational intervention, the object of this study is to reduce the&#xD;
      prevalence of bullying behaviors among fifth grade school age children. Bullying behaviors&#xD;
      promote an environment of violence , fear, and hostility. The study will arrange to present&#xD;
      six character education lessons in the classroom of fifth grade students in a New York City&#xD;
      public school. Questionnaires will be administered to the students before and after all the&#xD;
      lessons have been completed. Questionnaires will collect information about the students self&#xD;
      perception of their levels of misconduct, impulsivity, confidence, value of non violence,&#xD;
      ways of handling anger, opinions of their leadership behaviors, prevalence of bullying&#xD;
      behaviors, and indications of levels of self esteem. Also, their fifth grade teachers will&#xD;
      complete pre and post treatment student behavioral questionnaires.&#xD;

      This is a 2 X 2X 2 research design that will study the constructs of self esteem, leadership&#xD;
      skills, and prevalence of bullying among a fifth grade school age population. Before data&#xD;
      collection, a letter describing the study along with an informed consent sheet, will be&#xD;
      mailed to the student's parent/guardian. The written material will state that their child&#xD;
      participation is not mandatory. A 48 item likert style questionnaire pre-treatment,&#xD;
      post-treatment survey design will be administered to students. Basic demographic questions&#xD;
      will also be asked about.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All fifth graders will be given questionnaires before they receive the six classroom lessons&#xD;
      of 45 minutes duration and then after all the six lessons have been completed. Lessons will&#xD;
      be offered on a weekly basis. The fifth graders will be divided into small groups of&#xD;
      approximately 10 individuals. The lessons will be delivered by baccalaureate nursing students&#xD;
      in their last semester of college. The groups will be formed at the beginning and membership&#xD;
      will remain consistent to enhance development of trust and ease of authentic communication.&#xD;
      The lessons will be selected from the program, Overcoming Obstacles, a formal educational&#xD;
      program designed to assist students to communicate well and set meaningful goals for their&#xD;
      lives. In addition, the classroom teachers will be asked to complete a 14 item likert style&#xD;
      pre-treatment, post-treatment, both before and after the six lessons about their opinions of&#xD;
      each student's behaviors pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistician is a co-investigator and will identify the type of statistical analysis to be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
