  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test the safety of the investigational drug, ZD6474, in combination&#xD;
      with 2 other drugs that are standard in the treatment of colon and rectal cancer (cetuximab&#xD;
      and irinotecan). ZD6474 blocks the action of two substances in the body: vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). VEGFR stimulates&#xD;
      the formation of new blood vessels. When cancer cells produce VEGFR, new blood vessels are&#xD;
      made that provide blood to the cancer cells. The blood carries nutrients and oxygen, allowing&#xD;
      the cancer cells to live and grow. EGFR controls how quickly cells grow and multiply. Both of&#xD;
      these substances are found on normal cells, but they are found in much higher levels on&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The main purpose is to find the highest dose of ZD6474 that is safe to give in&#xD;
           combination with cetuximab and irinotecan. We will also be collecting information on how&#xD;
           the body responds to the study drugs and what effects, good or bad, it has on treatment&#xD;
           of colon and rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially we plan to add ZD6474 to cetuximab alone. Small groups of participants will be&#xD;
           enrolled in steps. The first group will be given a certain dose of ZD6474 and cetuximab.&#xD;
           If the participants have few or manageable side effects, the next small group of people&#xD;
           will receive a higher dose of ZD6474. This increase will continue until the study&#xD;
           doctors find the highest dose that can be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once we determine the highest dose of ZD6474 with cetuximab, we will add irinotecan at&#xD;
           increasing doses to determine the safety of all three drugs combined. The participant&#xD;
           will know whether they are receiving the two or three drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to confirm the safety of combining these drugs and to understand more how they&#xD;
           work and interact with each other, some participants on this study will take just the&#xD;
           ZD6474 for 2 weeks prior to starting the cetuximab and/or irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each cycle of treatment is 8 weeks long. All participants will start taking ZD6474&#xD;
           orally, on day one and continue taking it at home thereafter. Cetuximab and irinotecan&#xD;
           are given intravenously. Cetuximab is given once a week. Irinotecan will be given to&#xD;
           participants that enter the trial once the safe dose of ZD6474 and cetuximab is&#xD;
           determined. Irinotecan is given on Day 15 of cycle one, then every other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to visit the clinic every week for the first three weeks they&#xD;
           are on the study. After the first three weeks, they will be required to visit with the&#xD;
           doctor every other week. These visits will include physical exams, routine blood tests,&#xD;
           scans, and other tests or procedures to monitor health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to routine blood tests, blood tests for research will be done on the last 10&#xD;
           subjects on the trial. Test results from this sample will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
           participants condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to be treated on this study, a tumor tissue specimen must ba available for&#xD;
           research testing. The specimen will be taken from a biopsy that was done before the&#xD;
           participant enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can continue on the study drug as long as they tolerate the drug and the&#xD;
           cancer does not grow.&#xD;
