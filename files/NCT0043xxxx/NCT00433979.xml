      Women represent an increasing proportion of HIV cases globally and in Canada, yet are&#xD;
      underrepresented in clinic trials. It is therefore critical to conduct this study on&#xD;
      antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacokinetics (PK) in women to obtain additional information on ARV&#xD;
      drug levels in women and their relation to adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is three-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. that the mean drug levels (Cmin and Cmax) of ARVs will be significantly higher in our&#xD;
           female population as compared to the mean drug levels in the historical HIV population&#xD;
           (which is primarily men)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. that ARV drug levels, particularly Cmin, are associated with body weight in women&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. that higher ARV drug levels, particularly Cmax, are associated with higher frequency and&#xD;
           severity of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate that levels of Protease Inhibitors (PIs) and Non-Nucleoside Reverse&#xD;
           Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) are significantly higher in our female population as&#xD;
           compared to the mean drug levels in the historical general population (which is&#xD;
           primarily men).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the association between PI and NNRTI minimum concentration (Cmin) and body&#xD;
           weight in our female population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the association between maximum concentration (Cmax) and the frequency and&#xD;
           severity of AEs as measured by the proportion of patients with grade 2 or higher&#xD;
           laboratory or clinical AEs and the Symptom Index Score in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the association between ARV drug levels and age, race, height, body mass&#xD;
           index, adherence, hormonal levels and therapy, menstruation history, duration of HIV&#xD;
           infection, duration on ARV therapy, baseline viral load, baseline CD4 count, present CD4&#xD;
           count, hepatitis B or C infection, class of ARVs, presence of ritonavir and other&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;

      Predictors of antiretroviral pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected women with virologic&#xD;
      suppression on combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in Canada constitute the fastest growing population groups at risk for infection with&#xD;
      HIV and AIDS. Women now represent approximately 40% of all AIDS cases worldwide and&#xD;
      approximately 20% of cases in Canada. Although the AIDS epidemic has been ongoing for more&#xD;
      than 20 years, surprisingly little is known about the differential efficacy and toxicity of&#xD;
      various antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in women as compared to men. This gap in knowledge is a&#xD;
      result of the initial exclusion of and continued underrepresentation of women in ARV clinical&#xD;
      trials. Many studies suggest that HIV-infected women taking ARV treatment (ART) have more&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) than men, especially in relationship to systemic symptoms like diarrhea,&#xD;
      as well as organ toxicity, including hepatotoxicity, lactic acidosis, peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      and, notably, lipodystrophy. Currently, the occurrence and management of AEs is the most&#xD;
      important issue in the treatment of HIV. Understanding the reasons for the differences of AEs&#xD;
      in HIV-infected women is critical and has yet to be evaluated within a large cohort. It is&#xD;
      unknown whether these differences relate to hormonal influences, drug metabolism, adherence,&#xD;
      fat distribution, body size or other factors. Some small studies have found that drug levels&#xD;
      (e.g. Cmin, Cmax, AUC) are higher in women and are associated with increased toxicity.&#xD;
      Ultimately, we plan to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the utility of&#xD;
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and ARV drug dose adjustment on the frequency of AEs in&#xD;
      women. Prior to conducting this RCT, it is critical to conduct this study on ARV&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in women to obtain additional information on ARV drug levels in women&#xD;
      and their relation to AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is three-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. that the mean drug levels (Cmin and Cmax) of ARVs will be significantly higher in our&#xD;
           female population as compared to the mean drug levels in the historical HIV population&#xD;
           (which is primarily men)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. that ARV drug levels, particularly Cmin, are associated with body weight in women&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. that higher ARV drug levels, particularly Cmax, are associated with higher frequency and&#xD;
           severity of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty HIV-infected women from 8 Canadian sites who have been on their first combination ART&#xD;
      regimen containing either a PI or an NNRTI (since these are the ARV agents eligible for PK&#xD;
      analysis) for at least three months and who have evidence of full virologic suppression (HIV&#xD;
      RNA VL less than 50 copies/mL) on at least two occasions at least one month apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate that the Cmin and Cmax of PIs and NNRTIs are significantly higher in our&#xD;
           female population as compared to the mean drug levels in the historical general&#xD;
           population (which is primarily men).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the association between PI and NNRTI Cmin and body weight in our female&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the association between Cmax and the frequency and severity of AEs as&#xD;
           measured by the proportion of patients with grade 2 or higher laboratory or clinical AEs&#xD;
           and the Symptom index score in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the association between ARV drug levels and age, race, height, body mass&#xD;
           index, adherence, hormonal levels and therapy, menstruation history, duration of HIV&#xD;
           infection, duration on ARV therapy, baseline VL, baseline CD4 count, present CD4 count,&#xD;
           hepatitis B or C infection, class of ARVs, presence of ritonavir and other medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a cross-sectional study with ARV drug levels (Cmin and Cmax) measured&#xD;
      weekly for three weeks Three samples will be taken from each subject to reduce variability&#xD;
      due to both technologic and biologic sources. Data will be collected on demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical disease and ARV history and on clinical toxicities at the first&#xD;
      visit. Blood work will be carried out on the first visit to assess for laboratory toxicity&#xD;
      and hormonal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug levels will be summarized with the mean of the 3 values for Cmin and Cmax for each woman&#xD;
      for their PI or NNRTI and compared to the mean values of the general HIV population. Cmin and&#xD;
      Cmax will be classified into high and low levels with a high level defined as less than or&#xD;
      equal to 1.5 X arithmetic population mean for each drug. Characteristics of patients with&#xD;
      high drug levels will be compared to those of patients with low drug levels. Univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression models will be used to identify independent associations of&#xD;
      patient characteristics with high drug levels. The proportions of patients with AEs and the&#xD;
      median number of AEs per patient will be compared between patients with high Cmax and&#xD;
      patients with low Cmax.&#xD;
