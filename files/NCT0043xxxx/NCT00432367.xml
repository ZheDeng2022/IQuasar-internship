    <textblock>
      Among the best practices recommended for malaria control during pregnancy is ensuring&#xD;
      effective case management of malaria illness. However, this is often not practiced because&#xD;
      (1) malaria infection in pregnancy is often asymptomatic, (2) peripheral parasitaemia may be&#xD;
      absent even when the placenta is heavily parasitized, (3) implementing diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of malaria within a routine antenatal service may be difficult and (4) antimalarial&#xD;
      treatment options available to pregnant women are limited due to resistance to&#xD;
      chloroquine(CQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine(SP0 and paucity of safety and efficacy data on&#xD;
      other antimalarial drugs in pregnancy, particularly artemisinin combination treatments (ACT).&#xD;
      Therefore the commonest recommended practice in pregnancy is the administration of SP as&#xD;
      intermittent preventive treatment (SP-IPTp). However, the effectiveness of SP-IPTp has been&#xD;
      questioned because parasite resistance to SP is spreading rapidly across sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a three-arm open label randomised control non-inferiority trial of&#xD;
      insecticide-treated nets(ITN) plus rapid diagnostic test(RDT) screening, and treatment with&#xD;
      SP or amodiaquine plus artimisinin(AQ+AS) versus ITN plus IPTp using SP. It is to be carried&#xD;
      out in pregnant women of all parities presenting at enrolling antenatal clinics with a&#xD;
      gestation of 16 to 20 weeks at their first booking. The key objectives are to demonstrate&#xD;
      that (1) the prevalence of severe anaemia (Hb &lt; 8g/dl) at 34 to 36 weeks of gestation (2) the&#xD;
      prevalence of low birth weight (BW &lt; 2500g) at delivery or within 72 hours after delivery (3)&#xD;
      the prevalence of placenta parasitaemia and (4) the incidence of serious and non-serious&#xD;
      adverse events in the ITN plus RDT screening and treatment arm are not greater than those in&#xD;
      the ITN plus IPTp arm. Alongside the clinical assessments, health care cost assessments will&#xD;
      be done to determine the cost-effectiveness of the two delivery strategies measured as cases&#xD;
      of severe maternal anaemia averted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      General objective To show that the long-lasting insecticide-treated nets(LLIN)///// plus RDT&#xD;
      screening and treatment strategy is not inferior to LLIN plus SP-IPTp in reducing the burden&#xD;
      of malaria during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To demonstrate that the prevalence of severe anaemia (Hb &lt; 8g/dl) at 34 to 36 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation in the LLIN plus RDT screening and case management arm is not greater than that in&#xD;
      the LLIN plus IPTp arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate that the prevalence of low birth weight (BW &lt; 2500g) at delivery or&#xD;
           within 72 hours after delivery in the LLIN plus RDT screening and case management arm is&#xD;
           not greater than that in the LLIN plus IPTp arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate that the prevalence of anaemia (Hb &lt; 11g/dl) at 34 to 36 weeks of&#xD;
           gestation in the LLIN plus RDT screening and case management arm is not greater than&#xD;
           that in the LLIN plus IPTp arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To demonstrate that the prevalence of placental parasitaemia in the LLIN plus RDT&#xD;
           screening and case management arm is not greater than that in the LLIN plus IPTp arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To demonstrate that the incidence of spontaneous abortions, intrauterine&#xD;
           deaths/stillbirths, neonatal and maternal mortality and developmental delays in the LLIN&#xD;
           plus RDT screening and case management arm is not greater than that in the LLIN plus&#xD;
           IPTp arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To demonstrate that the cost per case of (1) severe maternal anaemia averted (2)&#xD;
           maternal anaemia averted (3) peripheral malaria averted and (4) placenta malaria averted&#xD;
           is not higher in the LLIN plus RDT screening and case management arm than in LLIN plus&#xD;
           SP-IPTp arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The prevalences of severe anaemia at delivery and low birth weight have been&#xD;
      shown to be 12% and 5.7% respectively among Gambian multigravidae who received varying doses&#xD;
      of SP-IPT (Mbaye et al. 2006). In the absence of local data from the proposed study site, we&#xD;
      estimate that the prevalences of severe anaemia in the third trimester and low birth weight&#xD;
      will be 12% and 6% respectively in the LLIN +SP-IPTp arm of this study, similar to that in&#xD;
      the Gambian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For trial planning we have set a non-inferiority margin of 5%. This means we would consider&#xD;
      the LLIN + RDT screening with SP or AQ+AS treatment options to be inferior to the LLIN&#xD;
      +SP-IPTp option if the prevalence of severe anaemia at 34 to 36 weeks is 5% greater in the&#xD;
      LLIN+RDT with SP or AS+AQ treatment arm than that is observed in the LLIN+SP-IPT arm. Since&#xD;
      we expect the prevalence of severe anaemia in the LLIN +SP-IPTp arm would be 12%, we need 887&#xD;
      women per arm to detect a 5% difference between the two study arms at 95% significance with&#xD;
      90% power. Considering a 20% dropout rate we need 1110 women per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting a non-inferiority margin of 5% seems clinically and statistically relevant; and&#xD;
      yields a sample size that makes the execution of the study feasible within the time frame and&#xD;
      with the resources available. Choosing a smaller margin than 5% may be too tight requiring&#xD;
      large sample size of over 2000 per arm which might not be feasible and achievable within the&#xD;
      time frame; a larger margin than 5% may be too liberal to compare the public health impact of&#xD;
      these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that 925 women per arm can show with 90% power at 95% significance level and&#xD;
      accounting for a 20% dropout rate, that the prevalence of low birth weight associated with&#xD;
      the LLIN + RDT screening with or without SP or AQ+AS treatment is no worse than LLIN +&#xD;
      SP-IPTp by a margin of 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, a sample size of 1110 per arm is adequate to detect any effects of the interventions&#xD;
      on both birth weight and maternal Hb, a total of 3330 pregnant women will be recruited into&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A three-arm open label randomised control non-inferiority trial of RDT screening&#xD;
      with or without treatment with SP or AQ+AS versus IPTp using SP as follows: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. OptiMAL® antigen screening and treatment with SP plus LLIN&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OptiMAL® antigen screening and treatment with AQ+AS plus LLIN&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SP-IPTp plus LLIN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site and population The study will be conducted in the Ejisu-Juaben and Sekyere East&#xD;
      districts of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Enrolment will be done simultaneously at the&#xD;
      antenatal clinics of the Effiduase and Juaben district hospitals and a sub district health&#xD;
      centre in each of the districts. The Effiduase and Juaben hospitals have 50 and 40 beds&#xD;
      respectively and provide all basic medical services including adult medicine, paediatrics,&#xD;
      surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology. They run weekly antenatal clinic sessions and&#xD;
      together they register an average of 220 new pregnant women per month. The sub district&#xD;
      health centres (at Kwaso and Kumawu) are manned by qualified medical assistants and midwives.&#xD;
      Together they register an average of 80 new pregnant women per month. All health facilities&#xD;
      in the study districts including the proposed enrolling clinics offer SP-IPT to pregnant&#xD;
      women following the MoH guidelines. Pregnant women in their second or third trimester&#xD;
      diagnosed with malaria are treated with AQ+AS as recommended by the MoH at these facilities.&#xD;
      The study population will comprise pregnant women presenting at the hospital's antenatal&#xD;
      clinic with a gestation of 16 to 24 weeks at their first booking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A schematic profile of the study is shown in Figure 1. All study women will be recruited from&#xD;
      weekly antenatal clinic sessions held at the study sites over a period of one and half years.&#xD;
      Three teams of midwives and their assistants put together and trained by the principal&#xD;
      investigator (PI) will assist the PI and research teams to conduct the recruitment during&#xD;
      antenatal clinic hours. The standard operating procedures at the clinic will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomise pregnant women reporting at the ANC who consent to participate in the study&#xD;
           into three arms: an IPTp arm, RDT screening and SP case management arm and RDT screening&#xD;
           and AQ+AS case management arm. Distribute LLIN to eligible pregnant women in all arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain blood for baseline investigations including haemoglobin level, thin and thick&#xD;
           blood films for malaria parasite counts and, filter paper blood spots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess all pregnant women in the RDT and treatment groups clinically and obstetrically&#xD;
           prior to OptiMAL® dipstick screening; for those parasitaemic offer SP or AQ+AS and&#xD;
           ingestion of first dose observed directly at the ANC. Encourage the women to regularly&#xD;
           sleep under the bed nets provided and take their daily doses of iron and folic acid&#xD;
           tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For women in the RDT and treatment groups who are negative offer only daily doses of&#xD;
           iron and folic acid tablets and encourage them to regularly sleep under the bed nets&#xD;
           provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Women in the IPTp group will receive SP and ingestion will be directly observed at the&#xD;
           ANC according to the national guideline. Encourage the women to regularly sleep under&#xD;
           the bed nets provided and take their daily doses of iron and folic acid tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Women who decline participation in the study will receive SP-IPTp according to the&#xD;
           national guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antenatal Follow-Up Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Day 7: Women receiving SP or AQ+AS treatment will be followed up actively on the day 7&#xD;
           post treatment to assess any adverse events during the week post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At 6 months: repeat SP-IPT for women in the IPT arm and treat women in the case&#xD;
           management arm with SP or AQ+AS if they are RDT positive. Women in the case management&#xD;
           arm with negative RDT would receive only haematinics. Ask all study women to regularly&#xD;
           sleep under bed nets provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 8 months: repeat SP-IPT for women in the IPT arm and treat women in the case&#xD;
           management arm with SP or AQ+AS if they are RDT positive. Women in the case management&#xD;
           arm with negative RDT would receive only haematinics. Ask all study women to regularly&#xD;
           sleep under bed nets provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At 34 to 36 weeks: actively follow up women to sample blood by finger prick for&#xD;
           haemoglobin measurements, slide smears for malaria parasite counts and filter paper&#xD;
           blood spots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Unscheduled visits: Women presenting with a history of fever during an unscheduled visit&#xD;
           will be tested for malaria parasites. If they are found to be parasitaemic, they will be&#xD;
           deemed to be a treatment failure and will be given quinine as rescue medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All pregnant women will receive haematinics packs at each of the follow ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery and Postpartum Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The midwives will record all birth weights and note any stillbirths and perinatal&#xD;
           deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Midwives will record all congenital deformities for verification and confirmation by a&#xD;
           clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visits will be made toall women and babies at 6 to 8 weeks post-delivery to obtain&#xD;
           reports of any neonatal deaths or other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At 6 weeks post-partum, if a woman has peripheral parasitaemia she will be treated with&#xD;
           SP and followed up for parasite clearance on days 14 and 28 post-treatment. If there is&#xD;
           no parasite clearance on day 14 and/or day 28 a course of rescue medication (quinine)&#xD;
           will be given. This part of the study is necessary to assess the efficacy of SP to clear&#xD;
           parasitaemia.&#xD;
