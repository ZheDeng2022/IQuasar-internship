    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether HIV-infected patients are more likely to develop resistance&#xD;
      to antiretroviral therapy if their blood is not monitored for the number of viruses (viral&#xD;
      load) in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A virus that changes (mutates) over time may become resistant to certain types of medicine.&#xD;
      This resistance may affect future treatment options. This study will compare the amount of&#xD;
      virus in the blood of HIV-infected patients who have been monitored for viral load with the&#xD;
      amount of virus in the blood of patients who have not been monitored for viral load. For&#xD;
      patients who have detectable virus, the type of resistance (mutations) of the virus will be&#xD;
      determined by comparing the components of the virus with that of a virus that is known not to&#xD;
      be resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age or older who are being treated at the Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Institute at Mulago Hospital at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants are interviewed about the treatments they have received&#xD;
      for HIV and how they usually take their anti-HIV drugs. They also have a blood sample drawn&#xD;
      for research tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become widely available in resource limited settings (RLS)&#xD;
      due to large increases in available resources through the President s Emergency Plan for AIDS&#xD;
      Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM). The number&#xD;
      of people accessing ART in RLS doubled in 2005 alone. Whereas viral load testing is done&#xD;
      routinely for individuals on ART in the western hemisphere, this is not the case elsewhere.&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended only clinical and CD4 count monitoring as&#xD;
      the standard of care in RLS during the ART scale-up. As a result, there is a growing&#xD;
      population of individuals in Africa currently on ART whose treatment is monitored only using&#xD;
      clinical evaluations and CD4 counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to preserving lives and improving the quality of life of HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals, the goal of ART is to achieve and maintain suppression of HIV replication to an&#xD;
      undetectable level. This goal enables the treatment to remain effective in the long term&#xD;
      since the emergence of resistant strains is limited by the low replication rate of HIV&#xD;
      achieved under these conditions. The recovery of the immune system as determined through CD4&#xD;
      count monitoring is neither a very sensitive nor specific marker of virological suppression&#xD;
      in individuals on ART. Therefore, monitoring the response to ART using just the WHO&#xD;
      guidelines for RLS may lead to a significant delay in detecting the failure to achieve or&#xD;
      maintain virological suppression among individuals who are failing treatment. This is in&#xD;
      contrast to western settings where routine viral load testing leads to early detection of&#xD;
      failure to achieve suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure to monitor and detect unsuppressed virus increases the risk of development of&#xD;
      resistance to ART. In particular, failure to achieve or maintain virologic suppression for&#xD;
      prolonged periods of time may lead to the sequential development of thymidine analogue&#xD;
      mutations (TAMs) in patients taking zidovudine (AZT) or stavudine (d4T) as part of ART&#xD;
      regimens. The accumulation of 3 or 4 TAMs confers drug resistance across the nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) class of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and has&#xD;
      implications for future ART regimens, particularly in RLS where second line ART options are&#xD;
      limited. Stavudine and zidovudine are currently used as part of the first line regimens in&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa and other RLS areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that patients who are monitored with a combination of CD4 counts and viral&#xD;
      load measurements routinely develop TAMs at a slower rate than do patients who are monitored&#xD;
      with only CD4 count measurement (as per WHO guidelines in RLS). This hypothesis is based on&#xD;
      the higher risk of delay in detection of unsuppressed virus in patients who are monitored by&#xD;
      clinical and CD4 counts alone, which may translate into the development of drug-resistant&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team therefore proposes to carry out a cross-sectional study in a large public HIV&#xD;
      out-patient clinic in which patients who are routinely monitored with both CD4 count and&#xD;
      viral load measurements are compared with patients who are routinely monitored with CD4&#xD;
      counts measurement only. Individuals who have detectable viral load after 36 months of ARV&#xD;
      therapy in each of the above patient categories shall undergo a structured interview and HIV&#xD;
      genotypic testing, particularly to look for TAMs. The presence of TAMs in each instance shall&#xD;
      be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will highlight the magnitude of the risk of using CD4 count&#xD;
      monitoring only in patients on ART in RLS and contribute to efforts to find cheaper&#xD;
      technologies for virological monitoring of these individuals. The findings will also support&#xD;
      the choice of second line drug regimens that may be proposed for use in Africa.&#xD;
