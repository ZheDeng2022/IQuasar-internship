    <textblock>
      The acute effects of farmed rainbow trout, fed by various feeds versus a control meal with&#xD;
      poultry meat on cardiovascular risk markers and plasma protein expression are investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of the study are that if the feed are changed from a marine origin to&#xD;
      primarily a vegetable origin the content of long chain n-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3&#xD;
      PUFA) will decrease in the meat and thus possibly result in a decreased effect on health.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the feed of the trouts are also expected to give rise to differences in the&#xD;
      human plasma protein profile and fatty acid composition after consumption, which could be&#xD;
      associated with physiological effects.&#xD;

      In a controlled, single blinded human single meal study the acute effects of farmed rainbow&#xD;
      trout, fed by various feeds versus a control meal with poultry meat on cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      markers and plasma protein expression are investigated. 6 healthy men, age 40-70, will be&#xD;
      randomized to trout fed on only vegetable, only marine and a mix of different compositions of&#xD;
      vegetable and marine feeds. Outcome variables are blood pressure, pulse wave analyse, pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity, plasma protein profile, and plasma triglycerides.&#xD;
