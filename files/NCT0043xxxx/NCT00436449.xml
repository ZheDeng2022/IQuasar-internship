      This will be a multi-centre, double-blind, within-subject, placebo controlled randomised&#xD;
      trial in female subjects. All subjects will undergo bilateral breast augmentation surgery.&#xD;
      Immediately following surgery, each subject will receive 100µl containing 50ng or 200ng of&#xD;
      RN1001 per linear centimetre intradermally into both margins of one breast wound, and 100µl&#xD;
      of placebo solution per linear centimetre intradermally into both margins of their other&#xD;
      breast wound. The allocation of treatment to wound (left or right) will be randomised and&#xD;
      double blind.&#xD;

             augmentation through an infra-mammary fold incision who have given written informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight between 50 and 150kg and a body mass index within the permitted range for their&#xD;
             height using Quetelet's index-weight (kg)/height²(m). The permitted index is between&#xD;
             15-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of child bearing potential who are using method(s) of contraception&#xD;

             until 1 month post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects where the same implant position will be used for each breast; the implants&#xD;
             can be placed in sub-mammary or sub-pectoral pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects where the same type and size of implant is to be used for each breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinically acceptable results for&#xD;
             the laboratory tests specified in the trial protocol . All laboratory tests must be&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with significant breast asymmetry where this may produce a different length&#xD;
             or site of wound, or where there will be a different post-operative tension on the&#xD;
             wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and physical examination have a history or evidence&#xD;
             of hypertrophic or keloid scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had surgery in the area to be incised within one year of Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a personal history of a bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any history of breast malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the&#xD;
             Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or&#xD;
             involves the areas to be examined in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and/or physical examination, have evidence of any&#xD;
             past or present clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound&#xD;
             healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs&#xD;
             or surgical dressings to be used in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs including RN1001&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are taking regular, continuous, oral corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects undergoing investigations or changes in management for an existing medical&#xD;
             condition.&#xD;

             for what ever reason.&#xD;
