  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see if HbA1C, the usual blood test for monitoring blood sugar control in&#xD;
      diabetic patients, is as accurate in diabetic patients who also have HIV and will evaluate if&#xD;
      alternative methods for monitoring blood sugar are preferred for HIV infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes or high blood sugar may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Participants have two clinic visits (1 to 4 weeks apart) at the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center. At the first visit they provide a detailed medical, social and family&#xD;
      history and have blood and urine samples collected. Previous blood sugar values are also&#xD;
      recorded. At the second visit, scheduled for 1 to 4 weeks after the first visit, blood and&#xD;
      urine samples are collected. Some of the urine and blood samples are stored for future&#xD;
      research on diabetes, HIV or related conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is increasingly recognized among patients living with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. At present, there are no unique guidelines for the&#xD;
      management of diabetes in patients with HIV. Diabetes in this population is managed in&#xD;
      accordance with national guidelines for the management of diabetes in any patient. However,&#xD;
      there have been small studies suggesting that hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) may not be indicative of&#xD;
      true glycemic control in HIV positive patients. There are currently no published prospective&#xD;
      studies examining the ability of HbA1C to reflect glycemic control in HIV positive patients&#xD;
      with diabetes. Since the incidence of HIV positive patients with lipodystrophy, glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, and diabetes is steadily increasing with the widespread use of highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the question of how best to monitor hyperglycemia in these&#xD;
      patients is an important one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, a prospective cross-sectional study of 100 patients, seeks to collect preliminary&#xD;
      data to determine if HbA1C is appropriately reflecting plasma glucose in HIV positive&#xD;
      patients. Patients with HIV and diabetes or hyperglycemia will have a fasting and a random&#xD;
      plasma glucose and HbA1C collected as in normal diabetes patient care. They will also have&#xD;
      two validated alternate markers of glycemic control drawn, fructosamine and Glycomark [R], to&#xD;
      determine how well these markers may reflect actual glycemia. Fructosamine represents a&#xD;
      measure of protein glycosylation whereas Glycomark [R] is a monosaccharide in plasma&#xD;
      competitively inhibited in the renal tubules by glucose that reflects day-to-day&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. In addition, hemolysis will be assessed to investigate this as one potential&#xD;
      mechanism for why HbA1C may be a less accurate representation of glycemia in these patients.&#xD;
      The determination of the value of HbA1C as a marker of glycemia in HIV positive patients with&#xD;
      diabetes will assist with the monitoring and the management of this unique population with&#xD;
      diabetes. The measurement of other glycemic markers may provide evidence towards potential&#xD;
      superior markers of glycemia in these patients, and the study will provide insight into the&#xD;
      possible mechanism of the HbA1C discrepancy.&#xD;
