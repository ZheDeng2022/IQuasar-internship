  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracies of the Patient Activity Monitor to&#xD;
      that of a standard pedometer during a walking task and some day-to-day activities in a&#xD;
      simulated apartment setting.&#xD;

      The ability to accurately measure daily activity levels in lower extremity amputee patients&#xD;
      is important for a better understanding of their use of prosthetic limbs. Most studies have&#xD;
      shown that patients often report their activity level inaccurately. More objective data on&#xD;
      activity levels will not only provide information helpful for determining the appropriate&#xD;
      prosthetic components for an individual, it will also be helpful when assessing the effects&#xD;
      that medical illness have on activity levels and in objectively determining the benefits of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. In addition, being able to measure activity accurately will allow further&#xD;
      verification of currently developed clinical surveys designed to determine amputee activity&#xD;
      in a practical form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until more recently a practical, accurate and affordable means of monitoring lower extremity&#xD;
      amputee activity has not been available for use. Currently a monitoring device designed&#xD;
      specifically for this task is available for research use. It is called the Patient Activity&#xD;
      Monitor (PAM). Many different models of more generic activity monitoring devices, called&#xD;
      pedometers, also exist and need to be further tested in the amputee population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study was to measure and compare the step count and ambulation distance&#xD;
      accuracies of a Yamax Digi-Walker pedometer and the PAM in transtibial amputees at the K3&#xD;
      Level within a simulated apartment setting and during relatively continuous gymnasium&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;
