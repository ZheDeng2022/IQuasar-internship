  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major component of green&#xD;
      tea, affects how the body responds to insulin in healthy and obese people. Insulin is not as&#xD;
      effective in people who are overweight, have high blood pressure or diabetes. This condition&#xD;
      is known as insulin resistance. Laboratory studies suggest that green tea or EGCG treatment&#xD;
      lowers blood pressure, lowers blood sugar and increases blood flow. This study will see if&#xD;
      EGCG improves insulin resistance or insulin's effects on blood flow in people with insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal weight or overweight people between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Participants are randomly assigned to take EGCG or a placebo ( inactive dummy&#xD;
      pill ) in two 4-week treatment phases with a 2-week period of no study medication before each&#xD;
      treatment phase. After the first 4-week treatment, patients on placebo are switched to EGCG&#xD;
      and those on EGCG are switched to placebo. In addition to treatment, participants undergo the&#xD;
      following procedures during the study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening, including medical history, physical examination and blood and urine tests,&#xD;
           and finger-stick blood sugar measurement for patients with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a dietary and physical activity questionnaire and consult with a dietitian&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At-home and clinic blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose clamp test to measure how the body responds to insulin. This test is done three&#xD;
           times during the study. A needle is placed in a vein in each of the subject's arms, one&#xD;
           for sampling blood and the other for infusing insulin, glucose and potassium. Glucose&#xD;
           and insulin levels, electrolytes, lipids, fatty acids, cytokines and epicatechin are&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forearm blood flow measurement with microbubbles and ultrasound. Before beginning the&#xD;
           glucose clamp test, a test of how well the blood vessels relax is done. A device that&#xD;
           measures the size of the artery in the upper arm is placed above the elbow. Blood flow&#xD;
           in the muscle of the forearm is measured by ultrasound using a small infusion through a&#xD;
           vein of microbubble contrast agent consisting of gas-filled bubbles the size of red&#xD;
           blood cells. The contrast agent is infused over a 7- to 9-minute period at the beginning&#xD;
           of the glucose clamp test and again 2 hours after the beginning of the test.&#xD;

      Green tea is a functional food whose consumption is associated with improved cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in several large epidemiological studies. One third of the solids in&#xD;
      green tea are composed of the bioactive polyphenol epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG). Studies&#xD;
      in both cell- and animal-based models (from our lab and elsewhere) suggest that EGCG may&#xD;
      mimic and/or augment beneficial metabolic, vascular, and anti-inflammatory actions of&#xD;
      insulin. Indeed, we have recently shown that 3-week EGCG therapy of SHR rats (genetic model&#xD;
      of hypertension with features of human metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance,&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia, endothelial dysfunction, and overweight) lowers blood pressure, improves&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, increases insulin sensitivity, and raises adiponectin levels nearly&#xD;
      as effectively as treatment with the conventional ACE-inhibitor enalapril. Obesity, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, and hypertension are all important interrelated public health problems that are&#xD;
      characterized by reciprocal relationships between insulin resistance and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction. Thus, therapies for these diseases that improve insulin resistance often&#xD;
      simultaneously improve endothelial function and vice versa. Based on results from cellular,&#xD;
      physiological, and epidemiological studies, we hypothesize that oral EGCG administration will&#xD;
      simultaneously ameliorate insulin resistance and lower blood pressure in human subjects with&#xD;
      obesity. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, cross-over study to evaluate potential beneficial effects of EGCG to modulate&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, vascular function, and inflammatory markers in two&#xD;
      groups of subjects (lean healthy controls, obesity). After a 2-week EGCG-free run-in period,&#xD;
      each subject will be randomized to receive EGCG or placebo capsules (400 mg p.o. B.I.D.) for&#xD;
      4 weeks. This will be followed by a 2-week EGCG-free washout period after which subjects will&#xD;
      cross-over to the other treatment arm. At baseline, and after each 4-week treatment period,&#xD;
      we will assess insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp technique) and&#xD;
      vascular function. Regarding vascular function, we will measure basal and insulin-stimulated&#xD;
      brachial artery blood flow (large conduit artery assessed by Doppler ultrasound) as well as&#xD;
      capillary recruitment in forearm skeletal muscle (small nutritive arterioles assessed by&#xD;
      ultrasound with microbubble contrast). Blood pressure will be measured weekly in the UMB GCRC&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the study. EGCG pharmacokinetics will be measured at the beginning&#xD;
      of each glucose clamp study day after oral administration of a single dose of EGCG or&#xD;
      placebo. Finally, various plasma markers of inflammation will be measured at baseline and at&#xD;
      the end of each treatment arm to evaluate potential changes that may be related to&#xD;
      improvements in metabolic and/or vascular function. This study will explore whether EGCG, a&#xD;
      single compound thought to be a major bioactive component of green tea, is effective at&#xD;
      improving insulin resistance and lowering blood pressure in subjects with obesity. Results&#xD;
      from this study may have important implications for understanding potential health benefits&#xD;
      of functional foods that contain bioactive polyphenols including green tea, dark chocolate,&#xD;
      and red wine.&#xD;

        ALL SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from our study if they are pregnant , breastfeeding or if they&#xD;
        plan pregnancy prior to the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, subjects will be excluded if their age is greater than 65 yrs, BMI greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 40 kg/m(2), or have liver disease (including liver transaminase levels&#xD;
        greater than twice the upper limit of normal), pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency&#xD;

        coagulopathy, major depressive disorder, actively smoking or used tobacco within the last&#xD;
        year, history of cancer, in treatment for any form of cancer, positive tests for HIV,&#xD;
        hepatitis B or C, or take systemic corticosteroids, thiazolidinediones (within 3 months),&#xD;
        insulin, or anticoagulants, use food supplements that cannot be discontinued, regular&#xD;
        intake of 8 or more cups of tea per week within 3 months prior to study entry, regular&#xD;
        alcoholic beverage intake of more than two drinks per day (a drink corresponds to&#xD;
        approximately 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of table wine, and between 1 and 1.5 ounces of&#xD;
        80-proof spirits), poor compliance during run-in period or regular use of medications that&#xD;
        affect insulin sensitivity, blood pressure or vascular function and that cannot be&#xD;
        discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, history of any other medical disease, laboratory abnormalities, or&#xD;
        psychological conditions that would make the subject (based upon the principal&#xD;
        investigator's judgment) unsuitable for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with known hypersensitivity to octafluoropropane, recent eye surgery, or with&#xD;
        known cardiac shunts will also be excluded from participating because of potential adverse&#xD;
        effects from microbubble contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they are unable to give informed consent for all procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently, type 2 diabetes is not rare in children, however children are excluded from this&#xD;
        study because children do not typically take EGCG and do not typically have hypertension or&#xD;
        type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
