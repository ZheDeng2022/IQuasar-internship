  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of ARDS appears to be from damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier, which&#xD;
      is composed of the microvascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. This damage may&#xD;
      occur from direct or indirect lung injury. The mechanism of injury to the alveolar capillary&#xD;
      barrier appears to be through neutrophil-mediated injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury with alveolar over distention and abnormalities of the&#xD;
      coagulation system. This results in blood clot formation in the microcirculation of the lung.&#xD;
      Thrombolytics can dissolve blood clots and result in increased blood flow to the organs. This&#xD;
      treatment may benefit ARDS patients, thus the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hardaway, et al.studied the effects of thrombolytics on ARDS in pigs. The experimental group&#xD;
      showed improved oxygenation and survival as compared to controls. There was no bleeding&#xD;
      complications noted with this therapy. Dr. Hardaway followed this animal study with a phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial involving 20 patients with ARDS. The patients were treated with IV&#xD;
      streptokinase or urokinase. Nineteen of the 20 patients showed an increase in PA02 after&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy. There were no significant bleeding complications in patients that were&#xD;
      critically ill on ventilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an additional phase I pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      Tenecteplase for the treatment of ARDS. Unlike the other fibrinolytics studied in this&#xD;
      disease state, Tenecteplase, is more fibrin specific and has increased resistance to&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-I) at greater levels than other available fibrinolytics.&#xD;
      We have chosen an experimental dose escalation trial design of tenecteplase that has&#xD;
      demonstrated initial safety trends in a Phase I acute ischemic stroke trial. The initial dose&#xD;
      is 0.1 mg/kg IV and will increase to 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, with a final cohort of patients&#xD;
      receiving 0.4 mg/kg. Drug administration will be a single dose bolus in each cohort.&#xD;
      Advancement of dose will occur if safety is not in question in the previous cohort. We hope&#xD;
      this will provide an acceptable benefit risk ratio as the mortality of ARDS is approximately&#xD;
      30 - 60%. All patients will be closely monitored for any change in clotting parameters and&#xD;
      signs of bleeding. Tenecteplase will be administered via a peripheral IV as described in the&#xD;
      package insert.&#xD;

      1. Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome with tenecteplase, a dose escalation&#xD;
           pilot study: phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study sample size will be 20 patients. The 20 patients will be divided into 4 groups&#xD;
           with 5 patients in each group or cohort. The first cohort will received 0.1mg/kg of&#xD;
           tenecteplase as a bolus via peripheral IV as described by the package insert and will be&#xD;
           closely monitored for safety and efficacy. If there are no adverse events associated&#xD;
           with tenecteplase, the second cohort of patients will be enrolled and will receive 0.2&#xD;
           mg/kg of tenecteplase IV bolus. If there are no safety issues, we will proceed with the&#xD;
           next cohort at 0.3 mg/kg with a final cohort of patients receiving 0.4 mg/kg of&#xD;
           tenecteplase IV bolus. Advancement of dose will occur if safety is not in question in&#xD;
           the previous cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tenecteplase will be given as a bolus via peripheral IV as described by package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment will be initiated after informed consent is obtained and only &gt;12 hrs after&#xD;
           any subcutaneous Heparin has been stopped and &gt;12 hrs after placement of a pulmonary&#xD;
           artery catheter, central line or arterial line. Only patients meeting criteria for ARDS&#xD;
           (see inclusion criteria) will be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pretreatment assessment: We will obtain informed consent, demographic data, physical&#xD;
           examination and medical history, vital signs, PT, PTT, INR, ABG, hemoglobin hematocrit,&#xD;
           liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes, creatinine, fibrinogen, fibrin split products,&#xD;
           platelets, urine pregnancy test, EKG, chest x-ray, cardiac profile from Swan-Ganz&#xD;
           catheter and ventilator settings before treatment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment during treatment: Blood samples will be taken every 6 hours for 24 hours and&#xD;
           analyzes for PT, PTT, INR, fibrinogen, fibrin split products, platelets, hemoglobin, and&#xD;
           hematocrit. Arterial blood gas samples will be taken at hour 1, 2, 3, and every six&#xD;
           hours until 24 hours post-injection. Cardiac profile, vital signs and ventilator&#xD;
           settings will be monitored at hour 1, 2, 3, and every six hours until 24 hours&#xD;
           post-infusion. Adverse events will be monitored every hour for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-up assessment: 72 hours post treatment physical exam, vital signs, weight,&#xD;
           adverse events, cardiac profile, ventilator settings, PT, PTT, INR, fibrinogen, fibrin&#xD;
           split products, platelets, ABG, hemoglobin and hematocrit, liver enzymes, cardiac&#xD;
           enzymes, creatinine, EKG and chest x-ray will be obtained. Thirty days post treatment&#xD;
           physical exam, vital signs, weight, mortality, adverse events will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patients will be monitored for signs of clinical bleeding.&#xD;
