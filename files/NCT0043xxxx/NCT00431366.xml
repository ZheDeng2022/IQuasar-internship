      This study will explore sequence effect, a fatigue or tiredness commonly seen in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease after they have been doing the same thing for a while. The study&#xD;
      will use a new device called a modified peg board test (see description below) to measure&#xD;
      whether antiparkinsonian medications (levodopa/carbidopa or dopamine) and repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, see description below) of the brain can improve the&#xD;
      symptoms of sequence effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease who have never taken antiparkinsonian&#xD;
      medications and patients with advanced disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      must be 18 years of age or older and right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have five visits to the NIH Clinical Center as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (baseline): Patients have a neurological examination, including brief cognitive&#xD;
           function tests, a rating for depression, and two types of ratings for fatigue severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 2 through 5 (experimental sessions): Patients who have been taking antiparkinson&#xD;
           medication for a long time are asked to not take their medication for about 12 hours&#xD;
           (overnight withdrawal) before visits 2 through 5. They are off medication for about 14&#xD;
           hours total (until after the experiments are done). Patients may be admitted to the NIH&#xD;
           Clinical Center for the overnight drug withdrawal if necessary. At the start of each&#xD;
           session, participants are given either levodopa/carbidopa tablets or placebo (tablets&#xD;
           identical in appearance but with no active medication). They perform the modified&#xD;
           pegboard test before medication, after medication, and after brain stimulation with&#xD;
           rTMS. During two of the sessions, they receive actual brain stimulation, and during the&#xD;
           other two sessions they receive sham stimulation, which does not actually stimulate the&#xD;
           brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified pegboard test is a computer-based machine with eight pegs. Subjects transfer&#xD;
      each peg from a line of holes on the right side to a line of holes on the left side using&#xD;
      their right hand and moving as quickly as possible. After they finish moving all pegs to the&#xD;
      left line of holes, they wait for a beep and then transfer the pegs from left line to right&#xD;
      line of holes. They do this six times, three times with their right hand and three times with&#xD;
      their left.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in trains or short bursts of impulses. A&#xD;
      brief electrical current is passed through a wire coil held on the scalp. The current creates&#xD;
      a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling&#xD;
      sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in muscles of the face, arm or&#xD;
      leg. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or&#xD;
      perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal&#xD;
      disk electrodes taped onto the skin of the right hand. Subjects receive four rTMS blocks per&#xD;
      10 minutes. Each block consists of a total of 375 pulses.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to provide new insight into the effect of long-lasting sequence&#xD;
      movements (sequence effect) by investigating de novo and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      patients with an objective measurement. Our central hypothesis is that sequence effect is&#xD;
      caused by depressed excitability of the motor cortex, and is partially associated with&#xD;
      dopaminergic deficiency. Specifically, the aims of this study are to show that the sequence&#xD;
      effect is more severe in advanced PD than in de novo PD and to evaluate the extent of&#xD;
      improvement by levodopa and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and to show&#xD;
      the correlation of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve de novo PD patients and 12 age- and sex-matched advanced PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare objectively measured sequence effect with a modified Purdue pegboard, a&#xD;
      computer-based device, in de novo and advanced PD patients. The modified Purdue Pegboard will&#xD;
      detect start and stop times for individual peg insertion and for the task in its entirety.&#xD;
      The sequence effect in this protocol is detected by the progressive changes of time intervals&#xD;
      per peg insertion during the testing session. A time interval is defined as the period&#xD;
      between the start and stop times for individual peg insertion. We will conduct a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study to determine the beneficial effect of levodopa&#xD;
      and rTMS on the sequence effect in de novo and advanced PD. The four interventions are:&#xD;
      levodopa and rTMS; levodopa and sham; placebo and rTMS; and placebo and sham. A replicated 4&#xD;
      periods and four intervention-Latin Square design will be used for the crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the difference between two time intervals, individual 1st and 8th&#xD;
      peg insertion time, in 1st run (8-consecutive peg insertions) with right hand, which will be&#xD;
      compared between de novo PD and advanced PD. The secondary outcomes are: (a) the difference&#xD;
      in progressive changes of six time values for six runs; (b) the beneficial effect of levodopa&#xD;
      and rTMS on sequence effect; and (c) correlation between the time intervals of first and&#xD;
      eighth peg insertion and the scores of two subjective fatigue scales, i.e., Fatigue Severity&#xD;
      Scale (FSS) and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI).&#xD;
