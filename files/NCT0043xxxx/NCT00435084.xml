      This phase I/II study is designed to determine the safety and tolerability of APO866 for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory B-CLL not amenable to aHSCT. APO866 has shown to induce growth&#xD;
      inhibition in cultures of a wide variety of human hematological malignant cells as well as in&#xD;
      models with subcutaneously implanted human tumors. APO866 was considered to be safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated in a phase I study that treated 24 patients with advanced cancer. APO866 is&#xD;
      administered by intravenous infusion continuously for 96 hours and is repeated every 4 weeks.&#xD;
      In this study patients will receive only one cycle of treatment and the study endpoints will&#xD;
      be evaluated 4 weeks after the start of infusion. Patients will be followed up for 12 weeks&#xD;
      for safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B-CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia, remains incurable, and has only limited&#xD;
      therapeutic options available including alkylating agents and fludarabine. The identification&#xD;
      of new, selective, and non-toxic forms of therapy for patients with B-CLL is therefore a high&#xD;
      priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APO866 is a novel drug that induces cell death by specifically inhibiting the biosynthesis of&#xD;
      NAD+ from niacinamide, which is essential for the cellular metabolism, protein modification&#xD;
      and messenger synthesis. APO866 is not subject to the commonly known mechanisms of MDR. Its&#xD;
      activity is cell cycle independent. APO866 exerted high anti-tumor activity on a broad range&#xD;
      of different tumor cells derived from both human solid cancers and leukemias in vitro,&#xD;
      including CD38- and CD38+ cell lines, and on a large number of human xenografts in nude mice&#xD;
      and rats in vivo. Hematologic cancer cells were highly sensitive to APO866 (lower than 6 nM).&#xD;
      Lymphocytes are the most sensitive normal cells to APO866 resulting in lymphocytopenia and&#xD;
      reticulocytopenia in rats and monkeys. Furthermore, APO866 may have anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      properties as shown in vivo and dose-dependent decrease of VEGF levels in patients treated in&#xD;
      the phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear why CD38 positivity is associated with a short patient survival and poor&#xD;
      responsiveness to chemotherapy. It is possible that CD38 expression confers to B-CLL of a&#xD;
      more malignant cellular phenotype. This seems plausible given that the antigen has an&#xD;
      important role as a modulator of intracellular signaling and that cross-linking of CD38&#xD;
      up-regulates BCL-2 and inhibits apoptosis in normal mature B cells. Indeed, CD38/CD3l&#xD;
      interactions lead to increased B-CLL proliferation and survival. This study has been designed&#xD;
      to recruit patients with progressive or refractory B-CLL of whom, in line with the&#xD;
      literature, about 50% will be CD38+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that CD38+ lymphocytes will be more sensitive to the APO866 therapy due to&#xD;
      increased intracellular NAD+ consumption as substrate for the PARP dependent DNA repair&#xD;
      (instable genome, proliferation). However, CD38+ and CD38- B-CLL cells seem to be equally&#xD;
      sensitive to APO866 in vitro. In addition, decreased intracellular NAD+ levels will reduce&#xD;
      the anabolism of cADPR. CD38+ can catalyze the synthesis of cADPR from NAD+ and can further&#xD;
      hydrolyze cADPR to ADP-ribose.85,86,87 The cADPR is a potent Ca++-mobilizing activator and a&#xD;
      potential endogenous regulator.88 The ability of cADPR to release Ca++ from intracellular&#xD;
      pools is thought to be part of CD38-mediated signalling pathways that result in cell growth,&#xD;
      apoptosis, and differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APO866 was investigated in 24 patients with advanced cancers in a phase I study aiming to&#xD;
      determine the DLT and MTD. Treatment was well tolerated and safe. The unique DLT was&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia. At dose levels higher than 0.036 mg/m2/hr CTC grade III lymphocytopenia,&#xD;
      not thought to be clinically relevant, preceded all other toxicities. The recommended dose&#xD;
      for phase II studies of APO866 is 0.126 mg/m2/hr administered by civ infusion for 4&#xD;
      consecutive days every 4 weeks. This dose was selected because of its safety profile, and the&#xD;
      translational observation that Css of APO866 at MTD was similar or higher as compared to the&#xD;
      concentrations at which efficacy was established in vitro and in vivo. In addition, a&#xD;
      transient decrease of serum VEGF levels, a surrogate marker of angiogenesis, was observed&#xD;
      within 96 hrs after the start of treatment in 9 out of 11 patients treated at MTD and the&#xD;
      0.144 mg/m2/hr dose level of APO866&#xD;
&#xD;
      This forms the rationale to conduct a &quot;Proof of concept&quot; study of APO866, administered at the&#xD;
      recommended dose in patients with progressive refractory B-CLL non-eligible for aHSCT, either&#xD;
      CD38- or CD38+.&#xD;
