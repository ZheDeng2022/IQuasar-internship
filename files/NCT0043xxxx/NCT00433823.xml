  <brief_summary>

      Cholesterol is the precursor of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and sex steroids. Both&#xD;
      adrenal and non-adrenal (ovarian + testicular) all steroid hormones are primarily synthesized&#xD;
      using the LDL-cholesterol in the circulation. Additionally there is 'de novo' cholesterol&#xD;
      synthesis in both the adrenals and gonads controlled by the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. A third&#xD;
      pathway is the use of circulatory HDL-cholesterol by the adrenal and gonadal tissues for the&#xD;
      synthesis of steroids. Since statins both decrease circulatory LDL and inhibit de novo&#xD;
      cholesterol synthesis, they are likely to affect the synthesis of steroid hormones. In this&#xD;
      study we aim to investigate the effects of lowering LDL levels below 70 mg/dL on steroid&#xD;
      hormone synthesis.&#xD;

      Today atherosclerotic diseases are among the most important causes of death in the world.&#xD;
      Epidemiological, clinical, genetic, experimental and pathological studies have clearly shown&#xD;
      the role of lipoproteins in atherosclerosis. LDL is the major atherogenic lipoprotein and has&#xD;
      been defined as the primary target of lipid lowering treatment by NCEP. Although the level of&#xD;
      LDL, the primary target in the treatment of dyslipidemia, has been set as below 100mg/dl in&#xD;
      coronary heart diseases (CHD) and CHD risk equivalents, this level has been pulled down to&#xD;
      below 70mg/dl for the group defined as very high risk group by the ATP (Adult Treatment&#xD;
      Panel) guide that has been updated following the new clinical studies. As we already know,&#xD;
      cholesterol is the precursor of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and sex steroids, besides&#xD;
      being a structural component of the cell membrane. Both adrenal and non-adrenal&#xD;
      (ovarian+testicular) all steroid hormones are primarily synthesized using the LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      in the circulation. In addition to this, there is 'de novo' cholesterol synthesis in both the&#xD;
      adrenals and gonads controlled by the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. A third pathway, which under&#xD;
      normal circumstances has little contribution as compared to the first two, is the use of&#xD;
      circulatory HDL-cholesterol by the adrenal and gonadal tissues for the synthesis of steroids.&#xD;
      Our knowledge on extremely lowered LDL levels is quite limited. However, since statins both&#xD;
      decrease circulatory LDL and inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis, they are likely to affect&#xD;
      the synthesis of steroid hormones.&#xD;
