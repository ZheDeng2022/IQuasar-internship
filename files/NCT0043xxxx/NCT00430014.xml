      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of atiprimod when given in doses starting at 60 mg/day and ranging to 360&#xD;
      mg/day, or the MTD, whichever is lower, in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to measure the pharmacokinetics of atiprimod and&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of atiprimod treatment in patients with advanced cancer, and to&#xD;
      compare the pharmacokinetics of atiprimod tablets and capsules at the starting dose, with the&#xD;
      intent of switching to capsules for the dose escalation if the capsules pose no safety&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atiprimod was shown to slow or stop the growth of several human tumor cell lines in&#xD;
      laboratory studies. Researchers believe it may have the same effect on tumor cells in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on the study, you will have what are called &quot;screening tests&quot;.&#xD;
      These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. At the&#xD;
      screening visit, you will be asked questions about your medical history and any medications&#xD;
      you use. You will be asked questions about your ability to carry out everyday activities&#xD;
      (performance status). You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, and temperature), routine blood (about 1&#xD;
      teaspoon) and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram (ECG--a test to measure the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a neurological exam, which will include a series of questions and tasks (such&#xD;
      as walking, talking, and touching your nose). The interview will take about 20 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Additionally, the study doctor will test your reflexes by tapping your arms, knees,&#xD;
      and the bottom of your feet with a rubber triangle-shaped end of a special instrument that&#xD;
      looks like a little hammer. The study doctor will also test your ability to sense light touch&#xD;
      and pinprick, and will check your eyes with a special light source (ophthalmoscope). You will&#xD;
      be asked questions about your physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being,&#xD;
      as well as additional concerns you may have regarding numbness, tingling, discomforts, and&#xD;
      difficulties you may be having. The interview will take about 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor will be measured by tests that are normally used to check the extent of disease in&#xD;
      patients with the same type of cancer. This may include x-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsies. To collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed&#xD;
      with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large&#xD;
      needle. Women who are able to have children must also have a negative pregnancy test in order&#xD;
      to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you complete all of the screening tests and are eligible to participate in the study, you&#xD;
      will be scheduled to return to the clinic within 14 days, for baseline testing and the start&#xD;
      of treatment (Day 1). You will be asked questions about your medical history and the&#xD;
      medications you used since the last visit. You will have a physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of your vital signs, and routine blood tests (about 1 teaspoon). A blood sample&#xD;
      (roughly less than half of a teaspoon) will also be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing.&#xD;
      PK testing is used to measure the amount of atiprimod in your blood. This first blood sample&#xD;
      will be your &quot;baseline&quot; PK sample, and the drug level in later blood samples will be compared&#xD;
      to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to one of 8 specific dose levels of atiprimod, based on when you entered&#xD;
      the study; however, your dose level may be lowered if you experience increased blood levels&#xD;
      of AST and ALT (liver function tests used to monitor for possible liver inflammation). Your&#xD;
      assigned dose level will decide how many tablets or capsules of atiprimod you will take for&#xD;
      each dose. The first group of 3 patients will receive atiprimod tablets at the lowest dose&#xD;
      level for 14 days, followed by 14 days off drug. If no serious side effects occur, the next 3&#xD;
      patients will receive atiprimod capsules at the lowest dose level. If no serious side effects&#xD;
      occur, the next 3 patients will receive atiprimod capsules at the next higher dose level and&#xD;
      capsules will be used for the rest of the study (tablets will only be used for the first&#xD;
      group of 3 patients). If 1 of the 3 patients experiences a serious side effect, the next 3&#xD;
      patients will be given the same dose (rather than the next higher dose) to further evaluate&#xD;
      safety at that dose. If no serious side effects occur, the next 3 patients will receive the&#xD;
      next higher dose. Each new dose level will be tested in this way, until the highest dose&#xD;
      level (8th dose level) is reached or until serious side effects occur, in which case the dose&#xD;
      will not be raised any higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, you will take your dose of atiprimod orally (by mouth) in tablet or capsule&#xD;
      form once a day for 14 days, followed by 14 days with no atiprimod treatment. These 28 days&#xD;
      (4 weeks) will make up one treatment &quot;cycle.&quot; If you do not experience a serious side effect&#xD;
      that forces your doctor to remove you from study, and your cancer is stable or shrinking&#xD;
      after 2 months of treatment, you will be eligible to continue on atiprimod treatment for up&#xD;
      to 1 year (a total of 12 cycles). If you experience increased blood levels of AST and ALT,&#xD;
      and these levels return to normal within 7 days of completing the treatment cycles, you may&#xD;
      be eligible to continue atiprimod treatment, but at a lower dose level and on a modified&#xD;
      schedule (atiprimod once a day for 7 days, followed by 7 days off atiprimod). You should take&#xD;
      the atiprimod in the morning at about the same time each day. You should not eat food for at&#xD;
      least 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking atiprimod. You should drink 1 - 2 glasses of&#xD;
      water (preferred) or orange juice, soda, tea, or coffee during the 2 hours before and 2 hours&#xD;
      after taking your daily dose of atiprimod, and you may drink water (preferred) or orange&#xD;
      juice, soda, tea, or coffee during the 2-hour period after taking your daily dose of&#xD;
      atiprimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your baseline testing, you will be given your first dose of atiprimod. During the first&#xD;
      8 hours after your first dose of atiprimod, you will be watched for any side effects that&#xD;
      might occur. You will have several blood samples taken during this period for PK testing.&#xD;
      About a quarter of a teaspoon of blood will be drawn 30 minutes after your first dose, then&#xD;
      again at 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours after your&#xD;
      first dose, for a total of 2 teaspoons of blood drawn. After these blood collections, you&#xD;
      will go home. You will be given a study diary for recording any other medications you take&#xD;
      and how much you take, as well as any side effects that you experience. You will also be&#xD;
      asked to record the type and amount of beverage consumed during the 2-hour period before&#xD;
      taking atiprimod and the 2-hour period after taking atiprimod. You will be required to keep&#xD;
      this diary up to date during your entire participation on study, and you must bring it to&#xD;
      every study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will return to the clinic 24, 48, and 72 hours after your first dose (Study Days 2, 3,&#xD;
      and 4). You will be asked questions about your medical history and the medications you used&#xD;
      since the last visit. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital&#xD;
      signs, routine blood (about 1 teaspoon), and an ECG. The ECG will only be done on Day 2 (not&#xD;
      on Days 3 and 4). A blood sample (less than half of a teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing.&#xD;
      You will be given your daily dose of atiprimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you leave the clinic on Study Day 4, you will be given enough atiprimod to last until&#xD;
      the next visit (in other words, through Study Day 6). You will be instructed to not eat food&#xD;
      for at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking atiprimod, and to take the atiprimod in&#xD;
      the morning at the same time each day. You will also be instructed to drink 1 - 2 glasses of&#xD;
      water (preferred) or orange juice, soda, tea, or coffee during the 2 hours before and 2 hours&#xD;
      after taking your daily dose of atiprimod. You will be given a diary for recording when you&#xD;
      take the atiprimod, the type and amount of beverage consumed during the 2-hour period before&#xD;
      taking atiprimod and the 2-hour period after taking atiprimod, other medications that you&#xD;
      take, and any side effects that you experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to return to the clinic for tests once a week during the first cycle of&#xD;
      treatment (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28). You will take the atiprimod doses on Days 5-14 at home as&#xD;
      instructed, except for the 2 days during this period that you are scheduled to return to the&#xD;
      clinic (Study Days 7 and 14). These 2 doses will be given to you at the clinic. Before you&#xD;
      leave the clinic on Study Day 7, you will be given enough atiprimod to last until the next&#xD;
      visit (Study Day 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these first four weekly visits (Study Days 7, 14, 21, and 28), you will have several&#xD;
      tests performed. During each visit, you will be asked questions about your medical history&#xD;
      and the medications you used since the last visit. You will be asked questions about the&#xD;
      doses of atiprimod you have taken on your own (number of tablets or capsules taken at each&#xD;
      dose, time each dose was taken, if you ate food or drank something other than water, orange&#xD;
      juice, soda, tea, or coffee during the 2 hours before or after taking study drug, and the&#xD;
      number of glasses of water, orange juice, soda, tea, or coffee that you drank during this&#xD;
      4-hour period). You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs,&#xD;
      routine blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine tests. You will have an ECG at Day 28 only (not on&#xD;
      Days 7, 14, or 21). You will also have a neurological exam. You will be asked questions about&#xD;
      your physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being, as well as additional&#xD;
      concerns you may have regarding numbness, tingling, discomforts, and difficulties you may be&#xD;
      having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have several PK blood samples taken at your Day 14 visit. About a quarter of a&#xD;
      teaspoon will be taken 30 minutes after you take the atiprimod dose at your Day 14 visit, and&#xD;
      then again at 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours after&#xD;
      that same dose, for a total of 2 teaspoons of blood drawn. You will also be instructed to&#xD;
      return to the clinic 24, 48, and 72 hours after your Day 14 visit for a single blood&#xD;
      collection. Less than a quarter of a teaspoon of blood will be collected at each of these 3&#xD;
      visits. A single blood collection (about half of a teaspoon) will also be taken at your Day&#xD;
      7, Day 21 and Day 28 visits for PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your Day 28 visit, you will also have the size of the tumor measured using x-rays, MRIs,&#xD;
      or CT scans, as before. Women who are able to have children will have a blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first cycle, you will return to the clinic for evaluation once a month at the end&#xD;
      of each cycle that you are eligible for treatment. If you do not experience a serious side&#xD;
      effect that forces your doctor to remove you from study, and your cancer is stable or&#xD;
      shrinking after 2 months of treatment, you will be eligible to continue on atiprimod&#xD;
      treatment for up to 1 year (a total of 12 cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each monthly study visit, you will be given enough atiprimod to last until your next&#xD;
      clinic visit (Week 4 of next cycle). You will be given a diary for recording when you take&#xD;
      the atiprimod, the type and amount of beverage consumed during the 2-hour period before&#xD;
      taking atiprimod and the 2-hour period after taking atiprimod, other medications that you&#xD;
      take, and any side effects that you experience. During these monthly visits, you will have&#xD;
      several tests performed. You will be asked questions about the doses of atiprimod you have&#xD;
      taken on your own. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs,&#xD;
      routine blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine tests, and an ECG. You will have a neurological&#xD;
      exam. You will be asked questions about your physical, social/family, emotional, and&#xD;
      functional well-being, as well as additional concerns you may have regarding numbness,&#xD;
      tingling, discomforts, and difficulties you may be having. A single blood collection (less&#xD;
      than half of a teaspoon) will be taken for PK testing. Your tumor will be measured using the&#xD;
      same kinds of scans as before. Women who are able to have children will have a blood&#xD;
      pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience increased blood levels of AST and ALT, and these levels return to normal&#xD;
      within 7 days of completing the treatment cycle, you may be eligible to continue atiprimod&#xD;
      treatment, but at a lower dose level and on a modified schedule. If you do receive a modified&#xD;
      schedule of atiprimod, you will return to the clinic for an additional evaluation on Week 2&#xD;
      (Day 14) of the modified cycle (in addition to the evaluation that you will have at the end&#xD;
      of the cycle). This evaluation will include the same tests done at the monthly visits, except&#xD;
      that your tumor will not be measured and you will not have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra visits, tests, and/or procedures may be done at any time during this research study, if&#xD;
      the doctor thinks they are in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if the disease progresses, intolerable side effects occur, or you&#xD;
      do not follow study guidelines for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after your last treatment cycle, you will return to the clinic for a follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation. You will be asked questions about your ability to carry out everyday activities&#xD;
      (performance status). You will be asked questions about your medical history and the&#xD;
      medications you used since the last visit. You will have a physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of your vital signs, routine blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine tests, and an&#xD;
      ECG. You will have a neurological exam. You will be asked questions about your physical,&#xD;
      social/family, emotional, and functional well-being, as well as additional concerns you may&#xD;
      have regarding numbness, tingling, discomforts, and difficulties you may be having. A single&#xD;
      blood collection (less than half of a teaspoon) will be taken for PK testing. Women who are&#xD;
      able to have children will have a blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Atiprimod is authorized by the FDA for research only. About&#xD;
      61 individuals will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.&#xD;
