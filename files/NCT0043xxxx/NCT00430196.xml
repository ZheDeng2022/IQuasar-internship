  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will compare BOTOX® versus Zanaflex ® for the treatment of muscle&#xD;
      overactivity in the upper limb following stroke or brain traums. This is a critical step in&#xD;
      the development of local intramuscular treatment for patients with muscle overactivity&#xD;
      following an acute brain lesions, as opposed to the more classic oral treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a multicenter, randomized, prospective, parallel, double blind study that&#xD;
      enrolls subjects at twelve sites (including Mt. Sinai) throughout the United States and&#xD;
      Europe. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BOTOX® compared&#xD;
      to Zanaflex® in reducing upper limb muscle tone in post-stroke subjects, as well as&#xD;
      evaluating changes in muscle tone-related disability and drug-therapy tolerance. This will be&#xD;
      an 18 week study. Subjects are eligible if they have been medically stable with upper limb&#xD;
      spasticity 6 months after their first stroke. Subjects will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      treatment groups: Treatment Group I - intramuscular BOTOX® plus oral placebo, Treatment Group&#xD;
      II - intramuscular placebo plus oral Zanaflex®, Treatment Group III - intramuscular placebo&#xD;
      plus oral placebo. The dose of BOTOX® will be at the discretion of the investigator with a&#xD;
      maximum of 500 U per subject. The dose of the Zanaflex® will be 4mg/day to a maximum of&#xD;
      36mg/day. The study anticipates that 150 subjects will be enrolled to provide sufficient&#xD;
      information to answer the primary objective of safety and efficacy of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatient, male and female subjects, of any race, between 18 and 85 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             result at Visit 1/Screening. (A female is considered of childbearing potential unless&#xD;
             she is postmenopausal or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury, more than 90 days prior&#xD;
             to Visit 2/Baseline, that result in disability caused by focal upper limb muscle over&#xD;
             activity, as assessed by the Investigator and characterized by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A wrist Ashworth tone of +3 or greater as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale&#xD;
                  at Visit 1/Screening and Visit 2/Baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A minimum measurement of +2 on the Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) for the&#xD;
                  principal therapeutic intervention target assessment (hygiene, dressing, pain,&#xD;
                  and cosmesis) chosen by the Investigator and the subject or subject's caregiver&#xD;
                  at Visit 1/Screening and Visit 2/baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who, as assessed by the Investigator, clearly understand the intent of the&#xD;
