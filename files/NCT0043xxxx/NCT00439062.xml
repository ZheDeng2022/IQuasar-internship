      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      roxithromycin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was 6-month, monocentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We treated&#xD;
      100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis with either once-daily oral roxithromycin (300 mg) or&#xD;
      daily oral placebo for 6 months. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of patients&#xD;
      who had a 20 percent improvement according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria&#xD;
      (an ACR 20 response) at six months. Secondary outcome measures were 50 percent improvement&#xD;
      and 70 percent improvement according to ACR criteria (an ACR 50 response and an ACR 70&#xD;
      response, respectively).&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:RA according to the 1987 American Rheumatism Association criteria19, age&#xD;
        between 18 and 70 years. Patients were required to have had an inadequate response to one&#xD;
        to four DMARDs (such as azathioprine, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, penicillamine,&#xD;
        hydroxychloroquine, or oral or injectable gold); an inadequate response was defined as&#xD;
        discontinuation of therapy because of lack of effect. If patients were receiving DMARDs,&#xD;
        they were required to complete a DMARD washout period that lasted at least 1 month before&#xD;
        starting study drug treatment; no DMARDs were permitted during the study. Patients who were&#xD;
        receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, prednisone (at 10 mg daily or less), or both&#xD;
        were eligible if the doses had been stable for at least four weeks before the study period&#xD;
        and continued to be stable during the study period. Patients were not allowed to receive&#xD;
        intra-articular corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients had to have active disease at enrollment (before the DMARD washout period),&#xD;
        defined as 12 or more tender joints, 10 or more swollen joints, and at least one of the&#xD;
        following: erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) of at least 28 mm/hr, C-reactive&#xD;
        protein(CRP) level greater than 2.0 mg/dL, or morning stiffness for at least 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative pregnancy test result was required for non-menopausal female patients. In&#xD;
             female patients of childbearing potential a urine pregnancy test was done at baseline&#xD;
             and any pregnant women were excluded. Other exclusion criteria included impaired&#xD;
             hepatic enzyme tests, impaired renal function, chronic/recurrent infection (e.g.,&#xD;
             chronic bronchitis, recurrent sinusitis), other infections(e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi,&#xD;
             Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma) , history of adverse reactions to macrolides,&#xD;
             roxithromycin, or similar antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient could be withdrawn from the trial at any time after enrollment for the following&#xD;
        reasons: the patient's request, severe or life-threatening adverse event, or inadequate&#xD;
        control of arthritis symptoms (&gt;50 percent increase in the total number of swollen or&#xD;
        tender joints) necessitating an increase in the systemic corticosteroid dosage or&#xD;
        reinstitution of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.&#xD;
