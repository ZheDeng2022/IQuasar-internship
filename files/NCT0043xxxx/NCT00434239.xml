  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is mainly assessing the safety of Revlimid in combination with Ancestim&#xD;
      (recombinant human stem cell factor) in patients with symptomatic myelodysplasia. Of those&#xD;
      two compounds, Revlimid has been shown to be an active drug in myelodysplasia. Clinical&#xD;
      responses will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim: The primary objective is to assess the safety of Revlimid in combination with Ancestim&#xD;
      in patients with symptomatic myelodysplasia. The secondary objectives are: Duration of&#xD;
      response and assessment of changes in gene expression profile of bone marrow samples from&#xD;
      patients undergoing such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are malignant hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      disorders. Prognosis can be estimated by use of the International Prognostic Scoring System&#xD;
      (IPSS) which divides patients into low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk groups&#xD;
      with corresponding median survival times of 5.7 years, 3.5 years, 1.2 years, and 0.4 years,&#xD;
      respectively. There is currently no standard treatment for MDS and management is often purely&#xD;
      symptomatic with transfusion of blood products and antibiotic treatment of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent phase II study however has shown significant response rates with Revlimid as a&#xD;
      single agent in patients with MDS. The total response rate was 56%. The effects of Revlimid&#xD;
      and SCF on hematopoietic progenitors cells were examined in vitro. RhSCF and Revlimid were&#xD;
      shown to be synergistic in stimulating the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells&#xD;
      and their precursors in vitro, thereby forming the rationale for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: This is a single-centre, open label, single-arm, non-comparative study, in&#xD;
      which 25 patients will be enrolled. The study will include patients who meet all the&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, as per the respective protocol section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled sequentially to receive 2 different dose levels of Ancestim&#xD;
      with a fixed dose of Revlimid. This will determine the feasibility and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination of Revlimid and Ancestim. Patients will start with an 8 week course of single&#xD;
      agent Revlimid as 10mg daily oral treatment day 1-21 in a 28 day cycle. If patients do not&#xD;
      achieve a complete remission on single agent Revlimid they will start on Ancestim s.c.&#xD;
      injections. Two dose levels of Ancestim (10 and 20 mcg/kg s.c. daily for 7 days) will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Safety will be assessed by the reporting of adverse events (starting with the first&#xD;
      study-related procedure, during treatment, and for a period of 60 days following&#xD;
      discontinuation of treatment). The intensity of the adverse events will be assessed using&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria. All adverse events will be recorded on&#xD;
      the case report forms (CRFs). Furthermore, assessments of physical (including neurological /&#xD;
      peripheral neurological) examinations, vital signs measurements, and haematology and clinical&#xD;
      chemistry tests will be used to monitor safety. Clinically relevant changes in laboratory&#xD;
      safety tests, vital signs, and physical examinations will be recorded as adverse events. The&#xD;
      adverse event sections of the CRFs will be submitted to a representative of the sponsor at&#xD;
      the end of each treatment cycle. Serious adverse events will be reported as they occur, on&#xD;
      forms provided by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Response to treatment will be assessed according to the guidelines of the&#xD;
      international working group to standardize response criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
      This will be done on bone marrow biopsies (including cytogenetic analyses) and peripheral&#xD;
      blood counts. An additional scientific investigation will examine gene-expression profiles of&#xD;
      bone-marrow and blood samples at different time points and will try to correlate those with&#xD;
      response to treatment. Concomitant in-vitro studies will assess surrogate markers of&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Adverse events, serious adverse events, transfusion requirements,&#xD;
      response data and Karnofsky performance status data will be summarized.&#xD;
