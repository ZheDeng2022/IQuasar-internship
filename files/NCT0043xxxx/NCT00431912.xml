      This phase II study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of APO866 for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). APO866 has&#xD;
      shown to induce growth inhibition in cultures of human CTCL cells as well as in animal models&#xD;
      with subcutaneously implanted human CTCL tumors. APO866 was considered to be safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated in a phase I study that treated 24 patients with advanced cancer. APO866 is&#xD;
      administered by intravenous infusion continuously for 96 hours and that is repeated every 4&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will receive 3 cycles of treatment and the primary efficacy endpoint will be&#xD;
      assessed at Week 16. patients will be followed up for 12 months&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CTCL is the most frequent occurring cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by an&#xD;
      indolent and protracted course of patches, plaques and tumors. It is highly symptomatic,&#xD;
      debilitating, disfiguring and impacting on the patient's quality of life. The treatment&#xD;
      strategy for CTCL is based on the exact diagnosis including the stage of disease and aims to&#xD;
      preserve cellular immune function, while achieving an anti-tumor effect. Given the nature of&#xD;
      the disease and the cumulative and additive toxicities of treatments used, the intensity and&#xD;
      duration of long-term therapy is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APO866 is novel drug that induces cell death by specifically inhibiting the biosynthesis of&#xD;
      NAD+ from niacinamide, which is essential for the cellular metabolism, protein modification&#xD;
      (e.g. PARP mediated DNA repair, sirtuins (histone deacetylation)) and Calcium dependent&#xD;
      messenger synthesis. APO866 is not subject to the commonly known mechanisms of MDR. Its&#xD;
      activity is cell cycle independent. APO866 exerted high anti-tumor activity on a broad range&#xD;
      of different tumor cells derived from both human solid cancers and leukemias in vitro and on&#xD;
      large number of human xenografts in nude mice and rats in vivo. Hematologic cancer cells were&#xD;
      highly sensitive to APO866. Lymphocytes are the most sensitive normal cells to APO866&#xD;
      resulting to lymphocytopenia and reticulocytopenia in rats, monkeys and cancer patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, APO866 may have anti-angiogenic properties as shown in vivo and in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APO866 has shown to induce, at low nM level, growth inhibition of human Myla CTCL cells as&#xD;
      well as in human subcutaneous xenografts of Myla CTCL in Balb-C nude mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APO866 was investigated in 24 patients with advanced cancers in a phase I study aiming to&#xD;
      determine the DLT and MTD. Treatment was well tolerated and safe. The unique DLT was&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia. At dose levels higher than 0.036 mg/m2/hr CTC grade III lymphocytopenia,&#xD;
      thought not be clinically relevant, preceded all other toxicities. The recommended dose for&#xD;
      phase II studies of APO866 is 0.126 mg/m2/hr administered by civ infusion for 4 consecutive&#xD;
      days (MTD). This dose was selected because of its safety profile, and the translational&#xD;
      observation that Css of APO866 at MTD was similar or higher as compared to the concentrations&#xD;
      at which efficacy was established in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No objective tumor response was observed. However, 4 patients had stable disease for at least&#xD;
      3 months: prostate cancer (4 months), melanoma (5 months), sarcomatoid mesothelioma (3&#xD;
      months) and oropharyngeal cancer (5 months). In addition, lesion size reductions were&#xD;
      observed in the melanoma patient (80% size reduction and stable size of other lesions) at an&#xD;
      APO866 dose level of 0.072 mg/m2/hr, and in the mesothelioma patient (moderate size&#xD;
      reductions of pleural lesions) at 0.108 mg/m2/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with APO866 was safe and well tolerated. The anti-tumor effect of APO866, in&#xD;
      particular on hematological cancer cells in vitro and ex vivo, and its lymphocytopenic effect&#xD;
      in patients support the rationale to conduct an open phase II study of APO866 in patients&#xD;
      with refractory or relapsed CTCL qualifying for systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
