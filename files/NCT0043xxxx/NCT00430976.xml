  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of aerobic exercise on the brain and&#xD;
      cognition through the measurement of neuroelectric and behavioral indices of executive&#xD;
      control cognitive function in older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to gain a better understanding of factors that relate to the&#xD;
      increased health and effective functioning of older adults. Specifically, efficiency of&#xD;
      psychomotor performance declines with advancing age leading to profound effects on older&#xD;
      adults' quality of life. For this reason, researchers have focused on the influence that&#xD;
      individual lifestyle habits have on the aging process. One lifestyle choice that has been&#xD;
      found to positively contribute to the efficiency of older adults' psychomotor performance is&#xD;
      cardiovascular exercise. This relationship appears to be especially significant when older&#xD;
      adults are challenged with more complex or effortful tasks. Previous research has led&#xD;
      investigators to believe that aging has a specific, rather than generalized, impact on&#xD;
      cognitive functioning. Also, prolonged participation in cardiovascular exercise has been&#xD;
      found to maintain the cognitive functioning critical for healthy aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine the role of an organized 6-month&#xD;
      cardiovascular exercise intervention trial on electrocortical (event-related brain potential)&#xD;
      and behavioral measures (reaction time) of executive control. In addition, a&#xD;
      non-cardiovascular exercise control group that participates in a 6-month stretching and&#xD;
      toning program will be used for comparison. Participants will be measured before and after&#xD;
      exercise training during engagement in several tasks designed to elicit different executive&#xD;
      functions (e.g., discrimination, task switching, inhibition). Each task also contains a&#xD;
      non-executive condition that will be used for comparison to examine the specificity of&#xD;
      exercise participation of cognitive functioning. A secondary aim of this project is to&#xD;
      determine the effects of an acute bout of exercise on cognitive functioning. Both groups will&#xD;
      participate in several bouts of exercise followed by immediate measurement on the tasks&#xD;
      outlined above to determine whether acute exercise has beneficial effects on executive&#xD;
      processes. The significance of this research may include the increased understanding of&#xD;
      factors related to the amelioration of age-related decrements in central nervous system&#xD;
      functioning and recommendations for the maintenance of cognitive health during the later&#xD;
      stages of life.&#xD;
