    <textblock>
      A comparison of intermittent pulsed cyclophosphamide to daily oral cyclophosphamide for the&#xD;
      treatment of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitides with kidney involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performed by the European Vasculitis Study group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary, ANCA-associated systemic vasculitides (AASV), including Wegener's granulomatosis&#xD;
      and microscopic polyangiitis, are progressive, multisystem, autoimmune diseases which respond&#xD;
      to immunosuppressive therapy. Their treatment with corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs has&#xD;
      been standardised in a first wave of studies (ECSYSVASTRIAL project), but limitations of such&#xD;
      regimens include only partial efficacy and appreciable treatment-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present trial, CYCLOPS, aims to reduce the cumulative exposure to immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
      by administering cyclophosphamide (CYC) as intermittent pulses. The potential benefit of&#xD;
      using CYC in this way for AASV has been demonstrated in preliminary, smaller studies.&#xD;
      Patients with previously untreated AASV and, &quot;generalised&quot;, but not life threatening, disease&#xD;
      with renal involvement, will be randomised to either continuous oral CYC or intermittent&#xD;
      pulse CYC. CYC will be continued until three months after remission has been achieved, with a&#xD;
      minimum CYC total duration of six months and maximum duration of twelve months; both limbs&#xD;
      will then receive the same maintenance regimen of azathioprine and prednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 18 months. The primary end-point is the disease-free period, taken as the&#xD;
      period of time from remission until relapse or study end; secondary end-points are adverse&#xD;
      effects, cumulative damage and immunosuppressive drug exposure. 160 patients will be&#xD;
      required.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A new diagnosis of WG, MP or renal-limited vasculitis (RLV) (appendix 5). Patients not&#xD;
             previously treated with cytotoxic drugs will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Renal involvement attributable to active WG, MP or RLV with at least one of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  elevated serum creatinine between 150 and 500 umol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  biopsy demonstrating necrotizing glomerulonephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  red cell casts.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  haematuria with &gt;30 red blood cells/high powered field and proteinuria &gt; 1g/24hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ANCA positivity or confirmatory histology or both (appendix 5). ANCA positivity&#xD;
             requires a typical CANCA pattern by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), (preferably&#xD;
             confirmed by anti-PR3 ELISA), or the presence of PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA determined by&#xD;
             ELISA, PANCA requires confirmation by anti-MPO ELISA [6]. (Central review of ANCA&#xD;
             serology and histology will be performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age 18-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. More than two weeks treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYC) or other cytotoxic drug&#xD;
             within previous year or with oral corticosteroids (OCS) for more than 4 weeks. If the&#xD;
             patient has received &gt;1.0g of methyl-prednisolone prior to the study start, discuss&#xD;
             with trial co-ordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Co-existence of another multisystem autoimmune disease, e.g. SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hepatitis Be antigen positive or Hepatitis C antibody positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known HIV positivity (HIV testing will not be a requirement for this trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serum creatinine &gt; 500umol/l (consider MEPEX trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Immediately life-threatening organ manifestations (e.g. lung haemorrhage or dialysis&#xD;
             dependence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous malignancy (usually exclude unless agreed with trial co-ordinator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnancy or inadequate contraception if female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Anti-GBM antibody positivity.&#xD;
