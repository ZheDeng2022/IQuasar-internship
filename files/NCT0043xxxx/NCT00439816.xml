      To determine racial/ethnic differences in preference for group visits in veterans with poorly&#xD;
      controlled hypertension (State 2 hypertension) and determine the effect of group visits on&#xD;
      health outcomes among veterans with poorly controlled hypertension.&#xD;

      Research Design: Randomized clinical trial to assess veterans� preference for group visits&#xD;
      and the effect of group visits on hypertension outcomes. Hypertension affects close to 50&#xD;
      million persons in the U.S., with prevalence, severity, and impact being increased in&#xD;
      non-white Americans 1.Despite recent clinical trials associating successful antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapy with reductions in stroke incidence, myocardial infarction, and heart failure,&#xD;
      control rates remain below the Healthy People 2010 goal of 50%. The importance of blood&#xD;
      pressure control is recognized within the VA as two of the conditions selected for QUERI&#xD;
      include ischemic heart disease and congestive heart disease, and blood pressure control is a&#xD;
      performance measure for every VAMC 2. Clinical trials have shown that blood pressure control&#xD;
      can be achieved in most patients with hypertension 3. When physicians fail to prescribe&#xD;
      lifestyle modification, adequate doses of antihypertensive medications, or appropriate drugs,&#xD;
      blood pressure control may not be achieved.1 In the course of a 15-30 minute visit with a&#xD;
      primary care physician, lifestyle modifications may not be addressed and inertia may prevent&#xD;
      rapid adjustments in medication dosages or changes in drug combinations. 4. The outpatient&#xD;
      group visit model is an intervention developed by managed care organizations to capitalize on&#xD;
      economy of scale. It has significant points of departure from the existing health care&#xD;
      delivery system design, which focuses on acute care. The outpatient group visit model also&#xD;
      fosters a more collaborative effort between the physician and patient, introduces nurses as&#xD;
      knowledgeable team members who can be trusted to communicate important information to&#xD;
      patients and between patients and physicians, and promotes peer support among the&#xD;
      participating patients. Group visits have proven successful in high health services utilizing&#xD;
      elderly patients with one or more chronic illnesses. A one-year study of monthly 2-hour group&#xD;
      visits led by a physician and nurse showed significant improvements in care delivery as&#xD;
      measured by decreases in emergency room visits, specialty care visits, and hospital&#xD;
      readmissions though no change in self-reported health and functional status were realized. 5.&#xD;
      Also, patients with type 2 diabetes attending group visits were shown to have increases in&#xD;
      quality of life measures, knowledge of type 2 diabetes, and improved metabolic control as&#xD;
      compared to patients in usual care. 6. Group visits offer providers more time per visit to&#xD;
      address process-of-care indicators and provide patients more time per visit with their&#xD;
      primary care physician. The monthly schedule allows for more frequent contacts between the&#xD;
      patients and physicians. Providers caring for patients in groups can deliver consistent&#xD;
      messages to multiple patients at once. Though monthly primary care visits (in groups) would&#xD;
      be an increase from the 4 primary care visits per year presently realized by veterans with&#xD;
      hypertension at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC, the frequency is more consistent with JNC 7&#xD;
      guidelines for monthly visits for follow-up and monitoring after the initiation of&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy. Presently, the average primary care physician at the Charleston VA&#xD;
      is scheduled to see 2 patients per hour. Group visits would allow the physician to see 20&#xD;
      patients over 2 hours. While demonstrated feasible and acceptable to elderly, chronically ill&#xD;
      managed care populations, and uninsured and underinsured patients with type 2 diabetes, group&#xD;
      visits have not been systematically tested in the Veteran�s Health Administration system.&#xD;
      Additionally, previous studies have not evaluated patients� acceptance of group visits or&#xD;
      their responses to groups according to race/ethnicity. This study seeks to inform whether&#xD;
      group visits are acceptable to veterans as a method of health care delivery, regardless of&#xD;
      race/ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will assess the effect of group visits on hypertension outcomes. Veterans&#xD;
      with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure =160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure =100&#xD;
      mmHg) will be identified during routine office visits. The primary care physician will&#xD;
      explain what group visits are using a standard script then patients will be asked if they are&#xD;
      willing to be seen in a group setting. Patients who indicate a willingness to receive care in&#xD;
      a group setting will be randomly assigned to either group visits or usual care. Randomization&#xD;
      will occur in blocks to insure equal number of subjects by race/ethnicity in each of the two&#xD;
      groups (group setting vs. usual care). We will recruit up to 8 VA primary care physicians to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Several have already indicated an interest in conducting group&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Visit Protocol: Group visits will be co-led by the patients� primary care internal&#xD;
      medicine physician and a clinic nurse. Each group visit session will be scheduled for two&#xD;
      hours consisting of: 15 minutes for &quot;warm-up&quot; and socialization, 30 minutes for presentation&#xD;
      of a health- related topic (facilitated by the physician or another team member with special&#xD;
      expertise), 15 minutes for break, during which time the nurse and physician will circulate,&#xD;
      attending to individual needs, immunizations, appointment scheduling, and other issues, 15&#xD;
      minutes for questions and answers, 15 minutes for planning the next session, and 30 minutes&#xD;
      for one-on-one consultations with the physician. Upon conclusion of the group portion of the&#xD;
      visit, patients will have the opportunity to see the physician individually if required.&#xD;
      While the group visits are intended to be the main source of medical care, patients who need&#xD;
      care in between scheduled group visits, or who have specific medical needs that cannot be&#xD;
      accommodated in the group visit (i.e. PAP smears, DRE), will be able to schedule a one-on-one&#xD;
      visit with their primary care provider.&#xD;
