  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The polycystic ovary syndrome is the leading cause of female infertility in the United&#xD;
      States. The disorder affects approximately 6-10% of women of reproductive age. It is widely&#xD;
      accepted that &quot;insulin resistance&quot; may be responsible for the infertility of this syndrome.&#xD;
      Women are insulin resistant when their bodies do not respond to insulin's action to handle&#xD;
      sugar as they normally should. Because of this insulin resistance, women with the polycystic&#xD;
      ovary syndrome are also at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. We have previously shown&#xD;
      that D-chiro-inositol (DCI), a substance naturally found in our body that helps insulin's&#xD;
      action, is lacking in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. Not having enough DCI may&#xD;
      lead to insulin resistance. The purpose of this study is to determine if weight loss helps to&#xD;
      replenish the body with DCI and help to promote insulin's action.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is present in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS are at high risk for&#xD;
      developing type 2 diabetes, presumably due to the insulin resistance that accompanies the&#xD;
      syndrome. Some actions of insulin may be effected by putative inositolphosphoglycan (IPG)&#xD;
      mediators of insulin action, and evidence suggests that a deficiency in a specific&#xD;
      D-chiro-inositol (DCI)-containing IPG may contribute to insulin resistance in individuals&#xD;
      with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus. A deficiency in DCI may also&#xD;
      contribute to the insulin resistance in women with PCOS. In PCOS, three separate studies have&#xD;
      shown that administration of DCI, the precursor to DCI-IPG, to women with PCOS improved&#xD;
      glucose intolerance while reducing circulating insulin, improved ovulatory function, and&#xD;
      decreased serum androgens. Serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and blood pressure improved&#xD;
      in some of the studies as well. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that&#xD;
      administration of DCI improved insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, and that a deficiency&#xD;
      in DCI may contribute to the insulin resistance of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of our group demonstrated that women with PCOS, when compared to normal&#xD;
      women, had a (i) greater than 5-fold increase in the renal clearance of DCI, (ii) 50%&#xD;
      reduction in the circulating concentration of DCI, and (iii) decreased insulin-stimulated&#xD;
      release of DCI-IPG during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Moreover, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (as determined by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      [FSIVGTT]) correlated inversely with renal clearance of DCI. In addition, it appears that&#xD;
      obesity needs to be present for the abnormality in renal clearance of DCI to be present in&#xD;
      PCOS, and obesity does not seem to have an effect in DCI renal clearance in normal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that obesity modulates the renal clearance of DCI in women with PCOS, but&#xD;
      not in normal women. A corollary of this hypothesis is that an increased urinary DCI&#xD;
      clearance leads to a reduction in circulating DCI and insulin-stimulated DCI-IPG release, and&#xD;
      aggravates insulin resistance in women with PCOS. To test our hypothesis, we propose to study&#xD;
      the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine if DCI renal clearance in obese women with PCOS is increased&#xD;
      compared to age- and weight-matched, obese normal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this aim, we will determine if obese women with PCOS have (i) increased renal clearance of&#xD;
      DCI, (ii) decreased circulating levels of DCI, and (iii) decreased DCI-IPG release in blood&#xD;
      during an OGTT, as compared to age- and BMI-matched, obese normal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine if weight loss reduces DCI renal clearance in obese women with&#xD;
      PCOS, but not in age- and weight-matched obese normal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim determines if weight loss reverses the abnormalities in DCI handling in PCOS. The&#xD;
      effects of weight loss on (i) renal clearance of DCI, (ii) circulating levels of DCI, and&#xD;
      (iii) DCI-IPG release in blood during an OGTT, will be compared between obese women with PCOS&#xD;
      and age- and BMI-matched obese normal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Determine if a change (reduction) in DCI renal clearance as a result of&#xD;
      weight loss is correlated with a change (improvement) in insulin sensitivity in obese women&#xD;
      with PCOS that is independent of weight loss itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our Preliminary Studies, we have determined that insulin sensitivity has a significant&#xD;
      inverse relationship with urinary DCI clearance. In this aim, we will determine if decreasing&#xD;
      DCI renal clearance by weight loss in obese women with PCOS will improve insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      independent of the degree of weight loss (via statistical adjustment with the degree of&#xD;
      weight loss as a covariate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: Determine if an equivalent degree of weight loss in obese women with and&#xD;
      without PCOS is associated with (i) a greater reduction in DCI renal clearance, and (ii) a&#xD;
      greater improvement in insulin sensitivity in the PCOS women compared to the normal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further demonstrate whether improvement in insulin sensitivity as a result of an&#xD;
      improvement in DCI handling is independent of weight loss itself, women will be stratified by&#xD;
      the degree of weight loss. For each degree of weight loss, we will determine if obese women&#xD;
      with PCOS have (i) a greater reduction of renal clearance of DCI and (ii) a greater&#xD;
      improvement in insulin sensitivity as a result of weight reduction, as compared to&#xD;
      weight-matched obese normal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our proposed studies confirm a role for obesity in modulating DCI handling in PCOS, they&#xD;
      will substantially enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of PCOS and are likely to&#xD;
      provide insights into novel treatment strategies directed specifically at the IPG system and&#xD;
      normalization of its function.&#xD;
