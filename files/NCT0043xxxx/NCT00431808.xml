    <textblock>
      This study will be the first time that the candidate malaria vaccine Apical Membrane Antigen&#xD;
      1 (PfAMA-1-FVO[25-545]) will be tested in malaria endemic populations. The phase Ib study&#xD;
      will include adults who will be randomly allocated to either receive the malaria vaccine or&#xD;
      the vaccine against Tetanus. Each participant will receive 3 immunizations, without the&#xD;
      clinical investigators or the participants themselves knowing what has been given. They will&#xD;
      then be follow-up up for immediate reactions to vaccination, and also over a longer term of&#xD;
      one year. Blood will be taken to evaluate the biological safety parameters and also immune&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of&#xD;
      recombinant pichia pastoris blood stage malaria vaccine Apical Membrane Antigen 1&#xD;
      (PfAMA-1-FVO[25-545]) versus tetanus toxoid, in healthy Malian adults in Bandiagara.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase Ia trial is currently ongoing and its interim results will be used to select the best&#xD;
      dose/adjuvant combination to be brought to Africa. The trial is evaluating safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of AMA-1 (10 µg or 50 µg) adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide or Montanide ISA&#xD;
      720, or ASO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To evaluate the safety of one dose of AMA-1 (10 µg or 50 µg) adjuvanted with aluminum&#xD;
           hydroxide or Montanide ISA 720, or ASO2, given at D0, D28 and D56 in healthy Malian&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the humoral response to the vaccine antigen by measuring the variation in&#xD;
                the level of IgG and its ability to recognize the native protein on merozoites.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the cellular immune response by measuring the T cell proliferation and&#xD;
                cytokine production following in vitro stimulation with the vaccine antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary immunizations will be administered on days 0, 28 and a boost given at day 56. The&#xD;
      participants will be followed up actively during the vaccination phase, and passively for one&#xD;
      another 9 months. The will be 19 scheduled clinic visits and following will the the schedule&#xD;
      for obtaining serology data D-28, D0, D28, D56, D84, D140 and D365&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary evaluation will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Solicited adverse events measured from day 0 to day 7 after each dose;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unsolicited adverse events measured up to one month after each dose;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) measured during the 12 months of study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biological safety: two and four weeks after each vaccination, and thereafter every&#xD;
                12 weeks, in reference with the baseline before the first dose, by measuring the&#xD;
                following RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, platelets, WBC with&#xD;
                differential counts, potassium, sodium, ASAT, ALAT, total bilirubin, alkaline&#xD;
                phosphatase, γGT, creatinin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The humoral response to the vaccine antigen: assessed by measuring the level of IgG&#xD;
                by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An IFA for at least two parasite strains will be used to verify that the antibodies&#xD;
                elicited by the vaccine recognize the native protein on merozoites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive methods shall be employed to evaluate the above criteria.&#xD;
