  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a human trial to study the peripheral effect of therapeutic botulinum toxin&#xD;
      (botox-A). The trial is performed on healthy normal males. The study comprises of two&#xD;
      parallel placebo-controlled, double blinded studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In experiment 1 intramuscular Botox will be given in corrugator (one site) and frontalis (two&#xD;
      sites) muscles on one side and placebo to the other side. Intradermal (i.d.) capsaicin&#xD;
      injection will be given to both sides (between the two sites of frontalis injection&#xD;
      horizontally). Capsaicin-induced pain intensity and flare together with the area of&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to different stimulus modalities will be measured and mapped at specific&#xD;
      time points using different cutaneous stimuli (thermal, electrical, tactile, pressure). This&#xD;
      will characterize which fibres and receptors are affected by Botox and will show if Botox&#xD;
      have a unilateral effect (peripheral) or if it also affects the contralateral side (central&#xD;
      effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In experiment 2 intradermal Botox will be given in corrugator (one site) and frontalis (two&#xD;
      sites) muscles on one side and placebo to the other side. I.d. capsaicin injection will be&#xD;
      given to both sides (between the two sites of frontalis injection horizontally).&#xD;
      Capsaicin-induced pain intensity and flare together with the area of hypersensitivity to&#xD;
      different stimulus modalities will be measured and mapped at specific time points using&#xD;
      different cutaneous stimuli (thermal, electrical, tactile, pressure). This will characterize&#xD;
      which fibres and receptors are affected by Botox. The effect of intradermal Botox will be&#xD;
      compared to the results of experiment 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two experiments will show if the intramuscular Botox exerts its action via a leak of&#xD;
      Botox from the muscle to the overlying skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antipruritic effects of Botox on histamine prick test and itch will also be assessed in&#xD;
      parallel with the experiment 2. In this sub-experiment, 5 Units of Botox will be injected&#xD;
      intradermally in the middle of volar forearm. The same volume of placebo will be injected&#xD;
      into the other side. Histamine prick test will induce itch and the effect of intradermal&#xD;
      Botox will be assessed compared to the baseline. Flare area and visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      ratings will be measured.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Male, 18 40 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No concomitant medical diseases or clinically significant abnormal findings based on&#xD;
             the medical history and baseline physical examination, that could affect the conduct&#xD;
             of the study, analysis of the data, or the safety of a subject, as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject clearly understands the intent of the&#xD;
             study and is willing and able to comply with study instructions, is available for&#xD;
             study visits and procedures and is anticipated to complete the entire study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any medical condition that may put the subject at increased risk with exposure to&#xD;
             Botox, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
             sclerosis or any other significant disease that might interfere with neuromuscular&#xD;
             function, including peripheral neuropathies.&#xD;
