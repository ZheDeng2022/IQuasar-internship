  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if a combination treatment of&#xD;
      perifosine and docetaxel will help shrink or slow the growth of cancer cells in recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. The safety of this combination treatment will also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug designed to kill some cancers and is believed to be slightly&#xD;
      effective at killing blood vessels in cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perifosine is a new drug that may help docetaxel be more effective in causing cancer cells to&#xD;
      die. Perifosine alone may slow cancer cell growth by targeting an abnormal pathway in your&#xD;
      ovarian cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive your dose of&#xD;
      perifosine by mouth every 6 hours on Day 1 of therapy. The actual number of pills in your&#xD;
      dose depends upon which dose level you are assigned to. You will then continue receiving&#xD;
      perifosine by mouth once a day for 20 more days. Each cycle of treatment is about 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 5 of therapy, of the first cycle only, you will have blood drawn (about 2.5&#xD;
      tablespoons) performed, and 5 hair follicles and ascites collected, if available. If you do&#xD;
      not have ascites, you will have a FNA performed on your tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of therapy, you will have a DCE-MRI. On Day 10 of therapy, you will have a PET scan.&#xD;
      Your treatment schedule for each cycle will usually be the same. There may be a one-day&#xD;
      difference in the treatment schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first cycle is completed, you will begin receiving docetaxel, on Day 2 of therapy&#xD;
      of each cycle of treatment, as an injection in a vein over 60 minutes at the M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      infusion center. The second cycle of treatment will start on Day 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 72 hours of the start of each cycle, you will have blood (about 1 tablespoon) and&#xD;
      urine collected for routine tests . After you receive the drugs, you will have weekly blood&#xD;
      tests (about 1 tablespoon) to evaluate your well being. Before the start of each cycle of&#xD;
      therapy, you will have a physical exam, and your medical history will be recorded. You will&#xD;
      also be called by the study doctor or staff to ask questions about any side effects you may&#xD;
      be experiencing during therapy. After the end of every 2 cycles (about every 8 weeks), you&#xD;
      will have an x-ray and either a CT scan or an MRI to re-evaluate your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be given treatment on this study as long as your disease does not get worse. Your&#xD;
      physician will discuss with you the maximum number of treatment cycles you will receive. You&#xD;
      will be taken off this study if your disease gets worse or if you experience any intolerable&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your participation in this study has ended, you will come back for a follow-up visit.&#xD;
      At this visit, you will have your medical history recorded and a physical exam. You will have&#xD;
      blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine collected for routine tests. You may also have a CT scan&#xD;
      or an MRI to re-measure and re-evaluate your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up for as long as needed after you have completed treatment with&#xD;
      perifosine plus docetaxel. You will either be contacted by phone or asked to come to the&#xD;
      clinic for a routine visit. You will be contacted every 8 weeks. You will have radiographic&#xD;
      evaluations, by either a CT or an MRI, done every 12 weeks to evaluate your cancer growth or&#xD;
      until you start on another anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Perifosine has been authorized by the FDA for use in&#xD;
      research only. Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
