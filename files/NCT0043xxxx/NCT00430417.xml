    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to measure bone formation in both lactating and non-lactating&#xD;
      post-partum women and compare these to those in healthy non-pregnant controls. The secondary&#xD;
      aim is to obtain measurements of Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP), markers of bone&#xD;
      resorption, and calcium and vitamin D metabolism in these subjects. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that lactating women will have an increase in bone resorption but no increase in bone&#xD;
      formation when compared to non-lactating post-partum women and normal controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and lactation are both states of altered maternal calcium and bone metabolism which&#xD;
      may have a significant impact on the development of peak bone mass. While these two states&#xD;
      are characterized by different hormonal environments, both have been associated with&#xD;
      significant bone loss. The maternal hormonal mechanism for providing calcium to meet the&#xD;
      needs of the developing fetus appear to differ from those that meet the needs of lactation.&#xD;
      During pregnancy, the 30 gm of calcium required by the fetus comes predominantly from an&#xD;
      increase in maternal intestinal calcium absorption which is mediated by 1, 25 dihydroxy&#xD;
      vitamin D and other factors. Several studies have measured total and free 1, 25 dihydroxy&#xD;
      vitamin D through pregnancy and find the values nearly double. Serum Parathyroid Hormone&#xD;
      (PTH) levels fall to about 10-30% of the mean non-pregnant value in the first trimester and&#xD;
      then increase to the mid-normal range by term, while ionized calcium remains normal&#xD;
      throughout pregnancy. PTHrP levels gradually increase throughout pregnancy although the&#xD;
      source (maternal, fetal, or placental) remains unclear. Most studies of bone metabolism in&#xD;
      humans during pregnancy have measured changes in markers of bone turnover rather than bone&#xD;
      density to avoid radiation exposure to the fetus. These studies have been confounded by&#xD;
      several variables such as the effects of hemodilution in pregnancy, altered glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rates (GFR), degradation, and clearance of markers by the placenta, which may&#xD;
      cloud the results. Some of these studies report an increase in urinary markers of bone&#xD;
      resorption from early to mid pregnancy while bone formation markers decrease and then rise&#xD;
      before term. Importantly, no one has assessed state-of-the-art markers of bone formation such&#xD;
      as P1NP in pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During lactation in humans, it is estimated that 600 to 1000 ml of milk are produced a day&#xD;
      with daily calcium loss of 200 to 400 mg. In contrast to pregnancy, a majority of this&#xD;
      calcium comes from demineralization of the maternal skeleton, and is probably predominately&#xD;
      mediated by PTHrP in the setting of low estrogen. PTHrP levels are significantly higher in&#xD;
      lactating women than non-lactating controls while intact PTH is reduced by approximately 50%&#xD;
      during the first several months of lactation. The source of the PTHrP is likely the mammary&#xD;
      gland, as PTHrP levels are elevated 10,000 fold in milk and circulating maternal PTHrP levels&#xD;
      are increased further with suckling. This is also supported by a mouse model in which the&#xD;
      tissue-specific ablation of the PTHrP gene in the lactating mammary gland resulted is a&#xD;
      decrease in bone loss during lactation. When PTHrP enters the maternal circulation, it&#xD;
      stimulates maternal bone resorption from the skeleton and renal tubular resorption of&#xD;
      calcium. PTHrP indirectly suppresses PTH as ionized calcium rises to upper levels of normal.&#xD;
      1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels fall to within the normal range during lactation, although&#xD;
      they have been reported to be higher in lactating than non-lactating postpartum women.&#xD;
      Intestinal absorption of calcium also returns to normal during the post-partum period. Serial&#xD;
      bone density measurement obtained during lactation show a fall of 3-10% in trabecular bone&#xD;
      (spine, hip, femur) with a smaller 1-2% loss at cortical bone. Both losses are far greater&#xD;
      that than that seen in early postmenopausal women, or in women receiving&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy. This implies that it is not only the&#xD;
      fall in estrogen that mediates bone loss during lactation. The bone loss during lactation&#xD;
      seems to be transient as there is rapid recovery of bone density in postpartum women with&#xD;
      weaning and the resumption of menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of bone resorption have been measured in urine in several prospective studies of&#xD;
      lactation in humans where they have been reported to be elevated 2-3 fold. However, these&#xD;
      results may be confounded by a decrease in GFR and volume contraction that may occur during&#xD;
      lactation compared to pregnancy. Surprisingly, more reliable markers of bone resorption&#xD;
      measured in serum (CTX and NTX) have not been measured in a controlled lactation study.&#xD;
      Markers of bone formation as measured by osteocalcin (Oc) and bone specific alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase (BSAP) have generally been reported to be higher during lactation. However, these&#xD;
      results are difficult to interpret as BSAP is not a very sensitive marker of bone formation.&#xD;
      Recent data has emerged suggesting that Oc may measure bone resorption as well as formation.&#xD;
      The current most accurate measure of bone formation is serum amino-terminal telopeptides of&#xD;
      procollagen 1 (P1NP), which has not been measured in a control study of lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective pilot cohort study of post-partum lactating women, post-partum&#xD;
      non-lactating women, and matched healthy controls who are not currently or have not recently&#xD;
      been pregnant. The investigators hope to estimate the measurable differences in bone&#xD;
      formation and resorption by comparing blood and urine samples from lactating women to&#xD;
      non-lactating postpartum women and normal controls. 100 female volunteers between the ages of&#xD;
      21 and 45 years will be recruited to achieve 75 evaluable subjects or 25 in each of the three&#xD;
      groups. There are two study visits, one at 6-8 weeks and another at 12-14 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
      Normal controls will be seen during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle and they&#xD;
      will be age and race matched to the post-partum women.&#xD;
