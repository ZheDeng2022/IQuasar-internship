  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aripiprazole is effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of refractory panic and generalized anxiety disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accruing evidence demonstrates that the anxiety disorders are common and associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and impairment. Although current first-line interventions are&#xD;
      effective, many patients remain at least somewhat symptomatic, and some respond not at all,&#xD;
      despite initial treatment. For instance, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common&#xD;
      distressing and disabling condition affecting 5% of the population. It is typically&#xD;
      characterized by a chronic course and associated with significant psychosocial impairment and&#xD;
      decreased quality of life (Simon and Pollack 2000). Although a number of therapeutic agents&#xD;
      have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of GAD, only a minority of anxious patients&#xD;
      experience remission with initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is a common anxiety disorder, occurring in 3.5 %&#xD;
      of the population (Kessler, et al., 1994). Although the study of panic disorder has advanced&#xD;
      in recent years, with the availability of a growing number of treatments with reported&#xD;
      efficacy in clinical trials and practice, acute and longitudinal follow-up studies of&#xD;
      patients with panic disorder suggest that many individuals remain symptomatic despite&#xD;
      treatment (Pollack and Otto, 1994). However, there is no systematic data currently available&#xD;
      to guide the treatment of patients with panic disorder who remain symptomatic after initial&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, one purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the addition of aripiprazole,&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with GAD or panic disorder who remain refractory despite a&#xD;
      treatment trial with an anxiolytic (e.g. antidepressant, benzodiazepine, buspirone).&#xD;
      Aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic agent with potent effects at the serotonergic, as well&#xD;
      as dopaminergic receptor, and a more favorable side effect profile than standard&#xD;
      neuroleptics, including a low potential to cause extrapyramidal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period is a 9-week, acute treatment phase. Patients who meet inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will receive aripiprazole for 8 weeks. Treatment will be initiated with 2.5 mg/day at the&#xD;
      baseline visit, 5 mg/day aripiprazole for the first week and flexibly titrated up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 30 mg/day over the next six weeks. Patients will be seen weekly for the first&#xD;
      three weeks of this phase of treatment, and then at 2-week intervals for the remainder of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female outpatients, age 18-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder (PD) with or without&#xD;
             Agoraphobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For GAD: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score greater than or equal to 16, and for PD:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hamilton Depression Scale score less than or equal to 18.5) Clinical Global Impression&#xD;
             of Severity score Score equal to or greater than 4.&#xD;
