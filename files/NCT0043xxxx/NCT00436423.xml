  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to Evaluate the response rate of Gemcitabine with TS-1&#xD;
      in Korean patient with advanced but inoperable, metastatic or recurrent pancreatic cancer who&#xD;
      is not receiving anti cancer therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, curative treatment of pancreatic cancer is surgery.But patients with operable&#xD;
      indication are rare, most of patients present with locally advanced or general advanced stage&#xD;
      at diagnosis. Thus the majority of patients need chemotherapy.But efficacy outcomes have not&#xD;
      seemed to increase overall survival comparing with none treated control group.In Korea the&#xD;
      incidence of pancreatic cancer increases steadily. Prognosis is poor. So now the effective&#xD;
      treatment is necessary.There are no phase 2 trialsabout combining gemcitabine and TS-1&#xD;
      against advanced pancreatic cancer.according to phase 1 trial of advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      (nakamura et al)toxicities more than 3 grade are neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
      anorexia, etc that can be treated.Phase 1 trial is not study to evaluate the response rate.&#xD;
      But among 21 patients who can be evaluated the response rate, 10 patients have Partial&#xD;
      response or Complete response.This combination therapy seemed to havetolerable toxicity and&#xD;
      remarkable therapeutic effect for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.So therapy&#xD;
      combining gemcitabine with TS-1 is expected synergic and additional effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is phase 2, open-label, multi-center, single arm study The total sample size will&#xD;
      be 38 patients. Patient will be administered chemotherapy until disease progression.&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 every 3weeks (on day 1 of each&#xD;
      cycle) TS-1 will be administered 80 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks.&#xD;
