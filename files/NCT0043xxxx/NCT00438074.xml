      This study will investigate optical tissue characteristics as a function of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      breast cancer treatment. Our objective in this pilot study will be to identify diffuse&#xD;
      optical spectroscopy parameters that change with treatment and that may correlate with&#xD;
      pathological response. The ultimate goal is to use such parameters ultrasound as an early&#xD;
      predictor of pathological partial or complete response in women with locally advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer receiving treatment with neoadjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy or neoadjuvant&#xD;
      combined modality chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy for females in North America. Around 5-15% of the&#xD;
      estimated 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year will present with locally advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer (LABC) (The definition of what constitutes &quot;LABC&quot; is complex and variable. Clinically&#xD;
      these tumours are usually considered to be those greater than 5cm in size and/or extend&#xD;
      beyond the breast tissue into the surrounding skin or muscle. Patients with matted axillary&#xD;
      lymph nodes (N2) or internal mammary nodes (N3) or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node&#xD;
      involvement are also considered to have LABC. In view of the extensive nature of these&#xD;
      tumours at presentation, women with LABC have a poor outcome in terms of both local and&#xD;
      systemic recurrence. Standard treatment for these patients is usually neoadjuvant systemic&#xD;
      (chemotherapy or less frequently endocrine therapy) followed by surgery and radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Patients who have hormone receptor positive tumours will then receive endocrine therapy. With&#xD;
      the use of multidisciplinary therapy, 10-year disease free survival rates of 50% for Stage&#xD;
      IIIA and 33% for Stage IIIB disease have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impetus for undertaking this study is that we are searching for imaging methods that&#xD;
      could potentially serve as surrogate indicators of pathological response. One such modality&#xD;
      that we wish to investigate as it may be ultimately useful in this patient population is&#xD;
      diffuse optical spectrometry. This modality depends on differentiating oxygenated from&#xD;
      deoxygenated tissue but is also sensitive to other changes in tissue characteristics. It has&#xD;
      been used before in proof-of-principle studies differentiating benign from malignant disease&#xD;
      but we hypothesize that it may be more useful in terms of monitoring tumour responses to&#xD;
      treatment. This is a non-invasive imaging modality that is easy to administer and relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally Advance Breast Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must give appropriate written informed consent prior to participation in the&#xD;
             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able and willing to comply with the safety procedures during the&#xD;
             Scanning Period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be women of between 20 and 80 years of age, inclusive, on the day the&#xD;
             Informed Consent Form is signed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be women who will be receiving neoadjuvant radiation therapy and/or&#xD;
             chemotherapy for locally-advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

             or surgical procedures (e.g.,silicone/saline implants) involving either breast,&#xD;
             exclusive of the lesion at issue;&#xD;

          -  Subjects with any dermatologic abnormalities (including tattoos, open sores, or&#xD;
             breached skin) involving either breast;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a current or past medical history of connective tissue disease;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a known sensitivity to purified water, soybean oil, sucrose, polysorbate&#xD;
             80, oleic acid, EDTA, benzalkonium chloride, FD&amp;C caramel color, butylated&#xD;
             hydroxyanisole, and/or sodium hydroxide;&#xD;
