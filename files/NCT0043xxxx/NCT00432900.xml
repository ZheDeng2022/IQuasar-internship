  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) to measure a brain protein called&#xD;
      peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in patients with multiple sclerosis. PBR is created&#xD;
      during the inflammation process, and brain inflammation is a key feature of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS). PBR usually affects one type of brain cell, but it can also cause damage to&#xD;
      surrounding areas of the brain in patients with MS. PET studies of PBRs and brain&#xD;
      inflammation may help elucidate the role of these brain cells in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with MS between 18 and 70 years of age may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Patients with MS must have had onset of disease between 18 and 40 years of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MS undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Medical history, physical examination, blood tests and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Blood tests and PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4: MRI and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: PET scan and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6: MRI and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Medical history, physical examination, blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3: PET and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For&#xD;
      this procedure, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a metal&#xD;
      cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises that occur during the scanning&#xD;
      process. The procedure lasts about 90 minutes; the patient is asked to lie still for up to 25&#xD;
      minutes at a time. The subject can communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the&#xD;
      scan. During part of the scan a contrast agent is administered through a catheter (plastic&#xD;
      tube) placed in an arm vein to enhance the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET scan gives information on brain and body chemistry and function. The subject lies on&#xD;
      a bed that slides in and out of the doughnut-shaped scanner. A catheter is placed in a vein&#xD;
      in the arm and another is placed in an artery in the wrist or elbow area. The catheter in the&#xD;
      arm is used for injecting a radioactive material that the scanner detects, and the other is&#xD;
      used to collect blood samples. A custom-molded plastic mask is used to support the head and&#xD;
      prevent it from moving during the procedure. The subject may be asked to perform various&#xD;
      tasks during the PET scan or to lie quietly. The scan lasts about 2.5 hours.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to measure brain peripheral benzodiazepine receptor&#xD;
      (PBR) expression as a marker of neuroinflammation in subjects with MS using [(11)C]PBR28 PET&#xD;
      imaging. Inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) is a prominent feature of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS), the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. A complex&#xD;
      sequence of inflammatory events leads to the formation of new lesions. The disruption of&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier that occurs during this inflammatory cascade is the basis of&#xD;
      Gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) enhancing lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), currently the&#xD;
      most widely utilized marker of neuroinflammation in MS. Although Gd-DTPA enhancement&#xD;
      correlates with acute clinical relapses, its limitation as a biomarker of disease activity&#xD;
      includes the relative insensitivity to mild degrees of inflammation and the lack of&#xD;
      correlation to long-term disability. An alternative marker of neuroinflammation may,&#xD;
      therefore, be informative. Activated microglia and macrophage constitute the secondary&#xD;
      effector cells of CNS inflammation in MS. Recent studies investigating the expression of the&#xD;
      peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in the CNS have shown that the increased expression&#xD;
      of PBR is a marker of activated microglia/macrophage. Specific ligands for PBR have allowed&#xD;
      the study of activated microglia/macrophage in vivo through positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) imaging in a number of settings including inflammatory, ischemic and toxic injury to&#xD;
      the CNS. The availability of a novel PBR ligand [(11)C]PBR28 developed by the Molecular&#xD;
      Imaging Branch, NIMH, that demonstrated greater specific signal for PBR than the previously&#xD;
      available ligands affords a unique opportunity to investigate a cell-type specific marker of&#xD;
      neuroinflammation in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with definite MS (McDonald criteria) with evidence of brain inflammatory activity&#xD;
      indicated by presence of Gd-DTPA enhancing lesions on MRI and a control group consisting of&#xD;
      age-matched healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 32 subjects with MS will undergo screening TSPO genotype analysis by PCR to accrue up&#xD;
      to 16 MS subjects with confirmed high- or mixed- affinity binding genotype (HL or HH&#xD;
      genotype) who will undergo a brain [(11)C]PBR28 PET and MRI imaging. Subjects with MS will&#xD;
      undergo follow-up brain [(11)C]PBR28 PET and MRI at approximately 4-month interval. Subjects&#xD;
      will undergo clinical examination at each PET imaging time point to assess clinical measures&#xD;
      of disability and impairment. Up to an equal number of age-matched healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      undergo screening TSPO genotype analysis by PCR. Up to 16 healthy volunteers with confirmed&#xD;
      high- or mixed- affinity binding genotype (HL or HH genotype)undergo test retest brain&#xD;
      [(11)C]PBR28 PET studies to determine the reproducibility of [(11)C]PBR28 PET in a healthy&#xD;
      population compared to MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks to test PBR expression measured by [(11)C]PBR28 PET imaging as a marker of&#xD;
      neuroinflammation in patients with MS. Primary outcome measures include 1) correlation&#xD;
      between increased PBR expression and gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI, and 2) correlation&#xD;
      between increased PBR expression and previously and/or persistently gadolinium-enhancing&#xD;
      lesions on MRI, 3) PBR expression in subjects with multiple sclerosis compared to that in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
