    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to participate in a four day research study of the immune system&#xD;
      effects and safety of short-term acute dosing of Cold-fX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of acute dosing of Cold-fX for 3 days on&#xD;
      the immune system compared to a placebo (dummy pill). Safety of the acute dosing will be&#xD;
      determined through various blood tests carried out during the study.&#xD;

      Eligible volunteers from Hackensack University Medical Centre will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the treatment or placebo group with equal numbers in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will consist of taking three capsules of CVT-E002 (600mg) or placebo three&#xD;
      times daily on Day 1, two capsules of CVT-E002 (400mg) or placebo three times daily on Day 2&#xD;
      and one capsule of CVT-E002 (200mg) or placebo three times daily on Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fasting blood sample will be collected on all 4 days of study participation. Immunological&#xD;
      assays and blood chemisty safety tests will be performed on the samples. Serum samples will&#xD;
      also be collected and stored until futher analysis for various cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events experienced during this study will be documented.&#xD;
