      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of an insulin-sensitizer&#xD;
      (Actos) added to a standard Pegasys/Copegus combination therapy of chronic hepatitis C in&#xD;
      patients who have previously failed a pegylated-interferon-alpha / ribavirin combination&#xD;
      without the insulin sensitizer. The primary endpoint is the initial virological response&#xD;
      (level of HCV RNA in serum) as evaluated after 12 weeks of triple therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance and diabetes are major disease modifiers in chronic hepatitis C, as they&#xD;
      increase liver fibrogenesis and reduce the rate of response to antivirals. Regarding the&#xD;
      latter, a previous study showed that a sustained virological response (SVR) occurred in about&#xD;
      one third of patients with genotype 1 and insulin resistance (measured as homeostasis&#xD;
      assessment of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR &gt; 2) vs. two thirds of genotype 1 patients without&#xD;
      insulin resistance. These findings were independently confirmed by other studies and extended&#xD;
      to non-responders with genotypes 2, 3 and 4. Thus, we suggested that insulin resistance&#xD;
      should be corrected in patients with chronic hepatitis C not responding to currently&#xD;
      available antiviral treatment, in order to improve response to retreatment. The modalities of&#xD;
      this intervention, however, have not been established. In addition, the optimal HOMA-IR score&#xD;
      to be attained has not been identified. To assess this point, we planned a prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of the insulin-sensitizer&#xD;
      pioglitazone (ActosTM, Takeda Pharma AG, Lachen, Switzerland) 15 mg QD, added to the&#xD;
      pegylated interferon-α2a (PEG-IFN-α2a) (PegasysTM, Roche Pharma Schweiz AG, Reinach,&#xD;
      Switzerland) 180 μg QW/ribavirin (CopegusTM, Roche) 1000-1200 mg QD combination therapy in&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C patients who had previously failed to respond (i.e. had detectable serum&#xD;
      HCV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy) to a pegylated interferon-α/ribavirin combination without&#xD;
      the insulin-sensitizer. All patients had a baseline HOMA-IR score &gt;2 as additional inclusion&#xD;
      criterion, because this was the threshold discriminating responders from non-responders in&#xD;
      previous works. Diabetic patients were excluded.&#xD;
