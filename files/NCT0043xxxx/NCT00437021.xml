  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational smallpox vaccine, called&#xD;
      IMVAMUNE®, with respect to safety and immune (body's defense system) response. Participants&#xD;
      will include healthy adults, age 18 or older born after 1971, who have not had smallpox&#xD;
      vaccine before. Volunteers were originally assigned to 1 of 5 groups. In July 2007, a hold&#xD;
      was placed on the Dryvax® groups and the study was modified. Volunteers, numbering 197, will&#xD;
      be assigned by chance to one of 3 groups to be vaccinated twice with IMVAMUNE® vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo (inactive substance) in Groups A and B, or to receive a single vaccination with&#xD;
      IMVAMUNE® or placebo in Group F. Volunteers will complete a memory aid (diary) for 15 days&#xD;
      following vaccination. Blood samples will be collected. Volunteers may participate for up to&#xD;
      425 days.&#xD;

      The study will evaluate the IMVAMUNE® smallpox vaccine with respect to safety and&#xD;
      optimization of immune responses by different vaccination regimens in vaccinia-naïve adults.&#xD;
      Study subjects must be age 18 and older and born after 1971. Originally, 215 subjects were&#xD;
      planned to be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups to be immunized twice with IMVAMUNE® vaccine&#xD;
      or placebo subcutaneously in Groups A and B, or Dryvax® or placebo by scarification in Group&#xD;
      C or both IMVAMUNE® and Dryvax® or 2 placebos in Groups D and Group E. In July, 2007,&#xD;
      enrollment was halted at the request of Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).&#xD;
      At that time, enrollment included zero subjects in Group A, 2 subjects in Group B, 8 subjects&#xD;
      in Group C, 6 subjects in Group D, and 4 subjects in Group E. CBER placed an official hold on&#xD;
      the enrollment into the Groups that would administer Dryvax®, i.e., Groups C, D and E.&#xD;
      Subjects previously enrolled into Groups C, D, and E will be followed according to the&#xD;
      protocol. The protocol has been modified as follows. One hundred and ninety-five subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups to be immunized twice with IMVAMUNE® vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo subcutaneously in Groups A and B, or to receive a single immunization with IMVAMUNE®&#xD;
      or placebo subcutaneously in Group F. (NOTE: A total of 197 subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to Groups A, B, and F as 2 subjects were previously enrolled in Group B.) Group A&#xD;
      will receive IMVAMUNE® vaccine or placebo on Days 0 and 7. Group B will receive IMVAMUNE®&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo on Days 0 and 28. Group F will receive a single dose of IMVAMUNE® at Day&#xD;
      0. All subjects will complete a memory aid for 15 days following each vaccination. Groups C,&#xD;
      D, and E will have the appropriate reactogenicity information collected until the vaccination&#xD;
      lesion, if present is well dried. Adverse events will be collected for 28 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination. Specimens will be collected for immunologic assays at the noted clinic visits,&#xD;
      as well as 1 year post last vaccination. Serious adverse events will be collected throughout&#xD;
      the study period. The primary safety objective is to evaluate the safety of IMVAMUNE® given&#xD;
      as a single dose, IMVAMUNE® given in a 2 dose prime-boost regimen at Day 0 and 7 or Day 0 and&#xD;
      28, IMVAMUNE® followed by a boost with Dryvax®, and IMVAMUNE® given simultaneously with&#xD;
      Dryvax®. The primary immunogenicity objective is to determine if the Geometric Mean Titer&#xD;
      (GMT) of neutralizing antibody [using Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) as the target antigen]&#xD;
      among subjects receiving a regimen of 2 doses of IMVAMUNE® (1×10^8, Days 0 and 7, Group A) is&#xD;
      non-inferior to that among subjects receiving 2 doses of IMVAMUNE® (1×10^8, Days 0 and 28,&#xD;
      Group B) at Day 14 following the 2nd dose. The secondary immunogenicity objective is to&#xD;
      determine if the GMT, as assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (using MVA as&#xD;
      the target antigen), among subjects receiving a regimen of 2 doses of IMVAMUNE® (1×10^8, Days&#xD;
      0 and 7, Group A) is non-inferior to that among subjects receiving 2 doses of IMVAMUNE®&#xD;
      (1×10^8, Days 0 and 28, Group B) at Day 14 following the 2nd dose. The tertiary&#xD;
      immunogenicity objective is to characterize the kinetics, magnitude, and duration of cellular&#xD;
      and humoral immune responses to IMVAMUNE® alone or IMVAMUNE® as a prime followed by a boost&#xD;
      with IMVAMUNE® or Dryvax®, or Dryvax® alone.&#xD;
