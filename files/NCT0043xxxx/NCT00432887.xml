  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project contains experimental studies of the effects of the drug caffeine on glucose&#xD;
      regulation in adults who have Type 2 diabetes. In our experiments, we are testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that moderate amounts of caffeine exaggerate the abnormal increases in glucose and&#xD;
      insulin observed after meals in patients with type 2 diabetes. On separate study days&#xD;
      subjects receive standard meals after taking capsules containing either caffeine or an&#xD;
      inactive placebo. We measure levels of glucose, insulin, and other chemicals in blood samples&#xD;
      drawn over the next 3 hours. In a separate study, we use continuous glucose monitoring to&#xD;
      measure glucose levels during everyday activities on days when subjects receive caffeine or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies do not involve clinical treatment or disease management. However, we hope to&#xD;
      learn whether a very popular drug impairs the clinical management of a common disease.&#xD;

      Pilot results suggest that caffeine, the most commonly used drug in the world, may interfere&#xD;
      with postprandial glucose metabolism by increasing insulin resistance and/or by stimulating&#xD;
      hepatic glucose production. This effect could have serious clinical implications for coffee&#xD;
      drinkers who have type 2 diabetes. Early results suggest caffeine exaggerates the&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia present in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental (non-treatment) studies in this project include double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled cross-over laboratory tests of glucose tolerance in groups of type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients and prediabetic volunteers who are coffee drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lab studies test the hypothesis that caffeine (vs. placebo) increases postprandial&#xD;
      insulin responses and results in a potentiation of glucose responses in the type 2 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ambulatory study examines the effects of caffeine administration on glucose levels during&#xD;
      everyday activities in the natural environment. This study uses a double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled cross-over design. Ambulatory glucose data are collected with a MiniMed&#xD;
      CGMS sensor and recorder worn for 72 hours. Caffeine and placebo are administered on separate&#xD;
      days. Average glucose levels and glucose responses to meals are compared across treatment&#xD;
      days within subjects.&#xD;
