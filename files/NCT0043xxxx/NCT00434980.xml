  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of a new family-based intervention for&#xD;
      schizophrenia. It is designed to help clients diagnosed with schizophrenia to overcome the&#xD;
      devastating effects of neurocognitive deficits on everyday functioning (Family-Directed&#xD;
      Cognitive Adaptation, FCA). Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are known to contribute to&#xD;
      devastating functional impairments and caregiver burden, as clients rely on caregivers for&#xD;
      help with basic living needs, such as personal hygiene, time management, social skills, and&#xD;
      progress towards vocational and educational goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will 1) Develop a manualized, family treatment program designed to improve&#xD;
      adaptive functioning of patients with schizophrenia, and 2) Conduct a pilot feasibility study&#xD;
      to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention, and to collect&#xD;
      preliminary outcome data. This will lay the foundation for a controlled trial of the efficacy&#xD;
      of the intervention. We expect that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The FCA intervention will be well-received and well-tolerated by clients and families,&#xD;
           as demonstrated by a high level of interest in the program, a low rate of attrition, and&#xD;
           a high rate of participant satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Client participants in the FCA intervention will show improvements in adaptive,&#xD;
           independent-living skills (e.g., personal hygiene and self-care, medication management,&#xD;
           time management, social skills, and responsibility for health maintenance) that will be&#xD;
           maintained three and six months following completion of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Family members participating in the FCA program will show reduced burden of care and&#xD;
           time spent caregiving, greater satisfaction in their relationship with the client,&#xD;
           improved self-efficacy in the caregiver role, and reduced psychological distress (e.g.,&#xD;
           depression, anxiety, and hopelessness) at the completion of the program and at three and&#xD;
           six-month follow-up interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open trial designed to evaluate the feasibility of a new family intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3- and 6-months following&#xD;
      completion of the the intervention. A total of 20 clients diagnosed with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and their families will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Massachusetts General Hospital Freedom Trail Clinic and the Beth Israel Deaconess&#xD;
      Medical Center (BIDMC) (including,the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and the BIDMC&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient departments). Clients and their families will participate in the&#xD;
      Family-Directed Cognitive Adaptation (FCA) intervention, including a functional assessment,&#xD;
      16 single-family sessions and 6 sessions of a monthly, multiple-family group. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted by a clinical evaluator (who is not directly involved in the&#xD;
      treatment) at the end of the individual-family treatment and at about 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      following completion of treatment on all clients and relatives on a variety of outcome&#xD;
      measures specified below (timing of assessments may occasionally be delayed by about 1-4&#xD;
      weeks in order to accommodate the schedules of clients and families). Sessions will be&#xD;
      audiotaped for use in the development of an instrument for measuring therapist fidelity to&#xD;
      the treatment model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FCA program is designed to teach clients and families about neurocognitive deficits&#xD;
      associated with schizophrenia, recommend specific compensatory strategies and positive&#xD;
      behavioral supports for managing these deficits, and teach families to help the client to&#xD;
      implement these strategies in order to improve adaptive living skills. The FCA program will&#xD;
      begin with a comprehensive cognitive and functional assessment of the client and the home&#xD;
      environment in order to identify specific functional targets for the intervention. This will&#xD;
      include: 1) a neuropsychological assessment of attention, processing speed, memory and&#xD;
      executive functioning; 2) an assessment of independent living skills (e.g., time management,&#xD;
      grooming, self-care); and 3) a home assessment to identify barriers to adaptive functioning&#xD;
      in the client's home environment. Specific measures are described below and attached in the&#xD;
      Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the cognitive and functional assessments, clients and their relatives will receive&#xD;
      16 individual-family sessions (14 weekly sessions and 2 bi-weekly sessions-However, timing of&#xD;
      sessions may vary a bit to accommodate schedules of participants. We will aim to complete the&#xD;
      counseling sessions within 18-22 weeks), and 6 sessions of a monthly, multifamily group (3-4&#xD;
      sessions will be concurrent with individual sessions, and 2-3 sessions will serve as&#xD;
      maintenance groups following the completion of the main, individual-family intervention). The&#xD;
      individual sessions in the FCA program will include: 1) general psychoeducation about illness&#xD;
      symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia (about 4 sessions), 2) a&#xD;
      feedback session presenting the results of the cognitive and functional assessment, and&#xD;
      identification of functional targets for the intervention, and 3) completion of 2-3 modules&#xD;
      targeting specific deficits in adaptive functioning that were identified during the&#xD;
      evaluation. Most sessions will be conducted at the clinic where the client receives&#xD;
      psychiatric treatment, but 3-4 home visits will also be conducted to facilitate modification&#xD;
      of the home environment and generalization of compensatory skills. Sessions will include the&#xD;
      client and at least one family member who lives with the client. The principal investigator&#xD;
      will serve as a clinician for this program along with a co-leader, and they will serve as&#xD;
      members of the client's clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to Be Recorded (Measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients and participating relatives will be assessed by a clinical evaluator (who is not&#xD;
      directly involved in the treatment) via structured interviews and self-report instruments at&#xD;
      four time points, including baseline, completion of the individual-family intervention, and&#xD;
      at about 3 and 6 months following completion of the intervention. (Timing of assessments may&#xD;
      vary a bit to accommodate schedules of participants. Therefore, follow-up one will take place&#xD;
      within 2 weeks after ending the 16 session program, follow-up two will take place 12-14&#xD;
      weeks, and follow-up three will take place between 12-14 weeks after the third follow-up.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Client measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures will include an assessment of psychiatric diagnosis (SCID, chart review,&#xD;
      and collateral information gathered from the client's treating clinician and relatives) and&#xD;
      general demographic information. Clients will also undergo a neuropsychological evaluation at&#xD;
      baseline. This evaluation will consist of the MATRICS Provisional Consensus Cognitive Battery&#xD;
      Phase II. A brief selection of measures from this battery will be repeated at the&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment. Detailed descriptions of measures and copies of measures are&#xD;
      included in the Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments at all time points (baseline, post-intervention, 3- and 6-month follow-up) will&#xD;
      include measures of symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Scale for the Assessment of&#xD;
      Negative Symptoms, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), adaptive living skills and&#xD;
      functioning (Social Adaptive Functions Scale, Independent Living Skills Survey, Multnomah&#xD;
      Community Ability Scale, The Independent Living and Self-Care Skills Checklist, and the&#xD;
      Global Assessment of Functioning), behaviors related to cognitive functioning (Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression of Cognition in Schizophrenia, Frontal Lobe Personality Scale-Patient&#xD;
      Version), and the degree to which the patient perceives their relatives as critical of them&#xD;
      (Interpersonal Affectivity Scale). Furthermore, chart reviews will be conducted to record any&#xD;
      inpatient hospitalizations that occur during the study period and number of days spent in the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family member measures. Baseline measures will include general demographic information (age,&#xD;
      ethnicity, level of education, etc). All assessments will include measures of negative&#xD;
      attitudes towards the client (Patient Rejection Scale, Interpersonal Affectivity Scale),&#xD;
      perceived burden (Burden Assessment Scale), time spent in caregiving activities and&#xD;
      caregiving expenses (Family Resources Interview), knowledge about schizophrenia and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits (Modified Schizophrenia Knowledge Scale), caregiving self-efficacy (Family&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Scale), positive aspects of caregiving (Gratifications and Benefits of&#xD;
      Caregiving Questionnaire) and psychological distress (Beck Anxiety and Depression Scales). In&#xD;
      addition, relatives will be asked to provide collateral information about the client's&#xD;
      adaptive living skills (using the &quot;Informant Version&quot; of the Independent Living Skills Survey&#xD;
      and the Independent Living and Self-Care Skills Checklist) and cognitive functioning&#xD;
      (Clinical Global Impression of Cognition in Schizophrenia, Frontal Lobe Personality&#xD;
      Scale-Family Version).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients and relatives will complete an adapted measure of satisfaction with the program&#xD;
      (Satisfaction Questionnaire) and will be asked to report which aspects of it they found most&#xD;
      helpful and whether they were able to practice skills introduced. Therapist time spent&#xD;
      delivering the intervention will be recorded on a weekly basis. Notes for each session will&#xD;
      be recorded on a &quot;Contact Summary&quot; form. Interest in the program will be measured by keeping&#xD;
      track of the number of referrals to the program compared to the number of families who&#xD;
      participate. In addition, we will document rates of attendance.&#xD;
