  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if PANCRECARB® MS-16 (pancrelipase) is&#xD;
      safe and effective in reducing steatorrhea (as measured by 72-hour stool fat determinations)&#xD;
      in children and adults with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic insufficiency (PI) is a common pathologic condition that occurs in approximately&#xD;
      90% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Pancreatic insufficiency is characterized by both&#xD;
      pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate insufficiencies. Consequently, maldigestion occurs and a&#xD;
      variety of essential nutrients are lost through the stools, especially fat and fat soluble&#xD;
      vitamins. As a result, patients often experience growth failure and malnutrition. Effective&#xD;
      correction of maldigestion is critical to the survival and well-being of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several strengths of PANCRECARB® (pancrelipase) (i.e., MS4, MS8, MS16) have been available&#xD;
      and used by patients with CF for more than a decade. The digestive enzymes in PANCRECARB®&#xD;
      (pancrelipase) act locally in the gastrointestinal tract. The active enzymes hydrolyze fats&#xD;
      into glycerol and fatty acids, proteins into peptides and amino acids, and starches into&#xD;
      dextrins and maltose. PANCRECARB® (pancrelipase) has the potential to promote increased&#xD;
      lipase activity with efficient fat digestion. Efficient fat digestion is important in CF&#xD;
      because it may lead to improved nutritional and pulmonary status and ultimately to improved&#xD;
      quality of life and enhanced survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PANCRECARB® MS-8 (pancrelipase) has been compared to enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes&#xD;
      without bicarbonate for its efficacy in reducing steatorrhea in patients with CF. Differences&#xD;
      in fat excretion, when subjects received PANCRECARB® MS-8 (pancrelipase) versus&#xD;
      enteric-coated enzymes without bicarbonate, were compared using linear modeling. Mean fat&#xD;
      excretion decreased significantly in subjects who received PANCRECARB® MS-8 (pancrelipase)&#xD;
      compared to enteric-coated enzymes without bicarbonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed in accordance with FDA 2006 guideline on exocrine pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency drug products. Assuming that the results of this study demonstrate that therapy&#xD;
      with PANCRECARB® MS-16 (pancrelipase) results in clinically and statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in fat absorption relative to placebo in subjects with CF and pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency, the study results will be part of a submission for marketing approval of&#xD;
      PANCRECARB® (pancrelipase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two treatment periods with 72-hour stool collections separated by a&#xD;
      washout period. Study subjects will be required to consume a diet high in fat content.&#xD;
