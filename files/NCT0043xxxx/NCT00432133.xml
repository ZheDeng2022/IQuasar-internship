  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to determine the mechanisms that underlie Physical Activity&#xD;
      behavior change. We have 2 primary objectives. One, to test the effectiveness of brief,&#xD;
      practical interventions to promote and maintain Physical Activity among individuals who are&#xD;
      referred to a treadmill stress test but do not present symptoms of cardiac disease. Two, to&#xD;
      test the potential individual and environmental mediators and moderators of this effect.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a dearth of information on the mechanisms, and potential moderators, of physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) intervention effectiveness. Understanding the mechanisms of PA change will aid&#xD;
      in successful intervention development while understanding moderators will allow a matching&#xD;
      of intervention components to individual needs of particular populations. To definitively&#xD;
      understand mechanisms and moderators of behavior change it is necessary to develop&#xD;
      theory-based interventions that include specific strategies that target proposed mechanisms&#xD;
      of change while monitoring the proposed mediating and moderating variables prior to and&#xD;
      following intervention. This proposal highlights the use of the Ecological Model of Physical&#xD;
      Activity (EMPA) as a theoretical guide to strategy development. The EMPA highlights the&#xD;
      necessity to address individual (biological &amp; psychosocial) and environmental variables&#xD;
      (e.g., PA resource accessibility) when developing and implementing interventions. Health care&#xD;
      patients who have been referred for a treadmill cardiovascular stress test-but do not present&#xD;
      abnormal ECG or chest pain during testing-will be will be stratified by diagnosis of low&#xD;
      heart rate recovery, a potential biological moderator of intervention effectiveness. To&#xD;
      detect the potential independent and combined effects of individual motivation and&#xD;
      environmental accessibility we will conduct a randomized 2X2 factorial trial to test proposed&#xD;
      mediators of effectiveness. Participants (n=500) will be randomized to an individual (I),&#xD;
      environmental (E) , combination (I+E), or matched contact nutrition control. All intervention&#xD;
      conditions will include a CD-ROM session, 3 tailored mail, and 3 tailored automated telephone&#xD;
      follow-ups over a 6-month period. We will assess the reach, effectiveness, clinician&#xD;
      adoption, and staff implementation of these interventions, individually, in combination, and&#xD;
      when compared to controls among an understudied and high need population-individuals who are&#xD;
      at an elevated risk, but have not yet suffered a serious cardiac event (approximately&#xD;
      3,000,000 individuals/year in the US). The results of this project will identify the causal,&#xD;
      and potentially additive, relationships of environmental and individual mediators of PA&#xD;
      change and allow the examination of potential biological moderators of effectiveness. Because&#xD;
      intervention typically effects decrease over time and studies do not address setting-related&#xD;
      issues necessary to ensure sustainability of delivery at the organizational level we will&#xD;
      determine the maintenance of intervention effects on causal mechanisms and PA, 6 &amp; 12 months&#xD;
      following intervention. The interventions will be developed for delivery within the regular&#xD;
      scope of treadmill stress testing by typical medical staff and cost of delivery will be&#xD;
      assessed for each intervention condition. This project uniquely utilizes methods that will&#xD;
      facilitate institutionalization of the intervention components following the successful&#xD;
      completion of the trial and potential adoption of the intervention in other health care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
