      This is a research study of an investigational product called Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).&#xD;
      The study is designed to establish the safety and potential benefit of MMF. MMF has proven&#xD;
      one of the most effective medications to date for SLE and associated nephritis. It also&#xD;
      appears to be active in polymyositis and dermatomyositis. This medication inhibits inosine&#xD;
      monophosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of guanosine nucleotides.&#xD;
      It blocks the type II isoform found in activated lymphocytes more potently than the type I&#xD;
      isoform inhibiting both T- and B-lymphocytes. In SSc, MMF has been tried after anti-thymocyte&#xD;
      globulin in one small open label study with efficacy with a significant improvement in skin&#xD;
      score. We will test the safety and efficacy of MMF in SSc. All study patients will receive&#xD;
      the study medication. The effect of the study medication will be examined in two subgroups of&#xD;
      patients: those with early or progressive skin disease (skin substudy) and those with muscle&#xD;
      disease (muscle substudy). The change in modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) and creatinine&#xD;
      phosphokinase (CK) for, respectively, the skin and muscle substudies at 6 months after&#xD;
      treatment will be compared to baseline values.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune/connective tissue disease with complex pathogenesis&#xD;
      involving immune system dysregulation, leading to fibrosis. Inflammatory and autoimmune&#xD;
      aspects of this disease overlap systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease shown clearly&#xD;
      to respond to MMF. Activated T-cells, the probable target of MMF in SLE, likely also play an&#xD;
      important role in SSc pathogenesis. Evidence for this includes the similarity of SSc skin&#xD;
      disease to chronic graft versus host disease, a disease in which T-cells play a critical&#xD;
      role. MMF has proven one of the most effective medications to date for SLE and associated&#xD;
      nephritis [1]. It also appears to be active in polymyositis and dermatomyositis, disease that&#xD;
      also show significant overlap with SSc [2]. Myositis can also be a feature of SSc, suggesting&#xD;
      that his disease manifestation might be particularly likely to respond to MMF. MMF inhibits&#xD;
      inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of guanosine&#xD;
      nucleotides. It blocks the type II isoform found in activated lymphocytes more potently than&#xD;
      the type I isoform inhibiting both T- and B-lymphocytes [3]. In SSc, mycophenolate has been&#xD;
      tried after anti-thymocyte globulin in one small open label study with efficacy with a&#xD;
      significant improvement in skin score [4]. However, MMF has not been tried alone inSSc and&#xD;
      has not been tried in muscle disease associated with SSc. In this study, we will test the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of MMF in SSc. In this study all study patients will receive the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
