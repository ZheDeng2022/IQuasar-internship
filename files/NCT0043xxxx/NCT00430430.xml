  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low and very low carbohydrate diets, such as the Atkins' Diet, have recently gained attention&#xD;
      for their potential health benefits from weight loss and have gained some scientific support&#xD;
      from a growing number of studies. Benefits have been noted in relation to raised &quot;good&quot;&#xD;
      cholesterol, lower &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol and triglycerides. Other studies have shown an advantage&#xD;
      in substituting vegetable fat for carbohydrate in insulin resistant individuals and in some&#xD;
      instances in type 2 diabetes where improvements were seen in &quot;good&quot; cholesterol and blood&#xD;
      sugars. At the same time, our research have been exploring diets containing less processed&#xD;
      carbohydrates and other components which in combination (portfolio diet) have a similar&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering effect to drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we wish to determine whether our cholesterol-lowering components (portfolio diet)&#xD;
      should be incorporated into lower carbohydrate diets especially to preserve &quot;good&quot;&#xD;
      cholesterol and lower &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol for decreasing the risk of heart disease.&#xD;

      All subjects will undergo two parallel 2-phase treatments. On one treatment, subjects will be&#xD;
      placed on a low fat diet for one month (control run-in diet) and then for the second month&#xD;
      will continue on the low- fat diet (i.e. low-MUFA) with the addition of the portfolio&#xD;
      components. The order of these two phases will not be randomized. The other treatment will be&#xD;
      similar to the above except that the background diet of the portfolio phase will be high in&#xD;
      monounsaturated fat (high-MUFA). Subjects will be allocated randomly to either treatment.&#xD;
      Diets will be metabolically controlled and all food will be provided at weekly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come after a 12h overnight fast to the Risk Factor Modification Center at St.&#xD;
      Michael's Hospital or the Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Toronto&#xD;
      immediately prior to commencement of each treatment phase and at weekly intervals during the&#xD;
      course of each study period. Prior to the start of the study, subjects will be instructed on&#xD;
      details of the study diet protocol. They will also be asked to maintain a constant level of&#xD;
      physical activity throughout the course of the study. At all visits, body weight (in kg) will&#xD;
      be obtained in indoor clothing, without shoes, and blood pressure will be taken twice in the&#xD;
      dominant arm after subjects have been seated for at least 20 minutes. Height (in cm) will be&#xD;
      recorded at the first visit. Throughout the study period, subjects will maintain the diet&#xD;
      prescribed on their initial visit. At every other visit of each treatment phase, subjects&#xD;
      will provide a fasting blood sample. The kinetic tests of lipoprotein metabolism will be&#xD;
      performed during the 4th and 8th week of the study. At baseline and during the last week of&#xD;
      each study phase, 24h urine collection and 12h breath hydrogen collections will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of apolipoprotein in vivo kinetics will be carried out using a&#xD;
      primed-constant infusion of [D3]L-leucine. This protocol allows for the determination of the&#xD;
      kinetics of all apolipoproteins simultaneously. Kinetics studies will be conducted in the&#xD;
      constantly fed state where participants receive 1/30th of their daily energy requirements&#xD;
      every half-hour for the whole duration of the test (15 hours). These methods are described in&#xD;
      detail in previous publications from our group. Briefly, at 7am on the morning of the study,&#xD;
      after a 12-hour overnight fast, participants will be admitted to the Toronto General Hospital&#xD;
      Clinical Investigation Unit and two intravenous catheters (IV's) will be inserted, one into&#xD;
      each forearm vein. One IV will be for infusion of the stable isotope described below and one&#xD;
      for withdrawal of blood samples. After achieving a steady state (3hrs after the small&#xD;
      half-hourly meals), subjects will first receive a bolus injection of 10 µmol/kg of body&#xD;
      weight of [D3]L-leucine ([D3]L-leucine 98%, C/D/N Isotopes) dissolved in physiological saline&#xD;
      (0.9% NaCl) and then a constant infusion of 10 µmol/kg/h of [D3]L-leucine for 12 hours via an&#xD;
      intravenous line inserted into a left forearm vein. Blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      regular intervals (0, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12hrs). All lipoprotein subfractions will&#xD;
      be separated by sequential ultracentrifugation and frozen thereafter at -80oC until they are&#xD;
      processed for analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  men and postmenopausal women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index &gt; 18.5 kg/m2 and &lt; 40 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration &gt; 2.5 mmol/l and &lt; 6.0 mmol/l at&#xD;
             recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting plasma LDL cholesterol concentration &gt; 3.4 mmol/l at recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting plasma HDL cholesterol concentration &lt; 1.0 mmol/l at recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  living within a 40 km radius of St. Michael's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal women will be excluded due to the fluctuation of blood lipids during the&#xD;
             menstrual cycle and the difficulty of synchronising the timing of three one month&#xD;
             studies with the same point in the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking cholesterol medications at the start of the study. However, with their&#xD;
             physician's approval those who wish to join but are already taking&#xD;
             cholesterol-lowering medications (or cholesterol lowering natural health products) may&#xD;
             join the study providing the medications (or natural health products) are stopped for&#xD;
             at least 2 weeks before starting the study and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure will be excluded. The cut off for&#xD;
             raised blood pressure has been taken as greater than 140/90mmHg. Patients with&#xD;
             systolic blood pressure between 140-150mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between&#xD;
             90-95mmHg may be accepted, since we have found that on the diet their blood pressures&#xD;
             tend to be lowered into the acceptable range. For patients in the above normal range&#xD;
             (as above), a letter will be required from the physician responsible for their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Changing the type or dose of their drug treatment during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those judged as having a likelihood of being non-compliant with instructions for&#xD;
             whatever reason. Those with low compliance to lipid-lowering therapy will not be&#xD;
             selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Food allergies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of diabetes, renal liver disease or gastrointestinal disease.&#xD;
             Patients will be excluded if they have gross xanthoma or advanced premature&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease since this group may include hyperabsorbers of plant sterols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with major cardiovascular event (stroke or myocardial infarction), with&#xD;
             secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia (or untreated hypothyroidism), with&#xD;
             uncontrolled blood pressure, major disability or disorder such as liver disease, renal&#xD;
             failure or with major surgery &lt; 6 months prior to randomization. Individuals&#xD;
             predisposed to hemorrhagic stroke (on the basis of untreated raised blood pressure)&#xD;
             will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antibiotic use within the last three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smokers or have significant alcohol intake (&gt;1 drink/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disallowed medications will be cholesterol lowering drugs which if prescribed by&#xD;
             patients' physicians while on the study will be a reason for discontinuation from the&#xD;
             study. Introduction of cholesterol lowering natural health products during the study&#xD;
             will also be a reason for withdrawing a participant from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  individuals with acute (&lt;6 weeks) or chronic (&gt;6 weeks) infections, either bacterial&#xD;
             or viral, or individuals suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases&#xD;
