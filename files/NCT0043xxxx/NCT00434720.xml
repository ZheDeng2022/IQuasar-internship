      The GlideScope video laryngoscope (Verathon) is an intubating device that uses a&#xD;
      high-resolution camera embedded into a plastic laryngoscope blade. An LED provides&#xD;
      illumination. The GlideScope often provides a good laryngoscopic view, but passing the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords is sometimes difficult. Because of the 60&#xD;
      degree anterior curvature of the GlideScope's blade, ETT's must have stylets inserted so that&#xD;
      the ETT distal tip can be positioned anteriorly. Various authors have recommended different&#xD;
      angles of the ETT to optimally place it into the trachea. Previous study demonstrated that 90&#xD;
      degree sharp bend was both faster and subjectively easier in a heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      intubators. With the introduction of a rigid GlideScope Specific Stylet by the manufacturer,&#xD;
      the question arises as to the the best configuration of stylet for the ETT. Therefore, this&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, single-blinded trial is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between the GlideScope Specific&#xD;
      Stylet and the standard malleable stylet.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the optimum angle of curvature of an endotracheal tube when used with a&#xD;
      GlideScope in order to intubate in the most efficient fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups: A) 90º curvature, malleable stylet B) shallow curvature, rigid GlideScope Specific&#xD;
      Stylet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the primary outcome (time to&#xD;
      intubation). i.e. we hypothesize that the time to intubate is not related to the shape of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube. The control group will be arbitrarily assigned to the 90º group that was&#xD;
      the preferred option in a previous trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Time to intubation (seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained by one of the study investigators, and a copy will&#xD;
      be given to each participant. Written informed consent will also be obtained from the&#xD;
      operator of the GlideScope. After consent, randomization will occur by selecting the next&#xD;
      consecutive envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three distinct anesthesia providers involved in the conduct of this study, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;operator&quot; - person performing the intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;timer&quot; - person timing the outcome (one of the co-investigators)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;shaper&quot; - person who ensures that the angle and stylet of the tube matches the group to&#xD;
           which the patient was allocated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the person intubating must be blind up until the time at which the tube is to be&#xD;
      used, the unopened envelope will be taken to a third anesthesia provider, who will prepare&#xD;
      the ETT with stylet in an area that is not visible to the person performing the intubation or&#xD;
      to the person timing the intubation. The person performing the intubation will specify what&#xD;
      size of tube they wish to use. This will most commonly be 7.5 mm internal diameter (ID) for a&#xD;
      female and 8.0 ID for males, but the operator is free to use whatever size they feel is&#xD;
      appropriate. The tube size selection will take place before unblinding so the group&#xD;
      allocation cannot affect the decision of tube size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Group A&quot; ETT's will be shaped with the aid of a standard malleable stylet (Rusch 14 Fr) that&#xD;
      has been lubricated with single-use water-soluble lubricant. &quot;Group B&quot; ETT's will be&#xD;
      instrumented with the GlideScope Specific Stylet, with identical lubricant. The prepared tube&#xD;
      will then be concealed under a standard green OR towel and brought to the operating room&#xD;
      (OR). This tube will be placed close to the patient's head so that it is readily accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the OR, the GlideScope will be turned on at least 60s before use to prevent fogging. The&#xD;
      patient will be cared for in the usual fashion with respect to monitoring and induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia. Muscle relaxation will be used, and the agent used is at the discretion&#xD;
      of the operator. After induction of anesthesia, bag-mask ventilation will be used in the&#xD;
      usual fashion until the operator decides to proceed to laryngoscopy with the GlideScope. The&#xD;
      operator will remain blinded to the group allocation until after the laryngoscopic view has&#xD;
      been obtained with the GlideScope, where upon he will be handed the endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timer (who cannot see the tube under the green towel) will watch the operator until the&#xD;
      GlideScope is in the patient's mouth, start the timer, and then turn 180º to face the&#xD;
      anesthetic monitor. The timer will not be able to see the ETT, stylet, or curvature because&#xD;
      he will be facing the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing will continue until end-tidal CO2 of at least 30 mmHg is seen on the anesthesia&#xD;
      monitor, at which point the data collection form will be filled out, and the study protocol&#xD;
      will be finished. (The time to intubation will be recorded to the nearest tenth of a second.)&#xD;
      If the operator fails to intubate within 3 attempts or 150 seconds, the intubation will be&#xD;
      noted as a failure, and the ultimately successful means of securing the airway will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If oxygen desaturation (as recorded by pulse oximetry) below 95% occurs, then the patient&#xD;
      will be ventilated in the usual fashion to ensure oxygenation, and re-attempting intubation&#xD;
      using the GlideScope may proceed, but the timing will continue, and the same limits to&#xD;
      successful intubation (within 3 attempts or total of 150s) will apply. Between attempts, the&#xD;
      tube may be re-shaped by the operator if a malleable stylet is used and either the original&#xD;
      curvature has been lost or the operator feels that another curvature would be preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the oxygen saturation falls below 90% occurs at any point, the protocol will stop&#xD;
      immediately, and management will proceed in the normal fashion at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist, which could involve immediate intubation using the GlideScope or&#xD;
      other intubation device, or ventilation using a mask or laryngeal mask airway. If, at any&#xD;
      time, the attending anesthesiologist believes there is any risk to the patient because of the&#xD;
      study protocol, the protocol will be terminated and normal anesthetic care will continue.&#xD;
