  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbidly obese individuals are at high risk for potentially life threatening blood clots&#xD;
      around the time of abdominal surgical procedures. Fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra) is an FDA-&#xD;
      approved medication used in the prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at the time of&#xD;
      orthopedic or abdominal surgery, as well as for the treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      (PE). As with many medications, therapeutic dosages have not been fully investigated for the&#xD;
      morbidly obese population. Our goal is to study the therapeutic blood levels, after 2&#xD;
      different dosages of the medication are given to morbidly obese volunteers. We will recruit&#xD;
      21 morbidly obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35) individuals who are in the evaluation process&#xD;
      for bariatric surgery. They will be divided into 7 groups: 3 participants with BMI 35 - 39.9,&#xD;
      3 with a BMI of 40 - 49.9, 3 with a BMI of 50 - 59.9, 3 with a BMI &gt; 60, 3 with a weight of&#xD;
      100 - 149 KG, 3 with a weight of 150 - 199 KG and 3 with a weight of 200 - 249 KG.&#xD;
      Participants will be administered two different doses of the medication with a 2-week&#xD;
      interval in between, then blood will be drawn in various intervals throughout the next 48&#xD;
      hours to see which dose provides the best therapeutic levels. Participants will be monitored&#xD;
      closely for any side effects or complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery carries a mortality rate of 0.5-1%, with PE found to be the most frequent&#xD;
      postoperative complications and causes of death. Currently employed prophylactic methods&#xD;
      include unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins in combination with mechanical calf&#xD;
      compression. However, despite the implementation of these standard measures, the reported&#xD;
      incidence of fatal PE has ranged from 0.2 to 0.64% accounting for between 30 to 50% of deaths&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a reported 40,000 bariatric surgical procedures in 2001, and the numbers growing rapidly&#xD;
      every year, there is clearly a need for a more effective prophylaxis from DVT and PE. The&#xD;
      pentasaccharide fondaparinux is an anti-thrombotic agent used in the prophylaxis of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism after orthopedic or abdominal surgery. Its clinical value has been&#xD;
      established in multiple randomized double blind studies in high-risk major orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      where it showed a 55% greater reduction in DVT episodes compared to enoxaparin (Lovenox®)&#xD;
      Although fondaparinux has been administered in obese patients in clinical studies for&#xD;
      prevention of venous thromboembolism after orthopedic surgery and preliminary results show no&#xD;
      influence of ABW on the clinical outcome, the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug in the&#xD;
      morbidly obese have not been investigated. Previously published fondaparinux pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies excluded patients whose body weight was more than 30% of ideal, with the heaviest&#xD;
      group being 77.2+/-10.1 Kg and with a BMI of 25.7+/2.6 Kg/m2. Similar studies on low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparins, such as enoxaparin and dalteparin, showed predictable anti-Xa&#xD;
      activity with weight-based dosing in the morbidly obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been no study on the pharmacokinetics of this drug in the morbidly obese (BMI&gt;35&#xD;
      Kg/m2). It is clinically imperative to have a predictable anti-Xa level and a predictable DVT&#xD;
      prophylactic effect in the morbidly obese whose body weight may vary by as much as 3 to 4&#xD;
      fold higher compared to the average 70 Kg adult. This has become a critical issue in view of&#xD;
      the large number of bariatric surgical operations being undertaken, which has increased 150%&#xD;
      in the last two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of fondaparinux in&#xD;
      morbidly obese volunteers. This is a prospective crossover, randomized study with a 2-week&#xD;
      washout period comparing two dosing regimens of fondaparinux in morbidly obese volunteers.&#xD;
