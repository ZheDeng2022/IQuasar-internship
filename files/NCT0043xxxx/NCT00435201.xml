    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism of autoantibody production during&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. 10-50% of individuals with HCV have symptoms of&#xD;
      mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC). By studying the B cells from HCV-infected individuals with and&#xD;
      without MC, as well as from healthy controls, we hope to gain insight into the mechanisms of&#xD;
      autoantibody production and develop new strategies for treatment of MC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 170 million people worldwide. About 10-50% of&#xD;
      persons with HCV have MC. MC is associated with the development of autoimmune symptoms and B&#xD;
      cell proliferative disorders. We plan to study B cells from individuals chronically infected&#xD;
      with HCV as well as from healthy controls. We sort B cells into different types, and we&#xD;
      analyze these types for differential levels of gene expression. We are testing the hypothesis&#xD;
      that certain types of B cells from subjects with MC have increased expression of genes that&#xD;
      allow for increased cell survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People interested in participating in this study will have a complete history and general&#xD;
      medical examinations before beginning the study. Following the screening, you will have a&#xD;
      procedure called leukapheresis, in which white blood cells are removed, but your own red&#xD;
      blood cells are returned. The procedure takes approximately 3 hours and is similar to blood&#xD;
      donation. The leukapheresis is done during a same day admission to the hospital by an outside&#xD;
      blood collection company with trained nurses and certified equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some aspects of this study are experimental which means the fluid and cells collected will be&#xD;
      studied and analyzed to determine more precisely how your body's immune system is responding&#xD;
      to the virus. These tests are experimental in that they are not part of the usual routine&#xD;
      care of patients.&#xD;
