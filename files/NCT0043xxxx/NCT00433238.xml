      The study is designed to answer the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the acceptability of mental health screening and of the instruments used in a&#xD;
           sample of community living Chinese seniors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine rates of mental health service utilization in individuals identified at&#xD;
           screening as having psychological disturbance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if identifying mental illness and informing participants of screening results&#xD;
           and with treatment alternatives alters help-seeking pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This community sample of Chinese seniors will show a higher prevalence of psychological&#xD;
           disturbance than their counterparts in the general population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Emotional well-being will be positively correlated with individuals' physical health and&#xD;
           social support network.&#xD;

      A convenience sample will be drawn from 6 Congregate Dining (CD) groups in the Chinese&#xD;
      community. There are six groups of CD programs run by Yee Hong Centre for Geriatric Care run&#xD;
      at different locations in the Greater Toronto Area. The screening will be offered on site at&#xD;
      regular CD meetings to participants who have given informed, written consent. All&#xD;
      participants will attend a private post-screening interview. Those who score above the&#xD;
      threshold for depression and/or cognitive impairment, and who have not previously been&#xD;
      diagnosed or treated for these conditions, will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an&#xD;
      intervention group and a usual care group. Participants in the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive their screening results at the post-screening interviews and will also be provided&#xD;
      with suggestions for possible follow-up. They will be given the option of receiving further&#xD;
      psychiatric assessment at the Wellness Centre, or seeking care with their family physician&#xD;
      and assisted to obtain further care, if desired. Participants in the intervention group will&#xD;
      attend an appointment 3 months after receiving screening results and follow-up options during&#xD;
      which the rate of help seeking, rate of confirmed psychiatric diagnoses and types of&#xD;
      intervention received will be determined. Participants in the usual care group will not be&#xD;
      given screening results at the post-screening interview but will instead attend an&#xD;
      appointment 3 months post screening to receive their results and information about follow-up&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this research will: demonstrate whether community living Chinese elders are at&#xD;
      greater risk of psychiatric disorders and demonstrate the need for screening in older Chinese&#xD;
      adults living in the community; aid in the development of systematic and targeted&#xD;
      community-based screening and outreach to at-risk members of the target population; and help&#xD;
      determine if identification of mental health issues and education about treatment resources&#xD;
      has any effect on help-seeking for those conditions.&#xD;
