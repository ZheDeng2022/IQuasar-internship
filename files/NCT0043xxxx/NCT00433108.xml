    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial of two doses of mitoquinone&#xD;
      mesylate (MitoQ) and of placebo in patients with chronic Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that rapidly permeates the lipid bilayer and&#xD;
      accumulates within mitochondria in organs such as liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle. There&#xD;
      is strong evidence for increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage leading to&#xD;
      apoptosis via caspase activation. Several studies have shown that MitoQ protects cells from&#xD;
      apoptosis by acting as a caspase inhibitor and may be effective in reducing cell damage in&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that administration of MitoQ will lower raised ALT seen in patients with&#xD;
      chronic Hepatitis C compared with placebo. Approximately 36 patients who have been&#xD;
      unresponsive or not suitable for interferon-based therapy will be enrolled at one centre.&#xD;
      Treatment duration will be 28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a viral liver infection that contributes significantly to the burden of&#xD;
      chronic liver disease. It is currently estimated that over 170 million individuals (3% of the&#xD;
      world's population)are infected. In New Zealand, an estimated 25,000 people are living with&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and prevalence is predicted to increase by 50% over the&#xD;
      next 10 years. HCV is primarily spread by blood-to-blood contact. The single most important&#xD;
      risk factor for acquiring HCV is the use of injected recreational drugs, accounting for&#xD;
      approximately 80% of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike hepatitis B, no hepatitis C vaccine is currently available. In the absence of an&#xD;
      effective vaccine the current treatment of choice is interferon and ribavirin. However,&#xD;
      treatment of chronic HCV infection with interferon-alpha monotherapy does not achieve&#xD;
      sustained virologic response. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative treatment&#xD;
      strategies for patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to current antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this protocol is to compare two doses of a mitochondrial antioxidant treatment&#xD;
      (MitoQ) and placebo for the treatment of patients with raised liver enzymes due to HCV&#xD;
      infection. Approximately 36 eligible patients with chronic HCV infection will be randomised&#xD;
      to receive one of two doses of MitoQ or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment duration will be&#xD;
      28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;
