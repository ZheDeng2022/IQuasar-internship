    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if megestrol acetate can be used as an&#xD;
      appetite stimulant to improve weight gain in children with cancer and poor nutrition. The&#xD;
      study design is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Secondarily, we would&#xD;
      like to determine what effect any improvement in weight has on body composition by DEXA scan.&#xD;
      This includes whether the drug results in an increase in fat, fat-free mass, or both. If our&#xD;
      patients gain weight we would like to know if it improves their quality of life. Finally,&#xD;
      many children with cancer lose too much weight and require feeding to occur through a tube&#xD;
      put down their nose into their stomach (NG feeding). The tube can be painful to put down and&#xD;
      is uncomfortable when in. Some children may also require nutrition to be given into a vein&#xD;
      (Total Parenteral Nutrition or TPN). We are trying to see if we can prevent these procedures&#xD;
      from happening by having the subjects gain weight. This study will tell doctors if the drug&#xD;
      truly works (or does not work) in children who are underweight.&#xD;

      Overview of the study phases Prior to the randomization phase, we will draw some blood work&#xD;
      (1 teaspoon) with regular blood work to see if you/your child meet the final eligibility&#xD;
      requirements. If the results are within normal limits, we will proceed on to the&#xD;
      Randomization Phase. If the results are not within normal limits for your/your child's age,&#xD;
      then you/your child will not be able to proceed with the study and we will pass these test&#xD;
      results on to your regular oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Phase If you/your child agree to take part in this study you/your child will&#xD;
      have an equal chance of receiving one of two possible liquids: Megace (7.5 mg/kg/day taken&#xD;
      once in the morning) or the same amount of a placebo (a placebo is a substance that looks and&#xD;
      tastes exactly like the real medicine, however it is an inactive substance that contains no&#xD;
      drug). This assigning to the drug or the placebo is called randomization. Neither you nor&#xD;
      your physician can choose or know which treatment you are receiving. This &quot;blinding&quot; is&#xD;
      necessary to fairly test these drugs. In an emergency, your physician can immediately find&#xD;
      out which of the drugs/treatments you are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, you/your child will be given a supply of the drug or the placebo. Both the&#xD;
      drug and the placebo are a lemon-lime flavored liquid. There are no pills or tablets to take.&#xD;
      You/your child are to take the liquid by mouth in the amount prescribed once per day. You&#xD;
      will take the liquid every day for 90 days (3 months). The liquid is to be taken half an-hour&#xD;
      before breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment Information Collection Phase Before you/your child start taking the liquid, we&#xD;
      will collect some initial information. This will include taking your/your child's weight and&#xD;
      height. A dietitian will perform an assessment of you/your child's body composition using a&#xD;
      tool called a caliper. This will briefly pinch the skin at the back of your/your child's arm.&#xD;
      It will not hurt. The dietitian will also measure your/your child's upper arms using a tape&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research nurse will ask a series of questions called a Quality of Life assessment. This&#xD;
      will tell us about how you/your child feels before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, you/your child will have a scan called a DEXA (stands for Dual Energy X-Ray&#xD;
      Absorptiometry) scan done to assess your/your child's body composition. A DEXA scan does not&#xD;
      hurt but requires that you/your child lie still on the table while the scanner moves over&#xD;
      you/your child. Like all scans, there is some radiation exposure. However, the total amount&#xD;
      of radiation is very small (about half the radiation exposure of a normal chest xray). This&#xD;
      should not cause any problem for you/your child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also draw some additional blood (approximately 1 teaspoon) from your central line.&#xD;
      You/your child will not have extra pokes for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase You/your child will be followed closely by our team of doctors and dieticians&#xD;
      during the 90 days you/your child are on the study. Follow-up will occur when you are&#xD;
      normally scheduled to see your doctor. This can occur at either the Pediatric Oncology&#xD;
      outpatient clinics or when you are admitted to the BC Children's Hospital (Vancouver) or&#xD;
      Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton). You do not have to make special appointments for the&#xD;
      purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will watch your weight closely during the 3 months of the study. If you/your child lose an&#xD;
      additional 15% from your/your child's baseline (starting) weight we will stop you taking the&#xD;
      medication or placebo. You will then receive regular medical care. This may include starting&#xD;
      tube feeding or TPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also take additional blood work at least every 2 weeks during the 3 months. This can&#xD;
      be done through your/your child's central line at times when regular blood work is being&#xD;
      drawn. Once a month our research nurse will contact you by phone to see how things are going&#xD;
      and ask questions about possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Conclusion Phase At the end of the study we will again collect all the information as&#xD;
      we did in the Pre-treatment Information Collection Phase. This will include your/your child's&#xD;
      weight, height, caliper and arm measurements as well as asking the same quality of life&#xD;
      questions. You will then have a second DEXA scan done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 90 days you will be told whether you received the drug (Megace) or the inactive&#xD;
      substance (Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time commitment for you/your child to take part in this research should be minimal. Each&#xD;
      DEXA scan (you/your child are asked to complete 2 DEXA scans during the study) will take&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour. Each study nurse interview (3) should take approximately 10-15 minutes&#xD;
      each time. The quality of life questions will be asked three times and take approximately&#xD;
      5-10 minutes each time to complete.&#xD;
