  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cocaine administration leads to changes in brain function that persist long after the&#xD;
      acute withdrawal phase. The acoustic startle response (ASR) is a well characterized reflexive&#xD;
      response to a sudden acoustic stimulus. The ASR is mediated by a simple 3-synapse subcortical&#xD;
      circuit; it is modulated in part by brain areas and neurotransmitters associated with cocaine&#xD;
      administration. Our initial study and subsequent replication reveals a profound diminution of&#xD;
      the ASR in cocaine-dependent subjects after a brief period of abstinence. Our preliminary&#xD;
      findings indicate that first degree relatives of cocaine-dependent subjects also have reduced&#xD;
      startle compared to healthy controls. The findings of low ASR in rats and humans during&#xD;
      cocaine washout and low ASR in family members suggests there may be both a trait and state&#xD;
      component of the startle reductions we have reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central objectives of this proposal are to dissect this finding with regard to its&#xD;
      development and persistence in early and later phases of cocaine abstinence in humans; to&#xD;
      ascertain whether startle reduction and its potential normalization during later abstinence&#xD;
      is a predictor of clinical course in human subjects with cocaine dependence; and to examine&#xD;
      whether startle reduction is, at least in part, a vulnerability trait for the development of&#xD;
      cocaine dependence. This latter Aim will be carried out in humans by testing siblings of&#xD;
      cocaine-dependent subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocaine dependence is an enormous public health problem. The significance of this work lies&#xD;
      in the potential for the ASR reduction to serve as a reliable, easily repeatable biological&#xD;
      measure of cocaine-induced brain changes that may enhance outcome prediction so that tailored&#xD;
      treatments may be directed at those patients most vulnerable to relapse, given the&#xD;
      restriction of resources for available for substance abuse treatment.&#xD;
