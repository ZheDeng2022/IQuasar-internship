  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of sapropterin dihydrochloride&#xD;
      (6R-BH4) to existing treatment has any effect in patients with pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH). Patients with PAH have low levels of a substance called nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO). Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a substance produced by the body that is an essential&#xD;
      requirement in the formation of NO. NO is thought to be helpful in keeping blood vessels in&#xD;
      the lung healthy. 6R-BH4 is an experimental (unproven) medicine made in the lab that is very&#xD;
      much like the BH4 that our own body makes. The researchers are investigating whether 6R-BH4&#xD;
      can be added safely to current treatment for PAH and whether there is any evidence of benefit&#xD;
      from its use. The study will take approximately one year to complete from the time&#xD;
      recruitment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of oral 6R-BH4, administered in&#xD;
      escalating doses in addition to standard care, in subjects with pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate change in biochemical markers of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide synthetase activity (coupled and uncoupled) in&#xD;
      subjects with PAH receiving escalating doses of oral 6R-BH4 in addition to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective of the study is to evaluate change in biomarkers of disease progression,&#xD;
      6-minute walk (6MW) distance, Borg dyspnea scores, and quality of life (QOL) measures in&#xD;
      subjects with PAH receiving escalating doses of oral 6R-BH4 in addition to standard care.&#xD;
