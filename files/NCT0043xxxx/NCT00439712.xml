    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that in patients suffering from perennial allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis levocetirizine 5 mg OD relieves nasal obstruction. Furthermore the study is to&#xD;
      investigate how relevant for these patients their nasal obstruction and the effect of&#xD;
      levocetirizine on their nasal obstruction are.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is performed according to a monocentre, double-blind, placebo controlled, two arm&#xD;
      parallel group design. It is divided in 3 periods: A 7 ± 2 day screening phase when patients&#xD;
      are not to treat their perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) is followed by a 29 ± 4 day&#xD;
      treatment period when patients administer either levocetirizine 5 mg OD or placebo and a 14 ±&#xD;
      2 week post treatment observation period when again medication against PAR is not to be&#xD;
      taken. However in all study periods patients are provided cromoglicine nasal spray and eye&#xD;
      drops which in case of severe complaints they may use as rescue medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study patients keep a diary documenting the severity of their nasal and ocular&#xD;
      symptoms of allergy. Every morning and every evening they use a 4-point scale (0 = no&#xD;
      symptom, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) to rate nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal&#xD;
      itching, sneezing and ocular complaints they experienced during the preceding 12 hours.&#xD;
      Furthermore they report adverse events and intake of drugs inclusive of rescue and (during&#xD;
      treatment period) study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attend 5 visits to the study site. On visit 1 medical history and concomitant&#xD;
      medication are assessed and patients undergo a physical examination, a pregnancy test in case&#xD;
      of women of child bearing potential, and, if necessary, a skin prick test. Blood is taken to&#xD;
      estimate creatinine clearance. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are checked and, if they do&#xD;
      not contradict study continuation, patients enter the screening period which ends in the&#xD;
      morning of the day visit 2. If on this visit morning diary reports show sufficiently high&#xD;
      nasal obstruction scores and study participation still complies with the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, patients are randomized and start the treatment period taking the first&#xD;
      dose at the study site. On visit 2 as well as on the following visits adverse events and use&#xD;
      of medication are surveyed and compliance is checked. Visit 3, 4 and 5 are scheduled after&#xD;
      one week of treatment, between treatment and post treatment observation period and at the end&#xD;
      of the study respectively. On visit 5 there is a final physical examination and again females&#xD;
      of childbearing potential undergo a pregnancy test. To assess how relevant for patients nasal&#xD;
      obstruction and the effect of the study medication on nasal obstruction are questionnaires&#xD;
      are completed on each visit.&#xD;
