  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether passive gait training increases arousal,&#xD;
      demonstrated as changes in EEG (electroencephalogram) activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1) Passive gait training increases EEG-frequency in patients with impaired&#xD;
      consciousness due to severe traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Passive gait training increases conductivity speed of the cognitive P300-component of ERP&#xD;
      in patients with impaired consciousness due to severe traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe traumatic brain injury, especially after a high energy trauma, is characterised with&#xD;
      focal lesions and diffuse axonal injury, which leads to the dysfunction in the&#xD;
      cortico-spinal, cortico- cortical connections and reticular activation system. Formatio&#xD;
      reticularis plays an important role in arousal. Tactile and proprioceptive stimulation with a&#xD;
      view to improving level of consciousness in coma patients is popular in the western world&#xD;
      despite insufficient evidence of its effectiveness. Affolter-Bobath-Coombes-concept is the&#xD;
      most commonly used tool in the rehabilitation of brain damaged patients. This concept is&#xD;
      based on the theory that tactile, proprioceptive and oral stimulation develops new&#xD;
      connections in the brain and thereby stimulates consciousness and behaviour. Elliot et al&#xD;
      shows improvement in level of consciousness due to postural changes from a lying position to&#xD;
      a standing posture in 8 of 12 patients using Wessex Head Injury Matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive movements result in proprioceptive stimulation; the effect of which is close to that&#xD;
      achieved by physiological voluntary activity. PET and fMRI studies show that passive&#xD;
      movements activate several areas in the motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase afferent cortical input, passive gait training in the body weight&#xD;
      support robotic gait orthosis could be used in patients with impaired consciousness,&#xD;
      inability to cooperate and poor balance. This device gives the possibility to establish&#xD;
      therapeutically correct upright body position and passive legs movement simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge there are no studies, which illustrate the effects of passive gait training&#xD;
      on cortical activity in patients with impaired consciousness due to severe traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that passive gait training of this group of patients increases arousal,&#xD;
      which can be shown in an increased EEG (electroencephalogram)-frequency and increased&#xD;
      conductivity speed of the cognitive P300-component of ERP (Event Related Potentials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison(s): EEG- and ERP-activity after a single training session in robotic gait orthosis&#xD;
      in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, compared to EEG- and ERP-activity after a&#xD;
      single training session in robotic gait orthosis in healthy persons.&#xD;

    <description>Gait training: Gait robot (Lokomat®, Hocoma, Switzerland) is adjusted to the patient/healthy volunteer individually with chest strap, pelvic straps, harness, leg cuffs and foot lifters. Weight is adjusted individually, so there is a minimum weight support (i.e. when one foot is standing on the treadmill the other foot lifts free from the treadmill thereby simulating normal gait). Gait speed is 1,7-2,3 km/hour (speed can be changed and adjusted that the normal step length is achieved).The duration of the training session is 20 minutes.Blood pressure and pulse are monitored.</description>
