  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis and xerostomia are the most common complications of head and neck (H&amp;N)&#xD;
      irradiation, and the combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is associated with a&#xD;
      significantly higher rate of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucositis usually develops during the second or third week of a course of standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy, and the pain it causes peaks between the third and last week of treatment. The&#xD;
      pain then persists for at least one month following the completion of therapy, and may be so&#xD;
      overwhelming that it prevents patients from swallowing food and fluids. The patient is&#xD;
      therefore at a risk to develop malnutrition, and must be treated vigorously. In this respect,&#xD;
      the use of gastrostomy tubes (PEG) has been shown to be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the full course of irradiation, without interruption, is important for&#xD;
      achieving best possible results in cancer of the H&amp;N. It is therefore essential to identify&#xD;
      and refer patients at risk to receive effective and timely nutritional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since mucositis represents a clinical continuum which differs between patients, it is&#xD;
      difficult to assess before-hand which patients will be at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no simple laboratory tool available, which could predict which patients are&#xD;
      susceptible to develop severe mucositis and dysphagia, and eventually will require a feeding&#xD;
      gastrostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of mucositis, inflammation, results in the production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-α are elevated in&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions and are found in increased levels in blood and tissue fluid during&#xD;
      inflammation, while anti-inflammatory cytokines are produced in a decreased manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to find the best indicators and prognosticators of&#xD;
      mucositis occurring in the healthy oral tissues of H&amp;N cancer patients receiving treatment,&#xD;
      and to understand the cytokines balance mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming there is a correlation between high cytokines levels during inflammation and the&#xD;
      severity of radiation induced mucositis, finding these prognostic factors may help us predict&#xD;
      during the first part of the treatment the need for PEG, placing it prior to the&#xD;
      complications associated with severe mucositis on one hand, and avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
      procedures on the other hand.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis has a significant detrimental effect on patient's quality of life in terms of pain,&#xD;
      ability to eat, to swallow and talk. It may be so severe that an interruption of therapy is&#xD;
      required, consequently influencing tumor response and overall patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of mucositis varies between different patients: some patients may develop a&#xD;
      limited condition, confined to patches of mildly sore erythematous mucosa, while others may&#xD;
      experience diffuse areas of painful ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the more severe cases, pain may be so overwhelming that it prevents patients from&#xD;
      swallowing food and fluids. The patient is therefore at a risk to develop malnutrition, and&#xD;
      must be treated vigorously. In this respect, the use of gastrostomy tubes (PEG) has been&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another aspect of radiation induced mucositis is its health-care costs. Patients with more&#xD;
      severe mucositis have statistically greater outpatient support costs; these include&#xD;
      maintenance of appropriate nutritional and hydration support, such as placement of&#xD;
      gastrostomy tubes. In the U.S, the mucositis overall medical costs are in the order of&#xD;
      approximately $3000±$1000, per treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the full course of irradiation, without interruption, is important for&#xD;
      achieving best possible results in cancer of the H&amp;N. It is therefore essential to identify&#xD;
      and refer patients at risk to receive effective and timely nutritional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since mucositis represents a clinical continuum which differs between patients, it is&#xD;
      difficult to assess before-hand which patients will be at risk to develop severe mucositis&#xD;
      during the course of radiotherapy. In today's practice, patients undergoing radiation therapy&#xD;
      of the H&amp;N will undergo feeding gastrostomy by the treating physician prior to the treatment&#xD;
      if he will anticipate severe mucositis, based on the radiation fields, the chemotherapy used,&#xD;
      and his prior experience. Some of these procedures were eventually unnecessary. In cases&#xD;
      where gastrostomy was not placed a priory, the common practice is monitoring the patients&#xD;
      during treatment. If their weight loss exceeds 10% of their initial body weight, a feeding&#xD;
      gastrostomy is recommended (at this time point, the mucositis is usually severe, and many&#xD;
      patients need admission for fluid administration and semi-urgent procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is no simple laboratory tool available, which could predict which&#xD;
      patients are susceptible to develop severe mucositis and dysphagia, and eventually will&#xD;
      require a feeding gastrostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucositis develops in four successive phases: an inflammation phase, an epithelial phase, an&#xD;
      ulceration phase and lastly, a healing phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase, inflammation, is also entitled &quot;the initial tissue injury phase&quot;, and it&#xD;
      results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α are elevated in inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions and are found in increased levels in blood and tissue fluid during inflammation,&#xD;
      while anti-inflammatory cytokines are produced in a decreased manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In breast cancer patients, it has been shown that changes in cytokines levels, Including&#xD;
      IL-1β and IL-6, also correspond with the response of the malignant tissue to treatment. In&#xD;
      this case, a good clinical response to therapy has been associated with decreases in IL-1β&#xD;
      and IL-6 levels, versus increases in their levels which have been associated with the&#xD;
      progression of the disease. Furthermore, tumor markers such as the cytokeratin TPS, have been&#xD;
      shown to be sensitive in assessing the tumor's response to therapy and the patient's&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be emphasized though, that the findings cited above reflect the response of tumor&#xD;
      cells to therapy, while the proposed project deals with radiation effects on both normal&#xD;
      tissues and tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to find the best indicators and prognosticators of&#xD;
      mucositis occurring in the healthy oral tissues of H&amp;N cancer patients receiving treatment,&#xD;
      and to understand the cytokines balance mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming there is a correlation between high cytokines levels during inflammation and the&#xD;
      severity of radiation induced mucositis, finding these prognostic factors may help us predict&#xD;
      during the first part of the treatment the need for PEG, placing it prior to the&#xD;
      complications associated with severe mucositis on one hand, and avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
      procedures on the other hand. This study may also lead to a new strategy of assessing&#xD;
      severity of mucositis by laboratory tests, a tool that can be used as an objective assessment&#xD;
      in developing strategies that aim to reduce the mucositis. The understanding of the cytokines&#xD;
      balance in this condition can also be translated to the use of anti-cytokine treatment for&#xD;
      this condition, similar to other immune related diseases such as RA, Crohn's Disease and MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this study are to measure recently available tumor markers SCC and TPS, and&#xD;
      to correlate them with tumor response. Genetic markers will be assessed for extreme&#xD;
      alteration in radiation reactions such as severe skin reaction, early and unexpectedly severe&#xD;
      mucositis, and on the other hand - lack of response. The blood for these tasks will be&#xD;
      collected prospectively, but evaluated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of at least 14 and up to 35 patients with H&amp;N epithelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be clinically evaluated during the week before treatment, and during the&#xD;
      treatment period weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drown for cytokines prior to treatment, at week 2, 4 and at the end of&#xD;
      the treatment. The serum collected will be separated for the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inflammatory Cytokines: IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and TNF α.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anti inflammatory cytokines: IL-10 and TGF β.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tumor markers: SCC and TPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genetic assessment of genes that may be involved in extreme treatment reaction. At each&#xD;
           weekly follow up, patients will be assessed for mucositis by physician using the WHO&#xD;
           common toxicity criteria, and will answer a mucositis questionnaire (based on the&#xD;
           RTOG/EORTC questionnaire). Patient's weight will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the relationship between cytokine level and the clinically suggested PEG&#xD;
           at the end of the H&amp;N chemo-irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether a correlation exists between blood cytokines (inflammatory versus&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory cytokines) levels and the severity of radiation induced mucositis in&#xD;
           patients receiving chemo-radiotherapy for cancer of the H&amp;N.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether blood cytokines levels could serve as a simple laboratory tool,&#xD;
           to predict the severity of mucositis and dysphagia occurring during H&amp;N&#xD;
           chemo-irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the clinical usefulness of the Tumor Markers SCC and TPS in this setting,&#xD;
           namely, to evaluate the correlation between their blood levels and response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the associated mucositis between two commonly used radiation treatment&#xD;
           strategies - IMRT 5 field plan and classic two dimensional plan for the subgroup of&#xD;
           patients with advanced glottic and supraglottic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess whether cytokine levels during treatment can predict long term treatment&#xD;
           related toxicity.&#xD;
