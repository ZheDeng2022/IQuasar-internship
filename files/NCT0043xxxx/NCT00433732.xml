      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Trexima versus&#xD;
      placebo as assessed by pain relief and the incidences of photophobia, phonophobia and nausea&#xD;
      at 2 hours after treatment as the primary endpoints. Another objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of Trexima when compared to the individual components (sumatriptan and&#xD;
      naproxen sodium) using sustained pain-free as the endpoint. It is the intent that this study&#xD;
      be sufficiently powered to detect differences that are clinically meaningful and&#xD;
      statistically significant in order to meet both objectives.&#xD;
