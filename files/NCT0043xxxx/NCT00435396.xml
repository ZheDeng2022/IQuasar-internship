  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first time in humans (FTIH) study with the GSK Bio recombinant gB antigen to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and immunogenicity of this CMV candidate vaccine with a proprietary GSK&#xD;
      adjuvant system. The vaccine will be administered to young male healthy subjects at 0, 1 and&#xD;
      6 months. The trial will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate CMV vaccine.&#xD;
      An additional secondary objective of this trial is to identify and validate a test which will&#xD;
      be able to differentiate between previous CMV infection and CMV vaccination. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 2 years.&#xD;
