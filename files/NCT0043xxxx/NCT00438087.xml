      Facial palsy after surgical removal of cranial base tumors adherent to the nerve can partly&#xD;
      be explained by inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of corticosteroids to prevent facial&#xD;
      palsy after such surgery and to identify the patients that will have the highest benefit from&#xD;
      an anti-inflammatory treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include patients undergoing surgery for a benign tumor of the cranial base&#xD;
      (vestibular schwannoma). The efficiency of high dosage corticosteroids administered&#xD;
      intravenously during and after surgery will be evaluated on the facial nerve function in&#xD;
      comparison to a placebo. Pre operative and intra operative data will be collected and&#xD;
      analysed in order to investigate possible predictive factors of response to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: After the surgical removal of a cerebella-pontine angle tumor (mainly&#xD;
      vestibular schwannoma), and despite the anatomical integrity of the facial nerve, an&#xD;
      immediate or delayed facial palsy may occur. This palsy may be explained by ischemia, edema,&#xD;
      inflammation, or a neurotmesis (ruptured axons in an intact nerve sheet). This phenomenon is&#xD;
      highly dependent on the size of the tumor. In our preliminary studies, we observed an&#xD;
      immediate facial palsy in 16% and a palsy occurring at postoperative day 8 in 23% of the&#xD;
      patients operated on for a vestibular schwannoma. Corticosteroids may decrease the&#xD;
      inflammation and the edema around the nerve and reduce the incidence of the postoperative&#xD;
      facial palsy. Their efficiency has already been demonstrated in idiopathic facial palsy. In a&#xD;
      previously published study , a single dose of dexamethasone during surgery did not influence&#xD;
      the facial function outcome. But the short period of the treatment do not allow definitive&#xD;
      conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of a corticosteroid (methyl&#xD;
      prednisolone) administered intra- and postoperatively on the incidence of facial palsy after&#xD;
      surgery of cerebella-pontine angle tumors and to determine intra operative prognostic factors&#xD;
      for the facial function outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: A multi center, prospective, randomized, versus placebo, and&#xD;
      double-blind study will be undertaken. Four-hundred patients undergoing surgery for a&#xD;
      cerebellopontine angle tumor will be included during 23 months. Three university departments&#xD;
      of otolaryngology (Hospital BEAUJON, CHU de Bordeaux, CHU de Tours) will participate. The pre&#xD;
      operative assessment includes a clinical examination with the assessment of the facial&#xD;
      function (in 6 grades according to House and BRACKMANN), an audiometry and a vestibular&#xD;
      testing, and a cranial MRI with the classification of tumors in 4 stages according to their&#xD;
      size. Patients will be randomized after information and with their consent. During surgery,&#xD;
      the degree of nerve stretch (4 stages), the tumor adhesion to the nerve (4 stages) and the&#xD;
      stimulation thresholds of the facial nerve with an electromyographic monitoring device (NIM&#xD;
      Response 2, XOMED MEDTRONICS, Jacksonville, FL) will be recorded. All cases of facial nerve&#xD;
      interruption during surgery will be excluded. In the treated group, one IV injection of&#xD;
      methyl prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day will be administered intra operatively and on&#xD;
      postoperative days 1 and 2. The treatment will be continued on days 3 to 7 with the same&#xD;
      dosage orally. Subsequently, 0.5 mg/kg/day at days 8 and 8, and 0.25 mg/kg/day at days 10 and&#xD;
      11. The facial function will be assessed on postoperative days 1, 8 and 30 clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Considering the effect of corticosteroids in the idiopathic facial palsy&#xD;
      and the effect of these agents on edema and inflammation, we expect and decrease in the&#xD;
      incidence of immediate and delayed postoperative facial palsies. The intra operative&#xD;
      stimulation thresholds may indicate a subgroup of patients for which the efficiency of the&#xD;
      corticosteroids is higher than in the whole series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion : The facial palsy after surgery of cerebellopontine angle tumors is the most&#xD;
      frequent and the most significant morbidity. Corticosteroids may decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      this complication.&#xD;
