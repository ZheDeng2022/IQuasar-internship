  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of oral versus patch administration of&#xD;
      hormonal contraception on hormone sensitive proteins such as lipoproteins, clotting factors&#xD;
      and inflammatory proteins as well as blood sugar and insulin levels, antioxidant status and&#xD;
      flow-mediated dilation of arm and forearm vessels. The hypothesis is that oral administration&#xD;
      of contraceptive hormones will result in higher plasma levels of estrogen sensitive proteins&#xD;
      originating from the liver while patch administration of contraceptive hormones will result&#xD;
      in greater systemic effects of estrogen on vascular reactivity and antioxidant status.&#xD;

      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic effects of hormonal contraceptives differ when administered by oral or systemic&#xD;
      routes. The oral route magnifies the hepatic production of hormone sensitive proteins&#xD;
      including lipoproteins, clotting factors and inflammatory proteins such as CRP. These effects&#xD;
      are due to the first pass of hormone to the liver from the portal circulation. The first pass&#xD;
      hepatic effect also reduces the systemic exposure to orally administered estrogen and&#xD;
      progestin, due to glucuronidation and sulfation of sex hormones and excretion in the bile.&#xD;
      Systemic administration by the patch is more analogous to physiologic hormone release from&#xD;
      the ovary, as it avoids the first pass effect and the peripheral tissues are exposed to&#xD;
      higher hormone concentrations than with oral administration. Conversely, the liver may have a&#xD;
      lower exposure to hormone by patch administration than by oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to the extended cycle (2-month) patch contraception formulation under study,&#xD;
      similar questions may be asked about the metabolic, inflammatory and vascular effects of this&#xD;
      regimen compared to the one-month cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to measure the plasma estrogen and progestin levels observed with each formulation and&#xD;
           the physiological parameters that affect vascular health including lipids, glucose and&#xD;
           insulin, redox state, clotting and inflammatory factors, and vascular reactivity; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to study the relationships of hormones to physiological parameters among the three&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying rationale is that the net effect of estrogen-progestin combinations is a&#xD;
      function of the dose and biological effect of each hormone and that these effects differ by&#xD;
      route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three contraception regimens will be compared in an open label, randomized, crossover design.&#xD;
      The three regimens are Ortho-Cyclen速 as the standard reference oral contraceptive, Ortho&#xD;
      Evra速 patch formulation, and an investigational two month patch formulation. The two month&#xD;
      patch formulation will consist of applying Ortho Evra速 for 7 weeks in a row with the 8th week&#xD;
      off compared to 3 weeks of patch application with the 4th week off in the standard patch&#xD;
      cycle. Subjects will take each hormonal regimen for two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will have an initial one-month run-in period on Ortho-Cyclen速. In addition&#xD;
      to washing out any previous hormone exposure, this washout will serve as a compliance hurdle&#xD;
      that will help in selecting subjects that are willing to undergo the discipline of the study.&#xD;
      Washouts between treatments will not be performed in order to provide continuous&#xD;
      contraception for the study subjects and facilitate compliance once subjects are randomized&#xD;
      into the study. As each treatment period will last two months, the first month of each&#xD;
      two-month treatment period will be considered as the washout from the previous treatment&#xD;
      protocol. The second month of each two-month treatment period will be the investigative&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma hormones monitored in the second month of each two month period are ethinyl estradiol&#xD;
      and norelgestromin. Norelgestromin is the primary active metabolite of norgestimate&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clotting parameters to be measured are those monitored in our previous study of a desogestrel&#xD;
      (D) vs. levonorgestrel (L) contraceptive comparison at nearly equal estrogen exposures over 9&#xD;
      months. In this study, PT and PTT increased equally from a pre-treatment baseline, factor V&#xD;
      decreased on (D) and increased on (L), and free protein S decreased on (D) and did not change&#xD;
      with (L). The impression from this study was that the changes were internally compensating.&#xD;
      PAI-1, an inhibitor of plasminogen activation, will also be measured. These will be measured&#xD;
      at 1, 7, 21 and 28 days of the investigative month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory parameters will include highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), which is of&#xD;
      hepatic origin, and serum amyloid A (SAA), which varies in parallel to CRP in the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome but is transported almost entirely in HDL. SAA transport in HDL is considered to be&#xD;
      a barometer of impaired HDL function, which occurs in inflammatory states. These measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained at days 1 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antioxidant status is related to inflammatory and metabolic stress and is of additional&#xD;
      interest in light of a current NIH NICHD study to examine the changes in oxidant stress&#xD;
      during the menstrual cycle. The primary parameter we will use is total antioxidant capacity&#xD;
      (TOAC). Several other parameters of plasma redox status can be measured if interesting trends&#xD;
      are detected. These parameters will also be measured at days 1 and 21 of the respective&#xD;
      cycles. We have previously described the antioxidant effects of estrogen and prooxidant&#xD;
      effects of progestins and differences among the progestins in in vitro systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lipoprotein measures selected are the standard lipid profile consisting of triglyceride,&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL cholesterol measured by precipitation and estimation of LDL by the Friedwald&#xD;
      algorithm. The HDL2 and HDL3 sub-fractions and apoproteins AI and AII are sensitive measures&#xD;
      of estrogen-progestin balance, as is sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Lipoprotein lipids,&#xD;
      HDL sub-fractions and SHBG will be measured at 1, 7, 21 and 28 days. The apoproteins will be&#xD;
      measured at days 1 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure vascular reactivity after arterial ischemia in two ways, by brachial artery&#xD;
      reactivity and by venous plethysmography. Both techniques are sensitive to nitric oxide&#xD;
      mediated vascular dilation. Both procedures will be done without the nitroglycerin step.&#xD;
      Differences in flow mediated dilation and arterial compliance have been described in the&#xD;
      normal menstrual cycle, and should be sensitive to differing biologic effects of estrogen and&#xD;
      progestin in the respective contraceptive cycles. We expect that the vasodilatory response to&#xD;
      ischemia will represent the net opposing biologic effects of estrogen and progestin, as do&#xD;
      the hormone-sensitive plasma proteins. These measurements will be made at day 21 of the&#xD;
      second month of each of the three treatment arms, as day 21 is the time of maximum hormone&#xD;
      exposure in all three regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's overall satisfaction with each hormonal regimen will be quantified in a daily&#xD;
      diary along with a record of menstrual history.&#xD;
