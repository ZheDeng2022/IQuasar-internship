      Retinal structures are difficult to visualize because the retina is optically transparent. In&#xD;
      glaucoma, the microglia in the retina becomes activated in eyes with glaucomatous damage. The&#xD;
      microglia forms a dense meshwork which resembles gliosis-like alterations, which may increase&#xD;
      light scattering. With appropriate technology, increased reflection and light scattering from&#xD;
      the retina may be detected in eyes of glaucoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we investigate whether clinically observable retinal gliosis-like alterations&#xD;
      occur more often in patients with glaucoma than in non-glaucomatous controls, and whether&#xD;
      gliosis-like alterations are associated with a vasospastic propensity.&#xD;

      Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells&#xD;
      and cupping of the optic nerve head associated with visual function defects. Increased&#xD;
      intraocular pressure and vascular alterations such as unsteady blood flow have been&#xD;
      implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. While glaucoma changes occur in both the retina&#xD;
      and the optic nerve head, clinical diagnosis normally focuses on optic nerve head. However,&#xD;
      histomorphologic and immunohistochemistry studies have shown that glial cells in the retina&#xD;
      (astrocytes and Müller cells) are also activated in glaucoma. In addition, some patients with&#xD;
      glaucoma have clinically patchy alteration in the retina resembling epiretinal gliosis but&#xD;
      without visual disturbance, thus the term &quot;gliosis-like alterations&quot; was used previously. At&#xD;
      present however, it is unknown whether gliosis-like alterations are associated with a&#xD;
      specific type of glaucoma (i.e. high- or normal-tension glaucoma) or with vascular&#xD;
      dysregulation. Moreover, it remains unclear whether gliosis-like alterations may also occur&#xD;
      in the elderly patients without glaucoma as an aging process of the retina. Retinal&#xD;
      structures are difficult to visualize and details difficult to be imaged on a photograph&#xD;
      because the retina is optically transparent. Blue light scatters more than red light. This is&#xD;
      the reason why the retinal nerve fiber layer can to some extent be better visualized with&#xD;
      red-free light. The extensions of the astrocytes in the retina form a fine meshwork, which&#xD;
      becomes denser and irregular as these astrocytes are activated. The size and numbers of glial&#xD;
      cells increase, as the neural cell damage advances. These changes, in turn, may increase the&#xD;
      light scattering. With appropriate technology, increased reflection and light scattering from&#xD;
      the retina may be detected in the retina of glaucoma patients. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether gliosis-like alterations do occur more often in glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retina of patients and healthy controls alike will be photographically documented with a&#xD;
      digital fundus camera as well as with optical coherence tomography and automated&#xD;
      microperimetry that enables to correlate objectively local morphologic aspects and changes of&#xD;
      the retina with local functional measurements. Possible causes for secondary retinal gliosis&#xD;
      will be excluded in a thorough clinical examination including slit-lamp examination and&#xD;
      dilated direct fundoscopy. The examination techniques and interventions used in this study&#xD;
      are routine clinical practice and do not expose patients or controls to undue risk.&#xD;
