      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate an experimental imaging technology,&#xD;
      the multispectral digital microscope (MDM), which may help doctors see how far skin cancer&#xD;
      extends (widens out) on an area of skin. Researchers want to learn if this new technology can&#xD;
      help doctors identify the exact areas involved in precancerous or cancerous changes in the&#xD;
      skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All tissue and cells are made of tiny particles that give off small amounts of light. This&#xD;
      light is called fluorescence. Researchers have learned that cancerous cells and normal cells&#xD;
      give off different amounts and different types of fluorescence. Cancerous cells and normal&#xD;
      cells also reflect (bounce back) light differently. Researchers want to better understand if&#xD;
      light fluorescence and reflectance (a measure of the ability of a material to reflect&#xD;
      sunlight) from the skin can be used to tell which cells may be cancerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have developed the MDM system in order to better understand how cancer changes&#xD;
      the light fluorescence and reflectance in skin. The MDM system shines different colors of&#xD;
      light on the skin and takes pictures of fluorescence and reflectance on the skin area through&#xD;
      a microscope. The pictures will then be studied to better understand the differences in&#xD;
      fluorescence and reflectance in abnormal and normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, an area of your skin will first be examined under&#xD;
      standard white light. A researcher will then use the MDM imaging instrument to take pictures&#xD;
      of abnormal-looking and normal skin areas. The researcher will mark 2-4 areas of your skin&#xD;
      with a marker. During your surgery, you will have a small sample from a normal-looking area&#xD;
      collected and 1 or 2 samples collected, from abnormal-looking areas of the skin. Each sample&#xD;
      from abnormal-looking tissue will be about 3-4 millimeters wide (about the size of a small&#xD;
      pencil eraser).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the skin lesion has been removed, but before it is needed for review by the pathologist&#xD;
      or surgeon, the removed tissue will be examined using the MDM imaging instrument and standard&#xD;
      white light. The edges of the removed lesion will then be examined with another type of&#xD;
      microscope, a confocal microscope, which allows researchers to see the very small cells in&#xD;
      the tissue. The exact location that was imaged with this microscope will be marked on the&#xD;
      tissue, and the findings will be recorded. The tissue will then be checked by the pathologist&#xD;
      according to standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not be told of any of the experimental findings. Information about the diagnosis&#xD;
      will be available to your treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your name and any personal identifying information (such as your name, social security&#xD;
      number, or medical record number) will be coded to protect your privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 55 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who will be undergoing surgery to remove a region of skin suspected of&#xD;
             containing non-melanoma skin cancer will be eligible to participate in this study. The&#xD;
             proposed resection should be equal or greater than 1 cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In addition, patients undergoing induction chemotherapy or biologic therapy prior to&#xD;
             surgical resection are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational&#xD;
             nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with non-melanoma skin cancer lesion at eyelid, or in case that the lesion&#xD;
             extends to superior or inferior eyelid, this area will not be imaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Persons who are medically unfit to undergo resection of skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Persons under the age of 18.&#xD;
