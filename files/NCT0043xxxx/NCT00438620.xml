  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has been shown to have a positive effect on several quality of life&#xD;
      outcomes in cancer patients, but few existing studies have focused on the end stages of&#xD;
      cancer. The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of a physical activity&#xD;
      intervention in advanced cancer patients, from which data can be used to design a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial if results are encouraging.&#xD;

      Background Information Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      worldwide[1]. The resultant morbidities of cancer and its treatment are manifold; common&#xD;
      physiologic symptoms include pain, muscle weakness and fatigue, whereas common psychological&#xD;
      symptoms include depression, anxiety and poor sense of well-being. As methods of cancer&#xD;
      detection and treatment improve, survival is prolonged and the lifetime burden of these&#xD;
      adverse effects increases[2]. Addressing these issues is critical towards maximizing quality&#xD;
      of life, a multidimensional construct encompassing all physical and psychosocial factors[3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is one potential strategy for ameliorating quality of life in all phases of&#xD;
      cancer and its treatment [4]. Increasing evidence indicates a role for physical activity in&#xD;
      improving several aspects of physical and psychological well-being that may contribute to&#xD;
      quality of life in cancer patients, including muscle strength, functional capacity, mood and&#xD;
      self-esteem[5]. Not only does physical activity have proven benefits in terms of physical&#xD;
      performance and fatigue in cancer survivors, it may improve the capacity for basic activities&#xD;
      of daily living such that functional independence can be maintained as long as possible[6].&#xD;
      Although this has been demonstrated for early stage cancer survivors, there is limited&#xD;
      evidence for the use of physical activity in the palliation of patients with actively&#xD;
      progressive, advanced incurable cancer[7]. A few studies of exercise in advanced metastatic&#xD;
      cancer patients have demonstrated benefits in quality of life outcomes, however small sample&#xD;
      sizes have limited their generalizability to the larger end-stage cancer population[8-12].&#xD;
      There exists a critical need to more specifically identify exercise programmes targeted to&#xD;
      advanced cancer patients' needs, interests and preferences[13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the physical activity preferences and&#xD;
      interests of actively progressive, advanced incurable cancer patients and to determine if&#xD;
      there is any association between physical activity and quality of life in this population.&#xD;
      The ultimate aim of this study is to provide preliminary data on which a subsequent&#xD;
      intervention trial can be based if encouraging results are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe advanced cancer patient's attitudes towards physical activity, self-efficacy&#xD;
           for physical activity and programming preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the relationship between quality of life, medical and demographic variables,&#xD;
           and physical activity in advanced cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify which advanced cancer populations would be willing and able to participate&#xD;
           in a physical activity intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This pilot study will be cross-sectional in design, using a survey questionnaire&#xD;
      combining both closed and open-ended questions. After written consent is obtained, the&#xD;
      investigator will administer the survey questionnaire via face-to-face interview with the&#xD;
      patient at a time and location that is mutually convenient for both parties. The survey&#xD;
      questionnaire will be a one-time assessment, with anticipated duration of 45 minutes for&#xD;
      completion. The survey questionnaire will be developed based on combination of validated&#xD;
      physical activity and quality of life questionnaires, including the McGill Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire[14], the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale[15], and the Late-Life Function and&#xD;
      Disability Instrument[16]. Exercise program preferences and Theory of Planned Behavior&#xD;
      constructs will be assessed using items taken from previous research assessing physical&#xD;
      activity in cancer survivors[17-19]. Medical and demographic information will be collected&#xD;
      using self-report measures and via medical chart review. Date of death will be determined&#xD;
      from the cancer registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Be able to understand, provide written informed consent in, and speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cognitive ability to participate (defined as a normal Folstein's Mini Mental Status&#xD;
           Score for patient's age and education level[20])&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnosis of advanced cancer (defined as progressive, incurable, locally recurrent or&#xD;
           metastatic disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Approval of treating physician Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Any absolute contraindications to exercise (including acute MI within 2 days,&#xD;
      symptomatic/severe aortic stenosis, decompensated heart failure, symptomatic/hemodynamically&#xD;
      significant cardiac arrhythmias, unstable angina not previously stabilized by medical&#xD;
      therapy, acute aortic dissection, acute myocarditis/pericarditis, acute pulmonary&#xD;
      embolus/infarction) 2. Palliative Performance Status level of 30% or less[21] 3. Any patient&#xD;
      who, in the opinion of the treating physician, is within the last days to hours of life&#xD;
      Recruitment Patients diagnosed with advanced cancer (defined as progressive, incurable,&#xD;
      locally recurrent or metastatic disease) will be recruited from the Cross Cancer Institute&#xD;
      and the Capital Health Regional Palliative Home Care Program. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      identified by case managers in the Capital Health Regional Palliative Home Care Program, and&#xD;
      study information will be included in the ethics-approved Pain and Symptom &amp; Palliative Care&#xD;
      Research Group studies brochure distributed to outpatients at the Cross Cancer Institute by&#xD;
      the research nurse or study coordinator. Patient contact will be made by telephone outside of&#xD;
      the Cross Cancer Institute thereafter. Patients who accept the invitation to participate will&#xD;
      provide written consent prior to commencing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis To detect a change of 0.5 standard deviations (a medium effect size) in&#xD;
      the various outcomes (quality of life, physical activity) with a power of 80% and a&#xD;
      two-tailed alpha value of &lt;0.05, we need 29 participants. Based on previous study sampling of&#xD;
      the Cross Cancer Institute and Capital Health Regional Palliative Home Care by the Pain &amp;&#xD;
      Symptom and Palliative Care Research Group, 30 patients could be expected to be recruited&#xD;
      over a nine month period given frailty and end-of-life symptom limitations. The study will&#xD;
      commence with the enrollment of the first subject, subsequent subjects will be recruited on&#xD;
      an ongoing basis. Initial analysis will provide complete descriptive information on the&#xD;
      demographic and medical profile of the study participants. Primary analysis will use multiple&#xD;
      regression to explore the relationship between demographic/medical characteristics, physical&#xD;
      function and quality of life variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Committee Ethical and scientific approval will be obtained from the&#xD;
      local Institutional Review Boards affiliated with the Cross Cancer Institute and Capital&#xD;
      Health Regional Palliative Home Care prior to study commencement. All serious adverse events&#xD;
      will be reported to the local IRBs as well as each participant's treating physician. The&#xD;
      project coordinator, under the supervision of the principal investigator, will be responsible&#xD;
      for reporting any serious adverse events. The local IRBs will oversee the validity and&#xD;
      integrity of data by conducting periodic audits of study records.&#xD;
