  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estradiol promotes and maintains the typical female phenotype characterized by subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat accumulation. There is evidence to suggest that this effect relies on the ability of&#xD;
      estradiol to increase the amount of anti-lipolytic α2A-adrenergic receptors, but whether this&#xD;
      requires long-term exposure to estradiol or is the result of an immediate effect is not&#xD;
      clear. Objective: To study acute effects of a single dose (4 mg) of 17β-estradiol on regional&#xD;
      and systemic lipolysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estradiol affects muscle and fat distribution, and thereby lipid metabolism. A reduction in&#xD;
      muscle power is seen after menopause, readily counteracted by female hormone therapy (HT).&#xD;
      Treatment with HT through months to previously untreated postmenopausal women, or hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy (HRT) to women with Turner syndrome, increases muscle mass and reduces&#xD;
      fat mass. HT in postmenopausal women furthermore prevents fat accumulation and increases&#xD;
      lipoprotein lipase activity and lipolysis to an extent comparable to premenopausal women. In&#xD;
      contrast, it has also been shown that estradiol may actually attenuate lipolysis during basal&#xD;
      as well as catecholamine stimulated conditions. In addition, one study found whole body fat&#xD;
      metabolism to be lower during treatment with estradiol than without, and reduced lipolysis is&#xD;
      present in postmenopausal women during treatment with estradiol, along with an increased&#xD;
      number of α-adrenergic receptors and a decreased number of β-adrenergic receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not clear whether the lipolytic effect of estradiol happens acutely or is dependent on&#xD;
      chronic exposure. Moreover, regional differences in the pharmacodynamics of estradiol have&#xD;
      not been assessed. Finally, effects on skeletal muscle have never been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study was 1) by microdialysis to quantify the regional production&#xD;
      of glycerol in two tissues (muscle and fat), and in two regions (abdominal and femoral). 2)&#xD;
      To quantify the whole-body lipolytic effect of estradiol, and 3) in biopsies to study&#xD;
      intracellular mechanisms behind the action of estradiol.&#xD;
