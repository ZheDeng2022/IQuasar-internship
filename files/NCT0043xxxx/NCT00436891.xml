  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a bacteria that causes many different sicknesses in children&#xD;
      and adults. This study will look at the number of cases of pyoderma (bacterial skin&#xD;
      infection) and scabies (skin mites that cause itching) in 550 infants 12 months or younger in&#xD;
      Fiji. (GAS can cause pyoderma, and sometimes skin sites infested with scabies can become&#xD;
      infected with GAS bacteria.) The study will also look at the makeup of GAS and how certain&#xD;
      medications affect GAS. The infants will be involved in the study for approximately 1 week.&#xD;
      Their skin will be examined for pyoderma and scabies. A swab sample will be taken from the&#xD;
      pyoderma area to test for GAS. The researchers hope to see how often these skin infections&#xD;
      occur and how they affect the Fijian population. The information will help the researchers to&#xD;
      develop better treatment and possibly a vaccine to prevent infection. Infants with pyoderma&#xD;
      that is defined as &quot;greater than mild&quot; will be referred for treatment.&#xD;

      Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, a common infective agent in children and adults, causes&#xD;
      the widest range of clinical disease of any bacterium. This study is the fourth of five&#xD;
      studies in a larger project aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of infections caused by the&#xD;
      group A streptococcus (GAS) in Fiji. This larger project is called the Fiji Group A&#xD;
      Streptococcal Project (Fiji GrASP). Fiji GrASP is in turn part of a larger program aimed at&#xD;
      progression of a novel GAS vaccine - this program is the project entitled &quot;Global GAS Vaccine&#xD;
      Based on the M-Protein.&quot; The three broad aims of the Fiji GrASP epidemiologic studies are:&#xD;
      (1) to establish the burden of disease of GAS infections in Fiji; (2) to describe the&#xD;
      molecular epidemiology of GAS isolates in Fiji and; (3) to establish natural immunologic&#xD;
      correlates of protection of a J8 vaccine if they exist. This is a cross-sectional study of&#xD;
      550 infants over a 2-month period. Skin will be examined for pyoderma and scabies, and swabs&#xD;
      will be taken from pyoderma lesions once. All GAS isolates from skin swabs will undergo&#xD;
      genetic sequencing of the N-terminal and C-repeat regions (for the J8 epitope) of the M&#xD;
      protein at QIMR. One hundred skin swabs will undergo antimicrobial susceptibility testing&#xD;
      against penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. The primary objectives of&#xD;
      the study are to estimate the point prevalence of GAS pyoderma in 550 infants in the Central&#xD;
      Division of Fiji and to estimate the point prevalence of scabies in 550 infants in the&#xD;
      Central Division of Fiji. The secondary objectives of the study are to genotypically&#xD;
      characterize group A streptococci isolated from skin swabs from pyoderma lesions in infants&#xD;
      in Fiji and to determine antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin, clindamycin,&#xD;
      erythromycin and chloramphenicol in 100 GAS isolates from skin swabs. The primary endpoints&#xD;
      of the study are to determine the number of cases of pyoderma and the number of cases of&#xD;
      scabies. The secondary endpoints are: (1) to determine the number of children with pyoderma&#xD;
      and scabies; (2) to determine the number of GAS isolates from skin swabs that contain the J8&#xD;
      epitope and the overall emm-type distribution of GAS isolates and; (3) to complete&#xD;
      antibiograms of GAS isolates from skin to penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin and&#xD;
      chloramphenicol.&#xD;
