  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large observational studies have shown cereal fiber to protect from diabetes and heart&#xD;
      disease. Despite the success of acarbose, an Î±-glucosidase hydrolase inhibitor, which lowers&#xD;
      the glycemic index of foods containing starch, sucrose and maltodextrins, the use of diets&#xD;
      containing low glycemic index foods still remains to be established. We will therefore&#xD;
      provide otherwise healthy individuals with type 2 diabetes intensive counseling on food&#xD;
      selection either to improve glucose control using high cereal fiber dietary strategies or low&#xD;
      glycemic index foods. Studies will last 6 months with bloods taken for HbA1c, glucose and&#xD;
      blood lipids. If the study shows a benefit for either or both diets then use of high fiber&#xD;
      and/or low glycemic index foods in the diet may provide another potential way to improve&#xD;
      glucose control and lower cholesterol levels in non-insulin dependent diabetes.&#xD;

      Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited by placing advertisements in local newspapers and by&#xD;
      distributing similar advertisements to the diabetes clinic and diabetes education programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information Sessions: Approximately 1000 volunteers in groups of 10-30 with or without&#xD;
      spouses will attend one of a number of evening information sessions run from the Risk Factor&#xD;
      Modification Center at St. Michael's Hospital. During the sessions the exact nature of the&#xD;
      study will be described and volunteers will have the opportunity to ask specific questions&#xD;
      about the study and taste the high fiber and low glycemic index foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Potential subjects will then fill in and return to the investigators a detailed&#xD;
      questionnaire concerning their medical history, medications (including vitamin, mineral and&#xD;
      nutritional supplements) smoking habits, alcohol intake and exercise pattern and whether they&#xD;
      are currently on a specific diet. Details will also be obtained concerning planned vacations.&#xD;
      Those subjects deemed potentially eligible will be asked to give a fasting blood sample at&#xD;
      the Risk Factor Modification Center. Individuals who meet the study criteria, are invited to&#xD;
      return again to the Center. The principles of the diabetic diet which they are already&#xD;
      expected to be following will be reinforced, which incorporate the key elements of an NCEP&#xD;
      Step 2 diet (total calories from fat &lt;30%, saturated fat &lt;7%, polyunsaturated fat &lt;10%,&#xD;
      dietary cholesterol &lt;200 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will then be randomized to one 24-week treatment in a two-treatment parallel&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments: 1) low glycemic index dietary advice (e.g. to eat intact grain cereals,&#xD;
      pumpernickel bread, parboiled rice, cracked wheat, pasta, peas, beans and lentils) 2) high&#xD;
      cereal fiber diet. Background diets will be the subjects' diabetic diets, modified as above,&#xD;
      which will conform to CDA and NCEP Step 2 guidelines. Diet histories will be recorded at&#xD;
      weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24. These diets will be assessed for consistency by the&#xD;
      dietitian in the subject's presence. Where necessary, modifications in diet will be made to&#xD;
      ensure weight maintenance. Compliance will be assessed by 7 day food records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: the study will consist of four months recruitment and patient selection, during&#xD;
      which time estimation of individual caloric requirements will be performed, and 6 months&#xD;
      treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Details: Fasting blood samples are obtained at day zero and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and&#xD;
      24 of each study period. Twenty-four hour urine for urinary C-peptide analyses will be&#xD;
      obtained immediately prior to the beginning of the study and at the end of each 24-week&#xD;
      treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palatability and satiety: subjects will record their ratings using a 9-point bipolar semantic&#xD;
      scale at weekly intervals during each study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures: height at recruitment, waist and hip circumference, and body&#xD;
      composition will be taken immediately prior to and at the end of each study phase. Body&#xD;
      weight and blood pressure will be measured at clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help to indicate whether dietary advice can make a significant difference to&#xD;
      glycemic control as has been the case with drug therapy to reduce postprandial glycemia.&#xD;
