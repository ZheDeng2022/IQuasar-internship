      Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A serious mental illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated to be present in as high as 6.4% of the population in Western populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associated with considerable disability and high morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterized by periods of both lowered and elevated mood (i.e. depression and&#xD;
           mania/hypomania respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The depressive aspect of bipolar disorder is often overlooked, possibly due to its less&#xD;
      dramatic nature, despite its significant impact on the lives of those affected. Bipolar&#xD;
      depression (BPAD-DP) is associated with a twenty fold increased risk of suicide, and&#xD;
      typically lasts three to five times as long as a manic or hypomanic episode. Despite this,&#xD;
      there has been relatively sparse investigation of treatments for BPAD-DP, with guidelines&#xD;
      based primarily on expert judgment rather than clinical trials. In addition a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patients with bipolar depression do not respond to the range of commonly used&#xD;
      medications. One of the only substantially new treatments developed for unipolar depression&#xD;
      in recent years has been the advent of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).&#xD;
      Repetitive TMS has been evaluated in over 20 trials conducted over the last ten years, but no&#xD;
      substantive trials have explored its use in bipolar depression. We propose to do this,&#xD;
      conducting a large scale clinical trial. The trial will include the assessment of both high&#xD;
      frequency left sided rTMS (as there is clearly the greatest evidence for the effectiveness of&#xD;
      this in unipolar depression) and low frequency right sided rTMS (as this there is growing&#xD;
      evidence of the effectiveness of this in unipolar depression and we have an excellent pilot&#xD;
      study to suggest its potential in BPAD-DP and it has never previously been assessed in a&#xD;
      clinical trial exclusively targeting this patient group). Our previous research strongly&#xD;
      supports the effectiveness of rTMS paradigms including low frequency right-sided stimulation&#xD;
      in unipolar depression and suggests these may have value in BPAD-DP. As BPAD-DP is clearly a&#xD;
      clinical problem of significant impact and with limited treatment options, there is a&#xD;
      pressing need for the development and definitive testing of novel treatments such as rTMS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bipolar affective disorder is a serious mental illness with significant mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity [1]. Some estimates of prevalence in Western populations are as high as 6.4% [2].&#xD;
      The depressive aspect of bipolar disorder is often overlooked, possibly due to its less&#xD;
      dramatic nature, despite its significant impact on the lives of those who suffer from it [3].&#xD;
      Bipolar depression is associated with a twenty fold increased risk of suicide [4], and&#xD;
      typically lasts three to five times as long as a manic or hypomanic episode [5, 6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, there has been relatively sparse investigation of treatments for bipolar&#xD;
      depression, with guidelines based primarily on expert judgment rather than randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials [7]. First line treatment typically involves treatment with a mood&#xD;
      stabilizer - lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine [7]. Addition of an antidepressant&#xD;
      such as an SSRI, buproprion or venlafaxine may be indicated if depression persists, although&#xD;
      there is a possibility of inducing rapid cycling and manic or manic episodes. Alternative&#xD;
      agents such as lamotrigine and atypical antipsychotics may also be considered [7]. However,&#xD;
      there is little firm evidence in this area, and the lack of controlled studies in the&#xD;
      treatment of bipolar depression was described by Thase in 2005 [7], as &quot;an embarrassment to&#xD;
      the field&quot;. In addition to this lack of evidence of efficacy, it is clear that a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patients with bipolar depression do not respond to the range of commonly used&#xD;
      treatments including medication combinations [8]. It is clear that the depressive phase of&#xD;
      bipolar disorder is an important clinical problem and one in which there is a considerable&#xD;
      need for the development of new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS is a technique that was first developed in the mid 1980's which involves the use of a&#xD;
      time variable magnetic field to stimulate brain activity. rTMS methods have generally been&#xD;
      found to be well tolerated, safe and without complications such as the use of an anesthetic&#xD;
      that are required with more invasive forms of brain stimulation such as electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of rTMS to affect mood was first noted in normal controls in the late 1980's.&#xD;
      Studies using focal stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in depression&#xD;
      first appeared in the mid 1990's [9-11]. These studies produced promising results with&#xD;
      reduced depression severity following left prefrontal cortex (PFC) stimulation. Since that&#xD;
      time a considerable number of trials of left DLPFC rTMS have been conducted. The majority of&#xD;
      these studies have used 5-20 Hz stimulation frequency. Most of these have predominately been&#xD;
      small in sample size and of short duration (i.e., 10 treatments) (CIA pub 11). They have also&#xD;
      been confounded by concerns about the choice of sham stimulation type [12] and variation in&#xD;
      stimulation 'dose' provided. The studies with the most robust clinical effects have used a&#xD;
      higher number of pulses per subject and higher stimulation intensity levels, suggesting a&#xD;
      dose - response relationship (CIA pub 2,11). They have almost exclusively focused on the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with unipolar major depression although some of these studies have&#xD;
      included a subset of patients with BPAD-DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been at least 6 meta-analyses of the antidepressant effects of left PFC rTMS. All&#xD;
      but one have shown greater antidepressant effects of 2 weeks of HFL-TMS compared to sham;&#xD;
      these included an analysis of 6 reports [13], of 12 studies [14], of 16 studies [15], of 10&#xD;
      studies [16] and a Cochrane review of 14 [17]. The single negative study included only 6&#xD;
      reports with 91 subjects and as such had less power than most of the other meta-analyses. Of&#xD;
      the larger studies, Holtzheimer et al reported a weighted mean effect size of 0.81 [14], Burt&#xD;
      et al reported an effect size of 0.67 [15] and Kozel at al an effect size of 0.53 [16]. These&#xD;
      are moderate to large effects. However, the studies repeatedly report that the overall&#xD;
      clinical results observed were not that impressive. For example, a mean overall improvement&#xD;
      of only 23.8% on the HAMD in the blinded studies reviewed in [14] compared to 7.3% in the&#xD;
      sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempting to address the issue of definitely establishing the efficacy of rTMS in&#xD;
      depression, a large international trial has been recently completed. Conducted by a private&#xD;
      TMS manufacturer (Neuronetics Pty Ltd), this involved a randomized trial of HFL-TMS (10Hz)&#xD;
      compared to placebo over up to 9 weeks of treatment. The results of this study show the&#xD;
      statistically superiority of active over sham rTMS treatment [18]. Currently, the results of&#xD;
      this trial are being utilized in support of an FDA application for the Neuronetics device for&#xD;
      treatment of depression (M Demitrack, personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to sham controlled trials, there have also been a series of trials comparing&#xD;
      HFL-TMS to ECT [19-22]. Encouragingly, these have reported no differences in responses rates&#xD;
      between ECT and HFL-TMS except for one study including psychotic patients (showing greater&#xD;
      benefit with ECT in the psychotic group [22]) and a second trial which recently reported&#xD;
      better responses with bilateral or unilateral ECT of unlimited treatment duration compared to&#xD;
      a fixed course of 3 weeks of unilateral left PFC rTMS [23]. However, some of these studies&#xD;
      have not necessarily had sufficient power to detect subtle differences between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, several alternative rTMS paradigms have shown promise. Low frequency rTMS&#xD;
      applied to right PFC (LFR-TMS), contrary to high frequency rTMS, is known to reduce local&#xD;
      cortical excitability [24]. The initial trial of LFR-TMS established its efficacy in a non&#xD;
      treatment resistant sample of patients [25]. Funded by a previous NHMRC grant, we have&#xD;
      conducted research establishing the efficacy of LFR-TMS as compared to HFL-TMS and placebo&#xD;
      (CIA 15):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 60 patients were randomized to either HFL-TMS or LFR-TMS or a sham stimulation&#xD;
      condition (n=20 in each group). All had treatment resistant depression (TRD) and had failed&#xD;
      multiple antidepressant medication trials (mean number = 5.7 ± 3.4). There were no baseline&#xD;
      clinical or demographic differences between the three groups. Over the double blind phase of&#xD;
      the study there was clearly an antidepressant effect of both active groups that was superior&#xD;
      to the response to sham stimulation. There was a continued improvement in both active groups&#xD;
      across the 4 weeks of the study: for the group as whole, after the 4 weeks of treatment the&#xD;
      mean percentage change in MADRS score from baseline was 48.0 ± 17.9% (range 15.1 - 87.5%).&#xD;
      These results demonstrated that both HFL-TMS and LFR-TMS have substantial therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy and that robust clinical response appeared to require at least 20 sessions of&#xD;
      treatment with the parameters used. However, only a sub-population of patients responded to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equivalence of HFL-TMS and LFR-TMS has also been demonstrated in a more recent study&#xD;
      [26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Study 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have also conducted a large scale clinical effectiveness trial of LFR-TMS comparing 1 Hz&#xD;
      and 2 Hz stimulation to right PFC (CIA 47). This study involved the randomization of 130&#xD;
      patients with treatment resistant major depression to receive right PFC stimulation in a&#xD;
      single daily 15 minute train at either 1 or 2 Hz. 2 Hz stimulation was investigated as a&#xD;
      potential way of doubling the number of applied stimuli within identical treatment time (to&#xD;
      increase the treatment dose and potentially enhance treatment response). Treatment response&#xD;
      was equivalent between the 2 groups (62.3 24.0 % change in the 1 Hz group, 64.7 21.0% change&#xD;
      in the 2 Hz group over 4 weeks) with no difference in response. This does not support the&#xD;
      substitution of 2 Hz as an optimal condition for LFR-TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another alternative paradigm is sequential bilateral rTMS (SBrTMS), the application of&#xD;
      HFL-TMS and LFR-TMS, one after the other in the same treatment sessions. We have recently&#xD;
      completed the first large study of this technique and the first to extend treatment beyond 10&#xD;
      days (CIA 33):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Study 3. In the study conducted, we combined HFL-TMS and LFR-TMS sequentially in&#xD;
      each treatment session in a trial comparing active to sham stimulation (n=50, 25 per group).&#xD;
      Importantly, treatment was provided for up to 6 weeks, longer than any previously published&#xD;
      rTMS trial. In this study there was clearly a marked benefit of active over sham stimulation.&#xD;
      There was a significant difference between the groups at 2 weeks (F(1,25)=25.5, p&lt;0.001)&#xD;
      which remained significant at all other trial time points (F(5,44)=3.9, p=0.005). Patients&#xD;
      continued to respond across the 6 weeks of active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most critically, by study end, 13 of 25 patients in the active group (&gt;50%) and only 2 in the&#xD;
      sham group met response criteria on the HAMD. 9 patients in the active group (36%) and no&#xD;
      patients in the sham group met criteria for clinical remission. A further 45% of patients in&#xD;
      the sham group who crossed over to active treatment at trial end went on to respond in a&#xD;
      manner meeting response criteria (33% remission criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS in Bipolar Disorder - Depressive Phase Markedly fewer trials have been conducted&#xD;
      investigating the effects of rTMS in BPAD. Of these, a small number have focused on the&#xD;
      treatment of mania using high-frequency stimulation applied to the right DLPFC. Initial open&#xD;
      studies of this technique appeared promising, although negative results have also been&#xD;
      published [27] and there is need for a substantive definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even fewer studies have focused specifically on the treatment of BPAD-DP. In the first of&#xD;
      these, Dolberg et al randomized 20 patients to HFL-TMS or placebo [28]. Unfortunately the&#xD;
      brief report published provides few experimental details but the active group appeared to do&#xD;
      better than the sham group after 2 weeks of treatment. In contrast, in the only other&#xD;
      randomized trial, Nahas et al found no difference in response between active HFL-TMS and sham&#xD;
      in a study of 23 patients [29]. In this study, there was a response rate of 36% in the active&#xD;
      and 33% in the sham group. The authors questioned whether the type of sham coil they used was&#xD;
      really in part 'active' due the degree of brain stimulation produced with the coil&#xD;
      orientation they applied. The same group followed 7 patients who responded to active rTMS&#xD;
      over 12 months providing weekly maintenance rTMS [30]. There appeared to be some degree of&#xD;
      benefit of maintenance treatment although this was difficult to quantify due to the open&#xD;
      nature of the follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only other source of information about the usefulness of rTMS in BPAD-DP comes from the&#xD;
      description of the response of these patients in general trials with mixed samples.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, some of the larger studies including the Neuronetics trial described above&#xD;
      [18] have excluded BPAD patients and most of the studies other than our own have had too&#xD;
      small samples to allow meaningful data to be extracted on subgroups. In studies we have&#xD;
      conducted, none of which was designed to directly investigate rTMS responses in BPAD, a total&#xD;
      of 50 BPAD-DP have been treated to date. These have been treated across 5 separate trials. In&#xD;
      most of these trials the number of subjects is too limited to draw any useful inferences.&#xD;
      However, a total of 21 patients with BPAD-DP received LFR-TMS in the clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      trial described above over a 4 week period (study 2). In this group, there was a significant&#xD;
      reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores between baseline and week 2&#xD;
      (baseline = 21.6 ±5.7, week 2 = 12.0±6.3, p&lt;0.001) and between baseline and week 4 (baseline&#xD;
      = 21.6 ±5.7, week 4 = 9.7±6.3, p&lt;0.001). Interestingly given that this is the first published&#xD;
      sample with a treatment duration of greater than 2 weeks, the group showed a significant&#xD;
      reduction in HAMD scores between week 2 and 4 (p&lt;0.05) indicating the benefit of the longer&#xD;
      period of treatment. 15 (71%) of these patients met response criteria (&gt;50% reduction in HAMD&#xD;
      scores by trial end).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this study did not include a sham control group, it strongly suggests that low&#xD;
      frequency right sided rTMS has therapeutic potential in BPAD-DP which warrants the conduct of&#xD;
      a definitive randomized controlled trial. Despite widespread communication within the&#xD;
      international rTMS research community (the CIA of this grant is a committee member of the&#xD;
      International Society for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), we are aware of no large study&#xD;
      exploring the use of rTMS in BPAD-DP that is completed and unpublished or currently underway.&#xD;
      In addition, we are not aware of any current or past studies exploring the role of LFR-TMS in&#xD;
      this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER GAPS IN THE LITERATURE Clearly BPAD is a relapsing illness and there is no substantive&#xD;
      data on the impact of rTMS on longer term outcomes. Long term follow-up data with rTMS&#xD;
      treatment is very limited in general. One study has reported similar 6 month relapse rates&#xD;
      following rTMS and ECT treatment [31] but only considered the outcome in a limited group of&#xD;
      patients (n=21 in the rTMS group). Unpublished data from the Neuronetics trial (CIA 52)&#xD;
      suggests that relapse rates post rTMS are similar or lower than those seen in previously&#xD;
      published large ECT studies (M Demitrack, personal communication). We have reported relapse&#xD;
      and re-treatment at an average time of 9 months post acute treatment but this sample was not&#xD;
      comprehensively followed between the end of acute treatment and relapse (CIA 36). We will aim&#xD;
      to significantly contribute to understanding the outcome of treatment by including structured&#xD;
      assessments over a 12 month follow up period in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses / Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with high frequency left sided rTMS will result in a greater reduction in HAMD&#xD;
           scores than sham rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment with low frequency right sided rTMS will result in a greater reduction in HAMD&#xD;
           scores than sham rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses 3. Greater than 50% of treatment responders to rTMS will continue to&#xD;
      experience clinical benefits from rTMS, as indexed by HAMD scores remaining within 25% of the&#xD;
      HAMD score achieved at the end of the acute treatment phase during the 6 months of post acute&#xD;
      treatment follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Treatment with high frequency left sided rTMS and low frequency right sided rTMS will both&#xD;
      be well tolerated as assessed by a retention rate in treatment of greater than 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology including project design and sequence of procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design The study has been designed to allow the reporting of results in a manner&#xD;
      consistent with the international CONSORT guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a 4-week (20 session) randomized double-blind clinical trial with 3&#xD;
      treatment arms conducted at a two sites (Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre in Melbourne and&#xD;
      the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto,&#xD;
      Toronto, Ontario, Canada).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur via the generation of a computer number sequence with stratification&#xD;
      by site and diagnosis of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      immediately prior to the commencement of the first treatment session, after the measurement&#xD;
      of bilateral resting motor thresholds with standard means (CIA 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study phase (phase 1) will involve the 4 week randomized controlled trial conducted&#xD;
      under strict double-blind conditions. Fidelity of the blinding process will be assessed at&#xD;
      the end of this period with patients and raters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will involve the provision of open label treatment with LFR-TMS to patients who&#xD;
      received sham treatment and wish to receive 'active' rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responders to active treatment from phase 1 or 2 will enter phase 3, a 6 month follow up&#xD;
      period where participants will be reassessed at 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size We aim to recruit 40 patients into each group (total n=120). The sample size&#xD;
      calculation for the study was conducted based on the within group standard deviation of 7&#xD;
      (this was the upper limit of the standard deviation for the bipolar patients HAMD scores in&#xD;
      the low frequency right sided rTMS trial data provided above) and between group difference of&#xD;
      5.0 points (change in 2 active groups of 12 (based on 4 week change data above) and change of&#xD;
      7 in the sham group allowing for a substantial placebo response). With an alpha of 0.05 the&#xD;
      study will have a power of 0.91 to detect a difference in end scores between the 3 groups&#xD;
      (calculation in PASS 8.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measures Demographic variables and potential co-variates will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline following a clinical interview. These will include the duration of the current&#xD;
      episode, years from first diagnosis, number of previous episodes, type and dose of current&#xD;
      and previous treatment and family history of mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measures will be performed at randomization, at 2 and 4 weeks as well as at the&#xD;
      follow up assessments. A trained rater who is blind to treatment type will administer all&#xD;
      measures. Raters will be required to maintain &gt;90% reliability on the primary outcome&#xD;
      assessments on ratings with 6 monthly assessments based on videotaped interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be scores on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Depression (HAMD) [33]. In addition we will use the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology&#xD;
      (IDS) - Clinician Version and Patient version [34]. In addition, we will rate patients on the&#xD;
      Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) to assess for the possibility of emergent manic symptoms&#xD;
      [35].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments made at baseline to explore potential predictors of clinical response will&#xD;
      include the CORE rating of melancholia [36], the Measure of Parental Styles [37], the&#xD;
      Depressive Personality Inventory [38] and the Costello and Comrey trait anxiety measure [39].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess for the possibility that rTMS treatment may result in cognitive side effects, we&#xD;
      will assess cognition at baseline and the end of 4 weeks of treatment with the following&#xD;
      tests. They may also provide evidence of improved executive / frontal functioning produced&#xD;
      with the treatment: Personal Memory Questionnaire, Block Design Test, Verbal Paired&#xD;
      Associates Recall and Recognition, Visual Paired Associates, Digit Span (WAIS), Simple and&#xD;
      Complex Reaction Time, Finger Tapping Test, Verbal Fluency, Trail making A&amp;B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS Treatment TMS will be administered with Medtronic Magpro30 magnetic stimulators using&#xD;
      70mm figure of 8 coils. Prior to the commencement of treatment TMS, single pulse TMS will be&#xD;
      used to measure the resting motor thresholds (RMT) for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB)&#xD;
      bilaterally in all subjects using standard published methods (CIA 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation parameters rTMS will be administered on a daily basis 5 days per week for all&#xD;
      subjects: Left: 10Hz, 110% RMT, 40 Trains, 5 second duration, 25 second inter-train interval&#xD;
      (i.e., 2000 pulses) Right: 1 Hz, 110% RMT, 1 Train of 1200 pulses Sham: Sham patients will be&#xD;
      successively randomized to sham stimulation on either the left or right at the same&#xD;
      stimulation parameters but using a sham coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions have been matched for treatment duration. Missed sessions will be 'made up' by&#xD;
      an extension of the treatment duration but only one missed session will be allowed per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two active conditions have been matched for approximate treatment duration rather than&#xD;
      pulse number in keeping with previous research (CIA 15). Matching for pulse number would&#xD;
      result in either a left treatment schedule with significantly fewer pulses than appears&#xD;
      effective in other studies or an excessively long right treatment schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation localization This will follow a slight modification of standard procedures.&#xD;
      Firstly, the site for the optimal activation of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle in the&#xD;
      contralateral hand will be located whilst stimulating the relevant motor cortical region at&#xD;
      supra-threshold intensity. This site will be marked on the scalp. We will then measure 6 cm&#xD;
      anteriorly on the scalp surface and mark it with ink. This point will be then used as the&#xD;
      site of stimulation. The majority of rTMS studies have measured 5 cm anteriorly. However,&#xD;
      this has been shown to result consistently in localization that is posterior to the&#xD;
      dorsolateral PFC [40]. The measurement described here should result in more consistent&#xD;
      treatment of dorsolateral PFC but still provide considerable stimulation overlap with the&#xD;
      established '5 cm' site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan Each subject will undergo a 3D sagittally orientated T1 weighted structural MR scan&#xD;
      on the 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner at the Alfred or Toronto Western Hospital (128 slices). Analysis&#xD;
      of scalp to cortex distance in prefrontal cortex and at the site of stimulation will be&#xD;
      conducted using previously published methods [41] by a post doctoral research fellow with&#xD;
      considerable experience in structural neuroimaging analysis using the ANALYSE software&#xD;
      package. During scanning, the site of motor cortex and the stimulation site will be marked on&#xD;
      the scalp with 2 vitamin E capsules. This will also allow the post hoc analysis of our actual&#xD;
      site of stimulation in comparison to cortical landmarks of the DLPFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) EEG before treatment will be used to examine mean absolute&#xD;
      spectral power within 5 frequency bands. The mean absolute power (in squared microvolts per&#xD;
      hertz) will then be computed within the following 5 frequency bands: delta (0.5-3.5 Hz),&#xD;
      theta (3.5-7.5 Hz); alpha (7.5-12.5 Hz); beta 1 (12.5-20.5 Hz), and beta 2 (20.5-32.5 Hz).&#xD;
      EEG activation / spectral power will be assessed at rest (eyes open and closed) and during&#xD;
      cognitive engagement in several tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications will be continued during rTMS if considered safe to do so. Patients will only&#xD;
      enter the study if there has been no dose increase in the 4 weeks prior to randomization and&#xD;
      there has been no significant improvement (&gt;15% change) in depression in one week between&#xD;
      screening and the first study assessment visit (based on HAMD ratings at these two visits).&#xD;
      The commencement of any new psychotropic medication will not be allowed in the 4 weeks prior&#xD;
      to study entry and during the study period. The continuation of antidepressant medication /&#xD;
      mood stabilizers places the trial in a realistic clinical framework. We will minimize the&#xD;
      confounding effect of medication by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ensuring the patients are stable (stable dose and not improving) prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Controlling for medication status in secondary statistical analyzes. This way of dealing&#xD;
           with medication effects has appeared to quite satisfactory in our previous trials (CIA&#xD;
           15, 33) and not confounded treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The primary analysis will be conducted on HAMD and secondary analysis on&#xD;
      the IDS scores from baseline to week 4 using the 'last observation carried forward' method in&#xD;
      the case of subjects who exit the study prematurely. ANOVA tests and 2 tests will be used to&#xD;
      examine differences between demographic and clinical characteristics between the groups for&#xD;
      continuous and categorical variables following testing for normality of the data. Repeated&#xD;
      measures general linear models will be computed to look for differences in group scores&#xD;
      across the study time points (baseline, week 2, week 4) with group as the between subjects&#xD;
      variable. Concurrent antidepressant use will be included in a secondary analysis as a&#xD;
      covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the follow up phase will descriptively compare the number of patients who&#xD;
      continue to report depressive symptoms below the HAMD threshold for clinical response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be included if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a DSM-IV diagnosis of a bipolar disorder (type I or II) and currently meet&#xD;
             criteria for a major depressive episode (SCID 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be aged 18-70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have the persistence of depressive symptoms for at least one month at sufficient&#xD;
             severity to warrant a diagnosis of major depressive episode&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score of &gt; 20 (moderate - severe depression).&#xD;
             Including only a more severely ill group of subjects limits the placebo response rate&#xD;
             [32]. Moreover, this will allow us to address the application of rTMS methods in the&#xD;
             most clinically relevant subgroup of patients (in addition helping to constrain group&#xD;
             heterogeneity, a major issue in depression research).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have had no increase or initiation of new antidepressant (or other psychoactive)&#xD;
             therapy in the 4 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have an unstable medical condition, neurological disorder or any history&#xD;
             of a seizure disorder or are currently pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the opinion of the investigator, are a sufficient suicidal risk to require&#xD;
             immediate electro-convulsive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a current DSM IV diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence disorder, a diagnosis&#xD;
             of a personality disorder (SCID II) or another axis 1 disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please note: several of these criteria (e.g. inclusion criteria 1 &amp; 2, exclusion criteria&#xD;
        3) have been selected to explicitly constrain the heterogeneity of the sample to increase&#xD;
        the likely power of the study to detect differences between the groups given the&#xD;
        potentially subtle difference between the treatment methods.&#xD;
