      This study will see if bacteria differ between children who have allergies or asthma and&#xD;
      children who do not have allergies or asthma. Previous research suggests that some bacteria&#xD;
      may protect against allergies and asthma. This study may provide more information on why some&#xD;
      children develop allergies and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Dentistry who are between&#xD;
      6 and 11 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of participating children complete a questionnaire about the child and the child's&#xD;
      health. The child provides a saliva sample by chewing a small piece of wax and spitting in a&#xD;
      cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The saliva sample is analyzed in the laboratory for bacteria, yeast and antibodies&#xD;
      (substances the body produces to fight germs).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of and to establish methods for a&#xD;
      future study that will investigate associations between oral bacteria and allergic diseases&#xD;
      in children. Rates of allergic diseases such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema have increased&#xD;
      in the U.S. over the past several decades. One explanation for those increases is the Hygiene&#xD;
      Hypothesis, which contends that decreases in microbial exposures have made the population&#xD;
      more reactive to environmental allergens. Reports of protective associations for various&#xD;
      infections and exposures to farms, pets, siblings, and day care have provided support for the&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Preliminary work by NIEHS researchers suggests that some oral bacterial exposures&#xD;
      may be beneficial. NIEHS researchers recently reported that elevated serum antibody&#xD;
      concentrations to two common oral pathogens were associated with lower prevalences of asthma,&#xD;
      wheeze, and hay fever in the U.S. population. Using a mouse model, NIEHS researchers found&#xD;
      that immune responses involved in allergic airway inflammation could be modulated by&#xD;
      infection with an oral pathogen. To further investigate these associations in humans, NIEHS&#xD;
      researchers, in collaboration with UNC researchers, are planning an observational study that&#xD;
      will collect saliva samples from and allergy information on child patients at the UNC-Chapel&#xD;
      Hill School of Dentistry. Because we anticipate that several hundred children might have to&#xD;
      be enrolled, we are proposing to test methods in a pilot study of 60 children. Twenty&#xD;
      children will be recruited from each of three pediatric clinics. A research assistant will&#xD;
      obtain the parent's consent and the child's assent and administer a questionnaire to the&#xD;
      parent. The child's dentist will collect one teaspoon of saliva by having the child chew a&#xD;
      piece of inert wax and spit into a sterile collection cup. Samples will be transported to the&#xD;
      NIEHS and analyzed for bacterial species and for allergy-related cytokines. The specific aims&#xD;
      for this pilot study are: 1) to identify the most efficient recruitment strategies, 2) to&#xD;
      estimate response rates, 3) to estimate the distribution of allergic diseases among the&#xD;
      children, 4) to identify any problematic consent form and questionnaire items, 5) to optimize&#xD;
      saliva collection and laboratory protocols, and 6) to estimate statistical parameters&#xD;
      required for more precise sample size calculations. Information gained from this pilot study&#xD;
      will allow us to decide whether a larger study among this clinic population is feasible and&#xD;
      to design a more efficient study if we decide to proceed.&#xD;
