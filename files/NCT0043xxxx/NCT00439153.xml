  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tourniquet cuffs are routinely used to stop blood flow in patients' arms or legs during&#xD;
      surgery. This allows surgeons to better visualize anatomical structures during the procedure.&#xD;
      Although complications after surgery are rare, patients sometimes suffer from pain or&#xD;
      numbness in their limb and redness of the skin in the area where the cuff was applied. Using&#xD;
      the lowest pressure possible minimizes the chance of these problems. Previous studies,&#xD;
      conducted on adults, have shown that basing the cuff pressure on the minimum amount of&#xD;
      pressure necessary to stop blood flow to the limb (known as limb occlusion pressure, or LOP)&#xD;
      can lead to lower cuff pressures successfully being used. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the magnitude by which tourniquet cuff pressure can be reduced in children using a&#xD;
      tourniquet instrument capable of measuring LOP in combination with tourniquet cuffs selected&#xD;
      to fit the size and contour of the limb. The tourniquet instrument and cuffs used in this&#xD;
      study are all commercially available and approved for use with children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that use of a commercially available tourniquet instrument capable of&#xD;
      calculating limb occlusion pressure in combination with tourniquet cuffs selected and applied&#xD;
      according to a standardized procedure will produce surgical fields of equal or superior&#xD;
      quality with significantly lower tourniquet cuff pressures.&#xD;

      1. Purpose The risk of tourniquet-related injury increases with increasing tourniquet cuff&#xD;
           pressure, therefore techniques intended to minimise tourniquet cuff pressures should be&#xD;
           compared to current standard methods. A commercially available pneumatic tourniquet&#xD;
           capable of measuring the pressure needed to occlude blood flow to a limb, known as limb&#xD;
           occlusion pressure, combined with contoured tourniquet cuffs has been shown to&#xD;
           significantly decrease necessary cuff pressures in adult patients. The magnitude of&#xD;
           reduction in cuff pressure in a paediatric population has not yet been determined.&#xD;
           Results of this study may decrease the standard tourniquet pressures used by paediatric&#xD;
           orthopaedic surgeons, thereby reducing the risk of tourniquet-related injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Justification Many studies have shown that both tourniquet pressure and time should be&#xD;
           minimised to reduce the risk of tourniquet related injuries and post operative&#xD;
           complaints. As the purpose of the tourniquet is to maintain a bloodless surgical field,&#xD;
           in theory the minimum cuff pressure required to occlude arterial flow (the 'Limb&#xD;
           Occlusion Pressure' or LOP), plus a safety margin to allow for changing conditions&#xD;
           during the procedure, should be used. In practice, most surgeons use a standard pressure&#xD;
           based on experience, or based on an indirect measurement of systolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous studies have shown that basing the cuff pressure on the LOP measured on each&#xD;
           patient immediately prior to limb exsanguination and cuff inflation can lead to lower&#xD;
           cuff pressures being used on many adult patients. This technique directly measures the&#xD;
           cuff pressure required to occlude flow, thereby accounting for the individual patient's&#xD;
           limb and vessel characteristics as well as the type and fit of the cuff. Unfortunately,&#xD;
           the standard method of measuring limb occlusion pressure (monitoring a distal artery&#xD;
           with a Doppler ultrasound probe while slowly increasing cuff pressure) is awkward and&#xD;
           time consuming. A tourniquet device that allows automatic measurement of LOP at the&#xD;
           start of each surgical procedure is now commercially available. This device has been&#xD;
           shown to significantly reduce cuff inflation pressures necessary to occlude blood flow&#xD;
           in adults; however, the magnitude of reduction in cuff pressure has not previously been&#xD;
           determined in a paediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous studies also suggest that wider tourniquet cuffs that are contoured such that&#xD;
           they match the taper of the limb when applied occlude blood flow at lower pressures in&#xD;
           adults. It is of interest to determine if wider cuffs, and contour cuffs designed to&#xD;
           better fit tapered limbs, in combination with LOP calculation, allow for significantly&#xD;
           lower cuff pressures in practical use on paediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives Quality of surgical field will be the primary outcome of this study.&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes will include reduction in tourniquet cuff pressures and incidence of&#xD;
           neurapraxias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Method The target population will include subjects scheduled to receive&#xD;
           anterior cruciate reconstruction at BC Children's Hospital by Dr. Chris Reilly. Subjects&#xD;
           will prospectively be randomized into two groups. In the control group, tourniquet&#xD;
           inflation pressures consistent with the current standard of care at BC Children Hospital&#xD;
           will be used. In the experimental group, tourniquet inflation pressures will be&#xD;
           determined by an automated calculation of limb occlusion pressure plus a predetermined&#xD;
           safety margin. This technique has previously been shown to be equivalent to the Doppler&#xD;
           technique for determining tourniquet inflation pressures, which is the gold standard.&#xD;
           This is a non-inferiority trial with a power set at 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. The&#xD;
           estimated sample size is 21 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Method The study is a single blinded, randomised, prospective clinical comparison of two&#xD;
           techniques used for determining tourniquet cuff pressure. The quality of surgical field&#xD;
           will be compared in the experimental group (cuff pressure determined by LOP calculation)&#xD;
           and the control group (standard cuff pressure of 300 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, 21 sealed envelopes indicating 'LOP + paediatric cuff' and 21&#xD;
      indicating 'standard pressure + standard cuff' will be prepared. The envelopes will be placed&#xD;
      in blocks of 4 and 6 in order to minimise the predictive effect. After the grouping of the&#xD;
      patient is determined, the person normally responsible for tourniquet cuff application will&#xD;
      select an envelope and apply the indicated cuff at the indicated pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 'LOP + paediatric cuff' group, cuff selection and application will be based on a&#xD;
      standardized guide used to determine the most appropriate size and shape of cuff for the&#xD;
      given limb. See cuff application guidelines (attached). Once the indicated cuff has been&#xD;
      applied, the photoplethysmographic LOP sensor will be clipped to a toe of the affected leg,&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) will be recorded, and the automated LOP routine activated. LOP&#xD;
      and recommended tourniquet pressure (RTP = LOP + predetermined margin) will be displayed&#xD;
      within 1 minute and recorded. The limb will then be exsanguinated following the surgeon's&#xD;
      usual procedure and the cuff inflated to the RTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 'standard pressure + standard cuff' group, cuff selection and application will be&#xD;
      made based on the principal investigator's current practice. The limb will then be&#xD;
      exsanguinated following the surgeon's usual procedure and the cuff inflated to a standard&#xD;
      pressure, based on current practice and predetermined by the surgeon to be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the surgeon's discretion, the cuff pressure may be increased or decreased at any time&#xD;
      during the procedure, with SBP, time, and the reason for change recorded. Immediately&#xD;
      following the end of the procedure, the surgeon (principal investigator) will rate the&#xD;
      overall quality of the surgical field using a visual analogue scale. He will also be provided&#xD;
      with an area to comment on visualization capabilities during specific aspects of the&#xD;
      procedure or any difficulties that may have occurred. Tourniquet inflation time and variation&#xD;
      in SBP taken from the anaesthetists chart will be recorded. Incidence of post operative&#xD;
      neurapraxias will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment and enrolment will continue until enough subjects have been recruited to&#xD;
      show statistical significance, which is currently estimated to be 21 subjects per group.&#xD;
      Differences in the quality of the surgical field and tourniquet inflation pressures will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups, in addition to incidence of neurapraxias.&#xD;
