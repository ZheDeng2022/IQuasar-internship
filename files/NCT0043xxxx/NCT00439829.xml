  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to elucidate the effect of synchronizing initiation of ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation treatment with follicular wave emergence in poor responder patients undergoing&#xD;
      IVF/ICSI and ET. We hypothesize that initiating treatment on day 1 versus day 4 of the cycle&#xD;
      will increase the number of follicles recruited and oocytes retrieved.&#xD;

      Sample Population Eligible patients undergoing IVF or ICSI for the treatment of infertility&#xD;
      in the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center at the University of Saskatchewan (ARTUS;&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences) in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan&#xD;
      and the Genesis Fertility Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia will be identified by study&#xD;
      physicians and nurses. Patients with a history of poor response to ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      therapy in a previous IVF or ICSI cycle, who have already decided to undergo a subsequent&#xD;
      treatment cycle, will be contacted by a study physician and offered enrolment into the study.&#xD;
      Patients exhibiting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age of 43 years or younger&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18&lt;BMI&lt;35&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of poor response to ovarian stimulation as determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previously cancelled oocyte retrieval procedure due to &lt; 4 follicles greater than 12 mm&#xD;
           on ultrasound OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt; 3 mature oocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam performed within the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal or corrected levels of TSH and Prolactin within the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has not taken ovarian suppression therapy within 1 month of initiating study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic medical conditions such as renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented ovarian failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of only one ovary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum Day 3 FSH &gt; 12 IU/L within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ovaries inaccessible transvaginally&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any contraindications to ovarian stimulation treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in an investigational drug trial in the 30 days prior to the pre-study&#xD;
           visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle Cancellation Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development of &lt; 3 follicles &gt; 12 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size A sample size of 80 women (40 women per treatment group) has been chosen. This&#xD;
      calculation was based on a standard deviation of 3.0 in each treatment group, a significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05 (2-tailed test), a mean difference of 2.0 follicles and a power of 80%. The&#xD;
      standard deviation used in the power calculation was based on similar studies performed in&#xD;
      domestic animal species. Approximately 120 IVF/ICSI cycles are performed each year in the&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at the University of&#xD;
      Saskatchewan and approximately 600 cycles are performed at the Genesis Fertility Centre.&#xD;
      Approximately 5-10% of patients are proven poor responders. Thus, with an anticipated 75%&#xD;
      recruitment rate, we expect to recruit 80 patients in the study over a 24 month period. It is&#xD;
      expected that 25% of research subjects will be enrolled at the ARTUS Centre and 75% of&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at the Genesis Fertility Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Women who are believed to be eligible for the study will be asked to visit&#xD;
      the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center at the University of Saskatchewan (ARTUS) or&#xD;
      the Genesis Fertility Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia for a pre-study appointment. At&#xD;
      this visit, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed. If patients meet all study&#xD;
      criteria, consent will be obtained and each woman will be randomized to either the control&#xD;
      group (i.e. treatment starting on day 4) or experimental group (i.e., treatment starting on&#xD;
      day 1). A medical history and vital signs will be performed. Study drug administration, diary&#xD;
      card use and potential adverse reactions will be reviewed at the pre-study visit. Diary cards&#xD;
      will be used to monitor study drug administration, adverse reactions, and concomitant&#xD;
      medications used during the study. Diary cards will be reviewed with the patient by study&#xD;
      personnel throughout the duration of the study. Serious adverse events will be reported by&#xD;
      the investigators to the drug safety group of the study drug manufacturers and the Biomedical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Board, in accordance with Tri-Council Policy guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be instructed to call the clinic on day 1 of menses. If menses begins&#xD;
      before 6 pm, that day will be considered day 1. If menses begins after 6 pm, the next day&#xD;
      will be considered day 1. Women randomized to the day 1 treatment group will be instructed to&#xD;
      begin ovarian stimulation therapy (Gonal-f, Serono Canada) on day 1 and visit the clinic to&#xD;
      undergo their first transvaginal ultrasound examination on day 2. Women randomized to the day&#xD;
      4 treatment group will be instructed to begin ovarian stimulation on day 4 and visit the&#xD;
      clinic on day 4 for their first transvaginal ultrasound examination. Ultrasound examinations&#xD;
      will be performed to determine the number of follicles developing in the ovaries. Ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations will continue every 2-4 days for each woman, as per the normal standard of care.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn intermittently during stimulation to determine serum concentrations of&#xD;
      estradiol-17B. Each participant will be asked to perform a home urine pregnancy test before&#xD;
      taking their first dose of study medication. If a woman is found to be pregnant, she will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a follicle &gt; 13 mm is detected OR if 6 or more follicles &gt; 10 mm develop and E2 is &gt;&#xD;
      1000 pmol/L, women will be instructed to begin taking a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone&#xD;
      Antagonist (Cetrotide, Serono Canada) and recombinant Luteinizing Hormone (Luveris, Serono&#xD;
      Canada). Gonal F, Cetrotide and Luveris administration will continue daily until human&#xD;
      Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG, Pharmaceutical Partners of Canada Inc.) is administered when &gt; 3&#xD;
      follicles reach &gt; 17 mm in diameter. It is anticipated that the duration of ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation therapy will be 8-16 days. Shorter or longer stimulation intervals may result in&#xD;
      cycle cancellation. Oocytes will be isolated, evaluated and fertilized following hCG&#xD;
      administration, according to the normal standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type and dose of stimulation therapy will be standardized among women as noted in&#xD;
      Appendix B. Women will be asked to visit the clinic for a follow-up appointment with the&#xD;
      physician and study nurse approximately 4 weeks after the oocyte retrieval. Adverse events,&#xD;
      concomitant medications and diaries will be reviewed at this time. After the follow-up&#xD;
      appointment, women will have completed all study-related procedures. Adverse events&#xD;
      persisting at the time of study completion will be followed as deemed medically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures performed in this study adhere to Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The only&#xD;
      procedures that differ from those carried out for routine patient care are the initiation of&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation therapy on day 1, the urine pregnancy test prior to initiating therapy&#xD;
      and the completion of diary cards by the patients to monitor study drug administration,&#xD;
      adverse events and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of follicles &gt; 15 mm on day of hCG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peak serum estradiol concentrations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of antral follicles (day 1 or day 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of follicles aspirated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of oocytes obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oocyte morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fertilization rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of viable embryos (day 3 and day 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blastocyst rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of embryos transferred&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical pregnancy rate (serum ß-hCG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study endpoints will be compared between women in the control versus experimental group.&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be performed by the study investigators once 40 patients have&#xD;
      completed study procedures. The overall incidence of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)&#xD;
      requiring hospitalization in women undergoing IVF/ICSI is approximately 3%. Therefore, in 40&#xD;
      normal responder patients we would expect an incidence of OHSS-related hospitalization to be&#xD;
      approximately 1.2%. If more than 1 patient in each treatment group has been admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital for OHSS after 40 women have completed study procedures, the study will be reviewed&#xD;
      for possible termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foreseeable Risks and Discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks during study participation include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  discomfort during transvaginal ultrasound examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  discomfort and bruising at the site of venipuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  redness, swelling and discomfort at the drug injection site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1-10% of normally-responding patients, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurs in&#xD;
      which too many follicles develop, placing the woman at risk for hospitalization. Because a&#xD;
      suboptimal number of follicles develop in women who respond poorly to ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      therapy, we believe that the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation is extremely low to zero.&#xD;
      However, because we cannot predict the outcome of initiating therapy on day 1 of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle, we cannot guarantee that hyperstimulation will not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the above-mentioned risks are related to current standard of care for IVF. The risks&#xD;
      of OHSS will be minimized by adherence to the usual standard of care for ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      monitoring. Patients felt to be at risk for developing OHSS will have their dose of exogenous&#xD;
      FSH and hCG therapy dropped, as per the usual standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that patients become ill or injured as a result of participating in this study,&#xD;
      necessary medical treatment will be made available at no additional cost to the patient. By&#xD;
      signing the consent form, patients do not waive any of their legal rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits There are no guaranteed benefits for women participating in this study. However, if&#xD;
      our hypothesis is proven, women may benefit from an increased number of recruited follicles.&#xD;
      We anticipate that the results of this study will increase our understanding of poor response&#xD;
      to ovarian stimulation, and lead to the development of better treatments for couples&#xD;
      undergoing IVF/ICSI and ET in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs Partial drug coverage will be provided by Serono Canada Inc. to participants in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality All participants will be identified in the study by their initials and&#xD;
      assigned patient study number. Only study personnel will have access to study-related records&#xD;
      during the conduct of the study. The contents of study related records will not be available&#xD;
      to any party other than the University of Saskatchewan Ethics Board, the study sponsor, and&#xD;
      government regulatory agencies unless required by law. A report of the results of this study&#xD;
      may be made to Health Canada (HC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, USA) while&#xD;
      maintaining confidentiality of patient identification. The results of this study may also be&#xD;
      used for medical and scientific publications but patient identity will not be disclosed.&#xD;
      Study files will be archived by the scientific investigator for 25 years at Royal University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary Participation/Withdrawal from Study Participation in this study is voluntary.&#xD;
      Patients may decide not to participate or may withdraw at any time. Refusal to participate&#xD;
      in, or withdrawal from, the study will not affect the future medical care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study may be ended at any time, without patient consent. Reasons may&#xD;
      include, but are not limited to, patient's failure to follow study instructions, the&#xD;
      appearance of side effects, or study cancellation due to administrative reasons. If &lt; 3&#xD;
      follicles develop to a diameter of 12 mm or larger, the patient will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study and the IVF/ICSI cycle may be cancelled.&#xD;
