    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether semi-annual fluoride varnish applications&#xD;
      combined with caregiver counseling are effective in preventing and reducing a severe form of&#xD;
      dental decay, known as early childhood caries, in native and non-native children aged 6&#xD;
      months to 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood caries (ECC) is by far the most common chronic disease among Canadian&#xD;
      Aboriginal children, affecting nearly 90% of First Nations preschoolers in Ontario. It is the&#xD;
      number one cause of oral health disparities between native and non-native children. ECC&#xD;
      negatively impacts on the quality of life of children suffering from the disease and the&#xD;
      caregivers and family members who care for them. To address the problem of ECC, a range of&#xD;
      health promotion campaigns, including parent education aimed at balancing the knowledge and&#xD;
      values of First Nations communities with the recommendations of the scientific community,&#xD;
      have been implemented but these initiatives have had limited success in reducing the impact&#xD;
      of ECC and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While oral health promotion campaigns have raised awareness of the severity of ECC among&#xD;
      these communities, the literature shows that for this age cohort, increasing host resistance&#xD;
      through professionally applied topical fluoride (PATF) applications at regular intervals may&#xD;
      achieve better results. Of all the PATF methods, slow-release fluoride varnish may be the&#xD;
      most practical alternative to the use of gels, foams and rinses, as it decreases the risk of&#xD;
      fluoride ingestion and is associated with greater patient acceptability. Fluoride varnish has&#xD;
      shown promise as a caries reduction agent but more evidence for the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      intervention is needed, particularly for high-caries-risk populations like those in&#xD;
      Aboriginal communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of fluoride varnish (Duraflor, 5%&#xD;
      NaF, Pharmascience) combined with caregiver counseling in preventing and reducing ECC in&#xD;
      Aboriginal communities, in a 2-year randomized controlled trial. Methods: The trial enrolled&#xD;
      1226 children aged 6 months to 5 years from the Sioux Lookout Zone (SLZ) First Nations&#xD;
      reserves and 149 from Thunder Bay (NW Ontario). Twenty First Nations communities were&#xD;
      randomized to 2 study groups; families in both groups received oral health counseling and&#xD;
      restorative dental care provided by the SLZ Dental Program - one group received no fluoride&#xD;
      varnish (FV0) and the other received FV 2-3Ã—/yr. The same subjects were examined for the&#xD;
      dmft/s indices by trained and calibrated dental hygienists in 2003, 2004 and 2005. A&#xD;
      caregiver questionnaire assessed the impact of ECC on the quality of life of the child and&#xD;
      the family. The SLZ Hospital provided data on children's dental general anesthetic (GA)&#xD;
      procedures. Comparative cross-sectional oral health data for 416 (2003), 687 (2004) and 544&#xD;
      (2005) 3-5 yr-olds attending Junior Kindergarten in Thunder Bay, not receiving fluoride&#xD;
      treatments, were collected by the Thunder Bay District Health Unit's dental hygienists and&#xD;
      recorders. Results will assist decision makers in developing programs for addressing the&#xD;
      problem of ECC in high-caries-risk populations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with at least one primary tooth present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 6 months to &lt;6 years. Children under 6 months of age may be enrolled in the study&#xD;
             if at least one primary tooth has erupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residing in one of the First Nations Communities in the Sioux Lookout Zone or in the&#xD;
             Thunder Bay District Area, both located in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parental consent must be provided. If the parent is not the primary caregiver, a legal&#xD;
             guardian or a family member who is the primary care provider must sign the consent&#xD;
             form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with ulcerative gingivitis and stomatitis. (These children will be referred&#xD;
             for treatment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with allergy to colophony (colophonium). Colophonium is found in some&#xD;
             cosmetics, creams, sunscreens, pine-oil cleaners, chewing gum, and postage stamp glue.&#xD;
             Parents will be asked if the child suffers from this particular allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No teeth present or stainless steel crowns only.&#xD;
