      Thyroidectomy followed by administration of large activities of 131-iodine (131I) is the&#xD;
      treatment of choice for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). The serum thyroglobulin (Tg)&#xD;
      measurement during hypothyroidism (offT4-Tg), just before radioiodine thyroid ablation, has&#xD;
      proved to be effective for predicting persistent/recurrent disease. However, the Tg&#xD;
      measurement cannot be used as a corresponding value for preablative offT4-Tg when rhTSH is&#xD;
      used as stimulous before treatment. The present study was undertaken to evaluate if&#xD;
      post-thyroidectomy Tg values, measured before rhTSH-stimulation and radioiodine&#xD;
      administration, is of prognostic value in patients affected by DTC. We enrolled 28 patients&#xD;
      with DTC and submitted to total thyroidectomy. Thyroxine (T4) treatment was started just&#xD;
      after surgery to suppress TSH levels. Six to nine weeks later Tg levels were measured both&#xD;
      basally (onT4-Tg) and after rhTSH (rhTSH-Tg) stimulation. Subsequently, T4 was stopped and&#xD;
      serum Tg measured (offT4-Tg) just before 3700 MBq of 131I-iodide administration. A&#xD;
      post-treatment whole body scan (PT-WBS) was performed and neck radioiodine uptake (RAIU)&#xD;
      measured. A significant relationship was found between onT4-Tg and both rhTSH-Tg and&#xD;
      offT4-Tg. The onT4-Tg levels of 0.2 ng/mL or higher predicted PT-WBS results with a 100%&#xD;
      negative and 43% positive predictive values, respectively. Additionally onT4-Tg levels of 0.9&#xD;
      ng/mL or more predicts 12-months recurrences with 100% negative and 60% positive predictive&#xD;
      value. In comparison, 1.0 ng/mL or higher offT4-Tg values predicted PT-WBS results and&#xD;
      12-months restaging with 94% and 100% negative and 45% and 27% positive predictive value,&#xD;
      respectively. Basing on our data we conclude that preablative onT4-Tg may be of value as&#xD;
      prognostic marker when rhTSH-aided radioiodine ablation is done. Additionally, the role of&#xD;
      preblative onT4-Tg measurement as a yard-stick for radioiodine ablation should be further&#xD;
      evaluate.&#xD;

      Introduction Total (or near-total) thyroidectomy followed by TSH-stimulated administration of&#xD;
      large activities of 131-iodine (131I) is the treatment of choice for DTC [1-3]. The serum&#xD;
      thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement during hypothyroidism, just before radioiodine thyroid&#xD;
      ablation, has proved to be effective for predicting persistent/recurrent disease [4-8].&#xD;
      Recently recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) showed to be safely employed instead of thyroxine (T4)&#xD;
      withdrawal (offT4) to prepare patients for radioiodine ablation [9-10]. However, the Tg level&#xD;
      are measured 48 hours after radioiodine administration when rhTSH is used as stimulation&#xD;
      [11]. Consequently, due to the radioiodine-induced thyroid cells damage and Tg release, the&#xD;
      Tg measurement would not have reliable predictive value in patients treated by rhTSH&#xD;
      stimulation [12]. The present study was undertaken to evaluate if preablativeTg measurement&#xD;
      under T4 treatment is of prognostic value and serves as surrogate marker of offT4-stimulated&#xD;
      preablative Tg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selection We retrospectively enrolled 28 consecutive patients affected by&#xD;
      histologically proven DTC (23 papillary, 5 follicular) submitted to total thyroidectomy and&#xD;
      central compartment lymph-node dissection. Thyroxine (T4) treatment was started immediately&#xD;
      after surgery to suppress TSH levels. Six to nine weeks later Tg levels were measured both&#xD;
      basally (onT4-Tg) and after rhTSH (rhTSH-Tg) stimulation as previously described [13].&#xD;
      Subsequently, T4 was stopped for 4 weeks and serum Tg measured (offT4-Tg) just before 3700&#xD;
      MBq of 131I-iodide administration. A post-treatment whole body scan (PT-WBS) with radioiodine&#xD;
      uptake (RAIU) calculation was performed according to a previously described protocol [1]. All&#xD;
      non physiologic iodine uptake areas out of the thyroid bed were considered as positive&#xD;
      findings [14, 15]. Patients with positive PT-WBS underwent specific treatment and&#xD;
      personalized follow-up. Patients with negative PT-WBS immediately restarted T4 suppressive&#xD;
      treatment. Final restaging was performed in all patients 12 months after the last treatment&#xD;
      by neck ultrasound, onT4-Tg assay and both offT4-diagnostic WBS (DgWBS) and Tg assay (4 weeks&#xD;
      T4 withdrawal; required TSH&gt;30 mUI/L). Clinical and pathological characteristics of selected&#xD;
      patients were summarized in the Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Tg assay and screening for interferences Serum Tg was assayed in duplicate by a&#xD;
      specific high-sensitive IRMA assay (DYNOtest® Tg-plus, BRAHMS Diagnostica GmbH, Berlin,&#xD;
      Germany) according to the producer' instructions. This method provided a sensitivity of 0.05&#xD;
      ng/mL and a functional sensitivity of 0.2 ng/mL [16, 17]. As previously published,&#xD;
      preablative offT4 serum Tg values above 4.5 ng/mL and 3.2 ng/mL were considered as positive&#xD;
      with respect to PT-WBS and 12 months restaging results, respectively [8]. Otherwise, offT4-Tg&#xD;
      values higher than 0.2 ng/ml measured 12 months after thyroid ablation were considered&#xD;
      positive for persisting/relapsing disease. [18, 19]. The presence of anti-thyroglobulin&#xD;
      antibodies (AbTg) was screened by a specific radioimmunoassay (DYNOtest® anti-TGn, BRAHMS&#xD;
      Diagnostica GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and by recovery test with a specific Tg-recovery buffer&#xD;
      provided by the producer. Sera showing AbTg levels more than 60 U/mL and/or recover less than&#xD;
      80% or more than 120% were excluded from the study. Quality control was ensured by assaying&#xD;
      two levels of control sera in each series, by re-assessing all sera showing a coefficient of&#xD;
      variation exceeding 10% and by a bimonthly partecipation in the European inter-laboratory&#xD;
      control OncocheckTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD. Differences between groups were&#xD;
      assessed by two-tailed unpaired t-test. The relationship between variables was assessed by&#xD;
      linear regression analysis. In order to allow statistical analysis the value of undetectable&#xD;
      serum Tg expressed as &lt; 0.2 ng/nL was arbitrarily changed in 0.10 ng/mL. Statistical&#xD;
      significance was defined by a p-value &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics All diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were performed according to the regulations&#xD;
      of the local ethics committee. Informed consensus was obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results The overall results are summarized in the Table I. Relationship Between Post-surgery&#xD;
      onT4-Tg, rhTSH-Tg and offT4-Tg A significant positive relationship was found between onT4-Tg&#xD;
      and both rhTSH-Tg (p&lt;.0001) and offT4-Tg (p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 1, A-B-C) as well as between&#xD;
      rhTSH and offT4-stimulated Tg (p&lt;.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship Between Post-surgery Serum Tg and Thyroid Remnant Radioiodine Uptake (RAIU)&#xD;
      Among 22 patients showing no DTC metastasis on PT-WBS the serum distribution of onT4-Tg,&#xD;
      rhTSH-Tg and offT4-Tg was 0.342±0.402; 0.664±0.803 and 1.195±1.485 ng/mL respectively. Both&#xD;
      rhTSH and offT4-stimulated Tg levels were related to RAIU (p &lt;.05 and &lt;.005, respectively)&#xD;
      while no significant relationship was found between RAIU and onT4-Tg levels (Figure 1,&#xD;
      D-E-F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship Between Post-surgery Serum Tg and PT-WBS results The patients with positive&#xD;
      PT-WBS showed higher onT4-Tg (0.617±0.445 vs 0.341±0.402 ng/mL), rhTSH-Tg (2.150±1.249 vs&#xD;
      0.664±0.803 ng/mL) and offT4-Tg (4.417±2.136 vs 1.195±1.485 ng/mL) levels as compared with&#xD;
      patients with negative scan. Among 14 patients with undetectable onT4-Tg (i.e. ≤0.2 ng/mL)&#xD;
      none had positive PT-WBS neither recurrences at 12-months restaging. Additionally, none of&#xD;
      these patients showed stimulated Tg values more than 0.4 ng/mL and 1.0 ng/mL after rhTSH&#xD;
      stimulation and T4 withdrawal, respectively. Viceversa, among 14 patients with onT4-Tg levels&#xD;
      more than 0.2 ng/mL, 6 had positive PT-WBS (onT4-Tg: 0.3 to 1.4 ng/mL) and 3 showed DTC&#xD;
      recurrences at 12 months restaging (onT4-Tg: 0.9 to 1.7 ng/mL). Consequently, the onT4-Tg&#xD;
      levels predicts PT-WBS results with a 100% negative and 43% positive predictive values,&#xD;
      respectively. Additionally onT4-Tg levels of 0.9 ng/mL or more predicts 12-months recurrences&#xD;
      with 100% negative and 60% positive predictive value. In comparison, 1.0 ng/mL or higher&#xD;
      offT4-Tg values predicted PT-WBS results and 12-months restaging with 94% and 100% negative&#xD;
      and 45% and 27% positive predictive value, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Many reports indicate the usefulness of Tg concentration measurement before&#xD;
      radioiodine treatment to early detection of DTC relapse or metastasis [4-8, 20, 21]. Three&#xD;
      factors determine Tg concentration in most clinical situations: thyroid cell mass, thyroid&#xD;
      cell damage and activation of TSH receptors [22]. When Tg is measured before radioiodine&#xD;
      ablation the effects of surgical damage are generally vanished and endogenous TSH levels are&#xD;
      increased in all patients: consequently the thyroid remnant mass is the major determinant of&#xD;
      the serum Tg concentrations [23]. However, the rhTSH-stimulated Tg cannot be used instead of&#xD;
      preablative offT4-Tg when rhTSH is employed to prepare radioiodine ablation [12]. Therefore&#xD;
      we evaluated the role of post-surgery onT4-Tg as surrogate prognostic marker. We choiced to&#xD;
      suppress TSH levels in order to normalize the effect of TSH stimulation on thyroid remnants.&#xD;
      Clearly, the TSH suppression reduced Tg levels: however, the high-sensitive Tg assays provide&#xD;
      a good distinction between the lower limit of the euthyroid reference range and the&#xD;
      functional sensitivity limit detecting small amounts of thyroid tissue even in the&#xD;
      TSH-suppressed state (22, 23). We showed a significant positive relationship between&#xD;
      post-surgery Tg measured during T4 treatment and after TSH stimulation. No relationship was&#xD;
      found between RAIU (i.e. expression of remnant mass) and onT4-Tg, probably due the clustering&#xD;
      of all Tg levels lower than 0.2 ng/mL (see statistics paragraph). However, undetectable&#xD;
      onT4-Tg after surgery identifies patients free of metastasis at PT-WBS and without late&#xD;
      recurreces during early 12-months follow-up. None of these patients showed a significant&#xD;
      increase in both rhTSH and offT4-stimulated Tg before radioiodine ablation. This seems to&#xD;
      indicate that the relationship between Tg expression and thyroid tissue mass is manteined&#xD;
      even in TSH suppression state: Therefore undetectable serum onT4-Tg really identifies&#xD;
      patients without significant thyroid tissue amount as well as stimulated Tg. All patients&#xD;
      performed extracapsular total thyroidectomy in a dedicated thyroid surgery unit and the&#xD;
      thyroid remnant, expressed as RAIU, was lower in our series than in others. This means that&#xD;
      our data cannot directly translated to patients treated by more limited surgery. Globally,&#xD;
      basing on our data we conclude that preablative onT4-Tg may be of value as prognostic marker&#xD;
      when rhTSH-aided radioiodine ablation is done. Additionally, the role of preblative onT4-Tg&#xD;
      measurement as a yard-stick for radioiodine ablation should be further evaluate.&#xD;
