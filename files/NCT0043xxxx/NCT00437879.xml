  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have previously demonstrated that high-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy, and recently&#xD;
      conventional-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy may be used to detect cell death in vitro,&#xD;
      in situ and in vivo. The method can detect different forms of cell death and has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be sensitive to apoptotic, necrotic and mitotic cell death. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to evaluate the use of ultrasound imaging and spectroscopy as a predictive&#xD;
      marker of advanced tumour response to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatments may also act on tumour vasculature to &quot;normalize&quot; it we will also&#xD;
      evaluate blood-vessel imaging by standard Doppler-imaging and with standard higher-resolution&#xD;
      imaging using clinically approved microbubble contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal, as described above, is to select the best ultrasound spectroscopy parameter to&#xD;
      use as an early predictor of pathological complete response.&#xD;

      We have previously demonstrated that high-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy, and recently&#xD;
      conventional-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy may be used to detect cell death in vitro,&#xD;
      in situ and in vivo. The method can detect different forms of cell death and has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be sensitive to apoptotic, necrotic and mitotic cell death. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to evaluate the use of ultrasound imaging and spectroscopy as a predictive&#xD;
      marker of advanced tumour response to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatments may also act on tumour vasculature to &quot;normalize&quot; it we will also&#xD;
      evaluate blood-vessel imaging by standard Doppler-imaging and with standard higher-resolution&#xD;
      imaging using clinically approved microbubble contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal, as described above, is to select the best ultrasound spectroscopy parameter to&#xD;
      use as an early predictor of pathological complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will as a primary endpoint correlate changes in ultrasound backscatter&#xD;
      parameters obtained throughout the course of treatment with pathological complete, partial,&#xD;
      or complete and partial response. We ultimately hope to be able to generate a&#xD;
      Receiver-Operator-Curve for each parameter beyond this pilot investigation. The&#xD;
      ultrasound-spectroscopy parameters to be examined include mid-band fit, spectral-slope and&#xD;
      histogram-distribution-fit parameters related to scatterer size and concentration. From these&#xD;
      various receiver-operator curves the best ultrasound parameter for predicting response will&#xD;
      be selected and will aid to define the clinical specificity and sensitivity of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint in this study will include examining the change in size of the tumour,&#xD;
      which will also be measured using conventional gold-standard B-scan ultrasound imaging&#xD;
      (length by width by height in addition to volume) and correlating that to the spectroscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound changes determined at different times during patient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary endpoints will include measuring changes in blood vessel distribution by&#xD;
      standard Doppler-imaging and standard microbubble contrast agent imaging. As another&#xD;
      secondary endpoint we will also correlate our ultrasound changes with 2 and 5-year long-term&#xD;
      clinical outcome.&#xD;
