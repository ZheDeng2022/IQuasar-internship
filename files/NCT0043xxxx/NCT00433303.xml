      The purpose of our study is correlate between premature delivery (between week 23-35 of the&#xD;
      pregnancy) in women that had intercourse up to 12 hours prior to beginning of labor and&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the gene Prostanoid receptor.&#xD;

      During the past years there has been a conflict between different studies regarding the&#xD;
      correlation between intercourse during pregnancy and early labor. Brustman et al showed that&#xD;
      women that were at a high risk for early delivery and had intercourse and then an early labor&#xD;
      had significantly increase uterine activity compared to women at low risk. Petridou et al&#xD;
      showed that this risk is significantly higher at week 33 of gestation. However, the Cochrane&#xD;
      Library summary leaves the question of correlation between intercourse and early labor&#xD;
      unanswered. In Sayle et al's study showed no correlation between early delivery and&#xD;
      intercourse. In 2004 Oguma described 3 polymorphisms in the Prostanoid receptor gene. These&#xD;
      polymorphisms were correlated to increased activity of smooth muscles of bronchi in asthma.&#xD;
      Since this gene is also expressed in the uterine muscles we wanted to determine whether there&#xD;
      is a correlation between the three polymorphisms T-549C, C-441T, T-197C, G+1044A and early&#xD;
      delivery due to intercourse.&#xD;
