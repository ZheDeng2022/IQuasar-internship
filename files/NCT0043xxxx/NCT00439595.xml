  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high proportion of children under the age of 5 years and pregnant women in Tanzania is&#xD;
      anaemic, particularly in areas of high malaria transmission. The symptoms of anaemia are&#xD;
      often non-specific or absent and clinical judgement is generally insensitive in estimating Hb&#xD;
      levels, especially in infants who are assessed by basic grade health staff. Thus while&#xD;
      treatment for the common causes of anaemia is available, many cases are not treated due to&#xD;
      difficulties in recognising anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New diagnostic tools can increase the sensitivity of anaemia detection compared to clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis but no studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in increasing case-detection&#xD;
      and treatment of anaemic patients at the first level of healthcare. In addition, the costs of&#xD;
      their use in relation to any increase in numbers of cases treated are not known and this&#xD;
      knowledge is needed to guide public health decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two methods of measuring anaemia are currently suitable for use at the first level of care;&#xD;
      Copack Haemoglobin colour scale (HBCS) and Hemocue portable photometry. We propose to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness in basic health facilities of these 2 simple diagnostic tools compared to&#xD;
      control dispensaries (current practice) in increasing rates of detection and treatment of&#xD;
      anaemia in children under the age of 5 years and pregnant women over the course of 1 year in&#xD;
      a cluster-randomised trial in 30 dispensaries in a malaria-endemic area of NE Tanzania.&#xD;

      Study justification In spite a number of studies describing the sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of various simple tests for diagnosing anaemia(19-21) there are no studies that have&#xD;
      evaluated the effectiveness of basic training of heath workers, use of diagnostic tools and&#xD;
      assured availability of anaemia treatments, in reducing the burden of chronic anaemia in&#xD;
      children and pregnant women in malaria endemic areas of Africa. The cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      current diagnostic tests is not known and this information is needed to guide public health&#xD;
      policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of diagnosis, treatment and referral from basic health facilities depend on a&#xD;
      variety of factors (treatment adherence, clinic attendance, health worker awareness, local&#xD;
      prevalence of anaemia etc) that are likely to vary between different areas and health&#xD;
      facilities. A cluster randomised study has therefore been designed to shed light on these&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design overview This is a cluster randomised open label trial of 2 different 'point of care'&#xD;
      diagnostic tools (Hemocue and Copack) to detect anaemia in children under the age of 5 years,&#xD;
      each compared to a control arm that will continue current routine practice (based on clinical&#xD;
      judgement or ineffective colorimetric methods of measuring haemoglobin). An inherent&#xD;
      constraint in designing this effectiveness trial of is the absence of a measure of&#xD;
      haemoglobin in control dispensaries. Thus the proportion of children diagnosed with anaemia&#xD;
      is the primary outcome and expected rates will be derived from the rolling cross-sectional&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who are referred to the next level of care will be tracked and basic data on the&#xD;
      results of investigations and treatment outcome will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rolling cross-sectional anaemia survey in children under the age of 5 years will be&#xD;
      conducted in the villages served by participating health facilities throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs of anaemia diagnosis and treatment will be assessed in each of the trial arms and the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention arms will each be compared to the control arm in&#xD;
      diagnosing and treating anaemia and in normalising haemoglobin levels in children with&#xD;
      anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social surveys (individual interviews and focus group discussions) will be conducted to&#xD;
      assess the acceptability and popularity of each of the interventions and to identify&#xD;
      treatement-seeking behaviour for and risk factors for anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the trial will be circulated locally and nationally as soon as they are&#xD;
      available in order to maximise the usefulness of the results to health planners and providers&#xD;
      in Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exit strategy at the end of the trial will ensure that any additional resources provided&#xD;
      during the trial will be maintained through to the next local health planning and resource&#xD;
      allocation cycle.&#xD;
