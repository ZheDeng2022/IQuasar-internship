  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Across the country, Community Health Centers are participating in the Health Disparities&#xD;
      Collaboratives sponsored by the Health Services Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).&#xD;
      The Health Disparities Collaboratives integrate three complementary conceptual frameworks: 1)&#xD;
      the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) Breakthrough Series Model; 2) the&#xD;
      Improvement Model (i.e., Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles); and 3) Wagner's Chronic Care Model. The&#xD;
      Chronic Care model uses patient self-management, delivery system re-design, decision support,&#xD;
      and clinical information systems to maximize the effectiveness of interactions between&#xD;
      prepared proactive care teams and informed activated patients with chronic illnesses such as&#xD;
      diabetes, asthma, and depression. The Chronic Care model for depression, also known as&#xD;
      Collaborative Care, involves primary care providers working with a depression care team&#xD;
      comprising non-physicians (e.g., nurses, pharmacists) and mental health specialists (e.g.,&#xD;
      psychiatrists). Practice-based collaborative care involves primary care providers working&#xD;
      with an on-site depression care team. In contrast, telemedicine-based collaborative care&#xD;
      involves primary care providers working with an off-site depression care team using&#xD;
      telemedicine technologies. The purpose of this research project is to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost effectiveness of practice-based and telemedicine-based collaborative&#xD;
      care in Community Health Centers (without on-site mental health specialists) implementing the&#xD;
      Health Disparities Collaborative for depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An experimental study design and an intent-to-treat analysis will be used to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine-based collaborative care relative to&#xD;
      practice-based collaborative care. The research setting will be six Community Health Centers&#xD;
      located in medically underserved areas of Arkansas which serve rural, low income and minority&#xD;
      populations. Potentially eligible patients will be identified through screening by Community&#xD;
      Health Centers clinic staff or primary care provider referrals. Patients eligible for the&#xD;
      study will be consented and randomized to receive either telemedicine-based or practice-based&#xD;
      collaborative care, and followed for 18 months to assess processes and outcomes. On-site&#xD;
      clinical staff will screen patients for depression over an 18 month period and refer all&#xD;
      patients with clinically significant depression (PHQ9â‰¥10) to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of health care professionals will be involved in the practice-based collaborative&#xD;
      care model: 1) primary care providers (MD and RNP); and 2) a depression care manager (LPN or&#xD;
      Social Worker). The on-site care managers will provide care management activities by phone or&#xD;
      face-to-face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five types of health care professionals will be involved in the telemedicine-based&#xD;
      collaborative care model: 1) primary care providers (MD and RNP); 2) a depression nurse care&#xD;
      manager (RN); 3) clinical pharmacist (PharmD); 4) tele-psychologist (PhD); and 5) a&#xD;
      tele-psychiatrist (MD). The primary care providers will be located at the Community Health&#xD;
      Centers. The off-site depression care team will be located at the clinics of the University&#xD;
      of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Department of Psychiatry. The on-site primary care&#xD;
      providers will prescribe medications and schedule all appointments. The off-site nurse care&#xD;
      manager will conduct all care management activities by telephone. The off-site clinical&#xD;
      pharmacist will conduct medication histories and provide medication management by telephone.&#xD;
      The off-site tele-psychologist will conduct evidence-based psychotherapy (cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy) via interactive video. The off-site tele-psychiatrist will conduct&#xD;
      interactive-video consultations, train and supervise the depression care team, and conduct&#xD;
      provider education.&#xD;
