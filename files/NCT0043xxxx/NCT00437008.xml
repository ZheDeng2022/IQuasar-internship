      The purpose of the study is to determine whether there are differences in postprandial&#xD;
      endothelial function following a high-AGE(Advanced Glycation End-products) meal vs. a low-AGE&#xD;
      meal. We also intend to investigate if the therapy with 1050mg Benfotiamine for 3 days&#xD;
      protects against the postulated deterioration of endothelial function after a high-AGE meal&#xD;
      in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

      AGEs are a heterogeneous group of compounds formed by the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing&#xD;
      sugars with proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Diet has been recognized as an important&#xD;
      exogenous source of AGEs. There is evidence for the implication of AGEs in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of diabetes-related complications, atherosclerosis, ageing processes or AlzheimerÂ´s disease.&#xD;
      Although, only little information exists about their effects in humans. The hypotheses of&#xD;
      this study are that a high-AGE meal leads to a more important acute vascular dysfunction&#xD;
      comparing to a low-AGE meal, and that a 1050mg/day Benfotiamine therapy for 3 days has a&#xD;
      protective effect on the endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-one people with type 2 diabetes shall be investigated in a randomized, single-blinded&#xD;
      (investigator), cross-over design (please compare design description).&#xD;
