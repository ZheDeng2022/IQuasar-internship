    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if acupuncture is effective in&#xD;
      preventing xerostomia (dry mouth) in cancer patients who receive radiation treatment to the&#xD;
      head and neck area. Researchers also want to learn whether acupuncture lowers the severity of&#xD;
      dry mouth that is experienced by these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Investigate if acupuncture is effective in preventing xerostomia among cancer patients at&#xD;
      Fudan University Cancer Hospital (Cancer Hospital) who receive radiation treatment to the&#xD;
      head and neck area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether acupuncture reduces the severity of xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of providing acupuncture treatment to patients at Cancer&#xD;
           Hospital who are receiving radiation treatment for cancer of the head and/or neck area.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some research suggests that acupuncture may be helpful in stimulating saliva flow in patients&#xD;
      with dry mouth caused by radiation treatment. Acupuncture uses very thin needles inserted at&#xD;
      certain points on the body that are believed to affect bodily functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests&#xD;
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. Your complete&#xD;
      medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam. You will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete 3 short questionnaires about your quality-of-life and current saliva flow. These&#xD;
      should take about 5 minutes to complete. You will be asked to collect saliva in a vial (small&#xD;
      tube or jar) for 5 minutes, by allowing saliva to collect in your mouth and then spitting it&#xD;
      into the vial. You will be asked to collect saliva twice at each time point. One collection&#xD;
      will be like it is described above. The second collection will be after you have held a sour&#xD;
      liquid in your mouth for 1 minute. A traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis will also be&#xD;
      conducted. This will include diagnosis by a doctor as well as by using a heart-rate machine&#xD;
      and taking a photograph of your tongue. This will allow a more objective check of your heart&#xD;
      rate and tongue condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the toss of a coin) into 1 of 2 groups. One group will receive acupuncture during their&#xD;
      radiation treatment period, and the other will receive standard care without acupuncture.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the acupuncture group will receive acupuncture for 20 minutes before&#xD;
      their radiation therapy session, 3 days a week for 7 weeks. Participants in the standard care&#xD;
      group will not receive acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the acupuncture group, you will be asked to come to the acupuncture clinic for&#xD;
      the treatment, before your radiation treatment. The acupuncturist will put in the needles in&#xD;
      certain points of your body (including the chin, wrist, leg, and ear), while you are seated&#xD;
      in a chair. The needles will remain in for about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to receive medications for dry mouth at any point while on study, your&#xD;
      participation on this study will end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter which group you are assigned to, for each of the 7 weeks you are receiving&#xD;
      radiation treatment, your vital signs (your blood pressure and pulse) will be checked, and&#xD;
      you will be asked about any medications you are taking. You will also complete questionnaires&#xD;
      about your quality-of-life and symptoms. Each questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. A saliva sample will also be collected on Weeks 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. If you are&#xD;
      assigned to the acupuncture group, the saliva sample will be collected after the acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment on Weeks 1, 4, and 7 and before the treatment on Weeks 3 and 6. A traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine diagnosis will also be conducted in the middle of radiation treatment, at&#xD;
      the end of treatment, and 1 month later. This will include diagnosis by a physician as well&#xD;
      as by using a pulse machine and taking a photograph of your tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after the end of radiation treatment (Week 11), your vital signs will be checked,&#xD;
      you will be asked about any medications you are taking， you will complete the quality of life&#xD;
      and symptom questionnaires, and you will provide another saliva sample. After Week 11, your&#xD;
      participation on this study is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at the Fudan University Cancer Hospital.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of xerostomia prior to the head and neck radiation therapy (Sjögren's disease&#xD;
             or other underlying systemic illness known to cause xerostomia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Planned IMRT&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Suspected or confirmed physical closure of salivary gland ducts on either side&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known bleeding disorders and on Heparin or Coumadin&#xD;

             location or alter the energy pathway as defined by traditional acupuncture theory&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Local skin infections at or near the acupuncture site or active systemic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of cerebrovascular accident or spinal cord injury. (The mechanism of action&#xD;
             for acupuncture may be associated with central nervous system (CNS) activity, and&#xD;
             patients with CNS pathology may respond differently to treatment than the general&#xD;
             population.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Mental incapacitation or significant emotional or psychiatric disorder that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, precludes study entry as these patients may not be able&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Current acknowledged use of other alternative medicines such as herbal preparations&#xD;
             that could affect salivary function. Each patient will be asked for a list of herbal&#xD;
             supplements they are currently taking and this will be reviewed on an individual&#xD;
             basis. Patients will be excluded if they are taking any herbs known or suspected to&#xD;
             affect salivary function&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants taking cholinergic agonist medication (Pilocarpine, Cevimeline), beta&#xD;
             adrenergic antagonists, anticholinergic agents or other medications known to affect&#xD;
             salivary function&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Currently receiving acupuncture for any condition&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. No prior head and neck radiation treatment&#xD;
