  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with elevation of plasma-free fatty acids (FFA).&#xD;
      Studies indicate that elevation of plasma-FFA induces insulin resistance and also causes&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction as well as hemodynamic changes which are supposed to be involved in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glomerular hyperfiltration, which is associated with glomerular hypertension and hypertrophy,&#xD;
      a common finding in the early course of type 1 diabetes as well as type 2 diabetes, plays an&#xD;
      important role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. These hemodynamic&#xD;
      changes are not well understood, but are most likely induced by dilatation of the&#xD;
      (precapillary) glomerular arteriole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans the hemodynamic effect of FFAs has so far been investigated locally in brachial and&#xD;
      femoral arteries and recently in the eye and skin, where FFAs induced a pronounced increase&#xD;
      in blood flow probably due to a local decrease in vascular resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to characterise the hemodynamic effects of FFAs in the&#xD;
      kidney. In addition we want to test the hypothesis that FFA-induced changes are mediated via&#xD;
      endothelial derived nitric oxide (NO). The results of this study could provide information to&#xD;
      what extent elevated FFA-plasma levels contribute to hyperfiltration in the early course of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. The measurements will be done at baseline and during 4 hour infusion of a&#xD;
      triglyceride or placebo infusion, combined with heparin.&#xD;
