  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight children has increased significantly over the past 3 decades and&#xD;
      3 out of every 4 overweight children become obese adults. Additionally, overweight children&#xD;
      are now at risk for developing type-2 diabetes while still in their youth. To address the&#xD;
      issue of childhood weight management, Golan and colleagues provided a model for intervention&#xD;
      development that targets parents as an exclusive agent of change when attempting to treat&#xD;
      weight issues for children under 12 years of age. The Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO)&#xD;
      Weight Management Program (WMP) developed Family Connections, a condensed two-session&#xD;
      program, based on the Golan model, for parents of children between the ages of 8-12 with a&#xD;
      Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than the 85 percentile for age and gender. There is a need to&#xD;
      determine if the content of Golan's model can be translated into a practical intervention to&#xD;
      be used in usual pediatric weight management practice. The Family Connections study uses&#xD;
      three arms to determine the effectiveness of healthy eating and active living messages.&#xD;

      We used a 3 condition randomized controlled trial design to allow us to make comparisons&#xD;
      across current standard care, Family Connections, and Family Connections plus telephone&#xD;
      follow-up support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in a two year and four month period; beginning in November, 2004 and&#xD;
      ending in February, 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workbook Control. A workbook was created from the content of the two part Family Connections&#xD;
      classes, the current standard of care. The workbook has themes which promote increased PA and&#xD;
      fruit &amp; vegetable (FV) consumption in concert with decreased soda consumption (SC), and&#xD;
      television viewing/recreational computer time (TV). Specific intervention themes included&#xD;
      parental cognitive and behavior change, home environment change, and parental modeling of&#xD;
      healthy behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family Connections-current standard of care. The Family Connections classes are a two part&#xD;
      intervention targeted toward the primary caretakers of the overweight child. The classes were&#xD;
      held one week apart at a local Kaiser Permanente health clinic. Parents were also given a&#xD;
      copy of the workbook to use in class and at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family Connections plus Automated Telephone Follow-up. Parents assigned to this intervention&#xD;
      arm will complete the Family Connections program and subsequently receive 10 follow-up&#xD;
      sessions delivered via Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology. The calls will be&#xD;
      completed with high frequency initially and then scaled back over time. To sustain changes&#xD;
      that are made as a result of the Family Connections program, telephone follow-up calls&#xD;
      commenced 1 week after the second class. Calls occurred on a weekly basis for 1 month. During&#xD;
      the 3rd and 4th month calls occurred biweekly. Finally a monthly call was provided during the&#xD;
      5th and 6th months of the study. The calls will include content targeted towards, increasing&#xD;
      parental behavioral health, parenting and role modeling skills as well as providing&#xD;
      strategies for home environmental changes to promote healthy eating and PA. In addition, a&#xD;
      goal setting and assessment tool was provided; at the beginning of each call the primary&#xD;
      parent would hear the goal they selected the week prior and rate their achievement. Based on&#xD;
      the rating, the primary parent was given the option to hear tips related to the topic of&#xD;
      their prior week's selected goal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIM 1: To determine the effectiveness (6 &amp; 12 months after the intervention&#xD;
      initiation) of Family Connections when compared to a standard care control group in reducing&#xD;
      child BMI percentile rankings. Other key outcomes will be physical activity (PA) and healthy&#xD;
      eating behaviors (i.e., ↑ fruits &amp; vegetables; ↓Soda/sugar drinks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIM 2: To determine the effectiveness (6 &amp; 12 months after the initiation of&#xD;
      intervention) of adding automated telephone follow-ups using a 3 group randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial design. The maintenance intervention will reinforce and extend the messages of Family&#xD;
      Connections related to strategies to address the home environment, parenting skills to&#xD;
      promote healthy eating and activity, and parental modeling of appropriate eating and PA.&#xD;
      Changes in BMI percentile ranking will be used as the primary outcome. Other key outcomes&#xD;
      will be PA and eating behaviors (i.e., compares Family Connections alone to Family&#xD;
      Connections plus automated telephone follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AIM 1: Compare the effectiveness of each intervention condition to positively&#xD;
      change parental BMI, PA, and eating behaviors. Second, by omitting the overweight child from&#xD;
      the intervention process significant reductions in the child's reporting of eating disorder&#xD;
      symptoms were found when compared to intervention models that included the child as a primary&#xD;
      agent of personal change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AIM 2: Determine the effectiveness of Family Connections (with and without&#xD;
      follow-up) to decrease child eating disorder symptoms when compared to standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures were collected from the child and parent at the baseline study visit; at the 6 month&#xD;
      study visit; and at the 12 month study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  accelerometer (measure of physical activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self efficacy questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjective measures of screen time and physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kids Eating Disorders Survey (KEDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric Quality of Life survey (PEDSQL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block dietary recall survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat and Fibre survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self efficacy questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health literacy questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home Environment survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family health history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6 month assessment, parents (regardless of study arm assigned) were given a short&#xD;
      survey to complete regarding their level of interest and satisfaction of IVR. At the 12 month&#xD;
      assessment, parents completed a satisfaction survey regarding their experience with the study&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
