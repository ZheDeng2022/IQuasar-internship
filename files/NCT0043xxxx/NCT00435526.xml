  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess anti-CFA/I and anti-CfaE BIgG safety and to determine&#xD;
      protective efficacy of anti-CFA/I and anti-CfaE BIgG against diarrhea after challenge with&#xD;
      H10407, a CFA/I-expressing ETEC strain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving up to 33 subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the following three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group N Product&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 10 BIgG anti-CFA/I&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 10 BIgG anti-CfaE&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 10 LactoFree® Lipil®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will receive the test article three times daily following meals beginning 2 days&#xD;
      prior to oral ETEC challenge (strain H10407). Test article will be administered for a total&#xD;
      of 7 days. Monitoring procedures will assess volunteer safety, the primary endpoint&#xD;
      (diarrhea), stool microbiology (H10407 excretion), and ETEC-specific immunology. All&#xD;
      volunteers will receive antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or&#xD;
      amoxicillin) starting 5 days after ETEC challenge or sooner based on pre-defined clinical&#xD;
      criteria. Follow-up visits for 2 weeks post-discharge will monitor safety and immunological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General good health, without significant medical illness, abnormal physical&#xD;
             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities as determined by principal&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate comprehension of the protocol procedures and knowledge of ETEC illness by&#xD;
             passing a written examination (pass grade ≥ 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to participate after informed consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available for all planned follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on the&#xD;
             day of admittance to the inpatient phase for female volunteers of childbearing&#xD;
             potential. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an efficacious hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control during the study. Abstinence is acceptable. Female&#xD;
             volunteers unable to bear children must have this documented (e.g., tubal ligation or&#xD;
             hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a significant medical condition, (e.g. psychiatric conditions or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disease, such as peptic ulcer, symptoms or evidence of active&#xD;
             gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease, alcohol or&#xD;
             illicit drug abuse/dependency), or other laboratory abnormalities which in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator precludes participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive illness or IgA deficiency (below the normal limits)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serology results for HIV, HBsAg, or HCV antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant abnormalities in screening lab hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis or&#xD;
             EKG (EKG in volunteers ≥ 40 years), as determined by PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or ampicillin/penicillin&#xD;
             (excluded if allergic to two of three).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 stools per week or more than 3 stools per day) on&#xD;
             a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of diarrhea in the 2 weeks prior to planned inpatient phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach acidity (regular&#xD;
             defined as at least weekly).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of antibiotics during the 7 days before dosing or proton pump inhibitors, H2&#xD;
             blockers, or antacids within 48 hours of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Travel to countries where ETEC or cholera infection is endemic (most of the developing&#xD;
             world) within two years prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of vaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or LT toxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stool culture (collected no more than 1 week prior to admission) positive for CFA/I +&#xD;
             ETEC or other bacterial enteric pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational drug or any investigational vaccine within 30 days&#xD;
             preceding the first dose of test article, or planned use during the active study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical history of lactose intolerance or allergy to milk or milk products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., corticosteroids and&#xD;
             others) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use&#xD;
             during the active study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate an over-the-counter, lactose-free, infant, powder formula&#xD;
             suspended in 150 mL sodium bicarbonate buffer (based on requirement for frequent&#xD;
             dosing).&#xD;
