      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of BAY 43-9006 in combination with bicalutamide in patients with&#xD;
      chemo-naïve hormone-refractory prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That there will be PSA response when BAY 43-9006 in combination with bicalutamide is given to&#xD;
      patients with chemo-naïve hormone-refractory prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biologic and clinical activity and tolerability of BAY 43-9006, the therapeutic needs of&#xD;
      the proposed patient population, and the experimental evidence in support of targeting the&#xD;
      VEGF/VEGFR and MAPK pathways in combination with androgen receptor blockade in prostate&#xD;
      cancer, provides a strong rationale for the proposed phase II trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability and anti-cancer activity of combined treatment with the non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-androgen bicalutamide with the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor BAY 43-9006 in patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer that is progressing after castration therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to define the efficacy (i.e. post treatment decrement in PSA&#xD;
      (PSA response)) of BAY 43-9006 in combination with bicalutamide in patients with chemo-naïve&#xD;
      hormone-refractory prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of BAY 43-9006 given in combination with&#xD;
           bicalutamide in patients with HRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the time to treatment failure, PSA progression and disease progression in&#xD;
           HRPC patients treated with BAY 43-9006 in combination with bicalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine objective response rates in HRPC patients with measurable disease treated&#xD;
           with BAY 43-9006 in combination with bicalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II clinical trial in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer which&#xD;
      will evaluate the therapeutic activity and safety profile of BAY 43-9006 given orally at the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose of 400 mg PO BID continuously in combination with bicalutamide 50&#xD;
      mg PO daily continuously. Each 4 week period will be considered 1 cycle. Doses will be&#xD;
      adjusted for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint for this study will be the rate of PSA-response of the&#xD;
      combination for patients with rising PSA post castration therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include time to treatment failure, time to PSA progression, duration&#xD;
      of PSA response, median survival time, 1 year survival rate, objective tumor response rate&#xD;
      and stable disease rate as defined by the RECIST criteria, response duration, and incidence&#xD;
      of toxicities by NCI CTCAE.&#xD;
