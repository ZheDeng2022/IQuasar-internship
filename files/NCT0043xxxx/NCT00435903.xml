      The goal of this open trial is to pilot the use of palm pilots as a tool for monitoring&#xD;
      smoking behavior in individuals with serious mental illness. That is, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to assess the usefulness and feasibility of using Palm Pilots as a tool for monitoring&#xD;
      smoking behavior and for coaching participants to use a strategy for delaying and reducing&#xD;
      cigarette use.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will compare the accuracy of daily palm pilot recordings to paper and pencil&#xD;
           measures. We hypothesize that the number of cigarettes smoked according to daily palm&#xD;
           pilot recordings will correlate as well with salivary cotinine levels (a metabolite of&#xD;
           nicotine) as will daily paper and pencil recordings. That is, we expect that palm&#xD;
           recordings will be as accurate as paper and pencil recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will compare the total number of smoked cigarettes reported by the daily ratings&#xD;
           (paper and pencil or palm pilot) to participants' report of their weekly totals. We&#xD;
           expect that participants will tend to underestimate the number of cigarettes smoked when&#xD;
           asked to report weekly totals. That is, we hypothesize that participants will report&#xD;
           smoking fewer cigarettes in their weekly total compared to their daily reports of&#xD;
           smoking and that totals based on daily reports will correlate more strongly with&#xD;
           cotinine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We will measure the frequency at which participants access a screen on the Palm Pilot&#xD;
           that presents the &quot;4 D's,&quot; which are four strategies for delaying or reducing cigarette&#xD;
           use. Participants will be asked to access this screen when they experience an urge to&#xD;
           smoke. We hypothesize that at least some participants will make use of this screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We will assess the effect of daily monitoring on salivary cotinine levels. Smoking&#xD;
           reduction is not a specific goal of this program. However, participants who access the&#xD;
           4D's coaching screen on the Palm when they have an urge may reduce their smoking. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that reduction in cotinine levels will be correlated with greater frequency&#xD;
           of accessing the 4 D's screen. That is, participants who access the 4D's screen most&#xD;
           often (more than 5 times per day) are expected to show more reduction in cotinine levels&#xD;
           compared to baseline than are participants who do not access the 4 D's screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. We will measure participants' level of satisfaction with the Palm Pilot and the paper&#xD;
           and pencil versions of the monitoring forms. We hypothesize that participants will&#xD;
           report high levels of satisfaction with the Palm Pilot version, and that these will be&#xD;
           as high as or higher than levels of satisfaction with the paper and pencil version.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. We will assess whether participants are able to complete a rating scale on the Palm&#xD;
           Pilot. We hypothesize that participants will be able to complete this scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. We will assess the amount of training time required to train participants to use either&#xD;
           the paper and pencil or Palm Pilot versions of the monitoring form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Procedures: Ten participants will come in for four, 45-minute assessments, for a&#xD;
      total of 3 hours, over a 3-week period. At each visit, smoking behavior will be assessed&#xD;
      using either the palm pilot or paper and pencil recordings and carbon monoxide and salivary&#xD;
      cotinine will be measured. Training will be provided in the use of the palms and participants&#xD;
      will do a &quot;trial&quot; recording of data before their actual data are recorded. In addition,&#xD;
      during each week in which participants use Palm Pilots, they will be asked to come into the&#xD;
      clinic for a mid-week visit to have their Palm Pilot charged and synced with the computer. No&#xD;
      assessments will be completed during these mid-week visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will serve as their own controls in the study. Participants will be asked to keep&#xD;
      track of their smoking and to answer questions about their smoking using two formats: paper&#xD;
      and pencil forms and forms programmed on Palm Pilots. For the Palm Pilot recordings,&#xD;
      participants will be loaned a Palm Pilot to use to answer questions about their smoking&#xD;
      whenever they smoke. Palm recordings and paper and pencil recordings will be compared to&#xD;
      salivary cotinine and carbon monoxide levels. To control for the effects of one data&#xD;
      collection strategy being used before the other, subjects will be randomized to do either&#xD;
      paper and pencil recordings or palm recordings first. We will also teach clients a basic&#xD;
      behavioral strategy (&quot;the four D's&quot;) for cutting down on the amount of cigarettes smoked. The&#xD;
      four D's stand for 1) deep breathing, 2) drink fluids, 3) delay, and 4) do something else.&#xD;
      The paper and Palm Pilot versions of the questionnaires will include a reminder about the&#xD;
      four D's to encourage participants to cut down on the amount of cigarettes smoked per day. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will be asked to fill out the Hughes-Hatsukami Scale, which is a&#xD;
      measure of nicotine withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, all participants will take part in the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment 1: Baseline assessment (week 0) will include self report of cigarettes smoked&#xD;
           in the past week, a measure of salivary cotinine level, and expired air carbon monoxide&#xD;
           level. The four D's strategy for cutting down number of cigarettes smoked will be&#xD;
           introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For Week 1, subjects will be asked to keep daily paper-and-pencil records of their&#xD;
           smoking behavior for the week following baseline. Subjects will be asked to report on&#xD;
           number of cigarettes smoked, time of day smoked, how they felt when they smoked, and the&#xD;
           degree to which they craved the cigarette. They will also be asked to indicate whether&#xD;
           or not they tried any of the four D's strategies to avoid or delay smoking.&#xD;
           Additionally, they will fill out the Hughes-Hatsukami Scale once per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment 2: Subjects will then return for assessment at the end of the week of paper&#xD;
           and pencil recordings. Salivary cotinine and carbon monoxide levels will be measured at&#xD;
           this time. Additionally, subjects will fill out a satisfaction questionnaire regarding&#xD;
           their satisfaction with the paper-and-pencil method of monitoring their smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects will be trained to record their smoking behavior using a Palm Pilot version of&#xD;
           the recording form. Subjects will be loaned a Palm Pilot that will be programmed to&#xD;
           present a computerized version of the smoking behavior monitor form that was used to&#xD;
           make paper and pencil recordings. Subjects will be asked to hit a button on the Palm&#xD;
           Pilot whenever they have an urge to smoke, and to complete the recordings on the Palm&#xD;
           Pilot in the same manner as they did with paper-and-pencil recordings. However, Palm&#xD;
           Pilots will be set to beep 1x per day (participant's stated wake-up time) to prompt&#xD;
           participants to make a summary recording of number of cigarettes per day and to complete&#xD;
           the Hughes-Hatsukami Scale. Additionally, the morning questionnaire will include a&#xD;
           reminder screen that encourages participants to make the recordings and to practice the&#xD;
           four D's. Subjects will practice using the Palm Pilot over Week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mid-week visit 1: Participants will return to the clinic during the middle of the week&#xD;
           to charge and hot-sync (synchronize with the computer) their Palm Pilot. No assessments&#xD;
           will occur during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment 3: Subjects will return after a week of practice. Salivary cotinine and&#xD;
           carbon monoxide levels will be measured, as well as smoking withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects will then be asked to record their smoking on the palm pilots for another week&#xD;
           (Week 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Mid-week visit 2: Participants will return to the clinic during the middle of the week&#xD;
           to charge and hot-sync (synchronize with the computer) their Palm Pilot. No assessments&#xD;
           will occur during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Assessment 4: Subjects will return for a fourth and final assessment of cotinine and&#xD;
           carbon monoxide levels. Subjects will also complete a satisfaction questionnaire&#xD;
           regarding their experience with using the Palm Pilot version of monitoring.&#xD;
