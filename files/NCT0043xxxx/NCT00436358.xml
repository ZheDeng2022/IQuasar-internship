      This is an epidemiology study designed to implement hospital-based active surveillance for&#xD;
      intussusception (IS) in children &lt;1 year of age and lower respiratory tract infection&#xD;
      (LRTI)-related deaths among children between 29 days and 1 year of age in Mexico. An existing&#xD;
      linked database of the &quot;Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)&quot; will be used. The study&#xD;
      described in this protocol is a pilot study, which will evaluate the methodology to be used&#xD;
      in a later Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned epidemiology study will be conducted in IMSS hospitals and potentially use the&#xD;
      IMSS database to re-capture potential cases of IS and fatal cases and as a source of matched&#xD;
      case controls. The purpose of this project is to complement this data link system with an&#xD;
      active surveillance system for IS - in order to assess the feasibility of using the IMSS data&#xD;
      system by generating results that provide scientific validity. Such comprehensive (passive&#xD;
      and active) surveillance systems will facilitate the post licensure safety profile evaluation&#xD;
      of vaccines such as a vaccine against rotavirus diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep&#xD;
      2007.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this pilot study is to allow for the implementation of active hospital-based&#xD;
      surveillance for IS in children &lt;1 year of age in IMSS hospitals with pediatric medical care,&#xD;
      and LRTI-related post-neonatal deaths among children between 29 days and 1 year of age&#xD;
      participating in the IMSS system. Surveillance will be conducted in each of the approximately&#xD;
      230 IMSS hospitals with pediatric medical care (tertiary care and secondary care hospitals),&#xD;
      which have 40 million affiliates and an annual birth cohort of 575,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pilot phase the completeness and validity of electronic vaccination and&#xD;
      demographic data contained in the IMSS dataset will be assessed to determine whether or not&#xD;
      these data will be used during the actual post licensure study implementation. Study&#xD;
      participation for database validation will include parental/guardian/legal representative&#xD;
      interview and review of vaccination records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff at each of the approximately 230 IMSS hospitals will review medical records daily&#xD;
      for potential cases of IS in children &lt;1 year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records of potential IS cases will be reviewed to determine eligibility, in terms of&#xD;
      IS, based on the Brighton criteria Parents/guardians/legal representative of definite IS&#xD;
      cases will be contacted by study staff to recruit their child into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the informed consent is signed, the parental/guardian interview will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional medical information will be collected through medical record review during&#xD;
      hospitalization and after the child has been discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central Information Coordinator (IMSS staff member) will perform monthly reviews of the&#xD;
      IMSS database to search for definite IS cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-check will be performed with IMSS database to identify definite IS cases not yet&#xD;
      enrolled. In that situation, parents/guardians/legal representative will be contacted by&#xD;
      study staff to recruit their child into the study. Either in-hospital interviews or in-home&#xD;
      interviews will be arranged to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will perform the same review as above but for LTRI-related deaths in children&#xD;
      between 29 days and 1 year of age. They will also review morgue records for LRTI-related&#xD;
      deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central Information Coordinator (IMSS staff member) will perform monthly reviews of the&#xD;
      IMSS database for post-neonatal LRTI-related deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will contact the parents/guardians/legal representative of the deceased child to&#xD;
      explain the study and request enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, an interview will be conducted with&#xD;
      parents/guardians/legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMSS medical records will be reviewed by study staff. All LTRI related post-neonatal deaths&#xD;
      will be reported to the Principal Investigator (PI) and to the Safety Review Expert Committee&#xD;
      (SReC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SReC, which is completely independent from GSK Biologicals, will assign causes of death&#xD;
      (CoD) for all enrolled LTRI-related post-neonatal death cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All definite IS cases and LTRI related post-neonatal fatalities will be reported to the GSK&#xD;
      local operating company within 24 hours of identification. In addition all SAEs, deemed to be&#xD;
      related to a GSK vaccine will be reported based on discharged diagnosis only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completeness of key demographic data (date of birth, hospital of birth, gender, and&#xD;
      residential address) will be assessed for a sample of children in the IMSS dataset in a&#xD;
      single annual birth cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random sample (N=1,200) of children from a single annual birth cohort will be selected from&#xD;
      the IMSS dataset for verification of demographic data and vaccination history (the selection&#xD;
      process will continue until informed consent has been obtained for a total of 1,200&#xD;
      children). In-home interviews will be conducted with parents/guardians/legal representative&#xD;
      of all 1200 subjects to gather demographic and vaccination history (EPI card - Cartilla&#xD;
      Nacional de Vacunacion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data collected in the interview will be compared to that in the IMSS dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine history (two doses of DTP) collected from the EPI vaccination cards will be compared&#xD;
      to that in the IMSS dataset. The agreement for DTP will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All IS episodes in a single annual birth cohort of children in the IMSS dataset will be&#xD;
      identified. Data necessary for selection of matched controls (date of birth, hospital of&#xD;
      birth, and gender) will be extracted for these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five controls for identified IS cases will be selected from the IMSS dataset based on the&#xD;
      ability to fulfil the matching criteria. Statistics on the number of matched controls and the&#xD;
      quality of the match will be assessed by IMSS and Rixensart statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: occurrence of IS by passive (IMSS database) and active (RDE)&#xD;
      surveillance and of LRTI-related post-neonatal deaths by passive and active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure: demography data of IMSS affiliate, from IMSS record and parent&#xD;
      interview; DTP history from IMSS dataset and EPI&#xD;
