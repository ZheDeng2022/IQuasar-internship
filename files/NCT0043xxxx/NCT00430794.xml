      To determine the efficacy of the addition of spironolactone to modern blood pressure lowering&#xD;
      treatment regimens in patients with resistant hypertension (whose blood pressure is&#xD;
      uncontrolled despite three blood pressure lowering drugs)&#xD;

      Objective: To assess the antihypertensive efficacy of adding spironolactone to the&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment of patients with resistant hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale: The proportion of hypertensive patients meeting the definition of&#xD;
      resistant hypertension is growing rapidly as doctors use more combination antihypertensive&#xD;
      treatments in order to reach lower target blood pressures. Spironolactone is often used in&#xD;
      specialist clinics for patients with resistant hypertension although it is currently only&#xD;
      licensed in the UK for use in hypertension complicated by primary hyperaldosteronism.&#xD;
      Uncontrolled studies suggest that spironolactone is a very effective antihypertensive in the&#xD;
      modern management of resistant hypertension but we could find no randomised trials in this&#xD;
      setting. In the Sheffield Hypertension Clinic spironolactone is currently used as one of the&#xD;
      drugs of choice in patients with resistant hypertension, particularly in women and is&#xD;
      anecdotally often very effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods. The study will be a double- blind randomised placebo controlled trial with a&#xD;
      parallel group design assessing the addition of 25mg spironolactone to existing&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment, titrated to 50mg if necessary in 40 patients with resistant&#xD;
      hypertension (20 patients per group) over a period of 6 weeks. Resistant hypertension will be&#xD;
      defined as: blood pressures not adequately controlled (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;140&#xD;
      mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;85 mmHg in clinic and on ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring) despite treatment with the maximum tolerated dose of three&#xD;
      antihypertensive agents. All patients' current antihypertensive treatment will include a&#xD;
      thiazide diuretic and at least one of a beta-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor&#xD;
      or angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The primary endpoint will be the difference between&#xD;
      the spironolactone and placebo groups in change in daytime average systolic blood pressure on&#xD;
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring from day 0 to day 42.&#xD;
