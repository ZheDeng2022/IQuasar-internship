      This is a prospective study aimed to validate the ability of capsule endoscopy to accurately&#xD;
      diagnose small bowel Crohn's disease in symptomatic patients who have a non-diagnostic&#xD;
      standard workup. Patients will be randomized to undergo capsule endoscopy either one week or&#xD;
      five weeks after enrolment. Patients will be followed up for up to 3 months after capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the past few years, capsule endoscopy has sparked renewed interest in the investigation of&#xD;
      small bowel Crohn's disease. A PillCam™SB capsule (Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) is an&#xD;
      ingestible, disposable video camera that transmits high quality images of the small&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa. This enables the small intestine to be readily accessible to physicians&#xD;
      investigating for the presence of small bowel disorders such as Crohn's disease. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that capsule endoscopy identifies Crohn's disease when other methods are not&#xD;
      helpful. Diagnostic yields of 70% have been reported in small series of studies performed in&#xD;
      suspected small bowel Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the accuracy and clinical impact of Capsule Endoscopy in&#xD;
      detecting suspected small Bowel Crohn's Disease whose initial evaluation was non-diagnostic.&#xD;
      It will also serve to better understand the impact of capsule endoscopy on the natural&#xD;
      history of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to undergo capsule endoscopy either one week or five weeks after&#xD;
      enrolment. This will allow assessment of the natural history of this form of Crohn's disease&#xD;
      and ensure that any changes in CDAI and QOL after capsule endoscopy are not merely a result&#xD;
      of this natural history.&#xD;
