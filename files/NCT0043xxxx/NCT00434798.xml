  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish a human Campylobacter jejuni infection&#xD;
      model with the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safe application&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Infectious period risk mitigated by close monitoring and prospectively applied&#xD;
                early treatment criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Potential post-infectious sequelae risk mitigated by appropriate strain and host&#xD;
                selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Campylobacteriosis attack rate of at least 75%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine humoral, cell-mediated, and mucosal immune responses in&#xD;
      the newly established human C. jejuni infection model and evaluate short-term (&lt; 3 mo)&#xD;
      protection upon repeat exposure to homologous C. jejuni strain and assess immune responses&#xD;
      associated with protection.&#xD;
