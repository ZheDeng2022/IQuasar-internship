  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-681323 inhibits the action of an enzyme which is known to contribute to the inflammation&#xD;
      seen in such conditions as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.&#xD;
      This study will explore the safety of this drug and its blood levels when given in&#xD;
      intravenous form to healthy human volunteers.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Body weight = 60 kg and a Body Mass Index within the range of 19 to 32 kg/m2&#xD;
             inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have given informed consent and signed the study consent form prior to taking&#xD;
             part in any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no significant abnormality on clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Show no abnormality on haematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis examination at&#xD;
             the pre-study medical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate a clinically normal 12-lead ECG at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver function tests within the reference range at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, GT and&#xD;
             bilirubin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not show evidence of pre-study HIV and hepatitis B and C at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not show a positive pre-study urine drug screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taken prescription or over-the-counter medication within 5 days (or 5 half lives,&#xD;
             whichever is longer) before the first dosing day, unless the investigator confirms&#xD;
             that it will not introduce additional risk or interfere with the study procedures or&#xD;
             outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Show a history or evidence of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Show a history of increased liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) above upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN) in the past 6 months (if known).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate a history of regular alcohol consumption exceeding an average weekly&#xD;
             intake of &gt; 21 units (or an average daily intake of greater than 3 units). 1 unit is&#xD;

             wine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history or presence of any medically significant disease, or any disorder that&#xD;

             particular, gastro-intestinal, hepatic or renal disease or other condition known to&#xD;
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure prior to the first dosing day to more than 3 new medicinal entities within 12&#xD;
             months or has participated in a study with a new medicinal entity within 3 months or&#xD;
             any other study within 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If participation in the study will result in the subject having donated more than 450&#xD;
             mL blood within a 3 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On physical examination the subject is observed to have poor venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An unwillingness of subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with women; or&#xD;
             unwillingness of the subject to use a condom/spermicide in addition to having their&#xD;
             female partner use another form of contraception if the woman could become pregnant&#xD;
             from the time of the first dose of investigational product until completion of the&#xD;
             follow-up procedures.&#xD;
