      Study title: Functional dyspepsia -- effect of acid reducing treatment and individualized&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: 15-20% of all people experience dyspepsia each year. Dyspepsia means pain or&#xD;
      discomfort in the upper part of the abdomen. Accompanying symptoms from the esophagus may be&#xD;
      present. The most important relevant medical examination is gastroscopy, and if the findings&#xD;
      are normal the condition is usually classified as functional dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several disturbances of function are now known as potential causes of such symptoms, and the&#xD;
      optimal choice of treatment may vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study the investigators plan to examine whether different types of functional&#xD;
      disturbances respond differently to medical therapy. In particular, the investigators want to&#xD;
      assess whether comprehensive and individualized information will influence the results of&#xD;
      therapy. This has not been previously studied systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also postulate that disturbances of function of the esophagus may cause&#xD;
      complaints that should be classified as functional dyspepsia even if the symptoms are&#xD;
      atypical. Few studies have been done to evaluate this hypothesis, and there may be potential&#xD;
      consequences for choice of appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models and in humans is recently demonstrated that elevated gastric pH because of&#xD;
      anti-ulcer treatment can trigger food allergy. We use a proton pump inhibitor in our study&#xD;
      and eventually development of food allergy will influence patient's condition in an&#xD;
      observations period. That why we're observing IgE dynamics in our study.&#xD;

      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional dyspepsia is a common disorder affecting approximately 25 % of the adult&#xD;
      population. Functional dyspepsia is defined from symptoms according to the Rome II criteria.&#xD;
      A normal upper endoscopy is also warranted Many of these patients have specific motility&#xD;
      disorders. A more accurate diagnosis could mean a more effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the patients take several tests in order to make a more specific diagnosis.&#xD;
      These include: 24 hour pH-monitoring, oesophagusmanometry, drink test and scintigrafy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study the effect of acid reducing treatment (proton pump inhibitors) on the different&#xD;
      dysmotility-types and also the effect of medical information and advise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will observe concentrations of total IgE and various specific antibodies against food&#xD;
      allergens in serum when taking PPI. Results here can vary dependent on whether the patient&#xD;
      has used PPI anytime before or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are included via referrals from general practitioners and hospital doctors. An&#xD;
      upper endoscopy is performed. If this investigation is normal the patient is considered for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 20 - 60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rome II criteria fulfilled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Helicobacter test negative (urease-test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for exclusion are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior gastrointestinal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with proton pump inhibitors / H2 blockers the last 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy / lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current use of NSAIDs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious psychiatric illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious egg-allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start of the study: symptom score based on symptoms within the last three days. Lanzo melt 30&#xD;
      mg daily is given as a morning dose. Patients are randomized in two groups. Group A is given&#xD;
      thorough information based on the tests taken plus medical treatment. Group B receives&#xD;
      medical treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two weeks symptom score per telephone. After four weeks a new symptom score. A&#xD;
      reduction by at least 25 % is defined as treatment response. These patients continue their&#xD;
      medical treatment for three months. Now all patients receive thorough information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non responders end their medical treatment and they are followed with medical information and&#xD;
      advise the next three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eight weeks symptom score per telephone. After 12 weeks symptom score per telephone.&#xD;
      After 16 weeks the study is ended. Symptom score is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 and 16 weeks the patient evaluates his/her treatment in five categories: Very&#xD;
      satisfied, satisfied, less satisfied, no change, worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven symptoms are scored from 1-7 points based on the last week. The symptoms are:&#xD;
      regurgitation, nausea, early satiety, belching, pain referred to meals, pain not referred to&#xD;
      meals, postprandial fullness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Insignificant symptoms (as usual ignored)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Light symptoms (easy to ignore)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Moderate symptoms (easy to tolerate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quite marked symptoms (not easy to tolerate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Marked symptoms (affects daily activities)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Substantional symptoms (can't do daily activities)&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hour pH monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digitrapper III from Synectics is used. A probe is installed trans nasally to the gastric&#xD;
      lumen where a pH value is registered. Afterwards the probe is placed five cm over the upper&#xD;
      border of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). After 24 hours registration is completed and&#xD;
      analyzed with the use of Polygram 98 from Medtronic Functional Diagnostics AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total reflux index, reflux with meals, postprandial reflux, nightly reflux and long reflux&#xD;
      episodes are registered. Pathologic reflux index is defined as pathological if reflux is over&#xD;
      5 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acid Clearence Time (ACT) is also estimated. It is found by dividing total reflux time with&#xD;
      the number of refluxes. Upper normal limit is set to 0,85 minutes/reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagusmanometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use perfusion manometry. The catheter has sensors in five levels five cm apart. LES is&#xD;
      first localized and length and resting pressure are registered. We test for normal relaxation&#xD;
      with swallowing. Then we test the motility (peristalsis and amplitude/duration of pressure&#xD;
      waves).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scintigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
      We give a standard meal composed of two omelets, one slice of bread and a glass of water.&#xD;
      Radioactive Technesium is injected into the omelet and the meal is eaten in ten minutes.&#xD;
      Picture uptakes are taken according to the protocol the first hour after completion of the&#xD;
      meal. Gastric emptying time is estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drink test The patients drink water 150 ml/min until they feel they must stop. Symptoms are&#xD;
      registered when they stop and 15 and 30 minutes there after. This is a test to determine&#xD;
      accommodation and visceral sensibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests Hemoglobin, sedimentation rate, CRP, leucocytes, thrombocytes, bilirubin, ALP,&#xD;
      ALAT, g-GT, albumin and amylase are taken to exclude organic disease. It does not represent a&#xD;
      variable in the study design.&#xD;
