  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of oral&#xD;
      cladribine when taken in combination with Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study randomized around 200 participants from approximately 50 sites located world-wide,&#xD;
      who have experienced at least one relapse while taking IFN-beta therapy within 48 weeks prior&#xD;
      to Screening, irrespective of disability progression. Secondary progressive multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (SPMS) participants, who were still experiencing relapses, and participants who&#xD;
      have received disease modifying drugs (DMDs), other than IFN-beta therapy, during their MS&#xD;
      treatment history, but were currently on IFN-beta therapy and have experienced active MS&#xD;
      symptoms (at least 1 relapse) during the 48 weeks prior to Screening, were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive up to 4 cycles of oral cladribine or&#xD;
      matching placebo in combination with IFN-beta therapy. Participants who completed the&#xD;
      double-blind portion of the study were invited to participate in an open-label extension&#xD;
      phase of matching study design.&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. An AE was considered as 'treatment emergent' if it occurred after the first drug administration of each period or if it was present prior to drug administration but exacerbated after the drug administration.TEAEs were entered in infections and infestations SOC as per medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) version 11.0</description>

    <measure>Double Blind Period: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerges or worsens relative to baseline during a clinical study with an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered. SAE: Any AE that resulted in death; was life threatening; resulted in persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in/prolonged an existing in-patient hospitalization; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or was a medically important condition. An AE was considered as 'treatment emergent' if it occurred after the first drug administration of each period or if it was present prior to drug administration but exacerbated after the drug administration. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Initially 42 participants randomized under original protocol but enrollment terminated because of hematological toxicities. Protocol amendment 1 and 2 were implemented and enrolled 172 participants. Protocol amendment 5 was generated, resulting in discontinuation of Cladribine and reduction of Extension period and Safety Follow up to 48 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Double Blind Period: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerges or worsens relative to baseline during a clinical study with an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered. SAE: Any AE that resulted in death; was life threatening; resulted in persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in/prolonged an existing in-patient hospitalization; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or was a medically important condition. An AE was considered as 'treatment emergent' if it occurred after the first drug administration of each period or if it was present prior to drug administration but exacerbated after the drug administration. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <population>Safety population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication in the DBP and had follow-up safety data.</population>

        <title>Double Blind Period: Time to First Grade 3 or 4 Hematological Toxicity or Liver Toxicity</title>
        <description>Time to first Grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity or liver toxicity (lymphocytes, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell, neutrophils, white blood cells, hemoglobin, Alanine transaminase (ALT), Aspartate transaminase (AST), Platelets and Bilirubin) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. According to CTCAE v 4.0: Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life threatening or disabling and Grade 5=Death. 10th and 20th percentiles estimated from Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Due to the small number of events, estimates from Kaplan-Meier survival curves could only be derived for lower percentiles. The median (50th percentile) could not be estimated if less than 50% of the participants had an event during the time of the study. Accordingly, lower percentiles are presented according to the number of events observed.</description>

        <title>Double Blind Period and OLE Period: Time to 3-Month Sustained Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Progression</title>
        <description>EDSS progression is based on a standardized neurological exam and focuses on symptoms that commonly occur in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Overall scores ranges from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (death due to MS). A sustained progression on EDSS score was defined as an EDSS progression confirmed into two consecutive assessment. Time to sustained disability progression was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. 10th and 20th percentiles estimated from Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Due to the small number of events, estimates from Kaplan-Meier survival curves could only be derived for lower percentiles. The median (50th percentile) could not be estimated if less than 50% of the participants had an event during the time of the study. Accordingly, lower percentiles are presented according to the number of events observed.</description>

          <title>Double Blind Period and OLE Period: Time to 3-Month Sustained Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Progression</title>
          <description>EDSS progression is based on a standardized neurological exam and focuses on symptoms that commonly occur in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Overall scores ranges from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (death due to MS). A sustained progression on EDSS score was defined as an EDSS progression confirmed into two consecutive assessment. Time to sustained disability progression was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. 10th and 20th percentiles estimated from Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Due to the small number of events, estimates from Kaplan-Meier survival curves could only be derived for lower percentiles. The median (50th percentile) could not be estimated if less than 50% of the participants had an event during the time of the study. Accordingly, lower percentiles are presented according to the number of events observed.</description>

        <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. An AE was considered as 'treatment emergent' if it occurred after the first drug administration of each period or if it was present prior to drug administration but exacerbated after the drug administration.TEAEs were entered in infections and infestations SOC as per medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) version 11.0</description>

          <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. An AE was considered as 'treatment emergent' if it occurred after the first drug administration of each period or if it was present prior to drug administration but exacerbated after the drug administration.TEAEs were entered in infections and infestations SOC as per medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) version 11.0</description>

According to CTCAE v 4.0: Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life threatening or disabling and Grade 5=Death. 10th and 20th percentiles estimated from Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Due to the small number of events, estimates from Kaplan-Meier survival curves could only be derived for lower percentiles. The median (50th percentile) could not be estimated if less than 50% of the participants had an event during the time of the study. Accordingly, lower percentiles are presented according to the number of events observed.</description>
