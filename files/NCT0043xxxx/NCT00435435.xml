      Context Alcoholism is common clinical problem and its treatment has no standard and is&#xD;
      controversy. Different pharmacotherapy's, acamporsate, nalterxone and disulfiram have shown&#xD;
      to improve the drinking outcomes, but there is no randomized comparative studies on the&#xD;
      effects of these three medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the effect of manual based cognitive therapy&#xD;
      in adjunct of three different pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and setting Randomized, open label, multicentre naturalistic study, 12 week continuous&#xD;
      medication followed by targeted medication up to 52weeks and 67 week follow up on voluntary&#xD;
      treatment seeking alcohol dependent outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants 243 alcohol dependent adults. Intervention Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to&#xD;
      receive naltrexone, acamprosate or disulfiram, 50 mg, 1998 mg or 200 mg correspondingly per&#xD;
      day. The patients were met weekly in first month, then after 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
