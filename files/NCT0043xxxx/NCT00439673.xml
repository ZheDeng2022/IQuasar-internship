    <textblock>
      Myelodisplastic Syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by&#xD;
      ineffective hematopoiesis (as a result of increased apoptosis of precursor cells),&#xD;
      progressive peripheral cytopenia, with a tendency to evolve to acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term &quot;syndrome&quot; represents the wide clinical spectrum of this group of diseases, ranging&#xD;
      from mild and stable cytopenia, with a low risk of leukemic conversion and a life expectancy&#xD;
      of several years, to true pre-leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop recently developed a consensus risk-based&#xD;
      International Prognostic Score System (IPSS) for primary MDS, which has markedly improved&#xD;
      prognostic stratification of MDS patients. Following IPSS,it is now possible to identify&#xD;
      patients (i.e. Hig-Risk and Intermediate-2-Risk patients) with a bad prognosis (i.e. a&#xD;
      life-expectancy &lt; 1 year) due to a high risk of leukemic evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation represents the only curative therapy for this&#xD;
      subgroup of high-risk patients. However, this therapeutic option is often precluded for&#xD;
      several reasons (old age, comorbidity, lack of suitable donor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the experimental treatments hitherto tested, 5-Azacitidine (5-Aza) has recently shown&#xD;
      promising results. Moreover, the biological experimental data suggest that the association of&#xD;
      5-Aza with histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as Valproic Acid, and with differentiating&#xD;
      agents, such as retinoic acid, might be synergistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine (Aza C), a pyrimidine nucleoside analog, was developed as an antitumor agent. In&#xD;
      addition to cytotoxic effects, it induces differentiation of malignant cells in vitro. Aza C&#xD;
      inhibits DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme in mammalian cells responsible for methylating&#xD;
      newly synthesized DNA, resulting in synthesis of hypomethylated DNA and changes in gene&#xD;
      transcription and expression. The mechanism by which Aza C produces its effects is most&#xD;
      likely multifactorial. Aza C can produce significant myelosuppression, particularly at higher&#xD;
      doses. Aza C could also be acting as a biologic response modifier. The response of&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitors to cytokines is impaired in patients with MDS. This may be&#xD;
      attributable in part to abnormalities of the signal transduction pathway downstream from the&#xD;
      cytokine receptors. In vitro data suggest that Aza-C can modulate the cytokine signal&#xD;
      transduction pathway, rendering sensitive unresponsive cells to the effects of cytokines,&#xD;
      partially restoring normal hematopoietic regulation. Incorporation of Aza-C into DNA inhibits&#xD;
      DNA methyltransferase and induces DNA hypomethylation. 5-Azacytidine and&#xD;
      5-Aza-2_-deoxycytidine (decitabine), 2 potent inhibitors of cytosine methylation, have shown&#xD;
      strong antileukemic activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, both induce&#xD;
      trilineage responses in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) at dose levels allowing for&#xD;
      outpatient management, with moderate myelotoxicity and no significant nonhematologic&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacytidine is the only drug approved by FDA for the treatment of MDS. The median survival&#xD;
      for patients with MDS and a Intermediate/high IPSS score, treated with conventional care&#xD;
      regimens, is assumed to be 11 months. Patients treated with Azacytidine in the CALGB 9221&#xD;
      trial had a median survival of 18 months. Responses occurred in 60% of patients on the Aza C&#xD;
      arm (7% complete response, 16% partial response, 37% improved) compared with 5% (improved)&#xD;
      receiving supportive care (P &lt;.001). Median time to leukemic transformation or death was 21&#xD;
      months for Aza C versus 13 months for supportive care (P =.007). Transformation to acute&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia occurred as the first event in 15% of patients on the Aza C arm and in&#xD;
      38% receiving supportive care (P =.001). Furthermore, Aza-C improved quality of life,&#xD;
      compared to supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opposing actions of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs)&#xD;
      allow gene expression to be exquisitely regulated through chromatin remodelling. Aberrant&#xD;
      transcription due to altered expression or mutation of genes that encode HATs, HDACs or their&#xD;
      binding partners, is a key event in the onset and progression of cancer. HDAC inhibitors can&#xD;
      reactivate gene expression and inhibit the growth and survival of tumour cells. The&#xD;
      remarkable tumour specificity of these compounds, and their potency in vitro and in vivo,&#xD;
      underscore the potential of HDAC inhibitors as exciting new agents for the treatment of&#xD;
      cancer. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown to be potent inducers of growth&#xD;
      arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptotic cell death of transformed cells in vitro and in&#xD;
      vivo. One class of HDAC inhibitors, hydroxamic acid-based hybrid polar compounds (HPCs),&#xD;
      induce differentiation at micromolar or lower concentrations. Studies (x-ray&#xD;
      crystallographic) showed that the catalytic site of HDAC has a tubular structure with a zinc&#xD;
      atom at its base and that these HDAC inhibitors, such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid&#xD;
      (SAHA) and trichostatin A, fit into this structure with the hydroxamic moiety of the&#xD;
      inhibitor binding to the zinc. HDAC inhibitors cause acetylated histones to accumulate in&#xD;
      both tumor and normal tissues, and this accumulation can be used as a marker of the biologic&#xD;
      activity of the HDAC inhibitors. Hydroxamic acid-based HPCs act selectively to inhibit tumor&#xD;
      cell growth at levels that have little or no toxicity for normal cells. These compounds also&#xD;
      act selectively on gene expression, altering the expression of only about 2% of the genes&#xD;
      expressed in cultured tumor cells. In general, chromatin fractions enriched in actively&#xD;
      transcribed genes are also enriched in highly acetylated core histones, whereas silent genes&#xD;
      are associated with nucleosomes with a low level of acetylation. However, HDACs can also&#xD;
      acetylate proteins other than histones in nucleosomes. The role that these other targets play&#xD;
      in the induction of cell growth arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptotic cell death has not&#xD;
      been determined. Our working hypothesis is that inhibition of HDAC activity leads to the&#xD;
      modulation of expression of a specific set of genes, which control has been disrupted by&#xD;
      ectopic expression of EVI1 or similar oncogene, that, in turn, result in growth arrest,&#xD;
      differentiation, and/or apoptotic cell death. The hydroxamic acid-based HPCs are potentially&#xD;
      effective agents for cancer therapy and, possibly, cancer chemoprevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valproic acid Valproic acid (VPA, 2-propylpentanoic acid) is an established drug in the&#xD;
      long-term therapy of epilepsy. During the past years, it has become evident that VPA is also&#xD;
      associated with anti-cancer activity. VPA not only suppresses tumor growth and metastasis,&#xD;
      but also induces tumor differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Several modes of action might be&#xD;
      relevant for the biological activity of VPA: (1) VPA increases the DNA binding of activating&#xD;
      protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor, and the expression of genes regulated by the&#xD;
      extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)-AP-1 pathway; (2) VPA downregulates protein kinase C&#xD;
      (PKC) activity; (3) VPA inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a negative&#xD;
      regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway; (4) VPA activates the peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptors PPARgamma and dagger (Rif. 25); (5) VPA blocks HDAC (histone&#xD;
      deacetylase), causing hyperacetylation. The findings elucidate an important role of VPA for&#xD;
      cancer therapy. VPA might also be useful as low toxicity agent given over long time periods&#xD;
      for chemo prevention and/or for control of residual minimal disease. Authors show that the&#xD;
      well-tolerated antiepileptic drug valproic acid is a powerful HDAC inhibitor. Valproic acid&#xD;
      relieves HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression and causes hyperacetylation of histones in&#xD;
      cultured cells and in vivo. Valproic acid inhibits HDAC activity in vitro, most probably by&#xD;
      binding to the catalytic center of HDACs. Most importantly, valproic acid induces&#xD;
      differentiation of carcinoma cells, transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells and leukemic&#xD;
      blasts from acute myeloid leukemia patients. More over, tumor growth and metastasis formation&#xD;
      are significantly reduced in animal experiments. Therefore, valproic acid might serve as an&#xD;
      effective drug for cancer therapy. These findings constitute a &quot;proof of concept&quot; to use&#xD;
      valproic acid for the therapy of acute leukemia and myelodisplastic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATRA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoids have been shown to have a major role in the treatment of APL. There is also in&#xD;
      vitro evidence that primary blast cells from FAB groups other than M3 can demonstrate&#xD;
      phenotypic evidence of maturation when exposed to retinoid with or without other agents.&#xD;
      Additional relevant information on AML/MDS comes from a number of sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) The addition of retinoid increases the sensitivity of AML blasts to Ara C in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) BCL 2 protein is over-expressed in a proportion of AML cases. There is some evidence&#xD;
      that this correlates with treatment response and survival and, since chemotherapy results in&#xD;
      apoptotic cell death, this may constitute a mechanism of chemo-resistance. Retinoids down&#xD;
      regulate BCL 2 expression AML blasts in vitro. The increased sensitivity of AML blasts to&#xD;
      chemotherapy mentioned above, mediated by retinoid, is due to shortening of the BCL 2&#xD;
      half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (III) In a pilot study by Tallman et al, 39 high risk patients with a median age of 65 years,&#xD;
      most of whom (n=25) had failed to respond to chemotherapy, were treated with ATRA (150 mg/m2)&#xD;
      and LD Ara C. Forty-two percent of patients achieved a CR (25%) or PR (17%) and a further 17%&#xD;
      had stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (IV) In a recent study from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 170 patients with a median&#xD;
      age of 66 years with AML or high risk MDS were randomized to receive FAI (fludarabine, Ara C&#xD;
      and idarubicin) alone, or FAI combined with either G CSF or ATRA or both. The overall 6 month&#xD;
      survival was 49%. In a comparison of ATRA-treated versus ATRA-non-treated patients, there was&#xD;
      a more favourable outcome in recipients of retinoids, with CR rates of 56% vs 42%&#xD;
      respectively (p=0.06) and superior 6 month survival and event free survival (both p=0.02) but&#xD;
      no long-term benefit was demonstrable. In this study the exposure to retinoid was relatively&#xD;
      short, namely from day -2 to day +8 of chemotherapy (Rif. 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (V) In a recent study from Dusseldorf, 18 patients with MDS and AML secondary to MDS were&#xD;
      treated with Valproic Acid (VPA) alone, and 5 patients received a combination of VPA and&#xD;
      ATRA. A favourable response was observed in 44% of the patients treated with VPA alone, with&#xD;
      a median response duration of 4 (3-9) months. Four of the five patients who subsequently&#xD;
      relapsed were treated with VPA + ATRA, two of them responding again. The Authors hypotize&#xD;
      that pre-treatment with VPA might be necessary for a synergistic effect of both drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above evidence suggests that retinoids may be a useful biological response modifier (when&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and/or VPA) with little or no additional toxicity. Their role will&#xD;
      therefore be examined in this trial, in association with 5-Azacytidine and Valproic Acid.&#xD;
