    <textblock>
      This phase II study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of APO866 for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma. APO866 has shown to induce growth&#xD;
      inhibition in cultures of human melanoma cells as well as in animal models with&#xD;
      subcutaneously implanted melanoma tumors. APO866 was considered to be safe and well tolerated&#xD;
      in a phase I study that treated 24 patients with advanced cancer. In that study one of the&#xD;
      two patients with advanced melanoma had a stable disease for 5 months with size reduction of&#xD;
      some lesions. APO866 is administered by intravenous infusion continuously for 96 hours that&#xD;
      is repeated every 4 weeks. Patients will receive 3 cycles of treatment and the primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 16. Patients will be follow-up for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced melanoma is one of the most chemo-resistant types of human cancers. The incidence&#xD;
      increases by about 2.5% on an annual basis, with may partially be related to aging and growth&#xD;
      of the population, as well as other environmental risk factors. Virtually no recent progress&#xD;
      has been made in the treatment of patients with this disease. In the past 30 years, the FDA&#xD;
      has approved only 2 agents, dacarbazine and interleukin-2, on the basis of overall response&#xD;
      and response duration, respectively. However, these outcomes were not accompanied by a&#xD;
      survival benefit. The most recent randomized study of Dacarbazine (DTIC) yielded an overall&#xD;
      response rate of 7%, and to date, no other treatments, including combination therapies, have&#xD;
      shown to improve survival when compared to DTIC alone. Hence, the mainstay of treatment for&#xD;
      patients with advanced melanoma is DTIC-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APO866 is a novel drug that induces cell death by specifically inhibiting the biosynthesis of&#xD;
      Niacinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) from niacinamide, which is essential for the cellular&#xD;
      metabolism, protein modification and messenger synthesis. APO866 is not subject to the&#xD;
      commonly known mechanisms of multi drug resistance (MDR). Its activity is cell cycle&#xD;
      independent. APO866 exerted high anti-tumor activity on a broad range of different tumor&#xD;
      cells derived from both human solid cancers and leukemias in vitro and on a large number of&#xD;
      human xenografts in nude mice, including melanoma, and rats in vivo. Hematologic cancer cells&#xD;
      were highly sensitive to APO866. Lymphocytes are the most sensitive normal cells to APO866&#xD;
      resulting in lymphocytopenia and reticulocytopenia in rats, monkeys. Furthermore, APO866 may&#xD;
      have anti-angiogenic properties as shown in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APO866 was investigated in 24 patients with advanced cancers in a phase I study aiming to&#xD;
      determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Treatment was&#xD;
      well tolerated and safe. The unique DLT was thrombocytopenia. At dose levels higher than&#xD;
      0.036 mg/m2/hr CTC grade III lymphocytopenia, not thought to be clinically relevant, preceded&#xD;
      all other toxicities. The recommended dose for phase II studies of APO866 is 0.126 mg/m2/hr&#xD;
      administered by civ infusion for 4 consecutive days evry 4 weeks. This dose was selected&#xD;
      because of its safety profile, and the translational observation that Css of APO866 at MTD&#xD;
      was similar or higher as compared to the concentrations at which efficacy was established in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo. In addition, a transient decrease of serum vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) levels, a surrogate marker of angiogenesis, was observed within 96 hrs after&#xD;
      the start of treatment in 9 out of 11 patients treated at MTD and the 0.144 mg/m2/hr dose&#xD;
      level of APO866.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No objective tumor response was observed. However, 4 patients had stable disease for at least&#xD;
      3 months: prostate cancer (4 months), melanoma (5 months), sarcomatoid mesothelioma (3&#xD;
      months) and oropharyngeal cancer (5 months). In addition, lesion size reductions were&#xD;
      observed in the melanoma patient (80% size reduction and stable size of other lesions) at an&#xD;
      APO866 dose level of 0.072 mg/m2/hr, and in the mesothelioma patient (moderate size&#xD;
      reductions of pleural lesions) at 0.108 mg/m2/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with APO866 was safe and well tolerated. The anti-tumor effect of APO866, in&#xD;
      particular on melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo, and its anti-angiogenic propriety support&#xD;
      the rationale to conduct a open phase II study of APO866 in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
