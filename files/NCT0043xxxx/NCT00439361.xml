      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the toxicity profile of multiple doses of bortezomib when given with ICE in&#xD;
           patients with relapsed and refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib when given in combination&#xD;
           with ICE chemotherapy in patients with relapsed and refractory classical Hodgkin&#xD;
           lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the overall response rate and complete response rate in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      and refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib is designed to block a protein that plays a role in cell function and growth,&#xD;
      which may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICE is a combination of chemotherapy drugs that, together, may work more effectively at&#xD;
      causing cancer cells to die by stopping cells from dividing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesna is a drug that protects bladder cells from damage by the chemotherapy drug ifosfamide.&#xD;
      It is used to decrease the risk of bleeding in the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start taking the drugs on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These&#xD;
      tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. These tests&#xD;
      may be performed within 28 days of starting the study drugs. If you have had some of these&#xD;
      exams, tests, or procedures performed recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will&#xD;
      be for your study doctor to decide. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of&#xD;
      your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), height, and&#xD;
      weight. You will have x-rays and a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the disease. To&#xD;
      collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and&#xD;
      a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. You will have a&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen, chest, and pelvis and a positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) scan. Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Women&#xD;
      who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test&#xD;
      within 1 month before starting therapy on this study. Because taking part in this study&#xD;
      requires that participants' ability to fight off infections be normal, you will have blood&#xD;
      drawn (about 1-2 tablespoons) to be tested for HIV within 6 months before starting therapy on&#xD;
      this study. If your HIV test results are found to be positive, you will not be able to take&#xD;
      part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive bortezomib as a fixed dose, which will not change unless any&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur. At the start of this study, 3 participants will be given a&#xD;
      dose of bortezomib. If this dose does not cause intolerable side effects, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased as new participants take part in this study. There will be a total of 3 groups&#xD;
      (with 3-6 participants per group) entered at increasing dose levels. The dose of bortezomib&#xD;
      you receive will depend on when you join this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive bortezomib plus&#xD;
      ICE by vein. You will receive bortezomib, on Days 1 and 4, over 5 seconds. The ICE regimen&#xD;
      will be given as a continuous infusion over different times as follows. On Day 1, you will&#xD;
      receive ifosfamide and mesna over 24 hours. On Day 2, you will receive mesna over 12 hours&#xD;
      and carboplatin over 1 hour. On Days 1-3, you will receive etoposide over 2 hours. This&#xD;
      schedule for bortezomib plus ICE is considered 1 cycle (2 weeks) and will be repeated every&#xD;
      14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may have 3-6 cycles of the study drugs, depending on your tolerance of the drugs and the&#xD;
      status of the disease. If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side&#xD;
      effects, you will be taken off this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn once a week for routine tests. You will have a&#xD;
      study visit before the start of each 2-week cycle. During these visits, you will have a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire that will ask about specific side effects you might be experiencing. It should&#xD;
      take about 5 minutes to complete this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 3 cycles, you will return for CT scans, bone marrow biopsies (if they were&#xD;
      positive for disease before you began on this study), and a PET scan to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 3 cycles (if the disease did not worsen and intolerable side effects did not&#xD;
      occur), you may continue on this study for 3 more cycles. During Cycles 4-6, you will have&#xD;
      the same scans and blood tests as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing this study, for every 3-4 months on an indefinite basis, you will have&#xD;
      follow-up visits. During these visits, you will have blood drawn (about 2-3 tablespoons) for&#xD;
      routine tests. You will also have the same scans that were performed during the screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bortezomib and ICE are FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. The combination of bortezomib plus ICE is considered investigational and&#xD;
      authorized for use in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
