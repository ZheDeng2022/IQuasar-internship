  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of resveratrol in treating&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer that can be removed by surgery. Resveratrol may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the relationship between oral dose of resveratrol and the colon mucosal levels&#xD;
      of resveratrol and its metabolites in patients with resectable colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the relationship between colon mucosal levels of resveratrol and its&#xD;
      metabolites and plasma concentrations of resveratrol and its metabolites in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in colorectal cancer tissue before and&#xD;
      after treatment in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine M_1G concentration in colonic cancer tissue and in circulating white blood&#xD;
      cells (WBC) before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Correlate M_1G concentration in colorectal cancer tissue with M_1G concentration in&#xD;
      circulating WBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Assess the Ki67 labeling index in normal and malignant tissues in at least 10 fields per&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate COX-2 expression in colorectal cancer tissue with COX-2 expression in&#xD;
      circulating WBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Assess the toxicity profile of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a two-stage nonrandomized, open-label study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      dose levels in stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE I: Patients undergo an colorectal endoscopy. Patients whose biopsies confirm colorectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma histology and require surgical resection continue on study stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE II: Patients receive oral resveratrol on days 1-8. Patients undergo colorectomy on day&#xD;
      9. A tumor biopsy is performed during endoscopy and colorectomy for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two biomarkers of the potential activity of resveratrol are measured in nonmalignant and&#xD;
      malignant colorectal tissue biopsy samples: levels of M_1G adducts by immunoslot blot&#xD;
      analysis and levels of cyclooxygenase-2 protein/Ki67 by immunohistochemistry. Blood samples&#xD;
      are collected at baseline and during colorectomy for analysis of resveratrol and its&#xD;
      metabolites and other pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
