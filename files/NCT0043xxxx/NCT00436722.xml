  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial in liver transplantation in which conventional&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment will be compared with a therapeutic strategy consisting in&#xD;
      pre-transplant antibody-mediated T cell depletion followed by reduced calcineurin inhibitor&#xD;
      usage. The working hypothesis is that antibody induction followed by calcineurin inhibitor&#xD;
      minimization may promote development of tolerogenic mechanisms allowing the eventual&#xD;
      withdrawal of all immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomised controlled study in which patients will be randomised&#xD;
      according to a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional immunosuppressive treatment or induction&#xD;
      treatment plus reduced tacrolimus dosage. All transplanted patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will be followed during 12 months and evaluated according to an intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1: To determine the proportion of liver recipients in whom tacrolimus usage&#xD;
           can be significantly reduced 1 year after transplantation. Patients will be considered&#xD;
           as successfully receiving a reduced tacrolimus regimen if this drug is given as a single&#xD;
           dose every other day, or at the most administered as a single dose daily with trough&#xD;
           levels &lt; 5ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of induction treatment plus minimized&#xD;
           immunosuppression on graft and patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 3: To determine the impact of induction treatment plus minimized&#xD;
           immunosuppression on the development of: acute and chronic allograft rejection,&#xD;
           hepatitis C virus graft recurrence, opportunistic infections, bone fractures, kidney&#xD;
           failure, tacrolimus-related neurotoxicity, dyslipidemia and arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 4: To establish whether the use of ATG induction followed by reduced doses&#xD;
           of tacrolimus differentially affects anti-donor immune responses and/or promotes the&#xD;
           development of T cell dependent immunoregulatory networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional immunosuppressive protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Methylprednisolone iv 500 mg before laparotomy, and 500 mg at the time of&#xD;
                reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Methylprednisolone iv according to the following schedule: postoperative day 1 200&#xD;
                mg, day 2 160mg, day 3 120 mg, day 4 80 mg, day 5 40 mg, and thereafter 20 mg oral&#xD;
                prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Oral tacrolimus q12h starting on postoperative day 1 in order to reach trough drug&#xD;
                levels between 10 and 15 ng/mL. These levels will be maintained in this range&#xD;
                during the first month after transplantation. Subsequently, tacrolimus levels will&#xD;
                be gradually reduced as follows: : month 1-3: 8-15 ng/ml; month 4-12: 7-12 ng/ml;&#xD;
                afterwards: 5-10 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Progressive prednisone withdrawal between month 6 and 9 after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Treatment of acute rejection episodes: according to our conventional clinical&#xD;
                protocol. All efforts must be done in order to histologically document the&#xD;
                rejection episode. Hence, empirical treatment should be avoided if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. ATG-Fresenius 9mg/kg pre-transplantation, preceded by administration of 500 mg iv&#xD;
                methylprednisolone. Infusion of ATG-F will be started whenever the surgeon confirms&#xD;
                the suitability of the graft, and will take place during 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Oral tacrolimus q12h, starting on postoperative day 1 at the required dosages in&#xD;
                order to reach through drug levels between 5 and 12 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Reduction of tacrolimus dosages starting 3 months after transplantation in stable&#xD;
                patients with no evidences of graft rejection in the previous 60 days, and&#xD;
                according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  posttransplant month 3: 1 dose per day&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  posttransplant month 6: 1 dose every 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  posttransplant month 9: Â½ dose every 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  posttransplant month 12: evaluate the possibility of complete drug withdrawal&#xD;
                     or alternatively establish the optimal maintenance dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Treatment of acute rejection episodes: mild to moderate acute rejection episodes:&#xD;
                re-start 1-2 daily doses of tacrolimus. Severe acute rejection episodes or those&#xD;
                mild to moderate episodes that do not improve after 10 days of treatment: 1-2 daily&#xD;
                doses of tacrolimus plus methylprednisolone 0.5-1 g for 3 days. Resolution of the&#xD;
                rejection episode will be followed by resumption of the above mentioned protocol.&#xD;
                If a new rejection episode takes place, after treatment of the acute episode no&#xD;
                further attempts to reduce tacrolimus dosages will be attempted. In all cases&#xD;
                rejection will be confirmed by liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients suffering from hepatitis C virus infection will be treated as above,&#xD;
                unless alpha-interferon treatment is considered. In this case, daily tacrolimus&#xD;
                will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. All patients will receive CMV prophylaxis with iv ganciclovir for 14 days and oral&#xD;
                valganciclovir to complete 3 months after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample collection during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to routine diagnostic tests, all enrolled patients will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cryopreservation of donor spleen cells to measure anti-donor immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV viral load quantification pre-transplantation and at post-transplant months 1, 6 and&#xD;
           12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will undergo liver biopsy 1 year after transplantation and yearly&#xD;
           thereafter. In addition, HCV positive patients will be undergo liver biopsy 3 months&#xD;
           after transplantation. A portion of all liver biopsies will be cryopreserved for gene&#xD;
           expression studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-donor and anti-HCV T cell immune responses will be quantified before&#xD;
           transplantation, and 6 and 12 months after transplantation by gamma-interferon ELISpot&#xD;
           assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be harvested and cryopreserved before&#xD;
           transplantation, 6 months and 12 months after transplantation to perform gene expression&#xD;
           and flow cytometry studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sample of recipient DNA will be cryopreserved to perform DNA polymorphism studies.&#xD;
