  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic exposure to (cigarette smoke) CS causes biological changes, including airway&#xD;
      remodeling and changes in baseline gene expression profiles at the level of the epithelium.&#xD;
      Our own data indicate that chronic exposure to CS suppresses the ability of epithelial cells&#xD;
      to enhance antiviral gene expression in response to influenza infection and activate host&#xD;
      defense responses. While there is a large body of evidence supporting the notion that&#xD;
      exposure to CS causes significant changes in host defense responses, which may be linked to&#xD;
      permanent changes in epithelial cells at the genomic level, it is not known whether new and&#xD;
      emerging tobacco products have similar or distinct effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) inoculation in human volunteers, this study will&#xD;
      compare influenza-induced responses in non-smokers (NS), cigarette smokers (CS), e-cigarette&#xD;
      smokers (EC), hookah smokers (HS), and Little Cigar smokers (LCS) in vivo. This will be done&#xD;
      by analyzing nasal viral titers, antiviral defense responses, inflammatory mediator&#xD;
      production, and markers of immune responses for LAIV-induced responses between the different&#xD;
      groups of volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoke (CS), e-cigarette smoke (EC), hookah smoke (HS), and Little Cigar smoke&#xD;
      (LCS)-exposed populations will be stratified based on their responses to a smoking diary,&#xD;
      protocol questionnaire, as well as urine cotinine levels (which should be present in all&#xD;
      three groups). We are aware that many current smokers are poly-tobacco product users (i.e.&#xD;
      smoke cigarettes in addition to non-cigarette products), which could be confounding our&#xD;
      observations. This will be controlled for by having potential volunteers complete a smoking&#xD;
      diary and provide daily urine samples for 1 week prior to enrolling in the study. Based on&#xD;
      this diary, subjects will be grouped as CS (cigarettes only), EC (e-cigarette smokers and&#xD;
      smoking less than ½ pack of cigarettes per week), HS (hookah smokers and smoking less than ½&#xD;
      pack of cigarettes per week), and LCS (little cigar smokers and smoking less than ½ pack of&#xD;
      cigarettes per week). Individuals with mixed exposures that exceed those described above&#xD;
      (i.e. smoking more than ½ pack of cigarettes per week in addition to smoking hookah,&#xD;
      e-cigarettes, or Little Cigars) will be excluded from the studies. Potential subjects will&#xD;
      then complete a questionnaire regarding their smoking history, and will undergo urine&#xD;
      collection for measurement of cotinine for 7 consecutive days. Subjects will be assigned to&#xD;
      the different groups as followed: Group NS (no routine exposure to tobacco smoke, and average&#xD;
      log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio &lt; 1.0), Group CS (active cigarette smoker and log10&#xD;
      urine cotinine/creatinine ratio &gt; 4), Group EC (active e-cigarette smokers and average log10&#xD;
      urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4), Group HS (active routine hookah smokers and average&#xD;
      log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4), or Group LCS (active routine Little Cigars smoker&#xD;
      and average log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (2-4 weeks prior to Day 0): Obtain informed consent, history (including smoke&#xD;
      exposure questionnaire), physical examination, vital signs (VS), blood draw (for&#xD;
      anti-influenza antibody titer, HIV and T cell stimulation with flu antigen), urine (for&#xD;
      cotinine), nasal lavage (NL, for differential cell count, viral culture and antigen&#xD;
      detection, cytokine panel), nasal epithelial lining fluid (ELF, collected with filter paper&#xD;
      for cytokine analysis), nasal epithelial biopsy (NB) #1, pregnancy test for females of child&#xD;
      bearing potential. In addition, smokers will undergo spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the research lab daily the for the week prior to D0 to provide a&#xD;
      urine sample for cotinine. Subjects will given a daily smoking/exposure diary during this&#xD;
      time to continue throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 (Monday): Obtain VS, NL, ELF, urine. Administer FluMist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (Tuesday): Obtain VS, NL, ELF, urine, NB #2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 (Wednesday): Obtain VS, NL, ELF, urine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 8 +/- 1 day (Monday-Wednesday): Obtain VS, NL, ELF, urine, NB #3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 21 +/- 7 days: Obtain VS, blood draw, collect completed smoking/exposure diary&#xD;
