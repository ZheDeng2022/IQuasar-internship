  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite broad awareness of the role that diet plays in increasing obesity risk, adherence to&#xD;
      public health recommendations for maintaining healthy eating is low. Insights gained from&#xD;
      weight loss intervention trials find that trial participants report difficulty in restricting&#xD;
      calories, dissatisfaction with the pace of weight loss, inability to control eating, low&#xD;
      palatability of recommended foods and strong food cravings. Indeed, recent systematic reviews&#xD;
      provide empirical support that these subjective experiences that trial participants describe&#xD;
      likely represent eating-related traits or phenotypes . While amassing evidence supports&#xD;
      individual variation in these eating-related traits, to date there has been no systematic&#xD;
      effort to characterize robust eating-related phenotypes. Proposed is a Sub-study initially&#xD;
      planned to be piggy-backed on a planned Study being conducted by investigators at the&#xD;
      University of North Carolina (UNC-- Linnan, Dilworth- Anderson &amp; Evans). The UNC Parent Study&#xD;
      was a feasibility study using community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches to&#xD;
      explore possible intervention strategies aimed to reduce the burden of chronic disease and&#xD;
      cancer among African American families. The NHGRI-led eating behavior Sub-study is proposed&#xD;
      to be integrated with the UNC Parent Study (hereafter referred to as Phase 1). The additional&#xD;
      aims of the Sub-study (hereafter referred to as Phase 2) are to gain understanding of whether&#xD;
      we can characterize clusters of eating-related behaviors that may be associated with&#xD;
      adherence to weight management and weight outcomes. This current protocol lays out the&#xD;
      specific qualitative activities planned for Phase 1 which include conducting structured&#xD;
      interviews with Black Family Reunion organizers (N=8) and a sample of reunion participants&#xD;
      (N=40). We also describe the larger quantitative survey proposed for Phase 2. Pending the&#xD;
      feasibility of the sub-study with the African-American community, we will collect information&#xD;
      on eating-related behaviors in a large sample of individuals (N=350). If the initial&#xD;
      assessments (Phase1) prove that this is not a viable study to be conducted in that setting,&#xD;
      we will consider other population groups and other settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are also considering Phase 3 activities if we identify clusters of eating-related&#xD;
      phenotypes within individuals. Amended IRB applications will be submitted prior to launching&#xD;
      Phase 3.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Phase 1 of the study, targets are family members attending African American family&#xD;
             reunions. Therefore, the eligibility to participate will be: age 18 or older; not&#xD;
             currently pregnant; attending the targeted family reunion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Phase 2 of the study, the population for the study are adults (18 to 70&#xD;
             years-old), with the capability to read English. As this is a feasibility and&#xD;
             exploration study, the recruitment is intended to be broad and to include various&#xD;
             populations and profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Pregnant women will be excluded from participation in the study due to the focus on eating&#xD;
        behaviors and weight.&#xD;
