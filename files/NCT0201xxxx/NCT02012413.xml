  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PST (pulsed signal therapy) is a unique form of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF)&#xD;
      for stimulating healing of damaged structures such as cartilage, bones and soft tissues. The&#xD;
      physical effect of the pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) has been focus of research in&#xD;
      various studies, with cartilage being the most studied, and which has demonstrated an&#xD;
      increase in the synthesis of proteoglican and collagen in vitro. This is an randomized,&#xD;
      controlled and double blind clinical trial. The main objective is to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      improvement regarding anterior knee pain after PST intervention in patients with patellar&#xD;
      condropathy.&#xD;

      The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Clinical Hospital (Hospital&#xD;
      das Clinicas), University of São Paulo (Universidade de São Paulo - USP) under number&#xD;
      0253/11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This patient population is estimated to a total of 40 knees, with the patients meeting the&#xD;
      following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aged between 20 and 50 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  male or female;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patellofemoral pain syndrome without tibiofemoral and trochlear chondral degeneration&#xD;
           according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of patellar chondropathy confirmed by MRI;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  not having started using direct action drugs on the cartilage in the last 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  absence of prior surgery on the studied knee;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  absence of invasive procedures, such as knee infiltration, in the previous 12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  absence of disease in the contralateral limb that would cause an excessive burden on the&#xD;
           studied limb; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  absence of contraindications to performing PST, including a pacemaker, cancer,&#xD;
           infectious disease activity, severe heart failure, arrhythmias, angina, epilepsy and&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of patellofemoral pain is identified by anamnesis and physical examination&#xD;
      performed by knee surgeons with more than 10 years' experience. The presence of all of the&#xD;
      following criteria is required for diagnosis: typical complaint of anterior knee pain with a&#xD;
      duration longer than 3 months (when going up or down stairs, squatting, remaining for long&#xD;
      periods with bent knees), pain on palpation of the patellar articular surface and pain on&#xD;
      patellar compression (reproducing the patient's complaint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion in the study, all of the patients will be instructed (for the duration of the&#xD;
      study) not to use drugs with a direct action on the cartilage (e.g., chondroprotectors, such&#xD;
      as glucosamine and chondroitin) to avoid confounding biases regarding the effects of the&#xD;
      treatments. No patients will be included who had started using these drugs in the previous 6&#xD;
      months to avoid the initial effect of this treatment being a confounder in terms of clinical&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed so that the patient and the orthopedist evaluating the clinical outcome&#xD;
      do not know to which group the patient belongs (i.e., a double-blind study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patient inclusion and signing of the terms of free and informed consent, the patients&#xD;
      will be randomized by a computer into 2 equal groups, i.e., the control and PST groups. The&#xD;
      patients with both knees included in the study will receive randomization for the right knee,&#xD;
      and the left will be automatically allocated into the other group. This method was selected&#xD;
      to best demonstrate any differences between groups. The final distribution of patients into&#xD;
      groups will be therefore not equalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PST application will be then directed to the patellofemoral joint. The PST application&#xD;
      protocol is as follows: 9 daily 1-hour applications, with 5 in the first week, a break for&#xD;
      the weekend, and 4 more the following week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group patients will be submitted to placebo PST treatment with the same protocol&#xD;
      and the device connected not generating magnetic pulses. The device operates silently, and it&#xD;
      is not possible for the patient to determine whether they are receiving the placebo or&#xD;
      treatment, thus maintaining patient blinding. For patients with both knees included, 9&#xD;
      sessions of the treatment are performed on one side and 9 more sessions of the placebo on the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participants are instructed to maintain their usual level of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kujala score will be taken after 3, 6 and 12 months in both groups. If superiority of the&#xD;
      PST group is observed, it was decided for ethical reasons that the placebo group should&#xD;
      receive the PST treatment and would again be followed up for 1-year post-treatment, with the&#xD;
      Kujala score ascertained at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of approximately 20 patients in each group was used for an alpha of 5% and beta of&#xD;
      20%. An effect size of 8 to 10 between groups was sought and is considered clinically&#xD;
      significant in terms of Kujala score.&#xD;
