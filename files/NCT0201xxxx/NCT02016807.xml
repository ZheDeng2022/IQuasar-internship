      RATIONALE: Polymerized (cross-linked) sucralfate malate paste (ProThelial) may be an&#xD;
      effective single therapy approach for the management of chemoradiation mucositis, treating&#xD;
      and preventing its occurrence in the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, small and large&#xD;
      intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This observational multi-phase trial is studying how well polymerized (cross-linked)&#xD;
      sucralfate malate paste (ProThelial) works to prevent and treat mucositis in adult patients&#xD;
      who are to receive or have received chemo/radiation therapy that have caused or is&#xD;
      anticipated to cause mucositis in the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, small or large&#xD;
      intestine. The Phase IV study addresses prevention and treatment in the oral cavity. The&#xD;
      Phase I study addresses prevention and treatment in the esophagus, stomach, small and large&#xD;
      intestine.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND ON INTERVENTION: PROTHELIAL™ Polymerized High Potency Sucralfate Malate Paste&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARD POTENCY VS HIGH POTENCY SUCRALFATE IN MANAGING MUCOSITIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard potency non-polymerized sucralfate is not recommended by MASCC/ISOO (Multinational&#xD;
      Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/ International Society of Oral Oncology) for the&#xD;
      treatment or prevention of mucositis, oral or alimentary. However high potency polymerized&#xD;
      sucralfate has been associated with rapid amelioration and prevention of both oral and&#xD;
      alimentary mucositis in a patient with advanced head neck cancer treated simultaneously with&#xD;
      high dose chemo-radiation. High potency sucralfate is standard sucralfate polymerized into&#xD;
      'sucralfate sheets' that adhere and orderly layer upon the mucosa achieving and maintaining&#xD;
      elevated concentrations of sucralfate long after the initial dose administration. Three hours&#xD;
      following administration, high potency sucralfate maintains a 7 fold greater surface&#xD;
      concentration of sucralfate on normal lining and a 23 fold greater concentration on inflamed,&#xD;
      ulcerated mucosa. In August 2013, the FDA cleared the use of ProThelial, a polymerized high&#xD;
      potency sucralfate paste, as a device for the management of oral mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAPID HEALING BY STANDARD POTENCY SUCRALFATE AT HIGH DOSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early sucralfate investigations showed that undissolved (thus high dose concentration)&#xD;
      sucralfate adherent to the human gastric mucosa caused rapid mucosal changes within 10-60&#xD;
      minutes. These changes included the release of mucus and bicarbonate as well as vacuolization&#xD;
      and exfoliation of superficial enterocytes being replaced by newly regenerated cells.&#xD;
      Laboratory animals given high doses of standard potency sucralfate (3-20 times the standard&#xD;
      14mg/kg dose) were observed to resist gastric injury, rapidly heal mucosal injuries and&#xD;
      showed increased secretion of luminal prostaglandins, mucus and bicarbonate. These mucosal&#xD;
      changes were shown to be linked to the local expression of growth factor receptors and the&#xD;
      secretion of epidermal growth factor. Later research identified that sucralfate-mediated&#xD;
      mucosal changes are growth factor dependent. Independently investigators have concluded that&#xD;
      sucralfate accelerates growth-factor mediated mucosal healing, though the mechanism is&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAPID HEALING BY HIGH POTENCY SUCRALFATE GIVEN AT LOW DOSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      High potency sucralfate is the active ingredient of ProThelial. At standard 14mg/kg doses,&#xD;
      high potency sucralfate causes a 7-23 fold hyper-concentration of sucralfate on mucosal&#xD;
      lining. In a placebo controlled, double blinded multi-center trial involving 60 patients,&#xD;
      there was a 28 day 87.7% healing rate of GERD erosions (compared to placebo's 37.7%) in&#xD;
      patients using high potency sucralfate at 1.5 gram twice daily. This represented a 2.34 fold&#xD;
      or 334% improvement in healing over placebo. Esophageal erosions in both treatment groups&#xD;
      were exposed to untreated gastric acid making the results observed with high potency&#xD;
      sucralfate that much more remarkable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, in a randomized 7 day four-arm trial involving 41 patients with erosive GERD, the&#xD;
      rate of healing for patients using high potency sucralfate was 80%. The 7 day healing rate&#xD;
      for acid therapy groups were considerably lower: omeprazole (20mg bid) was 30% and for&#xD;
      ranitidine (150mg bid) and antacid groups healing was 0%. Apparently the topical coating of&#xD;
      high potency sucralfate affects a mucosa-centric mechanism for healing that appears&#xD;
      indifferent to gastric pH or acid exposure. Comparing the 7 day healing rate of high potency&#xD;
      sucralfate to that of omeprazole there was a 2.67 or 367% improvement similar to that seen&#xD;
      when high potency sucralfate is compared to placebo where there was a 2.34 fold or 334%&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIENCE USING HIGH POTENCY SUCRALFATE FOR ORAL &amp; ALIMENTARY MUCOSITIS IN STAGE 4B HEAD AND&#xD;
      NECK CANCER&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 42 yo head and neck patient treated simultaneously with paclitaxel, carboplatin and&#xD;
      radiation (201Gy), high potency sucralfate (HPS - ProThelial) prevented mucositis, allowing&#xD;
      continuance of standard oral diet. The percutaneous gastric-tube surgically placed in&#xD;
      anticipation of Grade 3-4 mucositis was never used by the patient. While on ProThelial, the&#xD;
      patient never developed mucositis. Noncompliant discontinuation of HPS by patient midway&#xD;
      through chemo-radiation led to the emergence oral and alimentary mucositis with oral&#xD;
      erythema, nausea and diarrhea. Two days following resumption of HPS, both oral and alimentary&#xD;
      mucositis disappeared. Throughout treatment with ProThelial a normal oral diet was maintained&#xD;
      and no analgesia was required for mucositis. Patient reported no adverse events while on HPS&#xD;
      for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTHELIAL'S DEVICE MECHANISM OF ACTION - EXPEDITED HEALING&#xD;
&#xD;
      High potency sucralfate in polymerized sucralfate malate paste has a device mechanism of&#xD;
      action. It is assumed that the more efficient layering of polymerized sucralfate paste&#xD;
      produces adherent restrictive microenvironment across the mucosal lining which advantages the&#xD;
      activation of growth factor receptors by growth factor. Restrictive micro-environs generated&#xD;
      by cross-linked layers of polymerized sucralfate &quot;crowds&quot; free-moving growth factor, limiting&#xD;
      its random movements to &quot;pockets&quot; that overlie growth factor receptors. Spatially limiting&#xD;
      the movement of growth factor to the vicinity of its receptor heightens the chances of&#xD;
      receptor site activation. This device action leads to expedited healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTHELIAL'S DEVICE MECHANISM OF ACTION - REVERSING MUCOSA-BASED PAIN, NAUSEA, VOMITING &amp;&#xD;
      DIARRHEA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surface &quot;pockets&quot; of restrictive micro-environs created by Prothelial's unique layering&#xD;
      probably affect the flux of ions across mucosal receptors responsible for pain, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting and neuro-secretory diarrhea. These specialized mucosal receptors triggered by&#xD;
      chemo-radiation maintain their state of activation by means of gated-ion fluxes across&#xD;
      surface membranes that face the lumen of the gut. It is probable that the same restrictive&#xD;
      micro-environs that crowd growth factors to the vicinity of their receptors also affect the&#xD;
      surrounding space available to membranes for ion-flux and exchange. Spatial limitation of the&#xD;
      immediate surface environment surrounding ion-gated receptors along the GI tract impact the&#xD;
      receptor's ability to perpetuate the ion fluxes required to keep the receptor &quot;turned on&quot; or&#xD;
      stimulated. Physically restrictive micro-environs surrounding membranes of stimulated&#xD;
      receptors exhaust the ions immediately available to it for exchange. This limits the ability&#xD;
      of the receptor to stay &quot;on&quot;. The result is the quiescence of the membrane and the reduction&#xD;
      of receptor-associated pain, nausea (thereby vomiting) and neurosecretory diarrhea, all of&#xD;
      which are triggered by chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;
