  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to compare the growth parameters of children&#xD;
      approximately 2* years of age, who as infants were randomized to receive either a&#xD;
      lower-protein formula (&quot;experimental formula&quot;; EF) with 12.8 g/L protein or a standard&#xD;
      formula (SF) with 14.1 g/L protein or who were human milk (HM) fed for the first 4 months of&#xD;
      life. The secondary objective was to describe diet and nutrient intake in this cohort of&#xD;
      children. The exploratory objectives were to describe stool microbiota in a subset of this&#xD;
      cohort and stool composition (stool soap and nonsoap fatty acids, total fatty acids, and&#xD;
      minerals) in a second subset of this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (* The mean age of subjects was 33.0 months due to a delay in the study start-up.)&#xD;

      This was an observational, single-site, follow-up study of healthy children who as infants&#xD;
      who had completed study 9052A1-3000. An attempt was made to contact all subjects who had&#xD;
      completed study 9052A1-3000 by telephone to ask them to participate in study 9052A1-3001.&#xD;
      Approximately 66 and 60 subjects were planned to participate in the stool microbiota and&#xD;
      stool composition substudies, respectively.&#xD;
