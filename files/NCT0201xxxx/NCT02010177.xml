        Subjects with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis defined as aortic valve area of less than&#xD;
        1 cm2 or index area of 0.6 cm2/m2 by echocardiography, together with low-gradient (mean&#xD;
        gradient across the aortic valve &lt;40 mmHg) who are referred for treatment of AS will be&#xD;
        recruited. A total of up to 100 consecutive subjects of both genders will be enrolled at&#xD;
        the Sheba Medical Center. The study procedures, clinical management and follow up will be&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe aortic stenosis defined as aortic valve area of less than 1 cm2 or index area&#xD;
             of 0.6 cm2/m2 and low gradient (mean gradient across the aortic valve &lt;40 mmHg) by&#xD;
             echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis referred for medically indicated AVR&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Signed informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy or breast feeding (women of childbearing potential will have a serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Need for emergency surgery for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any case in which the practicing physician asserts that enrollment in the protocol&#xD;
             will adversely affect the patient treatment course.&#xD;
