  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study whether distressed medical residents, fellows, and&#xD;
      faculty health professionals benefit from completing online an anonymous and interactive&#xD;
      screening of stress, depression, substance use, and suicidal thoughts. The screening and&#xD;
      ability to interact online with a clinician anonymously are hypothesized to increase&#xD;
      willingness to come for counseling in person. Suicide risk factors are expected to be lower&#xD;
      once the distressed medical trainee or faculty member receives treatment.&#xD;

      According to theories such as motivational interviewing and stages of change, individuals&#xD;
      change health behaviors when the benefits (e.g., being less stressed) outweigh the risks&#xD;
      (e.g., concerns about confidentiality of treatment). Prior research suggests that educational&#xD;
      programming to promote the benefits and counter the perceived risks of counseling increases&#xD;
      adults' motivation to get professional help. Distressed physicians' motivation to seek help&#xD;
      following an educational intervention has not been evaluated but organizations such as the&#xD;
      American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Association for the Accreditation of Graduate&#xD;
      Medical Education, and the American Medical Association have developed policies and&#xD;
      programming to educate physicians about the importance of treating depression and reducing&#xD;
      suicide risk in themselves and their colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;best practices&quot; suicide prevention program in 50+ US universities, the American Foundation&#xD;
      for Suicide Prevention's Interactive Screening Program (ISP), was identified by the Oregon&#xD;
      Health and Science University (OHSU) Resident and Faculty Wellness Program (RFWP) clinicians&#xD;
      as a possible avenue by which to reach distressed OHSU trainees and faculty and encourage&#xD;
      them to get help. The &quot;Stress and Depression Questionnaire&quot; is an anonymous, online screening&#xD;
      tool for stress, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, and suicide risk. Responses&#xD;
      are scored and ranked according to level of distress and risk with Tier 1 representing &quot;high&#xD;
      risk, high distress&quot; and Tier 2 &quot;moderate distress, less risk&quot; and Tier 3 &quot;low or no distress&#xD;
      or risk&quot;. RFWP clinicians will monitor responses, provide prompt communication back to the&#xD;
      participants with information about how they scored, resources available to them, address any&#xD;
      questions/concerns they might have and invite them to set up an appointment at the RFWP (if&#xD;
      distressed). Moutier and her colleagues at a similar size academic medical center to OHSU,&#xD;
      University of California at San Diego (UCSD), administered this survey to all medical&#xD;
      students, residents, fellows, and faculty (13% completed it) and the majority eventually seen&#xD;
      by clinicians indicated that they never would have sought help if they had not received&#xD;
      feedback on the ISP and been encouraged to come in for evaluation/treatment. Being able to&#xD;
      anonymously dialogue with a clinician about their specific situation and questions appeared&#xD;
      to persuade some participants to come in for an evaluation or accept a referral. This&#xD;
      academic medical center did not have an in-house counseling program for residents and faculty&#xD;
      like the OHSU RFWP-UCSD trainees received an initial evaluation from a clinician and then&#xD;
      were provided with community referrals. Their participation rate of 13% is similar to rates&#xD;
      of participation in the ISP in undergraduate populations. In the present study, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that a highly visible and utilized RFWP may lead to a higher ISP participation&#xD;
      rate among the residents, fellows, and faculty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the ultimate goal is to save lives (i.e., reduce the rate of suicide among medical&#xD;
      trainees and faculty), the low base rate of suicide in a population makes it difficult to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the implementation of the ISP at OHSU will lead to a drop in suicide rates&#xD;
      at this institution. Even using patient suicidal ideation and attempts as outcomes is&#xD;
      problematic as this information can be difficult to gather unless the patient is actively&#xD;
      involved in treatment at the time. Rather in the present study the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      suicide prevention program will be measured by examining related variables to suicide&#xD;
      risk-increases in protective factors and decreases in risk factors. Specifically, these&#xD;
      researchers seek to decrease known risk factors (e.g., identify and intervene with untreated&#xD;
      depression, substance abuse, high level of stress) and increase protective factors (e.g.,&#xD;
      promote self-awareness, receipt of support and resources and delivery of mental health&#xD;
      services if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce known risk factors of untreated psychological distress (e.g., depression, high&#xD;
           stress level, substance abuse) by encouraging all residents, fellows, and School of&#xD;
           Medicine (SOM) faculty to complete a self-assessment of their level of stress and risk&#xD;
           using the ISP and then offer professional help through a personalized message/dialogue&#xD;
           that directly addresses any concerns/barriers about seeking help at the RFWP and offers&#xD;
           resources for better coping;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase self-awareness in mildly/moderately distressed trainees and faculty who fill&#xD;
           out the ISP and offer preventive/early intervention educational resources via the ISP on&#xD;
           topics that are relevant to them (based on their responses);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate whether all RFWP patients (ones who come to the program via ISP and other&#xD;
           referral sources) report decreased psychological distress, burnout, and risk of suicide&#xD;
           across treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess level of satisfaction with the RFWP educational outreach workshops, consultation&#xD;
           to department leaders (and referral of their trainees and/or faculty), and clinical&#xD;
           services provided to distressed trainees and faculty.&#xD;
