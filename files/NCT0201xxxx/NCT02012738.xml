  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Escalating violence is omnipresent in South African townships and can be traced back to two&#xD;
      core mechanisms: a trauma-related hyper-arousal and a positive rewarding perception of&#xD;
      violence. In the past, there was no therapeutic intervention available addressing both,&#xD;
      trauma and the so-called appetitive aggression. The University of Konstanz has developed a&#xD;
      culturally sensitive and scientifically based short-term intervention for the treatment of&#xD;
      traumatized patients, the Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), that has proven its effectiveness&#xD;
      in various randomized clinical studies in different war-affected populations. Recently, the&#xD;
      NET has been adapted for the forensic offender rehabilitation (FORNET) by also addressing the&#xD;
      perpetration of violence related to a self-rewarding perception of the exposure with&#xD;
      violence. It has shown to be effective in reducing the number of committed offenses in a&#xD;
      perpetrator sample in Burundi and to reduce PTSD symptoms in a perpetrator sample in the&#xD;
      Democratic Republic of the Congo. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficiency&#xD;
      of FORNET in a randomized clinical control trial with a sample of former offenders of the&#xD;
      townships of Cape Town. In addition to the previous studies, we specifically addressed the&#xD;
      context of ongoing stress and linked our findings to epigenetic markers of stress and&#xD;
      violence. Participants were followed over a period of up to 25-months post-treatment. The&#xD;
      FORNET was also disseminated to local staff of our collaboration partners from the South&#xD;
      African Universities and an organization working in the townships to warrant sustainability&#xD;
      of the therapeutic intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A group of 290 former young male offenders and young males at risk for perpetrating or&#xD;
      becoming victims of crime (age 10-40) from Cape Town, recruited via a community based&#xD;
      skill-training program has been interviewed in a first step. Participants with neurological&#xD;
      or psychiatric disorders other than those resulting from exposure to traumatic stress, like&#xD;
      chronic psychosis, were excluded from participation in the study but received referrals in&#xD;
      the professional health care system, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We applied standardised clinical questionnaires in a semi-structured interview for the&#xD;
      assessment of exposure to traumatic stress (Children Exposed to Community Violence (CEVC)),&#xD;
      trauma symptomatology (PSS-I for diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder), aggression&#xD;
      (Appetitive Aggression Scale (AAS); Buss &amp; Perry Aggression Questionnaire), offense types&#xD;
      checklist (from the AAS) and related drug abuse, psychosocial functioning (Work and Social&#xD;
      Adjustment Scale, WSAS) and suicidality (M.I.N.I. 6.0.0., shortened version). Additionally,&#xD;
      we used a questionnaire about social acknowledgement (Social Acknowledgement Questionnaire)&#xD;
      and substance dependence (M.I.N.I. version 6.0.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We set up a randomised clinical intervention trial for the treatment of former offenders that&#xD;
      covers violence perpetration on the one hand and traumatization on the other. 90 participants&#xD;
      were chosen by the highest aggression scale scores and a certain threshold of trauma&#xD;
      symptoms. 17 participants received FORNET, while 14 matched participants received CBT and&#xD;
      another 7 matched participants treatment as usual (Waiting List camp) in a camp. Matching&#xD;
      took place according to the severity of trauma symptomatology, aggressive behavior and&#xD;
      suicidality. 36 participants didn't receive intervention and weren't part of the camp&#xD;
      (Waiting List no camp) but were included in the follow-ups. In order to compare the treatment&#xD;
      effect with the two control groups and follow the long-term effects, post-treatment&#xD;
      assessments with the initial survey were performed about 8, 18 and 25 months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the follow-ups, 17 FORNET participants and 11 CBT participants were included in the&#xD;
      analysis. Two CBT clients had been excluded since they had not come to the follow-ups, one&#xD;
      CBT client died a relatively sudden death due to a severe disease. The camp waiting list had&#xD;
      been reduced to only six persons since one participant of the waiting list has been stabbed&#xD;
      to death in a gang fight. Therefore a combined waiting list has been emerged from the two&#xD;
      waiting lists (&quot;camp&quot; and &quot;no camp&quot;). 13 men from the &quot;no camp&quot;-waiting list were excluded&#xD;
      since they have not been to the follow ups. From the residual 21 clients from this waiting&#xD;
      list, 11 have been matched (together with the six participants from the &quot;camp&quot;-waiting list)&#xD;
      with the participants from the FORNET and CBT group in terms of post traumatic stress symptom&#xD;
      severity, level of appetitive aggression and suicidality. In the end 17 FORNET-, 11CBT- and&#xD;
      17 waiting list-attendees have been included into the analysis, hence a total sample size of&#xD;
      45 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 subjects of the control group, that still fulfilled the criteria for the therapy study&#xD;
      and were interested in it, received FORNET by trained ZA staff for ethical reasons and to&#xD;
      examine whether it is possible to effectively disseminate FORNET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the subjective data, we will corroborate the results with the assessment of&#xD;
      epigenetic consequences of appetitive aggression and trauma and investigate its significance&#xD;
      and persistence in the long-term course of the study. We propose that specific DNA&#xD;
      methylation patterns are important markers of environmentally driven mental health&#xD;
      pathologies, such as chronic aggression/violence and traumatic stress in such a sample of&#xD;
      perpetrators or young males at risk for perpetration. Further, we will test the stability of&#xD;
      DNA methylation and its potential modification over a period of up to 25 months by&#xD;
      behavioural intervention (FORNET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples (2ml) were collected through a non-invasive method using Oragene-Discover&#xD;
      (OGR- 500) Collection Kit (DNA genotek, Ontario, Canada). We will collect two DNA saliva&#xD;
      samples and one RNA saliva sample. Methylation patterns will be assessed at the University of&#xD;
      Stellenbosch (Prof. Soraya Seedat), focussing on markers of trauma and violence.&#xD;
