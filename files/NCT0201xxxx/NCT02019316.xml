    <textblock>
      BioSteel Sports Drink (BSD), a proprietary blend of branched chain amino acids, taurine, and&#xD;
      B vitamins, has increased its popularity among professional and amateur athletes. BioSteel&#xD;
      claims that BSD attenuates muscular and mental fatigue, and enhances recovery when consumed&#xD;
      before and during intense exercise. To date, the efficacy of BSD on attenuating muscular and&#xD;
      mental fatigue, and enhancing recovery during repeated bouts of intense exercise is unknown.&#xD;
      In a blind crossover study, participants will be subjected to sprint interval exercise&#xD;
      followed by muscular and cognitive function testing under two conditions: BSD and&#xD;
      isoenergetic control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is expected to start in January 2014 and be completed by December 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten exercise trained male athletes (18-35 years) will complete a repeated testing protocol&#xD;
      under 2 experimental conditions in a systematically rotated blind crossover design: BSD and&#xD;
      isoenergetic carbohydrate control, separated by 1 week. The testing protocol will consist of&#xD;
      sprint interval exercise (4-repeated Wingate cycle tests, resistance at 10% body mass&#xD;
      separated by 4 min recovery bouts, followed by 4 muscular fatigue and 2 cognitive function&#xD;
      tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1-2 weeks prior to testing, participants will complete two familiarization&#xD;
      sessions in the laboratory. During the first session (~2h), participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a physical activity readiness questionnaire and a participant information form for&#xD;
      personal and familial health history to rule out any pathologies or health issues that may&#xD;
      preclude them from participating in the present study. Additionally, their body composition&#xD;
      will be determined via BodPod (air displacement chamber), and they will also be screened via&#xD;
      5 exercise tests used in National Hockey League Combine (150 lb bench press, 8 lb sitting&#xD;
      medicine ball toss, standing long jump, vertical jump and maximal oxygen consumption test on&#xD;
      a cycle ergometer). During the second session (~1h), they will familiarize themselves with&#xD;
      the 2 cognitive tests. This testing is designed to eliminate any learning effect of repeat&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On test days (~5h), participants will arrive at the laboratory at ~0800h following a 12-h&#xD;
      overnight fast, and with limited activity (drive/use of the elevator to get to the lab).&#xD;
      Participants will be fed a standardized breakfast (7 kcal/kg body weight) and allowed 2 hours&#xD;
      to digest prior to testing. Thirty minutes before exercise, participants will ingest either&#xD;
      500ml of BSD (0.18 calories/kg body weight) or an isoenergetic carbohydrate control of&#xD;
      similar taste/appearance in a blind fashion. Participants will be given a 5-minute warm up,&#xD;
      then complete a session of sprint interval exercise (4 repeated Wingate tests, separated by 4&#xD;
      minutes recovery). Following the exercise, 4 National Hockey League Combine tests will be&#xD;
      completed to evaluate muscular fatigue (150 lb bench press, sitting medicine ball toss,&#xD;
      standing long jump, and vertical jump), and 2 cognitive function tests. Participants will&#xD;
      then receive a 15-minute non-exercise recovery where they will consume another 500ml of&#xD;
      supplement (or placebo) and complete the testing protocol again. Ratings of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE) will be collected throughout the exercise and muscular fatigue tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test day timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0800h: Arrive at lab 0805h: Standard breakfast 1025h: Blood sample 1030h: Take supplement&#xD;
      (double blind) 1100h: Blood sample 1105h: Warm up 1110h: Sprint interval exercise: post test&#xD;
      RPE 1130h: Muscular fatigue tests: post test RPE 1150h: Cognitive function tests 1200h: Rest&#xD;
      1215h: Sprint interval exercise: post test RPE 1245h: Muscular fatigue tests: post test RPE&#xD;
      1305h: Cognitive function tests 1315h: Blood sample 1320h: Leave lab&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the experimental trial, participants will be able to drink water ad libidum (volume&#xD;
      consumed will be quantified). The Gatorade condition will have a similar taste/appearance as&#xD;
      BioSteel. Blood samples will be collected via venipuncture in the forearm at 3 time points:&#xD;
      prior to supplement ingestion, 30 minutes post-ingestion/pre-exercise and immediately after&#xD;
      the second testing protocol. Blood obtained will be analyzed for leucine, isoleucine, valine&#xD;
      and tryptophan. All blood sampling will be done by a trained phlebotomist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: Individuals must be healthy, exercise-trained males aged 18-35 years.&#xD;
      Participants will have never consumed BioSteel Sports Drink. To ensure participants are&#xD;
      trained, they must achieve the 2013 National Hockey League Combine average scores or better&#xD;
      on 5 exercise tests (150 lbs bench press, 4 kg sitting medicine ball toss, standing long&#xD;
      jump, vertical jump and maximal oxygen consumption test on cycle ergometer). Women will be&#xD;
      studied subsequently to asses whether gender differences exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Collection: Blood samples will be collected by venipuncture of an arm vein by a trained&#xD;
      phlebotomist as with previous studies conducted in our lab. Briefly, participants will be&#xD;
      sitting comfortably in a chair with an armrest for the specimen collection. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects will be thoroughly briefed regarding the blood draws, and blankets, pillows, food&#xD;
      and drink will be available in the event a subject reacts negatively. Standard sterile blood&#xD;
      handling techniques will be used including disposable medical examination gloves, alcohol&#xD;
      swabs, and needles. All blood contaminated materials will be disposed of in a hazardous&#xD;
      material labeled disposal container, promptly after analysis. The specimens will be collected&#xD;
      in EDTA-treated tubes, undergo treatment following ELISA kit protocols, centrifuged, and&#xD;
      stored in a freezer at -70°C in the Exercise Nutrition Research Lab until hormone analysis in&#xD;
      the same laboratory. The frozen specimens will remain stable for approximately 1 month.&#xD;
      Therefore, the blood analyses will be completed within that time frame, after which they will&#xD;
      be disposed of appropriately. The samples will be controlled and cared for by the principal&#xD;
      investigator Dr. Peter Lemon and Kolten Abbott.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition: Will be measured by densitometry using air displacement plethysmography via&#xD;
      a BodPod® (involves sitting comfortably in a chamber for about five minutes while the space&#xD;
      the body takes up is measured).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic Capacity: Will be quantified via an incremental exercise cycle ergometer test. This&#xD;
      test is conducted routinely in our laboratory and will follow American College of Sport&#xD;
      Medicine guidelines (Gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wingate test: Will be conducted using a cycle ergometer which electronically measures power&#xD;
      (average, peak and decline). Resistance will be equal to 10% of subject body mass in kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscular power and endurance: Four measurements will be conducted in accordance to the&#xD;
      National Hockey League Combine guidelines (Gledhill &amp; Jamnik, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bench press repetitions of 150 lb (including the barbell) will be performed at a rate of&#xD;
           25 repetitions per minute, the number of consecutive repetitions until the individual&#xD;
           can not keep up the cadence will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sitting medicine ball toss using a standard 8 lb medicine ball. Subject will sit on the&#xD;
           floor with their back flat against the wall and legs straight out (hips flexed and the&#xD;
           knees extended). The ball will start at the chest and be pushed out. When the ball first&#xD;
           lands will be measured as the total distance (recorded in cm.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standing long jump will be conducted from a standing start with feet together. The&#xD;
           distance from the jumping line to the individuals heels will recorded as the total&#xD;
           distance (recorded in cm.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vertical jump will be conducted from a standing start. Fingers outstretched on the&#xD;
           dominant arm will reach as a high as possible deflecting a plastic marker. Without a&#xD;
           pre-step individual will jump as a high as possible. Measurement is to the nearest cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive function: Two tests will be conducted on a computer located within the Exercise&#xD;
      Nutrition Research Laboratory. Subjects will receive 5 minutes to complete each cognitive&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Modified Stroop test- a measurement of attentional fatigue and executive function, will&#xD;
           be scored based on error rate and mean response time (Kane &amp; Kay, 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trail Making Test Part B- a measurement of visual attention and speed of processing,&#xD;
           will be scored on total time to completion (Sanchez-Cubillo et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ratings of perceived exertion: Will be assessed after each sprint interval trial and at the&#xD;
      conclusion of muscular endurance and power testing via a Borg Scale (Noble et al., 1983).&#xD;
