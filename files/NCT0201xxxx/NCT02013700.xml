      This is a phase I, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled 9 subjects pilot safety run-in&#xD;
      followed by an additional 16 randomized subjects for a total of 25 subjects. In the pilot&#xD;
      phase subjects will be randomized into three treatment groups of allogenic mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells and in the randomized phase subjects will receive either allogenic mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells or matched placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and debilitating lung disease&#xD;
      characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and pulmonary&#xD;
      insufficiency eventually resulting in death. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis&#xD;
      (IPF) typically present with complaints of sub acutely progressive dyspnea and non-productive&#xD;
      cough, often accompanied by digital clubbing. Due to the insidious onset of symptoms,&#xD;
      however, most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease after significant fibrosis&#xD;
      has occurred. Physical exam is characterized by hypoxemia, &quot;dry&quot; inspiratory crackles on&#xD;
      auscultation, and occasional digital clubbing (6). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) usually&#xD;
      reveal restrictive lung physiology with progressive decline of forced vital capacity (FVC),&#xD;
      diffusion capacity (DLCO) and six-minute walk distances. Diagnosis is established by the&#xD;
      pathologic finding of usual interstitial pneumonia (with sub epithelial fibroblastic foci) by&#xD;
      open lung biopsy (7), and/or by high resolution CT (HRCT) demonstrating the characteristic&#xD;
      findings of peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular changes with fibrosis, honeycombing,&#xD;
      and traction bronchiectasis (8, 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is uniformly poor. The&#xD;
      natural history of the disease is characterized by inexorable progressive decline&#xD;
      interspersed with &quot;exacerbations&quot; or periods of accelerated disease which are often fatal&#xD;
      (5). There are no FDA approved treatment options for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis (IPF) and thus no standard of care. In cases of patients under the age of 60 with&#xD;
      limited comorbid disease, lung transplant may be offered. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis (IPF) receive empiric treatment, supportive care alone, and more recently, are&#xD;
      offered enrollment in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by epithelial cell&#xD;
      injury and activation with interstitial inflammation, fibroblast proliferation with&#xD;
      extracellular matrix collagen deposition, and eventual loss of function. Because mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells are known to home to sites of injury, inhibit inflammation, and contribute to&#xD;
      epithelial tissue repair, their use has been suggested as a novel therapy for the treatment&#xD;
      of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).&#xD;
