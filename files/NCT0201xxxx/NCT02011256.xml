      The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of atrial fibrillation in patients&#xD;
      with transient ischemic attack (TIA). Patients suffering TIA will have their heart rhythm&#xD;
      extensively monitored with 72-hour Holter-monitoring and an implantable loop-recorder.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the patients will be examined with echocardiography, coronary calcium-score and&#xD;
      biomarkers with the purpose to predict which subjects at risk for developing atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of death and the survivors are often left with severe disability.&#xD;
      Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an episode of neurological dysfunction, but unlike stroke,&#xD;
      the neurological deficits resolve completely within 24 hours. TIA and stroke share the same&#xD;
      common underlying cause, and patients with a TIA are at high risk for developing a subsequent&#xD;
      stroke. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is recognized as&#xD;
      the cause of around 25% of all strokes. The prevalence of AF rises with age, and it is&#xD;
      estimated, that approximately 5-10% of all subjects over the age of 80 years has either&#xD;
      persistent or paroxysmal AF. Regardless of the AF subtype the risk for stroke is the same,&#xD;
      and oral anticoagulation therapy is recognized as a superior treatment of AF related&#xD;
      stroke/TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to extend the normal workup of patients with TIA with a thorough&#xD;
      heart monitoring program. This includes 72-hours ambulatory electrocardiogram and insertion&#xD;
      of an implantable loop recorder (ILR). The ILR is small device implanted in the subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue in the left thoracic region. The device continuously monitors for arrhythmias in a&#xD;
      period up to 3 years. The 150 patients enrolled will also receive an ultrasound examination&#xD;
      of the heart and arteries of the neck and a computed tomography scan of the heart. Lastly,&#xD;
      biomarkers with known or suspected association with stroke and AF will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to determine, whether or not an extended heart monitoring&#xD;
      program with an ILR will identify more patients with AF as the underlying cause of TIA. This&#xD;
      can have enormous advantages for the patient, because the treatment with oral anticoagulation&#xD;
      therapy reduces the risk of subsequent stroke by approximately 40% compared to conventional&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy. Secondly, the study means to identify patients at high risk for&#xD;
      developing AF assessed with ultrasound, computed tomography and novel biomarkers.&#xD;

    <description>All TIA-patients with no prior history of atrial fibrillation (AFLI) will be monitored for AFLI with 1) regular 12-lead ECG 2) 72-h Holter-monitoring and 3) implantable loop-recorder (ILR). If AFLI is diagnosed, then the patients will not receive further monitoring ie. not all patients will get Holter or ILR.</description>
