  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of autologous (self) transplantation of Neurotrophic factors-secreting&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC-NTF, NurOwn™) in patients with ALS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSC-NTF cells are a novel cell-therapeutic approach which is expected to effectively deliver&#xD;
      Neurotrophic factors, which are potent survival factors for neurons, directly to the site of&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MSC-NTF cell therapy (NurOwn™) is based on transplantation of autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are enriched from the patients' own bone&#xD;
      marrow, propagated ex vivo and induced to secrete NTFs. The autologous MSC-NTF cells are&#xD;
      back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are&#xD;
      considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the&#xD;
      immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their&#xD;
      survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well&#xD;
      tolerated and appears to be generally safe. Some initials indications of clinical benefit&#xD;
      were also observed in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of&#xD;
      MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients. Patients will be followed for approximately three&#xD;
      months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo. During this&#xD;
      period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be&#xD;
      isolated and expanded. Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six&#xD;
      months at monthly visits.&#xD;
