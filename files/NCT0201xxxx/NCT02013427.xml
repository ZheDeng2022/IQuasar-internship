    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine brain properties for placebo response in chronic back pain&#xD;
      patients. The investigators have preliminary data indicating that, in blinded clinical trial&#xD;
      studies with neutral instructions regarding treatment, chronic back pain (CBP) patients can&#xD;
      be subdivided into placebo responders and non-responders, and these differences are&#xD;
      PREDICTABLE a priori, by brain activity. The results imply that CBP placebo may have clinical&#xD;
      utility and that its properties can be studied by human brain imaging techniques. In Phase I&#xD;
      of the study, the investigators seek to identify brain imaging parameters that predict the&#xD;
      propensity for the placebo response in an independent CBP cohort. In Phase II, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the interaction between placebo response and medication treatment&#xD;
      in individuals stratified as placebo responders versus non-responders. This research is&#xD;
      designed to critically assess the neurobiology of placebo analgesia for chronic pain in a&#xD;
      partially-blind clinical trial.&#xD;

      Below is a detailed description of what the study would entail (in other words, what would be&#xD;
      expected during each visit for the duration of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (week -2): Pre-treatment screening (180 min). Participants will complete the&#xD;
           informed consent process and are evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria. A&#xD;
           medical/pain history and physical examination will be completed and participants will be&#xD;
           asked to assess current back pain intensity on a VAS scale (0-100mm, no pain to worst&#xD;
           possible pain). Participants complete questionnaires and return within 2 weeks for&#xD;
           baseline MR imaging scans. Blood will be drawn for a baseline screen to obtain a&#xD;
           complete blood count, chemistry panel, and liver function tests. Participants will be&#xD;
           asked to discontinue their current pain medications 14 days (2 weeks) prior to their&#xD;
           baseline visit and take only acetaminophen rescue medication during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 (week 0): Baseline visit (60-90 min). Participants complete the VAS pain scale,&#xD;
           and if their pain is above a designated level and no changes in clinical status are&#xD;
           reported, they complete a battery of questionnaires and undergo fMRI procedures&#xD;
           (anatomical and functional scans). Participants will then be randomized to one of three&#xD;
           groups: active treatment, or placebo, or no-treatment groups; this is done in a&#xD;
           partially blind fashion (explained below), with medication dispensed in sufficient&#xD;
           quantities until the next visit. The placebo group will receive two placebo capsule bid,&#xD;
           and the standard of care group will receive one naproxen capsule (500mg) and one&#xD;
           esomeprazole capsule (20 mg) bid for the treatment period. The active and placebo&#xD;
           treatment groups are double-blinded, meaning that neither the participant nor the&#xD;
           researchers will know which treatment participants are receiving (in part through the&#xD;
           use of identical re-encapsulation of study agents). The no-treatment group allocation is&#xD;
           not blind, as both participants and study staff will be aware that these participants&#xD;
           are not receiving study agent. The no treatment group and all participants assigned to a&#xD;
           treatment group will continue to receive rescue medication (n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 (week 2): End of Treatment Period 1/Washout (60-90 min). All procedures will be&#xD;
           performed as described for Visit 2. A set of questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
           Adherence will be assessed by pill counts, use of rescue medication documented, and&#xD;
           participants will be queried about any side effects experienced. Only rescue medication&#xD;
           will be dispensed, to all participants, as they will begin a one week washout of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 (week 3): End of Washout/Beginning Treatment Period 2 (60-90 min). All&#xD;
           procedures will be performed as described for Visit 3, plus the addition of brain scans.&#xD;
           Adherence will be assessed by use of rescue medication documented, and participants will&#xD;
           be queried about any side effects experienced. Study medication will be dispensed in&#xD;
           sufficient quantities until the next visit. All participants remain with the same&#xD;
           treatment assignment as in Period 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 (week 5): End of Treatment Period 2/Washout 2 (60-90 min). All procedures will&#xD;
           be performed as described for Visit 3, with the addition of post-treatment imaging&#xD;
           scans. Adherence will be assessed by pill counts, use of rescue medication documented,&#xD;
           and participants will be queried about any side effects experienced. Only rescue&#xD;
           medication will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6 (week 6): End of Washout 2 (90 min). Participants will return to complete&#xD;
           questionnaires but no imaging studies will be conducted. Use of rescue medication and&#xD;
           side effects will be documented. Exit interviews will be conducted at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interim periods: During weeks in between visits, participant data will be tracked with&#xD;
           the assistance of a smart phone/computer application designed for the study. Depending&#xD;
           upon preference, the research staff will download an app onto participants' phones or&#xD;
           give them a link to use on their computers; in the case that a participant does not have&#xD;
           a smart phone or easy access to a computer/internet, the study will provide him/her with&#xD;
           a smart phone that has the app already installed. Participants will be given a login and&#xD;
           will be asked to use this application twice a day right after they take their&#xD;
           medication. The app asks participants to rate the severity of their pain and their mood&#xD;
           on a Likert scale, and probes them as to whether or not they took their medication.&#xD;
