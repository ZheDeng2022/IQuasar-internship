      This study investigates the effect of a computerized approach/avoidance retraining (aka&#xD;
      cognitive bias modification) over and above treatment as usual for patients in treatment for&#xD;
      substance use disorders. The computerized training entails viewing pictures of drug and&#xD;
      non-drug related stimuli, and then using the computer to make the drug pictures smaller and&#xD;
      the non-drug pictures larger. Participants will also take part in an EEG/event-related brain&#xD;
      potential assessment at the beginning and end of treatment to identify brain measures that&#xD;
      are associated with treatment response.&#xD;

      Methodology Participants must be receiving treatment for substance use disorders in the&#xD;
      adolescent program of the University of Michigan Addiction Treatment Services (UMATS) clinic.&#xD;
      Participants must be between the ages of 14-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study entails five components&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neurophysiological assessment. (Baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of substance use and psychiatric disorders. (Baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bias retraining treatment protocol. (after baseline, 6 training sessions over a two week&#xD;
           period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Second neurophysiological assessment at the end of treatment. (6 weeks after baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Six-month follow-up to assess substance use and psychiatric disorders. (6 months after&#xD;
           baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each component is described in more detail below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of substance use and psychiatric disorders will be completed using&#xD;
           well-validated structured interviews and questionnaires. This assessment will take place&#xD;
           as soon as participants can be scheduled following their entry into treatment at the&#xD;
           UMATS clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neurophysiological assessment will entail several procedures that reliably elicit brain&#xD;
           responses that are associated with substance use disorders and antisocial behavior. The&#xD;
           first neurophysiological assessment will take place as soon as participants can be&#xD;
           scheduled following their entry into treatment at the UMATS clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different tasks are described below. Participants will be asked to perform tasks that&#xD;
      involve responding to letters and pictures on a computer monitor while physiological&#xD;
      responses will be recorded continuously during the experiment. This will be achieved by the&#xD;
      use of sensors positioned on the head, forearms, palms, and face. These sensors are filled&#xD;
      with a nonirritating paste and attached to the skin using medical tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tasks are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Picture Viewing and Emotion Regulation Task-Duration: approximately 40 minutes The&#xD;
           subject will be presented with a number of different pictures from the International&#xD;
           Affective Picture System (IAPS) including traditional unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant&#xD;
           images as well as images of drugs and drug-related paraphernalia. Pictures are presented&#xD;
           following an instruction cue asking the person to enhance (upregulate) or diminish&#xD;
           (downregulate) their affective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Go/No go task - Duration: 10 minutes During this procedure, participants will respond to&#xD;
           two different letters by selecting one of two buttons that are associated with each&#xD;
           letter. They will be asked to inhibit their response if the letter they are viewing is&#xD;
           the same as the letter just viewed. It is intended to measure cognitive control.&#xD;
           Drug-related pictures will also be included as distractors to examine their effects on&#xD;
           performance and EEG/event-related potential (ERP) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gambling/feedback task-Duration: 10 minutes During this procedure, participants will see&#xD;
           2 squares, side-by-side on the monitor in front of them. Each square will have a money&#xD;
           amount displayed inside of it. Sometimes the squares show 5 cents, and sometimes they&#xD;
           show 25 cents. The task is simply to choose one of the squares on each trial, either the&#xD;
           one on the left or the one on the right. After a delay of about one second, the&#xD;
           participant will be told if he or she won or lost the amount of money inside the square&#xD;
           he or she chose. If the selected square turns GREEN that means the participant won the&#xD;
           amount of money shown inside the square. If the chosen square turns RED that means the&#xD;
           participant lost the amount of money shown inside the square. At the same time, the&#xD;
           unselected will also turn either green or red, to inform the participant how much he or&#xD;
           she would have won or lost if the other square had been selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Bias retraining treatment protocol. In addition to treatment as usual at the UMATS clinic,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into either bias retraining or sham training conditions. At a&#xD;
      pre-test session, participants will complete an approach-avoidance task (AAT) to measure&#xD;
      initial bias to drug-related stimuli. The AAT are each completed on a laptop computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AAT includes 20 pictures of drug-related stimuli and 20 pictures of non-drug related&#xD;
      stimuli. Pictures are presented equally in landscape and portrait format. After the pictures&#xD;
      appear on a monitor, participants will be instructed to use a joystick to either enlarge&#xD;
      (pull the joystick closer) or shrink (push the joystick away) the pictures. In this task, the&#xD;
      required response is unrelated to the content of the pictures. Specifically, participants are&#xD;
      instructed to pull the joystick to approach pictures in portrait format or push pictures in&#xD;
      landscape format. The difference between the median response time for drug versus non-drug&#xD;
      related pictures is used as a measure of bias. The AAT takes 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bias retraining protocol will then utilize the AAT. Participants will again be instructed&#xD;
      to push or pull the joystick dependent upon whether the picture is in portrait or landscape&#xD;
      formant. For participants in the experimental condition, all drug-related pictures will be in&#xD;
      landscape format, that is, all participants in the experimental condition will push the&#xD;
      joystick to shrink the drug-related pictures. For participants in the control condition,&#xD;
      drug-related pictures will be presented equally in portrait and landscape format. During&#xD;
      training, participants have to correct all errors. Training sessions will entail 200 trials&#xD;
      with a short break at the halfway point. Each session takes about 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-test assessment of bias (AAT) will take place as soon as participants can be&#xD;
      scheduled following their entry into treatment at the UMATS clinic. The bias retraining&#xD;
      protocol will begin the day following the pre-test assessment of bias. Participants will then&#xD;
      take part in 6 training sessions (each requires approximately 15 minutes to complete) over a&#xD;
      two week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to and following each administration of the AAT, participants will complete a rating of&#xD;
      their current feelings of craving to use drugs on a 6-point scale ranging from I don't want&#xD;
      to use drugs at all to I would love to use drugs right now. If the participant endorses a 4&#xD;
      or higher on the scale following presentation of the AAT, they will be queried by research&#xD;
      staff who will be trained in basic cognitive behavioral techniques to assist the participant&#xD;
      in reducing any feelings of craving. As participants are actively engaged in treatment for&#xD;
      substance use problems (i.e., consistently thinking and talking about drug use), it is&#xD;
      unlikely that words or pictures of drug-related stimuli will elicit sufficient craving to&#xD;
      trigger a relapse. Also, all participants will either be in the presence of or near a parent&#xD;
      and/or regular treatment provider, further minimizing the risk that any procedures would&#xD;
      elicit a relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a brief symptom inventory at their bias retraining sessions&#xD;
      so that we can track their progress over the course of treatment. The participant's primary&#xD;
      therapist will also be asked to make brief ratings regarding the participant's engagement and&#xD;
      progress at the end of active treatment. Finally, to provide an objective measure of&#xD;
      treatment adherence, participants will be drug tested. Drug testing is conducted randomly as&#xD;
      part of UMATS treatment, and we will request access to the results of those tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) A second neurophysiological assessment will take place 6 weeks following the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, at which point participants will have transitioned out of active treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
      intensive outpatient). Participants will repeat the same protocol as the first&#xD;
      neurophysiological assessment in order to detect any changes in brain responses as a&#xD;
      consequence of treatment condition. Participants will also complete the AAT and a brief&#xD;
      inventory of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) Six months after entry into treatment at UMATS, participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding their substance use and psychiatric symptoms as well as the AAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Design We predict that symptom measures and EEG/ERP measures assessed at baseline&#xD;
      will be associated with treatment response as measured by scores on the brief symptom&#xD;
      inventory administered at training sessions, results of drug testing, and therapist ratings.&#xD;
      Multilevel models will be used to estimate the associations between baseline measures&#xD;
      (modeled as fixed effects) and the repeated measures of the outcome variables (repeated&#xD;
      measures nested within individuals). To examine the effects of treatment condition (bias&#xD;
      retraining versus sham training), a group-based multilevel model (similar to repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVA) will be used to test for any group differences on the EEG/ERP measures&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and the follow-up neurophysiological assessment. Similar group-based&#xD;
      multilevel models (similar to repeated measures ANOVA) will also be used to test for group&#xD;
      differences on the substance use and psychiatric symptom measures assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      the 6-month follow-up, as well as the measures of treatment progress (drug tests, symptom&#xD;
      measures, therapist ratings) assessed between the baseline assessment and the second&#xD;
      neurophysiological assessment at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis and target N for recruitment. For the regression and multilevel modeling&#xD;
      analysis of dimensional outcomes, an n = 85 will provide 80% to detect the anticipated effect&#xD;
      (r = .30, α = .05). For the group-based multilevel models, groups of 41 will provide 80% to&#xD;
      detect the anticipated effect. Therefore, our goal is to recruit enough participants such&#xD;
      that each group (experimental and control) will include at least 40 participants with a&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up neurophysiological assessment. We anticipate a 15% attrition rate.&#xD;
      Therefore, we plan to recruit 94 participants.&#xD;
