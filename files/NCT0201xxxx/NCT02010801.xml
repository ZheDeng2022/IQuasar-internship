  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancers is&#xD;
      one the most common malignancies in the world. Over 10000 new cases per year are diagnosed in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Despite the many treatment options, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. More than&#xD;
      8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. A majority (70%to 85%) of patients&#xD;
      present with advanced or unresectable disease. In contrast, small liver cancers can be cured&#xD;
      with an appreciable frequency. Five-year disease-free survival exceeding 50% has been&#xD;
      reported for surgical resection, and for the inoperable patients who do not have vascular&#xD;
      invasion or extrahepatic spread. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended as an&#xD;
      alternative curative therapy. However, the main drawback of RFA is its limitation to tumor&#xD;
      size and location. The tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter or located adjacent to vessels,&#xD;
      could not be ablated completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE), developed and manufactured by AngioDynamics US Ltd, can&#xD;
      ablate tumor by fenestrating the cancer cell membrane by electric pulse. The anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect does not result from thermotherapy, so is also not diminished by adjacent vessels.&#xD;
      Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated IRE is a safe and effective treatment&#xD;
      for live cancers. The system has received CE mark approval in 2008 and FDA approval in 2010.&#xD;
      However, there is no experience in using IRE fro tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform intraoperative IRE for the patients with liver cancers who are&#xD;
      scheduled to receive hepatectomy in our hospital, and the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      ablate effect of tumors on specimens, and the effect of adjacent vessels. The investigators&#xD;
      will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of the system by this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of HCC or other cancers with hepatic metastatic with pathologic proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of HCC will be made by pathology / cytology or according to the&#xD;
             AASLD(2010) diagnostic criteria. In brief, Nodules larger than 1 cm found on&#xD;
             ultrasound screening of a cirrhotic liver should be investigated further with either&#xD;
             4-phase multidetector CT scan or dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. If the appearances are&#xD;
             typical of HCC (i.e., hypervascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal&#xD;
             venous or delayed phase), the lesion should be treated as HCC. If the findings are not&#xD;
             characteristic or the vascular profile is not typical, a second contrast enhanced&#xD;
             study with the other imaging modality should be performed, or the lesion should be&#xD;
             biopsied. Biopsies of small lesions should be evaluated by expert pathologists. Tissue&#xD;
             that is not clearly HCC should be stained with all the available markers including&#xD;
             CD34, CK7, glypican 3, HSP-70, and glutamine synthetase to improve diagnostic&#xD;
             accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suitable for surgical resection, but the distance between tumors and preserved vessels&#xD;
             is less than 5 mm. Adequate safe margin can not be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
