      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Papillary RCC is the second most common histologic subtype of kidney cancer, accounting&#xD;
           for approximately 10-15% of cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 1 papillary RCC occurs in both sporadic and hereditary forms, which are&#xD;
           histologically identical. Non familial type 1 papillary RCC can present as both solitary&#xD;
           renal tumors and as bilateral, multifocal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no standard agents of proven efficacy for patients with advanced papillary&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with disease localized to the kidney are managed surgically while patients with&#xD;
           advanced/unresectable disease are usually managed in the community with VEGF pathway&#xD;
           antagonists or mTOR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activating mutations of MET were identified in the germline of affected HPRC patients,&#xD;
           who have a predilection for the development of bilateral, multifocal type 1 papillary&#xD;
           RCC. Somatic MET mutations have been found in a subset of patients with non-inherited,&#xD;
           sporadic papillary renal carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigational agent INC280 is a selective MET inhibitor lacking activity against&#xD;
           the VEGF pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a proof-of-concept study using INC280 in patients with papillary RCC to test the&#xD;
           idea that effectively blocking the HGF/MET pathway will lead to clinical activity in&#xD;
           patients with papillary renal cell cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the overall response rate (RECIST 1.1) in patients with papillary renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma treated with single agent INC280&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) or sporadic papillary renal&#xD;
           cell carcinoma (RCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with bilateral multifocal disease can have tumors localized to the kidney&#xD;
                or have metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with sporadic papillary RCC (but without multifocal disease) should have&#xD;
                advanced disease that is considered unresectable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No active brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prior therapy with a MET inhibitor is allowed as long as the patient has not had&#xD;
                progressive disease while receiving the agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase 2 single center non-randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using a Simon 2 stage minimax design. Initially 13 evaluable&#xD;
           subjects will be recruited. If there are no responses to therapy, the study will be&#xD;
           terminated. If there is at least 1 response an additional 7 evaluable subjects will be&#xD;
           accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The two-stage minimax design is based on assuming an ineffective response rate of 5% and&#xD;
           a targeted effective response rate of 25%. We also assume that the probability of&#xD;
           accepting an ineffective treatment and the probability of rejecting an effective&#xD;
           treatment are each 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be dosed orally at a starting dose of 600 mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall response rate (complete response + partial response) will be determined.&#xD;

                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository&#xD;
                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal&#xD;
                  ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.1.2.15 Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug&#xD;
        and for 3 months after stopping study drug and should not father a child in this period. A&#xD;

        drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.1.2.16 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
