  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cirrhosis are particularly prone to infection which is frequently a precipitant&#xD;
      of hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure and circulatory collapse. Bacterial infections are&#xD;
      of particular concern in patients with cirrhosis because they are poorly tolerated. Sepsis&#xD;
      and associated endotoxaemia whereby bacteria produce inflammatory particles occur in&#xD;
      approximately 40% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and is a major cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut-derived and blood-borne pathogens can induce an inflammatory response within the liver&#xD;
      and spleen, which are the major organs that remove bacteria and their endotoxin (such as&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide - LPS and bacterial DNA itself) from the bloodstream. Several mechanisms&#xD;
      have been identified and proposed in this process which depends upon a balance between the&#xD;
      barrier functions of the gut and the 'detoxifying' capacity of the liver. People with&#xD;
      established liver cirrhosis have been shown to have escape of endotoxin into the bloodstream&#xD;
      produced by bacteria that reside in their intestines, which becomes more permeable or&#xD;
      'leaky'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut dysfunction is defined by changes in the types of bacteria within the gut and in overall&#xD;
      permeability allowing bacterial products which would otherwise be contained within the gut to&#xD;
      travel into the bloodstream and lymphatic system with detrimental effects elsewhere in the&#xD;
      body. This passage of bacterial products is termed bacterial translocation, and it's effects&#xD;
      on the liver and general immune system can be then be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has now become recognised that certain types of white blood cells such as neutrophils and&#xD;
      monocytes become dysfunctional and this predisposes to infection and may also have a more&#xD;
      direct pathogenic role in hepatic encephalopathy. Thus neutrophil and monocytes may be a&#xD;
      novel pharmacotherapeutic target in a condition where current therapies such as bowel&#xD;
      aperients (e.g. lactulose) are inadequate. A therapeutic strategy utilising Rifaximin, a&#xD;
      non-absorbable antibiotic, to modulate gut bacterial which produce ammonia, a chemical known&#xD;
      to be important in the cause of hepatic encephalopathy, could potentially lower gut-derived&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, endotoxaemia, infection and organ dysfunction in this population&#xD;
      improving outcomes and prolonging transplant-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore plan to test if Rifaximin positively affects markers of immune dysfunction in&#xD;
      patients with liver cirrhosis experiencing chronic hepatic encephalopathy after 30 days of&#xD;
      treatment, as our primary research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive results from this study would support further trials into the potential benefit of&#xD;
      using Rifaximin to improve immune function, as well as reduce the recurrence of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, in patients with liver cirrhosis.&#xD;

      Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed and conducted as a double blind placebo controlled randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial - Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed on patients referred to King's Liver Unit for further assessment&#xD;
      and management of chronic overt hepatic encephalopathy (≥ Grade 1) or with ≥2 episodes of&#xD;
      overt hepatic encephalopathy in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on 50 patients with cirrhosis and chronic hepatic encephalopathy&#xD;
      [25 Rifaximin and 25 placebo] aged between 18 and 75 years managed within the Liver Unit at&#xD;
      King's College Hospital which is the largest tertiary Liver Transplant Centre within the UK.&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study a patient will be considered to have cirrhosis if they fulfil&#xD;
      2 out of 3 diagnostic criteria of confirmatory liver histology, biochemistry and/or&#xD;
      radiologic findings consistent with cirrhosis/portal hypertension, and are presenting with&#xD;
      chronic persistent overt hepatic encephalopathy (≥ grade 1) or with ≥2 episodes of overt&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics, clinical details (including Westhaven hepatic encephalopathy grade) and&#xD;
      blood haematology, biochemistry (including venous ammonia), microbiology data and neutrophil&#xD;
      function will be assessed and collated at baseline and following 30 and 90 days of Rifaximin&#xD;
      therapy or placebo. Intestinal permeability will be assessed using the intestinal&#xD;
      disaccharide test. Faecal microbiota analysis will be performed by deep pyrosequencing&#xD;
      techniques and plasma endotoxemia will be measured (lipopolysaccharide levels) with bacterial&#xD;
      DNA quantification as a marker of bacterial translocation. These will all be measured at 3&#xD;
      time points: baseline and at 30 and 90 days after initiation of Rifaximin therapy or matching&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo intestinal functional tests within 7 days of recruitment, whereby they&#xD;
      will be administered a test solution of not more than a cupful (150mls) of different types of&#xD;
      non-absorbable sugars, which are drunk in liquid form by the participants. Prior to&#xD;
      ingestion, baseline samples will be obtained as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) blood samples - for analysis of intestinal &amp; immune (dys)function, and metabonomic&#xD;
      analysis ii) urine sample - for intestinal (dys)function &amp; metabonomic analysis iii) stool&#xD;
      sample - for faecal biomarker and microbiota analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      1v) ascitic sample (if clinically indicated) - surplus fluid will be analysed for bacterial&#xD;
      translocation and immune (dys)function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the test solution has been ingested, blood samples will be obtained via a cannula which&#xD;
      is placed in a vein, usually in the arm, prior to the start of the test, to allow further&#xD;
      sampling without causing discomfort to the patient. A total of 15 samples will be obtained&#xD;
      over a 5 hour period, with intervals ranging between 20-30mins, of not more than 6mls per&#xD;
      sample. At the end of the test, at a 5 hour interval, a further urine sample will be&#xD;
      collected to allow for intestinal functional testing. This is exactly the same procedure as&#xD;
      that specified in the approved 'The Gut-Liver Axis in Liver Disease &amp; Liver Transplantation'&#xD;
      study (REC ref: 12/LO/1417).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where participants are undergoing sampling of ascitic fluid for clinical reasons any fluid in&#xD;
      excess of pathology's requirements will be analysed along with peripheral blood samples.&#xD;
      Ascitic samples will only be taken from patients in whom a decision has been made to take&#xD;
      these samples for clinical reasons (this decision will not be that of the investigator). No&#xD;
      increased volume of such sample would be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes (development of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy, organ failure and&#xD;
      infection) will be recorded for a total of 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of samples - sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine and ascitic samples will be analysed in the Institute of Liver Studies and&#xD;
      King's College Hospital laboratories where various tests to determine intestinal and immune&#xD;
      function will be undertaken. Stool samples will be analysed both at laboratories at King's&#xD;
      College Hospital and at the Franklin-Wilkins Building, King's College London, where faecal&#xD;
      biomarkers and faecal microbiota analyses will be performed, respectively. Metabolic analyses&#xD;
      for metabonomic profiling will be carried out at Imperial College London (both at St Mary's&#xD;
      Hospital and at the South Kensington Campus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more detailed list of the tests and analyses to be performed is to be found in the&#xD;
      protocol. Study-specific flow charts have also been provided for a step-by-step&#xD;
      representation of the study, visually representing the study process including participant&#xD;
      recruitment, randomisation, sampling protocols and analyses at the three time points and&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
