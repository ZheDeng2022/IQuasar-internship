  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule&#xD;
      (SPN). This is an important group of patients because if it is lung cancer, presentation as a&#xD;
      SPN represents early disease, which following surgery has a high 5 year survival rate.&#xD;
      However as not all SPNs are lung cancer it would be unethical to biopsy every case. Clinical&#xD;
      guidelines recommend that SPNs should undergo an initial (FDG)-PET/CT scan, which may give&#xD;
      more information about the SPN and may indicate if it is likely to be lung cancer. However in&#xD;
      many cases it does not and current practice is to monitor the SPN with a series of CT scans&#xD;
      over 2 years to look for changes or growth which may/ but not always indicate lung cancer. If&#xD;
      no changes are observed over 2 years the SPN is considered not lung cancer. This is both&#xD;
      expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) and worrying for the patient in terms of&#xD;
      monitoring CT costs and delayed treatment due to length of time to diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines the diagnostic capacity of using a different CT scan. Dynamic Contrast&#xD;
      Enhanced -CT(DCE-CT). DCE-CT and FDG-PET/CT scans give different information about the SPN&#xD;
      and the investigators will look to see if information from either scan or combined&#xD;
      information from both scans may be better in the diagnosis of early stage lung cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators will also undertake a review of previous studies that have used these scans and&#xD;
      use data from both the review and the trial to look at the cost effectiveness of using DCE-CT&#xD;
      in the diagnosis of SPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit 375 people who have a SPN detected by a normal CT scan which requires&#xD;
      a FDG-PET/CT scan. In addition they will receive a DCE-CT scan either on the same day or&#xD;
      within three weeks of the FDG-PET/CT scan. This is the only extra procedure that will take&#xD;
      place to normal NHS care, however we will collect clinical and outcome data over the next two&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is coordinated by Southampton University clinical trials unit. Recruitment between&#xD;
      January 2013 - April 2016, from up to 14 UK sites. Data analysis and conclusions are expected&#xD;
      by the end of 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by the NIHR-HTA&#xD;

      Indication: Lung Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine with high precision, the diagnostic performances of DCE-CT and 18FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
           in the NHS for the characterisation of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use decision analytic modelling to assess the likely costs and health outcomes&#xD;
           resulting from incorporation of DCE-CT into management strategies for patients with&#xD;
           SPNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess, within an NHS setting, the incremental value of incorporating the CT&#xD;
           appearances of a SPN into the interpretation of integrated PET/CT examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether combining DCE-CT with 18FDG-PET/CT is more accurate and/or&#xD;
           cost-effective, in the characterisation of SPNs, than either test used alone or in&#xD;
           series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the nature and incidence of incidental extra-thoracic findings on&#xD;
           18FDG-PET/CT undertaken for the characterisation of SPNs and model their impact on&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule&#xD;
      (SPN) on diagnostic imaging tests. This is an important group of patients because&#xD;
      presentation as a SPN represents early disease with high 5 year survival rates following&#xD;
      surgical resection. However, not all SPNs are due to lung cancer and the accurate&#xD;
      characterisation of SPNs for diagnosis of early stage lung cancer is a diagnostic challenge&#xD;
      with significant associated health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widely adopted clinical guidelines for the subsequent investigation of SPNs recommend serial&#xD;
      CT scans to look for subsequent growth with biopsy to confirm diagnosis. UK, National&#xD;
      Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend 18FDG-PET for the&#xD;
      assessment of SPN in cases where a biopsy is not possible or has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE-CT and 18FDG-PET scans give different information about the SPN. Information from either&#xD;
      scan or combined information from both scans may be better in the diagnosis of early stage&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: Prospective Observational&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 375&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-CTIMP:Non interventional trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Therapy: As per local practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Trial Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, accuracy) for 18FDG-PET/CT and DCE-CT in relation to a subsequent clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of lung cancer. The outcome measures used in the economic model will include&#xD;
      accuracy, estimated life expectancy, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs will be&#xD;
      estimated from an NHS perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will compare&#xD;
      management strategies with DCE-CT to strategies without DCE-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Trial Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics for 18FDG-PET/CT with&#xD;
      incorporation of CT appearances and combined DCE-CT/18FDG-PET. The incidence of incidental&#xD;
      extra-thoracic findings on 18FDG-PET/CT, subsequent investigations and costs will also be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;

      Total Number of Sites: up to 14&#xD;
