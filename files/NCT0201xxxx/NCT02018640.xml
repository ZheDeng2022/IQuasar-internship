  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of tobacco is very high among Alaska Native pregnant women. The investigators are&#xD;
      conducting a three phase study. The first study is nearly completed and involved measuring&#xD;
      biomarkers of tobacco exposure in mothers and infants. The second phase of the research is a&#xD;
      qualitative study to translate the biomarker findings to an intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developing effective tobacco cessation interventions during pregnancy for American Indian and&#xD;
      Alaska Native people is a national priority and will contribute to the U.S. public health&#xD;
      objective of reducing tobacco-related cancer health disparities. The proposed project builds&#xD;
      on our successful partnership with the Alaska Native community and previous work with Alaska&#xD;
      Native pregnant women. We propose to develop and test a novel biomarker feedback intervention&#xD;
      relating cotinine levels in the urine of pregnant women with the woman and infant's likely&#xD;
      exposure to the tobacco specific nitrosamine and carcinogen&#xD;
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK). This 5-year project will be conducted&#xD;
      in three phases. In Phase 1 we utilized a non-randomized, clinical observational trial to&#xD;
      examine biomarkers of nicotine and carcinogen exposure (urine cotinine and total NNAL [a&#xD;
      metabolite of NNK], respectively) among maternal-infant pairs with assessments conducted&#xD;
      during pregnancy and at delivery. In Phase 2, we will obtain qualitative feedback on the&#xD;
      findings from Phase 1 through individual interviews conducted with women who use tobacco and&#xD;
      a confidant (partner/friend/relative) they have identified to develop the biomarker feedback&#xD;
      intervention messages. Phase 3 will consist of a formative evaluation of the biomarker&#xD;
      feedback intervention with pregnant women using a two-group randomized design to assess the&#xD;
      intervention's feasibility and acceptability, and the biochemically confirmed abstinence rate&#xD;
      at the end of pregnancy. All phases of the project will be guided by a Community Advisory&#xD;
      Committee. Each phase is an important step to advance our understanding of the potential for&#xD;
      biomarker feedback as a strategy to help Alaska Native pregnant women quit tobacco use. The&#xD;
      potential reach of the intervention is significant from a public health perspective as over&#xD;
      600 tobacco users deliver each year at the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage where&#xD;
      the proposed project will take place. Developing effective interventions for tobacco&#xD;
      cessation during pregnancy is important to reduce adverse health consequences for the mother&#xD;
      and neonate and future risk of tobacco-caused cancers.&#xD;
