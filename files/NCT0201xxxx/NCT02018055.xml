      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in stabilized&#xD;
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who performed percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with ticagrelor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 2,590 patients with AMI who underwent PCI with DES and took dual antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy as aspirin and ticagrelor during 1 month from index PCI will be randomized to&#xD;
      aspirin+ticagrelor versus aspirin+ clopidogrel during 11 months.&#xD;

      1. Study design Pospective, multi-center, randomized, open trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of switching from ticagrelor to&#xD;
           clopidogrel in stabilized patients with AMI with no adverse events during the first&#xD;
           month after an index PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Drug Test drug: Clopidogrel Control drug: Ticagrelor&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Disease Acute myocardial infarction: ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) and&#xD;
           non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Population 2590 (loss to follow-up: 10 %) -Test group: 1295 -Control group: 1295&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present study is designed to show non-inferiority for the treatment group with&#xD;
           aspirin plus clopidogrel versus the control group with aspirin plus ticagrelor. The&#xD;
           sample size is based on the combined occurrence rate of ischaemic and bleeding events&#xD;
           between 1 and 12 months after AMI. According to the PLATO investigators, the event rate&#xD;
           of the primary efficacy endpoint including CV death, MI or stroke was 5.28% in the&#xD;
           ticagrelor group and 6.60% in the clopidogrel group between 1 and 12 months after the&#xD;
           index event1. There were no reported data on the bleeding event rate associated with&#xD;
           ticagrelor from 1 to 12 months after AMI, especially the BARC bleeding rate at the time&#xD;
           of the present study design. Therefore, we assumed the event rate of BARC 2, 3 or 5&#xD;
           bleeding from the event rates of non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)-related PLATO&#xD;
           major or minor bleeding because the content of BARC 2, 3 or 5 bleeding was conceptually&#xD;
           quite similar with non-CABG-related PLATO major or minor bleeding. With regard to the&#xD;
           assumption of the bleeding rate from 1 to 12 months after the index PCI, we calculated&#xD;
           the expected bleeding rate using a proportional equation under the assumption that the&#xD;
           occurrence ratio of non-CABG-related major bleeding of the first 30 days to that of&#xD;
           after 30 days and the ratio of non- CABG-related major or minor bleeding of the first 30&#xD;
           days to that of after 30 days could be equal. Thus, for the event rate of BARC 2, 3 or 5&#xD;
           bleeding associated with ticagrelor from 1 to 12 months after AMI, the event rate was&#xD;
           assumed from the event rates of non-CABG-related PLATO major or minor bleeding during a&#xD;
           year of ticagrelor therapy (8.7%) and non-CABG-related major bleeding of the first 30&#xD;
           days (2.47%) and after 30 days (2.17%) in the PLATO trial. For the event rate of BARC 2,&#xD;
           3 or 5 bleeding associated with clopidogrel from 1 to 12 months after AMI, the event&#xD;
           rate was assumed from the event rates of non- CABG-related PLATO major or minor bleeding&#xD;
           during a year of clopidogrel therapy (7.0%) and non-CABG-related major bleeding of the&#xD;
           first 30 days (2.21%) and after 30 days (1.65%) in the clopidogrel group of the PLATO&#xD;
           trial7. After applying a proportional equation, we estimated that the BARC 2, 3 or 5&#xD;
           bleeding would be 4.07% in the ticagrelor group and 2.99% in the clopidogrel group.&#xD;
           Thus, the expected event rate of the primary endpoint from 1 to 12 months after the&#xD;
           index PCI was 9.35% (ischaemic event of 5.28% + bleeding event of 4.07%) in the&#xD;
           ticagrelor group and 9.59% (ischaemic event of 6.6% + bleeding event of 2.99%) in the&#xD;
           clopidogrel group. We chose the non-inferiority margin in accordance with clinical&#xD;
           judgement and other relevant studies with a non-inferiority design for the present study&#xD;
           design. The non-inferiority margin of two contemporary trials of antiplatelet treatment&#xD;
           after PCI that were available up to that time was equivalent to a 40% increase in the&#xD;
           expected event rate16,17. The steering committee decided that the non-inferiority margin&#xD;
           in our study should be less than a 40% increase compared to the expected event rate of&#xD;
           the control group. After considering clinically acceptable relevance and the feasibility&#xD;
           of study recruitment, we finally selected the non-inferiority margin of 3.0%, which was&#xD;
           equivalent to a 32% increase in the expected event rate. Sample size calculations (PASS&#xD;
           13; NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA) were initially performed based on a one-sided α of&#xD;
           0.025 and a power of 80%. To achieve these goals, a total of 2,230 patients was needed.&#xD;
           After considering a follow-up loss rate of 10%, there should be at least 1,644 per group&#xD;
           and a total of 3,288 patients. However, while the study was actively underway, the&#xD;
           government policy on investigator-initiated trials (ITTs) changed: it was decided not to&#xD;
           allow national health insurance to charge for the medical care costs of participating&#xD;
           patients in ITTs. Soon after, the government was forced to permit the application of&#xD;
           national health insurance to ITTs on the condition that researchers should obtain&#xD;
           approval for their studies by the head of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment&#xD;
           service. However, during this turmoil, researchers' willingness to register patients had&#xD;
           been compromised, and they could not register patients as planned within the period.&#xD;
           Thus, the steering committee held an emergency meeting with data and safety monitoring&#xD;
           board (DSMB) members and independent statisticians and decided to recalculate the sample&#xD;
           size for the timely completion of the trial. In recalculating the sample size, we&#xD;
           adopted a one-sided α of 0.05 instead of 0.025. According to the CONSORT statement of&#xD;
           non-inferiority and equivalence in trials18, a one-sided α of 0.05 was acceptable for&#xD;
           the non-inferiority clinical trials. Moreover, in the large-scale TROPICAL-ACS (Testing&#xD;
           Responsiveness to Platelet Inhibition Chronic Antiplatelet Treatment for ACS) trial (one&#xD;
           of the famous CV drug trials similar to the TALOS-AMI trial), the researchers adopted a&#xD;
           one-sided α of 0.05 for the sample size calculation4. Furthermore, of 110 CV&#xD;
           non-inferiority trials published in JAMA, The Lancet or the New England Journal of&#xD;
           Medicine from 1990 to 2016, a one-sided α was 0.05 in 66 trials19. Based on this&#xD;
           external harsh environment and a review of the sample size calculation in previous&#xD;
           large-scale randomised trials published in high-impact journals, we recalculated the&#xD;
           sample size by using a one-sided α of 0.05, a power of 80% and a follow-up loss rate of&#xD;
           10%. As such, the sample size was reduced from 3,288 to 2,590 (1,295 patients in each&#xD;
           group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct screening AMI patients based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria who (1) have been&#xD;
      treated with ticagrelor+aspirin for at least 30±7 days after an index PCI, (2) received full&#xD;
      explanation of the study details, (3) given informed consent To randomize eligible subjects&#xD;
      within 30±7 days after AMI undergoing PCI with newer generation DES, and receiving aspirin&#xD;
      and ticagrelor to the treatment and control groups in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2)Treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients receive clopidogrel 75mg + aspirin 100 mg (treatment group) or ticagrelor&#xD;
      90mg bid +aspirin 100mg treatment (control group) for 11 months (post-AMI 1 month to 12&#xD;
      months) and evaluation safety and efficacy by conducting physical examination, checking vital&#xD;
      sign, and collecting adverse events at post-PCI 3M, 6M, 12M visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labboratory and imaging tests, which undergo according to the medical judgment of each&#xD;
      investigator during the study period, are collected by reviewing medical records or EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject Assignment and Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization will be performed to ensure the scientific validity of the clinical test.&#xD;
           This will maximize the comparability of the test and control group and eliminate the&#xD;
           subjectivity of the researchers in subject group assignment. Before PCI, a 250-325mg&#xD;
           loading dose of aspirin is given to patients who are naïve to treatment and all patients&#xD;
           receive a loading dose of ticagrelor 180mg. Discharge medication consists of aspirin&#xD;
           100mg once and ticagrelor 90mg twice per day. All patients receive treatment with&#xD;
           aspirin plus ticagrelor for 1 month after the index PCI (screening period). At 30 ±&#xD;
           7days after index PCI, eligible patients were randomly assigned either to the 1) aspirin&#xD;
           100 mg plus clopidogrel 75mg daily (treatment group) or 2) aspirin 100 mg plus&#xD;
           ticagrelor 90mg twice daily (control group) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will occur&#xD;
           centrally. To randomize a patient, the investigative site will enter the subject into&#xD;
           the designated electronic system and obtain the treatment assignment (clopidogrel +&#xD;
           aspirin or ticagrelor + aspirin) in a 1:1 ratio. At 1 month visit after AMI, eligible&#xD;
           subjects were assigned to each treatment group following an access to the interactive&#xD;
           web-based response system (IWRS, Medical Excellence Inc., Seoul, Korea) by the&#xD;
           investigator or designee. Randomization sequence was created by an independent&#xD;
           statistician using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) statistical software and&#xD;
           was stratified by study center and type of AMI (STEMI or NSTEMI) and with a 1:1&#xD;
           allocation using hidden random block size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dosage and Method Test (Clopidogrel): 75mg oral administration, once a day Control&#xD;
           (Ticagrelor): 1 tablet (90mg) oral administration, twice a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Switching protocol (ticagrelor to clopidogrel) In the control treatment group, when&#xD;
           switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, patients take a 75mg clopidogrel without&#xD;
           loading dose at the time of the next scheduled dose after the final dose of ticagrelor&#xD;
           (eg, ≈12 hours from last dose of ticagrelor). The steering committee decided this&#xD;
           switching strategy of no loading dose based on the concept that our study population&#xD;
           would be at stable status at the time point of randomization (30 days after index PCI).&#xD;
           The data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) approved this switching strategy on the&#xD;
           condition that initial 100 enrolled patients in the treatment group should be monitored&#xD;
           daily during first 7days for the occurrence of adverse clinical events by telephone&#xD;
           interviews. Thereafter, DSMB reviewed the clinical data of the initial 100 patients in&#xD;
           the treatment group and recommended continuation of the study according to the original&#xD;
           protocol. After randomization, patients continue the same medication for 11 months&#xD;
           according to their group allocation (treatment period, Figure 1). Patients are evaluated&#xD;
           at 3 (2 months after randomization), 6 (5 months after randomization), and 12 (11months&#xD;
           after randomization) months after index PCI and monitored for the occurrence of the&#xD;
           clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Efficacy Test Variable Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint analysis Efficacy Test The non-inferiority test between 1 and 12 months&#xD;
           after AMI will be based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates. A 95% two-sided confidence&#xD;
           interval will be computed for the difference event rate (clopidogrel + aspirin) - event&#xD;
           rate (ticagrelor + aspirin). The clopidogrel group will be judged as non-inferior to the&#xD;
           ticagrelor if the upper confidence limit is less than the predetermined non-inferiority&#xD;
           margin of 3% (absolute risk difference).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hypothesis of non-inferiority test will be based on the difference of proportions.&#xD;
           Let rT denote the true event proportion in the test arm (clopidogrel + aspirin) between&#xD;
           1 and 12 months, and rC denote the true event proportion in the control arm (ticagrelor&#xD;
           + aspirin) between 1 and 12 months. The hypotheses are H0: rT - rC≥Δ HA: rT - rC&lt;Δ&#xD;
           TheΔis the non-inferiority margin, and is taken to be 0.03. The test will be performed&#xD;
           as a one-sided test at alpha=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The null hypothesis shall be rejected at alpha=0.05 if the one-sided p-value is less&#xD;
           than 0.05. When this occurs, the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval&#xD;
           will be less than 3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the non-inferiority analysis passed the acceptance criterion, a superiority analysis&#xD;
           will be performed. Statistical superiority is achieved when the upper limit of the&#xD;
           two-sided 95% confidence interval of the risk difference is less than 0%. The type I&#xD;
           error for this analysis is protected by the non-inferiority analysis, and no alpha&#xD;
           adjustment would be appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subgroup analyses will be performed by the primary endpoint categorized by type of AMI&#xD;
           (STEMI vs NSTEMI), Subgroup analyses will be performed by the primary endpoint&#xD;
           categorized by Type of AMI (STEMI vs NTEMI), Gender, Age (&gt;=75 vs &lt;75), Diabetes, LVEF&#xD;
           (&gt;=40% vs &lt;40%), eGFR (&gt;=60 vs &lt;60), type of implanted stents (Xience vs Resolute vs&#xD;
           Synergy stents), Bleeding risk according to the ARC criteria (high vs low bleeding&#xD;
           risk), CYP2C19 loss-of-function carrier status (carrier vs non-carrier).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary analysis population for primary and secondary endpoints will be the&#xD;
           Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population. The primary endpoint analysis will also be&#xD;
           performed on the Per Protocol (PP) population as subsequent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A primary endpoint analysis stratified by the institutions as a sensitivity analysis.&#xD;
           Strata will be divided by the accrual number of institution based on quartiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Implement noninferiority validation based on the tolerance limit after collecting&#xD;
           cumulative occurrence rate of MACCE (CV death, MI, stroke) + BARC bleeding (type 2, 3,&#xD;
           or 5) post 1M-1Y PCI and checking 95% confidence interval of [Ticagrelor occurrence rate&#xD;
           - Clopidogrel occurrence rate]. If the upper value of the 95% confidence interval is&#xD;
           less than 3% of the noninferiority tolerance limit, Clopidogrel is perceived noninferior&#xD;
           to Tricagrelor. Present the cumulative limit method, Kaplan-Meier curve and conduct&#xD;
           log-rank test to check the difference between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Main Secondary Endpoint Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will be composed of two families. The first family consists of the&#xD;
      composite endpoint of MACCE (CV death, MI, stroke) plus BARC bleeding (type 2, 3, or 5). The&#xD;
      second family will consist of MACCE plus BARC bleeding (type3, or 5), MACCE, and BARC&#xD;
      bleeding (type 2, 3, or 5). The endpoints from the second family will be tested&#xD;
      hierarchically, thereby maintaining the study-wise alpha level. These secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will only be tested if both the primary composite endpoint and BARC bleeding are significant&#xD;
      at non-inferiority analysis, and superiority analysis. Composite endpoint of MACCE plus BARC&#xD;
      bleeding (type 3, or 5) will be tested first, and only if this is significant, the composite&#xD;
      endpoint of MACCE only will be tested afterwards. BARC bleeding (type 2, 3, or 5) will be&#xD;
      tested only if both of the above endpoints are tested significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Analysis Population&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Intent to Treat (ITT) Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients at 1 month after AMI,&#xD;
           regardless of their adherence with the entry criteria, regardless of treatment they&#xD;
           actually received, and regardless of subsequent withdrawal from treatment or deviation&#xD;
           from the protocol19. Only some specific reasons that might cause an exclusion of a&#xD;
           patient from the ITT population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           No treatment was applied at all No data are available after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Per Protocol (PP) Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PP population is the subset of ITT population consisting of all patients who receive&#xD;
           and retain the treatment during 12 months after PCI19. Some specific reasons that might&#xD;
           cause an exclusion of a patient from the PP population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Violation of entry criteria including inclusion and exclusion criteria Withdrawal of&#xD;
           consent Concomitant treatment of oral anticoagulant agent (vitamin-K antagonists or&#xD;
           novel oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) during&#xD;
           the study period Poor compliance -Conversion from ticagrelor + aspirin to clopidogrel +&#xD;
           aspirin during RCT procedure and vice versa&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discontinuation of test or control drugs for 7 days or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. * In the cases of withdrawal of consent, concomitant treatment of oral anticoagulation&#xD;
           agent and poor compliance, their data will be used for statistical analyses until such&#xD;
           events occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Final enrollment number&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initially planned enrollment number of patients was 2,590, however, the actual number of&#xD;
      registered patient was larger than this, which was 2,697. The randomization of the current&#xD;
      trial was performed using interactive web-based response system and patients were&#xD;
      competitively enrolled in 32 institutions. Despite the competitive registration among&#xD;
      participating institutions, the random system did not have a lock on it, resulting in a&#xD;
      registration of 107 more patients than initially planned number. When DSMB closely monitored&#xD;
      the status of additionally registered subjects, its members agreed that there were no safety&#xD;
      issues to them and they got an approval of IRB for using the data of additionally registered&#xD;
      patients for the statistical analyses.&#xD;
