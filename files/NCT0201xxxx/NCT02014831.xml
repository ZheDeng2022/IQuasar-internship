  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Penile carcinoma is a rare cancer type, particularly in our industrialized countries.&#xD;
      Incidence is not well established but is estimated around 26000 annual new cases all around&#xD;
      the world [1]. We don't have accurate estimation for France but regarding data from the&#xD;
      literature, incidence rates in developed countries vary from 0.7 to 1.0/100000 men [2]. The&#xD;
      mean age at diagnosis is about 60 years [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different causes have been identified like history of Human PapillomaVirus (essentially&#xD;
      HPV16), phymosis, absence of circumcision, tobacco use, and history of condyloma [1]. In&#xD;
      addition, a lot of molecular genetic alterations are also responsible for penile cancer&#xD;
      occurrence and development [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically, most of these tumors are epidermoid cancers. Tumor spreads into inguinal&#xD;
      lymphnodes, then into pelvic lymphnodes. Then retroperitoneal lymphnodes are involves before&#xD;
      metastatic dissemination, often in lungs, liver and bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the French urology recommendations, treatment of localized penis cancer should&#xD;
      be conservative, as far as possible [5]; Even if local recurrences rate varies from 15% to&#xD;
      30% of patients, no reduction of overall survival is observed in these patients [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigations regarding involvement of inguinal lymphnodes and distant organs are a&#xD;
      key-point. Among the 10% of patients with loco regional recurrence [6], lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      should be preferred to chemotherapy which should be recommended for metastatic patients or&#xD;
      unresectable patients with regional lymphnodes involvement [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers of treatments (monotherapy or associations) have been tested in penis cancer but the&#xD;
      rarity of these tumors is a major obstacle to clinical research, due to small samples of&#xD;
      patients. The best results seem to be obtained with platinum-based treatments (ORR up to&#xD;
      32.5% with a combination of cisplatin, methotrexate and bleomycine) [8] [9], but even if&#xD;
      response rates are very promising, overall survival is still very short (median OS = 28&#xD;
      weeks) and treatment-related toxicities can be very important, even lethal [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histological type of squamous cells carcinoma, which is the large majority of penile&#xD;
      cancer, led Pagliaro et al. [10] to explore a combination of Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide and&#xD;
      Cisplatin (TIP) as neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced penile tumors. This association&#xD;
      of chemotherapy agents had previously proven its efficacy in squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      head and neck. Even if this study included a small number of patients (N=30) with penile&#xD;
      carcinoma, it showed very promising results on primary objective (objective response rate =&#xD;
      50% with 10% of complete responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these results and all previous researches, no chemotherapy agent has been submitted&#xD;
      to health authority's approval in France. It results that there is no market approval for&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic penile carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, based on the results of Pagliaro et al., the TIP is now considered by the French&#xD;
      physicians as the recommended standard of care for patients with metastatic penile carcinoma&#xD;
      [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a biological point of view, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and K-ras status&#xD;
      have been widely explored in the past few years in penile carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR seem to present high expression levels in such tumors, whatever the stage of disease.&#xD;
      Among 17 patients studied by Lavens et al., expression of EGFR was 3+ (which is the highest&#xD;
      grade of expression) in 14 cases and 2+ in 3 cases [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Andersson et al. analyzed 28 penis tumors and found a somatic mutation in 39% (n=11).&#xD;
      Mutations have been detected in the following genes: PIK3CA (29%), HRAS (7%) and K-ras (3%)&#xD;
      [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dorff et al. studied EGFR expression and K-ras status in 28 other penile carcinomas. They&#xD;
      noted an over expression of EGFR in all the samples but didn't find any K-ras mutation [13]&#xD;
      while Valverde et al. found 22% of K-ras muted carcinomas (N=28) [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      When present, K-ras mutations have been identified on exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) but rarely on&#xD;
      exon 3 (codon 61). Mutational status can be easily explored by Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
      amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR expression seems to be correlated with differentiation grade while K-ras mutation seems&#xD;
      to be correlated to the stage of disease [13] [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is a human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody. It has a specific and competitive&#xD;
      binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR, leading to inactivation of self-phosphorylation&#xD;
      of the receptor and inhibition of all the following intracellular signal chains. This has an&#xD;
      antiproliferative effect on cancer cells, inhibits angiogenesis, reduces cells mobility and&#xD;
      restores apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab has been widely studied in cancers with overexpression of Epidermal Growth Factor&#xD;
      Receptors (EGFR), in particular in squamous cancers of head and neck [15], colorectal [16]&#xD;
      and lung cancers [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases I studies showed that a dose in the range of 200mg/m² to 400mg/m² led to a good EGF&#xD;
      receptor saturation [18]. Association of Cetuximab and radiation therapy showed an&#xD;
      improvement on overall survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers&#xD;
      (median overall survival = 49 months versus 29 months in the radiotherapy-alone group) [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab has also been associated to platinum-based chemotherapies (Cisplatin or&#xD;
      Carboplatin) and 5-Fluorouracile in patients with head and neck cancer. Median overall&#xD;
      survival was significantly better on the group of patients with Cetuximab (10.1 months vs 7.4&#xD;
      months; p=0.04). However, 82% of patients with Cetuximab experienced Commom Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) grade 3/4 toxicities versus 76% in the other group [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events commonly noted with Cetuximab are cutaneous events, hypomagnesaemia, infection&#xD;
      and grade 3/4 anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab has also been studied as monotherapy in head and neck patients with responses rate&#xD;
      of 13% and disease control rate of 46%. Cutaneous events were still the main toxicities [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      One preliminary experience has been conducted in a patient with penile carcinoma, treated&#xD;
      with an association of a taxane (Docetaxel) and Cetuximab. This treatment led to imaging and&#xD;
      clinical signs of efficacy (decrease of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (18-FDG) uptake, necrosis of metastatic mass, improvement of pain and performance status).&#xD;
      The tolerance profile has been characterized by neutropenia and mild skin toxicity [22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another key-point is that the efficacy of Cetuximab is closely related to the presence of&#xD;
      mutation on the gene coding for K-ras. Van Cutsem et al. showed that patients with wild-type&#xD;
      K-ras colorectal cancers are much better responders to Cetuximab than patients with mutation&#xD;
      [23].&#xD;
&#xD;
      K-ras mutation leads to a constitutive activation of the Ras pathway independently and can&#xD;
      bypass the EGFR-driven signaling cascade and impair the clinical efficacy of EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K-ras status should always be determined before Cetuximab initiation and it would be&#xD;
      interesting to know EGFR expression rates in order to correlate with responses to Cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, immunogenicity is a class effect of monoclonal chimeric antibodies; the incidence of&#xD;
      Human Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) formation has been observed around 3.7% of patients&#xD;
      treated with cetuximab. However, no apparent effect on the safety or antitumor activity of&#xD;
      cetuximab has been observed in these patients [Summary of Product Characteristics of&#xD;
      Cetuximab].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the fact that,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association of Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide and Cisplatin is efficient for the treatment&#xD;
           of metastatic penile carcinoma and considered as the new &quot;standard&quot; of care in France,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  squamous cell carcinoma of the penis expresses EGF receptor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cetuximab has anti-tumor properties in EGF mediated cancers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  response rates to cetuximab is much better in patient with wild-type K-ras,&#xD;
&#xD;
      We postulate that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - the combination of Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide, Cisplatin with Cetuximab, will enable to provide&#xD;
      a better Objective Response Rate (ORR) than the same combination used without Cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As promising results obtained by Pagliaro are not resulting from a comparative phase III with&#xD;
      a reference treatment, it cannot be considered as a validated new standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Phase 2 study will explore the optimal way to treat patients with metastatic&#xD;
      penile carcinoma between two experimental schemes using a Simon's selection &quot;pick the winner&quot;&#xD;
      randomized design.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated by TIP +/- Cetuximab for 1 cycle of 21 days. Subsequent treatment cycles will be performed only if patients meet correct biological analyses as defined by protocol, with a maximum of 5 more cycles of 21 days. Thus, the treatment duration will vary between patients from 3 weeks to 18 weeks. The treatment efficacy will be evaluated 28 days after the day 1 of the last cycle administered. Thus ORR will be evaluated between 4 weeks to 20 weeks after randomization, according to the amount of administered cycles.&#xD;
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with best response consisting in a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR) from the date of randomization to the date of the end of treatment visit (i.e 6 cycles of treatment as maximum) evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1</description>
