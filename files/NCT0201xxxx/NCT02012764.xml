  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, prospective, observational cohort trial involving Primary Care Trusts&#xD;
      (PCTs) wishing to take part in the study and the Early Arthritis Clinic (Anti-CCP sub-clinic)&#xD;
      at Chapel Allerton Hospital. The approximate duration of subject participation will be 12&#xD;
      months and the approximate total duration of the study will be 10 years. Patients who have&#xD;
      not developed inflammatory arthritis within the 12 month period will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      continue follow up within the clinic on an annual basis with additional visits as clinically&#xD;
      indicated until the development of IA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence for the need to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA) early. Damage occurs early and early treatment is effective. Clearly there is a need to&#xD;
      improve ways of identifying these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recognised that patients with RA often have non-specific musculoskeletal complaints in&#xD;
      the months or years prior to development of RA (unpublished observations). Family members of&#xD;
      patients with RA are also at greater risk of developing RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given we know that earlier identification of patients enables earlier treatment and this&#xD;
      leads to better long-term outcomes, we need a method of identifying patients at the&#xD;
      pre-clinical stage of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, produced by the liver, primarily in&#xD;
      response to stimulation by interleukin-6 (IL-6). The lower limit of detection of routine CRP&#xD;
      is 8mg/dL (or higher), yet the mean CRP in the general population is &lt;2mg/dL11 (as measured&#xD;
      by high sensitivity assays). Therefore, patients with early RA may have low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation not detected by routine CRP. This has been demonstrated in patients with&#xD;
      established disease12, but no studies have been done in early disease. Disease activity&#xD;
      variables correlated with increases in highly-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) and hs-CRP was better&#xD;
      than ESR at predicting disease activity and severity12. Interestingly, on retrospective&#xD;
      analysis of blood donor serum, increased levels of hs-CRP have been noted in RA patients&#xD;
      during the pre-clinical phase, most commonly within the two years prior to symptom onset13.&#xD;
      This suggests immunologic changes occur prior to the development of the symptomatic stage and&#xD;
      provides an exciting tool for assisting in the diagnosis of very early inflammatory disease&#xD;
