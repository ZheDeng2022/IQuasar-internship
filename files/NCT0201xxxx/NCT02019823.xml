      General synopsis for SMS-text Adherence Support (*StAR) Study and associated preparatory and&#xD;
      pilot work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: High blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, stroke and&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease. Clear evidence exists that for individuals with high blood pressure&#xD;
      (hypertension) lowering blood pressure really reduces this risk. One of the critical factors&#xD;
      in the long term control of blood pressure is the regular use of effective antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications. In South Africa, poor treatment adherence (attending clinic, re-filling&#xD;
      prescriptions, and regularly taking hypertension tablets) is known to be an important and&#xD;
      alterable risk factor for uncontrolled high blood pressure and its complications (heart&#xD;
      disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease). SMS-text messages have been shown to improve&#xD;
      clinic attendance and medication adherence for some diseases (like HIV and TB) in other&#xD;
      low-resource settings. It is not clear whether SMS-text messages to support treatment&#xD;
      adherence have an effect on long-term blood pressure control. The acceptability,&#xD;
      sustainability and scalability such technology also remains to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate if a system of SMS-text messages to support treatment adherence is more&#xD;
      effective than usual care for controlling high blood-pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective is to test whether advice and support given by SMS-text,&#xD;
      either by providing information (informational) or by allowing a two-way communication&#xD;
      (interactive) improves control of blood pressure at one year compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives include assessing whether the interventions have an effect on,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic attendance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescription refill adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported medication adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypertension related illness or death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient empowerment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single centre randomized three-arm parallel group trial As it is not clear how&#xD;
      best to support treatment adherence for people with hypertension we need to compare the&#xD;
      different ways this might be done. Eligible patients who provide written consent will be put&#xD;
      into one of three groups and then compared. The groups are selected by a computer which has&#xD;
      no information about the individual (i.e. by chance). Participants in each group will get&#xD;
      different types of SMS-text messages and these are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhanced usual care In addition to their usual clinical care participants will receive&#xD;
           the pre-randomisation &quot;Welcome to the *StAR Study&quot; SMS-text, a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; SMS-text&#xD;
           on their date of birth and up to six additional SMS-text messages containing study&#xD;
           specific information and thanking the participant for taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informational SMS-text messages In addition to enhanced usual care, participants&#xD;
           allocated to the informational SMS-text support group will receive semi-tailored&#xD;
           structured adherence-support (including clinic appointment and medication pick-up&#xD;
           reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interactive SMS-text messages In addition to enhanced usual care and informational&#xD;
           SMS-text messages, SMS-text messages sent to participants in the interactive SMS-text&#xD;
           group will contain a &quot;prompt to respond&quot; which will guide participants to additional&#xD;
           SMS-text based resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is mean blood pressure measured at one year.&#xD;
      Additional outcomes include the proportion of participants with &quot;controlled blood pressure&quot;&#xD;
      as well as measures of clinic attendance, prescription refill adherence, self-reported&#xD;
      medication adherence, hypertension related illness or death, and patient empowerment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Participant recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posters advertising the study and leaflets containing study information will be available in&#xD;
      the general waiting areas of the health centre. Adult patients attending the medical&#xD;
      outpatients department or one of the chronic disease clubs will be approached and invited to&#xD;
      consider taking part in the study. Interested individuals will have the opportunity to ask&#xD;
      trained research staff questions about the study and their participation. Information about&#xD;
      the study will be available in English, isi-Xhosa, and Afrikaans. Individuals interested in&#xD;
      participating will be asked a series of screening questions to assess their eligibility for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study and will have their blood pressure measured as per the study protocol.&#xD;
      Eligible participants who decline to participate will be asked for permission to access their&#xD;
      clinical record to extract basic details (age, gender, medication, recent blood pressure).&#xD;
      Copies of Participant Information Leaflets and posters in English can be found in Appendix B.&#xD;
      Translated copies are available upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals who agree to participate will be asked to complete a consent form. A&#xD;
      copy of the completed form will be given to participants as part of their trial information&#xD;
      pack. Copies of consent to participate forms in English can be found in Appendix B.&#xD;
      Translated copies are available upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline We will ask standard questions about health and medical history, and measure&#xD;
           blood pressure, weight and height. Any necessary blood tests will be done as per clinic&#xD;
           protocols. A trained research assistant will review participant's clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 months Participant contact details (particularly participant's primary&#xD;
           mobile-telephone number) will be checked and if necessary up-dated and blood pressure&#xD;
           will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 months A trained research assistant will administer a final set of questionnaires,&#xD;
           measure participant's blood pressure according to the trial protocol, and repeat basic&#xD;
           clinical measurements including anthropometry. Clinical records will be reviewed to&#xD;
           capture intervening clinical events and changes in medical management. Participants who&#xD;
           do not attend the 12 month follow-up clinic appointment will be followed up, and if&#xD;
           cause for non-attendance is hospital admission or death, then hospital records or death&#xD;
           certificate data will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of study is the date of the final 12-month follow-up clinic visit of the last&#xD;
      participant. After this time study participants will be asked if they would like to receive&#xD;
      SMS-text messages as per the provincial department of health protocol if it exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's contact details (cellular phone number, address, etc), these will only be&#xD;
      available to name senior research staff involved in the study. Details will not be shared&#xD;
      with the clinic staff or with any other service provider unless permission to do so is&#xD;
      expressly given by the participant once the study has concluded. Data will be captured using&#xD;
      a combination of electronic data capture and paper case-report forms (CRFs). CRFs will be&#xD;
      entered onto the trial database on the day of collection. The trial database will include&#xD;
      checks for logic and consistency to be resolved by the local investigators. Data will be&#xD;
      stored on a computer with individually assigned passwords and individually assigned levels of&#xD;
      access. The trial database will include a full audit trail of any changes made. Randomisation&#xD;
      codes will be separately stored and accessible only by the trial statistician. No personal&#xD;
      data will be included in the trial database and participants will be identifiable only by a&#xD;
      unique study number. All essential documents will be retained in a trial master file. Trial&#xD;
      documentation will be archived and stored for seven years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential for harm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements we propose to take including blood pressure, height, weight, and waist&#xD;
      circumference are very safe and are regularly used in routine clinical care. We will be&#xD;
      taking participant's blood pressure a few more times than is usually done in the clinic which&#xD;
      could cause some discomfort. The potential for harm to patients as a result of the trial&#xD;
      intervention is judged as low. The University maintains Public Liability and Professional&#xD;
      Liability insurance which will operate in this respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits to individual participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive SMS-text messages which they may find beneficial.&#xD;
      Participants will have their blood pressure accurately measured on at least three occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rewards:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not providing any rewards or compensation to participants. Study participants&#xD;
      are not provided cell-phones or network airtime credit, however receiving SMS-texts or phone&#xD;
      calls or sending please call me messages to the study are free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is funded as part of a programme grant from the Wellcome Trust and EPSRC (Grant&#xD;
      Number DFR RDV0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot and preparatory work prior to the starting the StAR* study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol also includes brief summaries of preparatory and pilot work that will be carried&#xD;
      out to optimise the trial design and procedures prior to beginning the StAR* study (these&#xD;
      &quot;StAR* study development phase projects&quot; can be found in section 11 of the study protocol).&#xD;
