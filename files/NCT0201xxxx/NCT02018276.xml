    <textblock>
      Studies have attempted to control pain and increase patients' recovery satisfaction following&#xD;
      many kinds of operations by using as small an opioid analgesic dose as possible and adding a&#xD;
      nonopioid analgesic to reduce the side effects of narcotic analgesics. Among nonopioid&#xD;
      analgesics, lidocaine and magnesium are drawing attention, having been shown to be helpful in&#xD;
      controlling postoperative pain by lowering pain hypersensitivity to surgical stimuli.&#xD;
      Lidocaine acts as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. An&#xD;
      intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine has been reported to improve postoperative&#xD;
      pain control by reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Another report showed&#xD;
      that an intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine improved the quality of&#xD;
      postoperative functional recovery after general anesthesia in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
      patient. In addition, a review article on the effect of intraoperative intravenous injection&#xD;
      of magnesium found it to be an effective analgesic that may be added to conventional&#xD;
      opioid-based therapy because it generally reduces opioid consumption, decreases pain&#xD;
      assessment for 24 hours after surgery, and lacks severe side effects in relation to magnesium&#xD;
      administration. However, there has been insufficient research comparing the intraoperative&#xD;
      intravenous injection of lidocaine or magnesium in terms of which is more helpful for general&#xD;
      functional recovery and decreased postoperative pain. Recently, the scope of research on&#xD;
      anesthesia has come to embrace postanesthetic recovery; to help patients return to daily&#xD;
      life, the research trend is now shifting from the improvement or resolution of a specific&#xD;
      symptom to the measurement of general recovery. Postoperative recovery is a complicated&#xD;
      process related to such catamnestic factors as physiological end-points, the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events, and changes in psychological status. A widely used method to measure&#xD;
      postoperative recovery is the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey. The QoR-40 includes a&#xD;
      total of 40 questions that may be divided into five sub-categories: emotional state, physical&#xD;
      comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain. The respondent answers each&#xD;
      question on a 5-point scale, with one being worst and five being best. The QoR-40 takes 6.3&#xD;
      minutes on average to complete and is known to have good test-retest reliability, internal&#xD;
      consistency, and split-half reliability. With respect to anesthetic recovery, the QoR-40 has&#xD;
      been used in various studies to investigate how the surgery type, anesthesia method,&#xD;
      administration of an additional drug, and gender affect anesthesia and surgery. The validity&#xD;
      of the QoR-40 for research purposes has already been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, we investigated the intraoperative intravenous injection of&#xD;
      lidocaine and the intravenous injection of magnesium to compare these drugs' helpfulness in&#xD;
      the functional recovery of thyroidectomy patients after general anesthesia.&#xD;

    <description>The quality of patient recovery after general anesthesia was evaluated by summing the scores for five subcategories-emotional state, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain-to measure the global score (maximum of 200 points). The primary endpoint of this study was the QoR 40 at 24 hours after the operation. A difference between groups was considered significant when the difference in the score between two groups was 10 points or more.</description>
