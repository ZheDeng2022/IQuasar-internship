    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of chronic disability in Veterans. Stroke is associated&#xD;
      with significant loss of mobility, increased risk of falling, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      depression and neuro-cognitive impairment. These deficits negatively impact the independent&#xD;
      completion of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Task-oriented training has emerged as&#xD;
      the dominant therapeutic intervention in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke victims. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of these interventions may be enhanced through facilitation of implicit&#xD;
      knowledge rather than explicit knowledge. Specifically, implicit learning increases retention&#xD;
      and improves transfer of the improved motor function outside of the lab environment.&#xD;
      Moreover, implicit motor control reduces the burden imposed on cognitive resources as the&#xD;
      skill is performed automatically (i.e. do not have to 'think' about it). The amount and type&#xD;
      of feedback individuals receive while learning a new task (or relearning in the case of&#xD;
      rehabilitation) has been shown to influence the type of learning (i.e. implicit or explicit).&#xD;
      Thus the purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of different types of&#xD;
      feedback during motor learning on the learning type and the resultant impact on functional&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e. motor performance, retention, and cognitive workload) in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Someone has a stroke in the US every 45 seconds, resulting in over 700,000 new strokes every&#xD;
      year and stroke is the leading cause of disability in Veterans (American Heart Association&#xD;
      Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Sub-Committee). The vast majority of these cases&#xD;
      result in motor impairments, which frequently cause individuals to become dependent on others&#xD;
      for daily functioning (modified Rankin Scale 3-5, see Lees et al., 2006). Specifically, upper&#xD;
      extremity hemiparesis is the leading cause of functional disability after stroke and upper&#xD;
      arm function explains about 50% of the variability in reported quality of life (Wyller et al,&#xD;
      1997). As such optimizing upper arm neurorehabilitation is a critical problem to address in&#xD;
      the aging Veteran population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Rehabilitation, for patients, is fundamentally a process of relearning how to move to carry&#xD;
      out their needs successfully&quot; (Carr &amp; Shepherd, 1987). This statement posits that at its core&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation is motor learning, but despite this principle, research in motor learning&#xD;
      has had little impact on stroke rehabilitation (Krakauer, 2006). Recently there has been an&#xD;
      interest in developing and testing new methods to optimize upper extremity rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Investigators at the Baltimore VAMC have pioneered task oriented training paradigms to&#xD;
      improve mobility (Macko et al., 2005) in those with chronic stroke. As part of this&#xD;
      programmatic approach novel upper extremity robotics training programs have been developed to&#xD;
      improve reaching, and limb coordination. However, the majority of these interventions rely on&#xD;
      error-based learning strategies during rehabilitation, which foster task-related explicit&#xD;
      knowledge. However, a corpus of motor learning research indicates that this may not be the&#xD;
      best strategy to optimize motor learning, and thus neurorehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Error-based learning involves receiving continual feedback of movement with the intent that&#xD;
      the learner will make corrections to the movement in real time. Thus learning occurs through&#xD;
      a series of repetitions in which the learner continually reduces the discrepancy between the&#xD;
      ideal behavior and the observation of their own behavior. In other words, error-based&#xD;
      learning fosters an adaptation to achieve the desired behavior. In contrast, operant&#xD;
      conditioning learning strategies consists of the learner only receiving feedback about the&#xD;
      quality of their movement at the end of the behavior. Thus, learning occurs through a series&#xD;
      of reinforcement of the desired behavior in its entirety, which is more model-free than the&#xD;
      adaptation incurred during error-based learning. A primary distinction between these two&#xD;
      learning strategies is that error-based learning fosters explicit knowledge of the task,&#xD;
      whereas operant conditioning fosters implicit knowledge (Krakauer &amp; Mazzoni, 2011). These two&#xD;
      types of knowledge have drastic implications for functional outcomes (i.e. motor performance,&#xD;
      cognitive workload, and retention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to stroke, upper arm functions such as reaching and grasping were largely done without&#xD;
      the use of explicit knowledge. In other words, healthy individuals devote little conscious&#xD;
      effort about how they are controlling their limbs, they just 'do it'. Although, using&#xD;
      explicit strategies during learning can facilitate the rate of learning, if given enough&#xD;
      time, individuals who have limited explicit knowledge will perform equally well (Maxwell et&#xD;
      al, 1999). Despite a slower rate of learning, the payoff of reducing explicit knowledge of&#xD;
      the task can be very advantageous during motor performance. Notably, retention of the learned&#xD;
      behavior is greater in individuals who learned under conditions that inhibit explicit&#xD;
      knowledge. For example Malone and Bastian (2010) had individuals learn a novel walking task&#xD;
      (split belt treadmill where the belts move at different rates) and in those in which explicit&#xD;
      knowledge was limited exhibited learning that persisted longer than those who relied on&#xD;
      explicit knowledge during learning. In addition, limiting explicit knowledge during motor&#xD;
      learning may result in reduced cognitive workload and maintained performance under conditions&#xD;
      of challenge (Zhu et al., 2011). In conclusion, promoting explicit knowledge during&#xD;
      rehabilitation rather than unconscious control (limiting explicit knowledge) reduces&#xD;
      sustainability of the newly acquired motor skill, and consumes cognitive resources, which&#xD;
      need to be available for other demands. As such, automatic control of these behaviors is&#xD;
      critical to perform daily activities, suggesting operant conditioning (which limits explicit&#xD;
      knowledge) as superior to error-based learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with stroke are able to learn tasks implicitly, although the rate of learning may be&#xD;
      delayed as compared to healthy controls (Pohl et al., 2001) and delayed further as a function&#xD;
      of stroke severity (Boyd et al., 2007). Further, simply providing explicit information about&#xD;
      an implicit task has been shown to reduce the learning rate and retention in those with basal&#xD;
      ganglia stroke (Boyd et al., 2004; Boyd et al., 2006) and damage to sensorimotor areas (Boyd&#xD;
      et al., 2003; Boyd et al., 2006; Winstein et al., 2003). While these studies highlight the&#xD;
      importance limiting explicit knowledge during learning they were done in the context of&#xD;
      learning implicit sequences rather than the development of skill, which while related, rely&#xD;
      on different aspects of motor learning (Krakauer &amp; Mazonni, 2011, Yarrow et al., 2009). In&#xD;
      the context of functional skill learning, the timing/ type of feedback have been robustly&#xD;
      shown to affect the learning rate as well as retention and have been implicated to affect&#xD;
      knowledge type (Levin et al., 2010). Specifically, providing feedback about task performance&#xD;
      less frequently and after performance rather than during (i.e. delayed) have been shown to&#xD;
      increase learning retention and likely facilitate implicit learning (Cirstea et al., 2006;&#xD;
      Winstein et al., 1996). Additionally, feedback about the results (knowledge of results)&#xD;
      rather than the performance (knowledge of performance) has shown to increase retention and&#xD;
      limit explicit knowledge (Cirstea el al., 2006; Sidaway et al., 2008; Winstein, 1991).&#xD;
      Accordingly, the current proposal will attempt to foster implicit knowledge during the&#xD;
      development of motor skill by manipulating when feedback is given and type of feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to determine the effect of error-based learning versus&#xD;
      operant conditioning learning on critical outcomes of neurorehabilitation (i.e. performance&#xD;
      after learning, generalizability, cognitive workload imposed by the task, and retention).&#xD;

    <description>Quality of motor behavior was indexed by the percentage of samples in which the participants were within the trained (i.e. optimal) trajectory. The trained trajectory was a 2cm wide channel in the shape of a half circle between two targets which were 25cm apart from each other. Therefore, the scale measure is a percentage which can range between 0 and 100%.</description>

    <description>Brain electrophysiology measure of attentional processes as indexed by high alpha power (10-13 Hz). The unit of measurement is a percentage as the amount of power (microvolts squared) in the high alpha band was divided by the total power in the spectrum (i.e. 1-50 Hz). This method is commonly employed to normalize the power of a particular frequency if the statistical design includes a between subjects factor.</description>

        <title>Quality of Motor Performance</title>
        <description>Quality of motor behavior was indexed by the percentage of samples in which the participants were within the trained (i.e. optimal) trajectory. The trained trajectory was a 2cm wide channel in the shape of a half circle between two targets which were 25cm apart from each other. Therefore, the scale measure is a percentage which can range between 0 and 100%.</description>

        <title>EEG Derived High Alpha Power</title>
        <description>Brain electrophysiology measure of attentional processes as indexed by high alpha power (10-13 Hz). The unit of measurement is a percentage as the amount of power (microvolts squared) in the high alpha band was divided by the total power in the spectrum (i.e. 1-50 Hz). This method is commonly employed to normalize the power of a particular frequency if the statistical design includes a between subjects factor.</description>
