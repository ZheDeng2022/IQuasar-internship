      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendicitis is a common condition which represents a significant resource burden for the&#xD;
      Scottish National Health Service (NHS). It is unknown whether there are significant&#xD;
      differences in outcomes following appendicectomy which may be explained by geographic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to describe appendicectomy outcomes in Scotland as they vary by the&#xD;
      urban-rural nature of the patient's home location and travel time from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a retrospective observational enquiry which will utilise&#xD;
      administrative data from the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services&#xD;
      Scotland. Patient episodes will be identified by a procedure code for appendicectomy, and the&#xD;
      urban-rural classification of patients will be derived from postcode data. Travel time from&#xD;
      hospital will also be estimated through postcode data. The investigators will study a 10 year&#xD;
      period from January 2001 to December 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be risk-adjusted 30 day/inpatient mortality, 30 day readmission&#xD;
      rate, 30 day re-operation rate, length of stay and negative appendicectomy rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the possibility that outcome from appendicectomy may vary&#xD;
      according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the urban-rural nature of the patient's home location and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. travel time from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study of all appendicectomies performed in Scotland during the period&#xD;
      from 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010. It will use routinely collected administrative&#xD;
      data from the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially significant confounding variables such as age, gender, and co-morbidity will be&#xD;
      studied for their predictive value in a univariate model and included in a multivariate model&#xD;
      if they remain significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no single appendicectomy outcome measure which is a literature standard, so all of&#xD;
      the following will be evaluated as primary outcome measures: risk-adjusted 30 day/inpatient&#xD;
      mortality, 30 day readmission rate, 30 day re-operation rate, length of stay and negative&#xD;
      appendicectomy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry which will supply the data for this study is the Scottish Morbidity Record 01&#xD;
      (SMR01), the full title of which is the &quot;General / Acute Inpatient and Day Case dataset&quot; (see&#xD;
      http://www.adls.ac.uk/nhs-scotland/general-acute-inpatient-day-case-smr01/?detail). SMR01 is&#xD;
      collated and administered by ISD, and data submission is mandatory for all Scottish NHS&#xD;
      providers of in-patient or day-case care. Approximately 1.4 million records are added each&#xD;
      year. Diagnoses are coded according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10&#xD;
      standards and procedures are coded according to the United Kingdom's Office of Population&#xD;
      Census Statistics (OPCS) standards, the most recent of which is version 4.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data quality in SMR01 is high and is assured by regular internal audits. In the 2010&#xD;
      audit of accuracy, Main Condition was recorded with an accuracy of 88% and Main Procedure was&#xD;
      recorded with an accuracy of 94%. Where data inconsistencies are identified in the extract&#xD;
      supplied for this study, further clarification will be obtained where possible with ISD's&#xD;
      data retrieval support team. Data completeness is very high in SMR01. However, where&#xD;
      significant volumes of data are missing or unusable, the need for data imputation will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period was decided on pragmatically by a desire to provide an assessment of current&#xD;
      practice, fully within the era of widely practised laparoscopic surgery. A power calculation&#xD;
      also suggested that this would provide an adequate sample size to demonstrate differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our power calculation- specific to length of stay- was based on Faiz O, Clark J, Brown T,&#xD;
      Bottle A, Antoniou A, Farrands P, et al. Traditional and Laparoscopic Appendectomy in Adults.&#xD;
      Ann Surg. 2008 Nov;248(5):800-6. In their cohort of 259,735 appendicectomies performed from&#xD;
      1996-2006, the geometric mean length of stay was 3.52, with SD 1.8. We decided that a&#xD;
      difference of 0.5 days would be 'clinically significant'. We specified alpha 0.05 and Power&#xD;
      0.9, and an allocation ratio of 2 (allowing comparison of one tertile to two others). A&#xD;
      two-sided t-test of difference between two independent means was performed in G*Power 3.1.7.&#xD;
      This demonstrated that a total N of 616 was required to demonstrate this difference.&#xD;
      According to ISD figures, there were 3,712 appendicectomy procedures performed in 2010/11, so&#xD;
      with numbers available we will be able to detect a clinically significant difference in&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the Scottish government's own 8-fold urban-rural classification&#xD;
      system (see&#xD;
      http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/About/Methodology/UrbanRuralClassification) to&#xD;
      investigate the possible relationship between patient geographical location and outcome.&#xD;
      Urban-rural categories may be grouped for analysis, depending on initial exploratory work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will further calculate the approximate travelling time from patient home&#xD;
      location (using postcode) to the treating hospital, by constructing isochrones at&#xD;
      time/distance intervals from hospitals. Travel time will be evaluated as a continuous and&#xD;
      discrete variable.&#xD;
