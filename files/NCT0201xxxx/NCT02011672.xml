    <textblock>
      Background: Recent advances in science have established a fundamental role for low grade&#xD;
      chronic inflammation in mediating all stages of most of the non-communicable diseases&#xD;
      associated with ageing. Pro-inflammatory effects of hyperglycemia have been described. Dairy&#xD;
      and its components are known to exert beneficial effects on postprandial hyperglycemia. This&#xD;
      study investigates if dairy, normal and enriched, can reduce chronic inflammation via&#xD;
      improvement in glucose regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the effect of a nutrient-enriched dairy drink on parameters of glucose&#xD;
      regulation and postprandial inflammation with the effect of a standard milk drink, within a&#xD;
      population of overweight, apparently healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study is designed as a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel&#xD;
      trial during 7 weeks, during which the test and reference products will be consumed at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The difference in absolute change in fasting blood plasma&#xD;
      concentration of glucose, insulin and IL-6, from baseline to endpoint, and the difference in&#xD;
      postprandial response of plasma concentration of glucose, insulin and IL-6 at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment period, between subjects consuming the test and reference product.&#xD;
