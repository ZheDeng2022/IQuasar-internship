  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising rapidly worldwide. In Denmark approximately&#xD;
      8% of adults have T2D and more than 25.000 are diagnosed each year. This has vast&#xD;
      consequences for society and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized treatment aiming at normalizing blood glucose and hypertension comparable to&#xD;
      healthy individuals, have been tested in large studies. The effect on cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and other complications have been modest at best and one study showed an increased mortality&#xD;
      with intensive treatment. The standardized treatment often results in polypharmacy, which&#xD;
      increases the risk of patients discontinuing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a new approach to treatment of T2D, where the patients' individual characteristics&#xD;
      are considered. The aetiology of the diabetes can be different, which warrants different&#xD;
      treatment. Many patients have concomitant illness which can affect the way the patient is&#xD;
      treated. A tight regulation of blood glucose can in some patient constitute a risk of adverse&#xD;
      effects, especially hypoglycemia. In that sense individual targets for the treatment are&#xD;
      important. Effective lifestyle treatment has importance for a successful outcome and we&#xD;
      therefore offer an application that can help the patient and the physician organizing&#xD;
      activity individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of individual treatment is to choose the most effective medication. If a&#xD;
      prescribed drug does not have the desired effect it should be replaced with a different drug.&#xD;
      The overall goal is to reduce the number of substances and side-effects, but simultaneous&#xD;
      improve treatment and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular and other diabetes-related&#xD;
      complications. This will in turn result in improved quality of life and improved adherence to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential effect of individual tailored treatment of T2D is to improve the guidelines of&#xD;
      treatment, not only to improve the patients' health, but also to reduce the socioeconomic&#xD;
      consequences of the growing T2D prevalence&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is a prospective controlled open-label multicenter intervention study. General&#xD;
      practitioners in region of southern Denmark are responsible for the treatment, while central&#xD;
      visits for additional data sampling are located at Odense University hospital, Holbaek&#xD;
      Hospital, Naestved Hospital, and hospital of south west Denmark, Esbjerg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion phase will run for 2 years. The follow-up phase is 10 years from inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registries will be employed in both the characterization of patients and in the sampling of&#xD;
      end-points. Concomitant medication will be sampled from the National Prescription Database.&#xD;
      Concomitant illness and identification of endpoints will be sampled from the Registry of&#xD;
      Patients, Registry on Cause of Death, the Danish Registry on Regular Dialysis and&#xD;
      transplantation, the Danish general practice database, The National Indicator project,&#xD;
      Statistics Denmark, The National Indicator Project, The Danish Cancer Registry, the&#xD;
      DD2-database and local databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The control group will be treated according to national guidelines. The&#xD;
      intervention group will be treated according to individual assessment. Several approaches&#xD;
      will be employed to achieve individualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of pathophysiological traits in order to chose the correct medication&#xD;
           targeting hyperglycaemia. Identification of pathophysiological traits, through genetic&#xD;
           testing, GAD antibodies and C-peptid level, will individualize the treatment of&#xD;
           hyperglycaemia according to the following groups: MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the&#xD;
           young), LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes of adults), steroid-induced diabetes,&#xD;
           insulinopenic diabetes, secondary diabetes and patients with insulin resistance.&#xD;
           Specific treatment algorithms will be applied in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individualized targets for all patients with regard to hyperglycaemia. The target will&#xD;
           be chosen on the basis of age, motivation, skills, risk of hypoglycaemic events, therapy&#xD;
           resistance, initial hba1c and concomitant illness. As these factors change the target&#xD;
           can be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic characterization by impedance cardiography will be used in order to&#xD;
           individualize anti-hypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individualized targets for all patients with regard to hypertension. The target will be&#xD;
           chosen on the basis of concomitant risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further individualization will be achieved by discontinuing drugs which have not proven to be&#xD;
      effective within a three-month period or have proven to have side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment algorithms for the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MODY (characterized by genetic test): Glimepiride or repaglinide for type 1 and 3. 1)&#xD;
           diet, 2) basal insulin for type 2. Basal insulin for type 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LADA (GAD positive&gt; 30UI/ml): basal bolus insulin-regime. Metformin if BMI &gt; 25&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary diabetes (HOMA-beta &lt; 78.45 % AND history of pancreatitis or similar): basal&#xD;
           bolus insulin regime&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steroid induced diabetes: 1) meal time insulin 2) metformin 3) basal insulin if fasting&#xD;
           blood glucose is above 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulinopenic type 2 diabetes (HOMA2-beta&lt;78.45 % AND HOMA2-S&gt;105.5%): 1) metformin 2)&#xD;
           insulin, basal 3) meal time insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classical type 2 diabetes (HOMA2-beta&lt;78.45% AND HOMA2-S&lt;105.5%): 1) metformin 2) GLP-1&#xD;
           analogues* 3) basal insulin 4) meal time insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperinsulinemic type 2 diabetes (HOMA2-beta&gt;78.45% AND HOMA2-S&lt;105.5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with BMI&gt;35 kg/m2 both gastric bypass and pharmacological treatment can be&#xD;
      considered equally. In patients with BMI&lt;35 kg/m2 only pharmacological treatment is an&#xD;
      option:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with BMI&gt;35 kg/m2 gastric bypass should be considered according to the&#xD;
           current national criteria and the preference of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1) metformin 2) GLP-1 analogues* 3) Glitazones (pioglitazone is currently registered) 4)&#xD;
           insulin, basal 5) meal time insulin If marked oedema develops in relation to institution&#xD;
           of glitazones the treatment should be terminated. If patients have osteoporosis,&#xD;
           glitazones should generally not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have heart failure glitazones should not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *In cases were patients are reluctant to inject themselves or have economical objections,&#xD;
      DD4-inhibitors can be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premixed insulins can be used instead of basal insulin or instead of basal insulin+mealtime&#xD;
      insulin whenever deemed relevant by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension Hemodynamic characterization by impedance cardiography will be used in order to&#xD;
      individualize anti-hypertensive medication. By impedance measures of vascular resistance,&#xD;
      intravascular volemia and inotropy will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with ACE inhibitors. Secondary medication will in general be&#xD;
      achieved by the following algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High vascular resistance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use ACE-inhibitor or add a calcium-channel blocker (CCB) to an existing ACE-inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In case the resistance are increased by more than 100% and neither ACE-inhibitor or CCB&#xD;
           is given, consecutive add both according to blood pressure. If hypervolemia is present&#xD;
           address this before CCB is introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If intravascular volume is normal and blood pressure is high after ACE-inhibitor; use&#xD;
           CCB - also when resistance is normal&#xD;
&#xD;
      High intravascular volume:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Use hydrochlorthiazide 12.5mg combined with ACE inhibitor in one pill if possible. Else&#xD;
      use bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg. If the patient is already receiving diuretics, spironolactone&#xD;
      is used. Start with 25mg, maximum dose is 50mg. If kalium is above 4.3 or impaired kidney&#xD;
      function is present start with 12.5mg. Control of kalium is paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High inotropy&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) High inotropy might change with the institution of other drugs. Introduce CCB first and&#xD;
      secondly thiazide if the patient is normovolemic. In reverse order if the patient is&#xD;
      hypervolemic and with normal vascular resistance. Therefore high inotropy should only be&#xD;
      treated with carvedilol if 1) the patient is receiving ACE inhibitor, thiazide and CCB and&#xD;
      the impedance measure of high inotropy is made after ACE-inhibitor, thiazide and CCB is&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle A dietician will be employed to make written material regarding the diet. A&#xD;
      Cookbook will be made available online, together with accompanying grocery lists. The diet&#xD;
      will be done according to a composition of 20% protein, 40% fat and 40% carbohydrate to&#xD;
      improve glycemic control. The extra percentage of fat, compared to current recommendations&#xD;
      should come from polyunsaturated fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate exercise an accelerometer will be handed out and an individual goal of exercise&#xD;
      will be set. A novel interface of the accelerometer will be used to monitor the exercise done&#xD;
      and thereby enable the patient and the physician to evaluate the effort. Interval walking&#xD;
      will be the general focus of the exercise guidance, if the patient does not have other&#xD;
      individual exercise preferences. Individual goals of the exercise effort will be set and&#xD;
      software will modify the goals according to current fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal setting in the intervention group Treatment of hyperglycaemia should be made according&#xD;
      to the following goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimal control of HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % (48 mmol/mol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptable control of hba1c &lt; 7.5 % (58 mmol/mol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Free of symptoms, with the best possible Hb1ac within this restraint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general practitioner is free to choose which goal is applicable, according to the above&#xD;
      mentioned criteria. In patients with neuropathy or former cardiovascular disease extra&#xD;
      vigilance should be taken if optimal control is chosen. If the patient develops a severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic event, repeated measures of blood glucose below 4.0 mmol/l or is therapy&#xD;
      resistant, the goal should be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of hypertension should be made according to the following goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BT &lt; 135/85 in patients with microalbuminuria, increased creatinine or established&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BT &lt; 140/90 in patients without complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit at primary physician In the control group this will be scheduled as deemed&#xD;
      necessary by the physician In the intervention group this should be scheduled to be located&#xD;
      after the baseline visit at the central hospital, in order to achieve collection of all&#xD;
      relevant data for individualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic visits at primary physician These are to take place every 3 month. At these visits&#xD;
      treatment will be instituted according to the specified algorithms. If the goals are not met,&#xD;
      intervals of 1 month are recommended in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year the following will be collected for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking habits, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, weight, HbA1c, Urine&#xD;
           albumin-creatinine ratio, creatinine Visits for measurements of organ damage The initial&#xD;
           visit will be scheduled within 4 weeks of the screening visit. Longitudinal measurements&#xD;
           will be done after 2 and 4 years. The measurements will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG for assessment of ventricular hypertrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intima media thickness of the carotid artery along with assessment of plaque presence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of calcification of the coronary arteries by heart CT (only year 0 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood borne and urine markers of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated office blood pressure (used to direct treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ambulatory 24 hours blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire on quality of life, (at baseline: cardiovascular hereditary, former&#xD;
           gestational diabetes or pancreatitis and prednisolon treatment within the last 3 month&#xD;
           of debut)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thoracic impedans measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (side effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist to hip ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus photo&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits will be organized centrally. In a subset of patient echocardiography and pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits for measurements of thoracic impedans The measurement will be done after 0, 2, 4 (also&#xD;
      after 1 year in the intervention group) years throughout the follow-up period and will be&#xD;
      organized centrally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule Oct 2013: Inclusion of patients Oct 2015: inclusion ends Oct 2019: analysis of&#xD;
      surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease Oct 2025: sampling and analysis of endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooperation between primary care and project coordinators Daily management and coordination&#xD;
      will be handled by investigators at the 3 central hospitals. Data-sampling at central visits&#xD;
      will be their responsibility. The central investigators will have an advisory role in the&#xD;
      treatment of the patient. Initial pathophysiological characterization will be managed&#xD;
      centrally and the results will be forwarded to the primary physician. The coordinating&#xD;
      investigator will be responsible for gathering of data from registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily treatment of the patients will be managed by the primary physician according to the&#xD;
      algorithms. Recruitment will also be done by the primary physician. Serious adverse events&#xD;
      will be reported centrally by the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP will be employed to do conduct the investigations at the central visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant illness and identification of endpoints will be sampled from the Registry of&#xD;
      Patients, Registry on Cause of Death, the Danish Registry on Regular Dialysis and&#xD;
      transplantation, The Danish general practice database, The National Indicator project, The&#xD;
      Danish Cancer Registry, the DD2-database and local databases at time of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant illness will be established at the baseline visit through patient interview,&#xD;
      aided by records from the Registry of Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints will also be sampled real time as part of the sampling of SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations An incident rate of 2.5% per year of macro- and microvascular&#xD;
      complications, of 1.5% for cancer and approximate 1% of over-all mortality is expected.&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemic event rate is expected to be less than 0.4%. The expected incident rate of the&#xD;
      composite endpoint is 5%, a power of 80% and a type I error of 0.05. A benefit of 20% with&#xD;
      intervention is expected. Loss to follow-up: the database approach will limit this to a&#xD;
      minimum. For a cumulated event rate of 5% during 10 years the estimated sample size is 1123&#xD;
      patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The patient physical and mental integrity will be safeguarded. The&#xD;
      participants will be protected by the law on personal data and the Danish health legislation&#xD;
      act. The study will be conducted in compliance with the principles set forth in the&#xD;
      declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines for god clinical practise (GCP). The Study will be&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with this protocol as well as according to national legislation. The&#xD;
      study will be approved by the regional committee on medical health ethics, the Danish data&#xD;
      protection agency and the Danish Health and Medicines Authority. The study will be submitted&#xD;
      at ClinicalTrial.gov.&#xD;
