  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common disease of the immune system, known as an &quot;autoimmune&quot;&#xD;
      disease. In this disease, the immune system mistakenly destroys the hair follicle, causing&#xD;
      hair to fall out. Despite many people having this disease, research into its cause and into&#xD;
      new, better ways to treat Alopecia Areata has lagged far behind other similar diseases of the&#xD;
      immune system. Currently, there are no Federal Drug Administration approved drugs for&#xD;
      Alopecia Areata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abatacept (made by Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a safe intervention known to effectively treat&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, another &quot;autoimmune&quot; disease, by fighting inflammation. There are some&#xD;
      genetic and chemical similarities between those with active rheumatoid arthritis and Alopecia&#xD;
      Areata, suggesting that treatment with the same drug is likely to be effective. In mice&#xD;
      specially designed for testing drugs for the treatment of human alopecia, this medication&#xD;
      worked to prevent the disease Alopecia Areata from starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test Abatacept, we are going to treat 15 patients with moderate to severe Alopecia Areata&#xD;
      for 6 months. Each person enrolling into this study will receive the active study drug. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of the medication will be measured by changes in hair re-growth as determined&#xD;
      by physical exam and photography, as well as by patient and physician scoring. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for another 6 months off of the drug to see if the effects of treatment last and&#xD;
      if there is delayed response. We have recently changed the study to allow testing of&#xD;
      abatacept in a few patients with alopecia totalis and universalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small scalp biopsies and peripheral blood will be taken at the beginning of the study before&#xD;
      treatment and then after 4,12 and 24 weeks. The chemical analysis of these skin samples and&#xD;
      blood will help us to understand how the disease happens, how the treatment works, and&#xD;
      perhaps even guide us to better treatments in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with alopecia areata, patients with higher disease burdens are unlikely to&#xD;
      have satisfactory outcomes with current therapies. Our hypothesis is that CTLA4-Ig will be&#xD;
      effective therapy in moderate-severe alopecia areata by blocking re-activation of CD8+ memory&#xD;
      T cells, thereby aborting the cytotoxic T cell inflammatory response underlying alopecia&#xD;
      areata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from immune destruction of the&#xD;
      hair follicle and subsequent hair loss. Despite its high prevalence, research into the&#xD;
      pathogenesis and the development of innovative therapies in Alopecia Areata has lagged far&#xD;
      behind other autoimmune diseases. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for Alopecia&#xD;
      Areata. Abatacept is a safe intervention known to block costimulation and inflammatory&#xD;
      responses in rheumatoid arthritis, which shares several susceptibility genes in common with&#xD;
      Alopecia Areata. Both diseases share the involvement of CTLA4, which is the rationale for&#xD;
      selecting Abatacept for evaluation in this clinical trial. CTLA4-Ig has been shown to prevent&#xD;
      the onset of Alopecia Areata in the C3H-HeJ animal model of Alopecia Areata, demonstrating&#xD;
      preclinical proof of concept data in Alopecia Areata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct an open label pilot study of 15 patients with moderate to severe Alopecia&#xD;
      Areata treated with SC abatacept 125mg once per week for 6 months. A few subjects with&#xD;
      alopecia totalis or universalis will also be included. Subjects will be followed for another&#xD;
      6 months to evaluate durability of response following the treatment phase. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy outcome will be the proportion of responders after 6 months of treatment compared to&#xD;
      the historically known rate of response in untreated/placebo-treated subjects of 8 to 10%.&#xD;
      Punch biopsies and peripheral blood will be obtained at baseline prior to treatment and then&#xD;
      after 4, 12 and 24 weeks for immunomonitoring and molecular studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of and incidence of adverse events related to abatacept in this population of&#xD;
      patients will also be analyzed as a secondary endpoint.&#xD;

    <description>The study's primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of responders after 6 months of treatment, with response defined as 50% or greater hair re-growth from baseline as assessed by Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score at week 24. This is a relatively strict definition for defining responders and non-responders and was chosen to minimize the potential for spontaneous remission, in which fewer than 10% are expected to achieve this magnitude of hair regrowth spontaneously.</description>

    <description>Quality of life measures were based on changes in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The DLQi is a 10-item questionnaire with each question scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0 (better outcome). The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

          <description>Patients will be treated with abatacept 125mg subcutaneous (SC) self-administered each week. Treatment will be continued for 6 months to provide adequate time to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with alopecia areata. Patients will then be followed for an additional 6 months to assess the timing and incidence of relapse.&#xD;
Abatacept: After the screening period, subjects will begin weekly self-administered subcutaneous abatacept and will continue treatment for 6 months. Patients will be instructed in self-administration of study medication at baseline (week zero) and will be observed self-administering medication at each visit. Instructions regarding study drug administration will be reinforced as needed.&#xD;
The 6-month treatment period is expected to provide adequate time to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with moderate to severe AAP. Responders will then be followed for 6 months off drug.</description>

      <time_frame>24 weeks plus an additional 6 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
      <desc>There were no serious adverse effects, no major clinical laboratory abnormalities and no patients required discontinuation of therapy. Most common adverse event was upper respiratory infection symptoms in 6 subjects. All occurrences resolved with supportive measures and/or antibiotics. One subject experienced recurrent yeast infection. Adverse effects related to site injection was reported in 3 subjects and included body aches, tightness at the injection site, and tingling of the hands/arms.</desc>

          <title>Abatacept</title>
          <description>Patients will be treated with abatacept 125mg subcutaneous (SC) self-administered each week. Treatment will be continued for 6 months to provide adequate time to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with alopecia areata. Patients will then be followed for an additional 6 months to assess the timing and incidence of relapse.&#xD;
Abatacept: After the screening period, subjects will begin weekly self-administered subcutaneous abatacept and will continue treatment for 6 months. Patients will be instructed in self-administration of study medication at baseline (week zero) and will be observed self-administering medication at each visit. Instructions regarding study drug administration will be reinforced as needed.&#xD;
The 6-month treatment period is expected to provide adequate time to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with moderate to severe AAP. Responders will then be followed for 6 months off drug.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Small study size and potential for spontaneous remission that might discount the validity of clinical response. A greater observational post treatment period would strengthen conclusions. Last, inherent observer bias, by SALT scoring &amp; photography.</limitations_and_caveats>
