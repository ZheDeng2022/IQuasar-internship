      Dapivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is a substituted&#xD;
      diamino- pyrimidine (DAPY) derivative with potent antiviral activity against HIV-1.&#xD;
      Dapivirine is chemically described as 4-[[4-[(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amino]-2-&#xD;
      pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile.6 The dapivirine matrix VR is a flexible ring containing 25 mg&#xD;
      of drug substance dispersed in a platinum-catalyzed-cured silicone matrix. Dapivirine is&#xD;
      known to be well-suited for delivery via VR, as evidenced by favorable safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data to date described below.&#xD;

             resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If treatment is completed and symptoms have resolved within 45 days of obtaining&#xD;

             (RTI) requiring treatment per current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;

             (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 1-Female Genital Grading Table for Use in&#xD;
             Microbicide Studies Note: Cervical bleeding associated with speculum insertion and/or&#xD;
             specimen collection judged to be within the range of normal according to the clinical&#xD;
             judgment of the Investigator of Record (IoR)/designee is considered expected&#xD;
             non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic exam findings may be&#xD;
             enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a non-exclusionary severity&#xD;
             grading or resolved. If improvement to a non-exclusionary grade or resolution is&#xD;
             documented within 45 days of providing informed consent for screening, the participant&#xD;
             may be enrolled.&#xD;

                  Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention within the 6 months prior to&#xD;
                  Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Last pregnancy outcome 6 months or less prior to Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Gynecologic or genital procedure (e.g., tubal ligation, dilation and curettage,&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) Grade 1 or higher*&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Creatinine Grade 2 or higher*&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin Grade 2 or higher*&#xD;

               4. Platelet count Grade 1 or higher*&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Pap result Grade 2 or higher** Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an&#xD;
                  exclusionary test may be re-tested during the screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Women with a documented normal result within the 12 months prior to Enrollment&#xD;
             need not have a Pap smear during the screening period. Women with a Grade 1 abnormal&#xD;
             Pap smear can be enrolled upon completion of the initial phase of evaluation if no&#xD;
             current treatment is indicated (based on local standard of care for management of&#xD;
             abnormal cervical cytology). Need for a repeat Pap within 6 months does not preclude&#xD;
             Enrollment prior to that result becoming available. If the participant has had a&#xD;
             hysterectomy for reasons not related to cervical dysplasia, a Pap smear need not be&#xD;
             performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude&#xD;
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate the interpretation of&#xD;
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives&#xD;
