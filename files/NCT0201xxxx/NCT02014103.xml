      Conduct a retrospective study to evaluate the impact of generic conversion in adult&#xD;
      transplant recipients on post transplant outcomes one year prior to conversion to one year&#xD;
      post conversion. Variables for analysis will include but not limited to incidence of&#xD;
      rejection, hospital admission, changes in renal function, changes in transplanted organ&#xD;
      function. All tacrolimus levels and dose changes during this period will be collected and&#xD;
      compared. Additional pharmacokinetic modeling of this data will be performed for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study will compare othe relative bioavailability and steady-state&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of 6 tacrolimus formulations in a prospective, 6-way cross-over study&#xD;
      including CYP3A5 expressors (n=30) and non-expressor (n=30) transplant patients.&#xD;

      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Generic immunosuppressants for which bioequivalence were established in single-dose healthy&#xD;
      volunteer studies are also bioequivalent to the brand in stable transplant patients that are&#xD;
      considered high-risk such as CYP3A expressors, AA, and diabetics patients under steady-state&#xD;
      conditions and there will be no difference in intra-subject variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generic immunosuppressants will be bioequivalent among each other in transplant patients&#xD;
           independent of the type of risk (CYP3A5 expression, race, diabetes, age or a combination&#xD;
           hereof).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All generic immunosuppressants and the brand will be bioequivalent to each other as&#xD;
           confirmed in in vitro dissolution studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tacrolimus metabolism and clearance will not be affected by the formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative bioequivalence metrics such as using narrower acceptance intervals and a&#xD;
           population pharmacokinetic approach will confirm bioequivalence among the brand and the&#xD;
           six generics in the aforementioned high-risk transplant patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses, we propose the following four Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Using a retrospective cohort design, we will evaluate the clinical and safety outcomes&#xD;
      among adult transplant recipients whose tacrolimus dosage was converted from Prograf® to a&#xD;
      generic formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective review, evaluate the impact of generic conversion in adult transplant&#xD;
      recipients on post transplant outcomes one year prior to conversion to one year post&#xD;
      conversion. Variables for analysis will include but not limited to incidence of rejection,&#xD;
      hospital admission, changes in renal function, changes in transplanted organ function. All&#xD;
      tacrolimus levels and dose changes during this period will be collected and compared.&#xD;
      Additional pharmacokinetic modeling of this data will be performed for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identification of a single lot with the longest expiration date from each unique&#xD;
      manufactured product approved in the United States and conduct systematic dissolution,&#xD;
      content uniformity and purity testing on all tacrolimus product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct systematic dissolution testing of the brand and all currently approved&#xD;
      tacrolimus drug formulations using the FDA-recommended dissolution method. We propose to test&#xD;
      and compare the 1 mg capsule strength. In addition, we will compare the different&#xD;
      formulations in terms of potency, purity and other quality attributes. This work will be&#xD;
      carried out in the GMP-compliant facilities of The University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      (uip.pharmacy.uiowa.edu) and at the University of Colorado (iC42 Clinical Research and&#xD;
      Development, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado, Laboratory Director: U.&#xD;
      Christians). Based on these studies, if all lots pass current USP standards, we will proceed&#xD;
      to the clinical trial described in Aim 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Comparison of the relative bioavailability and steady-state pharmacokinetics of 6&#xD;
      tacrolimus formulations in a prospective, 6-way cross-over study including CYP3A5 expressors&#xD;
      (n=30) and non-expressor (n=30) transplant patients. Six tacrolimus formulations will be&#xD;
      tested and each patient will receive each formulation once. As we proposed to test&#xD;
      bioequivalence in the steady-state, patients will receive the test formulations for one week&#xD;
      prior to pharmacokinetic evaluation. The pharmacokinetic evaluation will incorporate limited&#xD;
      sampling strategies with a focus on fully characterizing the Cmax out to hour 4 post dose.&#xD;
      Subsequent PK sampling and trough blood concentrations will be monitored on a daily basis&#xD;
      using dried blood spots that the study subjects will collect by themselves at home. The daily&#xD;
      monitoring of levels will allow us to specifically address whether the need of additional&#xD;
      monitoring upon formulation conversion is necessary. It will be critical that the patients&#xD;
      are adherent to their test medication to ensure that they have reached steady state. This&#xD;
      will be monitored using test diaries, pill counts and MEMS caps (Medication Event Monitoring&#xD;
      System (MEMS), AARDEX Corp, Palo Alto, CABioequivalence will be tested using scaled average&#xD;
      bioequivalence metrics and analysis of variance as appropriate and intra-individual&#xD;
      variability of the formulations will be compared. This will also include the analysis of&#xD;
      potential period and sequence effects. A combination of limited sampling strategy and dry&#xD;
      spot analysis in combination with population pharmacokinetic modeling will be utilized to&#xD;
      fully characterize the PK profile of these formulations. In addition, the same study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 36 pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Subgroup analysis, population pharmacokinetics, and average bioequivalence Aim 4 is an&#xD;
      exploratory aim in which we will (A) address the concern that bioequivalence in the &quot;general&quot;&#xD;
      patient population will not translate to special subgroups such as high risk transplant&#xD;
      recipients as characterized by genotype, race, age, gender, sensitization (repeat transplant&#xD;
      or cytotoxic PRA &gt;35% or calculated PRA &gt;50%), presence of concomitant steroids, presence of&#xD;
      diabetes. and (B) test alternative bioequivalence metrics that have been proposed for the&#xD;
      analysis for immunosuppressant generics such as narrower acceptance intervals, average&#xD;
      bioequivalence was well as population pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
