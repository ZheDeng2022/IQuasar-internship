  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of intravenous (IV) dosing of atezolizumab in combination with oral erlotinib or alectinib in&#xD;
      participants with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two stages. In the erlotinib group, the combination treatment will be given to&#xD;
      participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      (TKI)-treatment-naive, advanced (nonresectable) NSCLC in a safety-evaluation stage and to&#xD;
      participants with previously untreated EGFR mutation-positive, advanced NSCLC in an expansion&#xD;
      stage (Stage 2). In the alectinib group, for both the safety-evaluation and expansion stages&#xD;
      (Stages 1 and 2), the combination will be given to participants who are treatment-naive with&#xD;
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1, erlotinib will be given at a starting dose of 150 milligrams (mg) by mouth (PO)&#xD;
      once daily (QD) and the starting dose of alectinib will be 600 mg twice daily (BID), for 28&#xD;
      consecutive days during Cycle 1 and on Days 1 through 21 of each cycle thereafter. The&#xD;
      starting dose of atezolizumab will be 1200 mg, administered every 3 weeks (q3W) starting on&#xD;
      Day 8 of Cycle 1. If the starting regimen for a combination treatment is not tolerated,&#xD;
      alternative doses and/or schedules of erlotinib and atezolizumab or alectinib and&#xD;
      atezolizumab may be tested to determine potential recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for that&#xD;
      combination treatment. In Stage 2, a potential RP2D and schedule for each combination&#xD;
      treatment will be investigated in an expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both stages, continuation of treatment beyond Cycle 1 will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating investigator. Study treatment will be discontinued in participants who experience&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, are not compliant with the study protocol, or,&#xD;
      in their opinion or in the opinion of the investigator, are not benefiting from study&#xD;
      treatment. However, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, participants with second-line or&#xD;
      greater NSCLC who are still receiving atezolizumab at the time of radiographic disease&#xD;
      progression may be permitted to continue study treatment.&#xD;
