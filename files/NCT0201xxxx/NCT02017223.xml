      This project proposes to use mobile devices to develop new tools for pediatric obesity&#xD;
      prevention and treatment targeting underserved minority adolescent populations at high risk&#xD;
      for obesity and related diseases. We will use off the shelf, validated and wearable wireless&#xD;
      sensors to measure physical activity, blood pressure, sleep, heart rate, galvanic skin&#xD;
      response and blood glucose levels and communicate the measured information to a mobile phone&#xD;
      using a wireless interface. This will deliver a record of behavior and health data that is&#xD;
      time-stamped, synchronized, and geographically localized using GPS to a secure server. Data&#xD;
      will then be analyzed and displayed to participating health professionals to provide them&#xD;
      with readily interpretable records of continuously monitored energy expenditure, recorded and&#xD;
      synchronized with other essential biological, behavioral and geographical data. To accomplish&#xD;
      this project, 50 African American and Hispanic youth (50% female, ages 12-17) will be&#xD;
      recruited into the research in advisory capacities, to test the sensors during development,&#xD;
      and to wear the sensors for three non-contiguous weeks. To test the sensors prior to use with&#xD;
      minority youth, 30 college students age 18 and above will be recruited to try out the sensors&#xD;
      in and outside of the laboratory in order to make sure that all sensors are in perfect&#xD;
      working order before testing them in minority youth populations. An advisory group of medical&#xD;
      professionals will be assembled to guide us through the process of developing a web interface&#xD;
      that will ensure that the right information will be displayed in an easily interpretable&#xD;
      fashion. The advisory group will participate in regular meetings to develop and test the web&#xD;
      interface. Using the data acquired, health professionals will be able to visualize average&#xD;
      amounts of physical activity, sleep, sedentary behaviors (daily or weekly) as well as daily&#xD;
      patterns. Average blood glucose, heart rate, and stress levels (daily or weekly) as well as&#xD;
      daily patterns will also be available. Practitioners will be able to see when and where&#xD;
      activity and metabolic events are occurring, enabling preemptive and preventive strategies as&#xD;
      well as targeted interventions to prevent and treat pediatric obesity in underserved and&#xD;
      at-risk minority youth.&#xD;

      Part 1: Developing a Mobile Software Suite for Biomonitoring The software suite proposed in&#xD;
      this research will be implemented using a three-tier architecture. The front tier of this&#xD;
      architecture is the data collection sensors coupled with mobile phones that acts as data&#xD;
      transmission device. The middle tier is a web server that receives and processes information&#xD;
      and sends it to a back-end database server that stores the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensor layer is a collection of off-the-shelf devices that measure the metabolic&#xD;
      activity. In particular, we propose to use heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose&#xD;
      monitors currently available from Alive Technologies25. In addition to measuring the&#xD;
      metabolic activity all these sensors are also capable of wirelessly transmitting this data&#xD;
      over Bluetooth interface. We propose to use feature rich Nokia N95 as the mobile phone&#xD;
      platform. N95 supports Bluetooth 2.0 +EDR for quick pairing with external Bluetooth sensors,&#xD;
      and has 3G and WiFi radios for high bandwidth data transfer. All the external sensors listed&#xD;
      above stream data to the Bluetooth enabled N95 mobile phone. In addition to the high&#xD;
      bandwidth radio capabilities, the N95 mobile phone platform has a highly accurate built-in&#xD;
      assisted GPS unit that uses a combination of GPS satellites, cellular tower and WiFi scanning&#xD;
      to obtain a GPS position lock in less than 10 seconds. The stated location accuracy of GPS&#xD;
      unit is 30 meters, while in practice the observed accuracy is around 3 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1a: Testing and Initial Deployment of sensors in target populations: We will use unit&#xD;
      testing to extensively test our mobile software suite. We will recreate several usage&#xD;
      scenarios and environmental conditions that our deployment test bed is likely to encounter. A&#xD;
      total of 50 Hispanic and African American youth will be recruited to assist in technology&#xD;
      development: 1) an advisory group of 10 youth, 2) 20 youth to participate in laboratory&#xD;
      testing of the biomonitors and 3) 20 youth to wear the biomonitors and provide data and&#xD;
      feedback. The advisory group of 5 African American and 5 Hispanic youth will be retained&#xD;
      throughout the developmental phase to periodically visit our laboratory and test-run the&#xD;
      sensors (50% female, 12-17 years of age). We will recruit a separate group of 10 African&#xD;
      American and 10 Hispanic youth (50% female, 12-17 years of age) to participate in idea&#xD;
      building sessions to ensure that sensors will be attractive and wearable, and to test the&#xD;
      ease of usability of our mobile software suite. The initial deployment phase includes&#xD;
      training the children on how to wear and remove the sensors. For laboratory testing of&#xD;
      sensors, 10 Hispanic and 10 African American youth will spend 3-6 hours wearing the sensors&#xD;
      and following protocols for walking, sitting, standing and doing various daily activities&#xD;
      either at Dr. Spruijt-Metz's Physical Activity Observation Laboratory at USC HSA, or to the&#xD;
      Motion Capture Laboratory at the Viterbi School of Engineering on USC Main Campus. Once the&#xD;
      software and hardware is determined to be robust enough for deployment we will conduct our&#xD;
      initial monitoring study with 10 African American and 10 Hispanic youth (50% female, 12-17&#xD;
      years of age). Children will wear the devices for three periods of one week (7 days), after&#xD;
      which they will participate in brief individual interviews and surveys to ascertain ease of&#xD;
      wear and to find ways to motivate and incentivize teens for wearing the sensors. Data&#xD;
      collected from these weeks of wear will be used for the remaining data analysis and web&#xD;
      presentation phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Data Capture and Transmission to a Back-End Server: We propose t a comprehensive&#xD;
      mobile software suite that will allow the mobile phone to use Bluetooth to pair with wireless&#xD;
      monitoring devices to collect vital health and behavioral data along with reading the&#xD;
      built-in GPS data. The BodyMedia and MemSensse units will provide accelerometry data on&#xD;
      physical activity and sleep. These measures will be validated in our physical activity lab&#xD;
      against the Actigraph accelerometer (which has been extensively validated in youth) and&#xD;
      Continuous Observation using the SOFIT system, a gold standard for physical activity&#xD;
      measurement in youth 32, 33. By using time stamps the sensor data from Accelerometer can be&#xD;
      correlated to the vital signs data collected from wearable sensors. We will use the data&#xD;
      collected from all these sensors to automatically classify the user's activity. In&#xD;
      particular, the software creates user specific movement signatures to account for differences&#xD;
      in user's gait, walking/running/bicycling speed, usual route taken between work and home etc.&#xD;
      The software will be able to use a combination of GPS and accelerometers to recognize the&#xD;
      differences between driving on road and walking. This sensor information will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously on the local storage on the mobile phone. For reference, our mobile device&#xD;
      platform has an 8GB in-built flash memory that can be used for storing sensor information.&#xD;
      Table 1 shows the approximate data rate of sensors. Using these data rates, we estimate that&#xD;
      our 8GB local storage can store approximately 1000 days worth of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While data may be stored locally on the mobile phone the real value of our approach is the&#xD;
      fact that these mobile devices can transmit the sensor information to any remote server using&#xD;
      cellular data network or even WiFi. The information collected from the sensors in the mobile&#xD;
      phone is sent to the web server for processing. The web server acts as data integrity manager&#xD;
      that prevents illegal data read/writes by using simple authentication mechanisms, such as&#xD;
      personal authentication. The web server utilizes HTTP/SMTP protocol to receive information&#xD;
      from the mobile phones. The web server also provides web enabled access to the data for&#xD;
      physician's around the globe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: Simultaneous Data Analysis and Interpretation: The web server sends the data to the&#xD;
      back-end database server for storing and further analysis of the data. Sensor data is likely&#xD;
      to be noisy. Therefore, the experts in engineering and pediatric obesity in minority&#xD;
      populations gathered on this team will work together to create adaptive algorithms to distill&#xD;
      important health and behavioral information from noisy sensors. The development of such&#xD;
      algorithms will allow for accurate measurements even when one sensor is not working properly.&#xD;
      In addition, we shall investigate the possibility of monitoring whether a child is properly&#xD;
      wearing all sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3a) Web interface capabilities: What, when and where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the data acquired, health professionals will be able to visualize:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity a child is getting (daily or&#xD;
           weekly), plus daily patterns of exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average number of steps a child is taking (daily or weekly), plus daily patterns of&#xD;
           steps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average amount of sedentary behavior a child is experiencing per day or per week, plus&#xD;
           daily patterns of sedentary behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average levels of stress or arousal (daily or weekly), plus daily patterns of stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patterns of behavioral and metabolic data will be time stamped. Therefore,&#xD;
           practitioners will be able to see when a child is active, sedentary, stressed, or&#xD;
           experiencing high blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing notifications: The final product will be influenced by the advisory group of&#xD;
      medical professionals that we will assemble. We therefore provide a brief list of examples&#xD;
      below (thus not an exhaustive list) of notifications that we envision the web interface&#xD;
      supply to participating health professionals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recommendations for physical activity range from 30-90 minutes of moderate to vigorous&#xD;
           physical activity per day and are somewhat age-specific34. Automated system&#xD;
           notifications could be generated when average daily physical activity moderate to&#xD;
           vigorous falls below 60 minutes, and again below 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recommendations for steps per day are currently 11,000 to 12,000 steps per day for girls&#xD;
           and 13.000 to 15,000 steps per day for boys. Automated system notifications will be&#xD;
           generated when children fall below these recommendations. New recommendations for both&#xD;
           physical activity and steps are expected to be made public soon35. Advances in the field&#xD;
           will be scrupulously monitored and incorporated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are currently no gold standards or threshold measures for stress or arousal in&#xD;
           youth or in adults. However, Firstbeat technologies&#xD;
           (http://www.firstbeattechnologies.com/) has been working to develop stress and recovery&#xD;
           analysis in collaboration with several research projects in the area of stress&#xD;
           measurement and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, applying also research in the&#xD;
           fields of exercise physiology, behavioral sciences, and applied mathematics. We will&#xD;
           work with Firstbeat to explore development of guidelines for measurement and definition&#xD;
           of cut-points for stress in youth. We will begin the design of multi-modal signal&#xD;
           processing algorithms for determining personalized cut-points for individual youths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio-monitoring for developing interventions and intervention strategies: Because&#xD;
      practitioners will be able to attach time of day to metabolic and behavioral indices and&#xD;
      patterns, health practitioners will be able to pinpoint causes and effects as well as develop&#xD;
      targeted intervention strategies. Furthermore, for researchers, the wealth of time and&#xD;
      location stamped data will allow for much broader understanding of the effects of the&#xD;
      environment and time of day of metabolic and behavioral events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4: Developing a User-Friendly, Web Enabled and Secure Interface for Health&#xD;
      Professionals: This part of the research will be ongoing and begin at the onset of the&#xD;
      project. An advisory team including pediatricians, family doctors, pediatric&#xD;
      endocrinologists, specialists in pediatric diabetes, African American health outreach&#xD;
      professionals and promotoras (outreach workers in the Hispanic community) will be assembled&#xD;
      to guide us through the process of developing a web interface that will ensure that the right&#xD;
      information will be displayed in an easily interpretable fashion. The advisory group will&#xD;
      participate in regular meetings to develop and test the web interface. At the onset of the&#xD;
      project, they will be invited to participate in an idea-building session in order to develop&#xD;
      specific guidelines for web interface development. Idea-building sessions are one of the&#xD;
      nominal group techniques that are used to structure small group meetings in such a way that&#xD;
      individual judgments can be effectively pooled. Typically, four steps are involved: 1) silent&#xD;
      generation of ideas; 2) group recording of ideas; 3) serial discussion of ideas; and, 4)&#xD;
      voting to order the ideas as to their salience. Idea writing is particularly helpful in&#xD;
      developing general ideas into more specific ideas using group interaction. This is also a&#xD;
      four-step process: 1) organization into small groups; 2) initial written response; 3) written&#xD;
      interaction; and, 4) analyses and report. Idea writing is an attractive technique because the&#xD;
      group produces a written product. Analyses of the idea-building data includes recording,&#xD;
      transcription, and examination of the data for emergent themes. The information from these&#xD;
      sessions will be used for several purposes: 1) to define the form and content of final data&#xD;
      that the web interface will provide, 2) to develop a system of notifications or alarms for&#xD;
      specific metabolic and behavioral values, such as blood pressure that is too high or physical&#xD;
      activity that is too low as discussed in the previous paragraph, 3) define important pathways&#xD;
      within the data that health practitioners will need to navigate easily and 4) to ensure web&#xD;
      interface user friendliness, accuracy and appeal. Ideas will also be generated on use of the&#xD;
      web interface to develop interventions for the targeted groups immediately and in the future.&#xD;
