  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and activity of Seviteronel, a lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17, in patients with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of seviteronel in subjects with castration-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer (CRPC). Phase 1 was a dose-escalation study enrolling subjects with CRPC that were&#xD;
      either &quot;treatment naïve&quot; (not treated with previous abiraterone or enzalutamide), or treated&#xD;
      with one or more of the following: abiraterone, enzalutamide, or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 is an open-label, multi-center cohort-expansion study to further determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of seviteronel in two CRPC populations with documented rising PSA with or&#xD;
      without bone or soft tissue disease progression during treatment with: abiraterone or&#xD;
      enzalutamide for ≥ 12 weeks (Group 1) abiraterone and enzalutamide; treatment should be ≥ 12&#xD;
      weeks for at least one agent (Group 2)&#xD;
