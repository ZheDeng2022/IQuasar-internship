      This project addresses the important public health need to reduce ethnic disparities in&#xD;
      depression care by pilot testing and refining a culturally tailored, low-cost intervention&#xD;
      for improving both depression and general medical outcomes among Latinos in safety net&#xD;
      primary care settings. Cuerpo Sano, Mente Sana is a newly developed, lay-led, group&#xD;
      self-management intervention that educates and empowers patients in their own health care and&#xD;
      has the potential for widespread implementation and sustainability in primary care because it&#xD;
      is responsive to patient, provider, and system preferences and needs. After completing an&#xD;
      assessment of study clinic sites, we will conduct a pilot test of Cuerpo Sano, Mente Sana&#xD;
      with 30 low-income, Spanish-speaking primary care patients. After reviewing pilot findings,&#xD;
      we will revise the intervention and study plan, and will conduct a second pilot trial. After&#xD;
      reviewing findings from this second trial, we will finalize the intervention and study plan&#xD;
      in preparation for larger studies to test Cuerpo Sano, Mente Sana versus other interventions&#xD;
      for addressing depression among Latinos in safety net primary care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos suffer a greater disability burden from depression than whites due to low rates of&#xD;
      quality depression care. Depression is common among Latinos in primary care settings and is&#xD;
      also often chronic, recurring, and comorbid with chronic medical illness. Improving outcomes&#xD;
      for both depression and chronic medical illness requires patients to become educated, active&#xD;
      partners in managing their illnesses. Latinos desire education regarding general and mental&#xD;
      health; have stigma-related concerns regarding mental health care; and prefer psychotherapy&#xD;
      to medication. However, safety net primary care providers and clinics often prioritize&#xD;
      improving medical outcomes and lack the resources for depression care, especially&#xD;
      psychotherapy. There is an important public health need to develop a culturally tailored, low&#xD;
      cost intervention that includes educational and psychotherapeutic elements, targets medical&#xD;
      illness and depression, and destigmatizes depression care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to patient, provider, and clinic preferences and resources for depression care,&#xD;
      we developed but have not yet tested an innovative, theoretically-based group intervention,&#xD;
      drawing upon two evidence-based interventions that improve self-efficacy: group cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and group self-management for chronic medical&#xD;
      illness. Professionally-led group CBT is effective for depression among ethnic minorities in&#xD;
      primary care but is difficult to sustain. Among patients with chronic medical illness,&#xD;
      lay-led group self-management programs educate and empower patients to engage in healthful&#xD;
      behaviors and participate in their care. The groups improve self-efficacy, health-related&#xD;
      behaviors, and outcomes; have been adapted for diverse conditions; and have been widely&#xD;
      disseminated and sustained. However, standard self-management groups do not improve&#xD;
      depression. We thus enhanced the Spanish-language Tomando Control de su Salud chronic disease&#xD;
      self-management program by adding depression-related educational and skill-building content&#xD;
      from group CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will pilot test and refine Cuerpo Sano, Mente Sana, our newly enhanced self-management&#xD;
      program for depression and chronic medical illness. Following a framework for successful&#xD;
      implementation of interventions, we will 1) evaluate intervention context and refine our&#xD;
      intervention and implementation strategy; 2) conduct a randomized trial with 30 low-income&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking patients with depressive disorder and chronic medical illness; 3) review&#xD;
      pilot findings of feasibility, implementation, and potential sustainability with a&#xD;
      multistakeholder panel and then revise our materials and procedures; 4) conduct a second&#xD;
      trial with 30 additional patients; and 5) review additional pilot findings (including 3- and&#xD;
      6-month intervention effects on self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and depression and health&#xD;
      outcomes and interviews with clinic stakeholders) and finalize the intervention and&#xD;
      implementation strategy. This study lays the groundwork for future comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      studies of strategies to address depression among Latinos in safety net primary care.&#xD;
