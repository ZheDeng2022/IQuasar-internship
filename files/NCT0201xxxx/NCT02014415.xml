  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that there is liver injury (inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis)&#xD;
      in adults with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), which is asymptomatic,&#xD;
      under-recognized, and undiagnosed. In addition, the investigators believe that the genetic&#xD;
      and environmental factors that play an important role in the development of alpha-1&#xD;
      antitrypsin (AAT) liver disease, can be identified by comparing a cohort database of clinical&#xD;
      disease information to linked biospecimen and DNA samples.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder resulting in a low level of a&#xD;
      protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). This deficiency can cause life-threatening liver&#xD;
      disease and/or lung disease at various ages. Some patients experience life-threatening liver&#xD;
      disease in childhood or liver cancer as adults. There is no specific treatment for AAT&#xD;
      related liver disease. Some patients develop emphysema as young adults, while some patients&#xD;
      remain healthy throughout their lives. Differences in the environment or in other genes may&#xD;
      explain such inconsistency in the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this multi-center study is to assess the natural history of&#xD;
      individuals with Pi-ZZ AAT deficiency, identify biomarkers for the progression of liver&#xD;
      disease and construct a database capable of linking cohort data with repository biospecimens.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to analyze components of the demographic, social, and family&#xD;
      history associated with more severe liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the natural history of liver disease by recording participant's&#xD;
      family history, medical history, current health, laboratory test results, and medical&#xD;
      treatment(s). Participants may complete brief research questionnaires about their physical&#xD;
      and mental health, diet, alcohol intake, and smoke, environmental and occupational (work)&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 120 Pi-ZZ AAT deficient adults with no previous history of liver disease,&#xD;
      moderate-severe liver disease, or post liver transplant, will be enrolled at one of three&#xD;
      sites. Eligible subjects will participate in one of the following study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Liver Biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Known Severe Liver Disease - subjects not meeting Biopsy Group eligibility due to the&#xD;
           presence of advanced liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post Liver Transplant - subjects who have previously undergone a liver transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, each participant will be assigned a unique study identification&#xD;
      (ID) number. All participant information recorded and samples collected for the study will be&#xD;
      saved by this unique number. All blood, tissue and genetic samples collected will be sent to&#xD;
      a secured repository for future retrieval and study. The process of coding data and samples&#xD;
      lessens the chances of a breach in confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of study participation, tests and activities performed specifically for research&#xD;
      will be determined by the enrollment group. Subjects in the Biopsy and Known Severe Liver&#xD;
      Disease groups participate in the study for 5 years (enrollment and four annual follow-up&#xD;
      visits). Both groups undergo a physical exam, diagnostic abdominal ultrasound, pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing and the collection of serum, plasma and blood for routine laboratory and&#xD;
      genetic testing (Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS cells), microRNA and DNA). However, only&#xD;
      the Biopsy Group participants undergo a liver biopsy and FibroScan at enrollment, and again&#xD;
      in Year 5. The liver tissue samples will help the researchers learn what causes liver disease&#xD;
      in some patients and how the liver disease progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the Post Liver Transplant group have a single study visit to record their&#xD;
      history, complete questionnaires and perform pulmonary function testing. In addition, whole&#xD;
      blood for DNA analysis will be collected from these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on their study arm assignment, participants will receive copies of their diagnostic&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound, pulmonary function test, routine laboratory test and liver biopsy&#xD;
      pathology results, to share with their primary care physician.&#xD;
