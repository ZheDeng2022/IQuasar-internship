      To evaluate the efficacy of fasiglifam 50 mg once daily compared to placebo on glycemic&#xD;
      control as measured by glycosilated haemoglobin (HbA1c) over a 16-week treatment period in&#xD;
      participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or&#xD;
      5 on dialysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called fasiglifam. Fasiglifam is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This study will look at glycemic control&#xD;
      in people who take fasiglifam in addition to standard antihyperglycemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 164 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by&#xD;
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain&#xD;
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent&#xD;
      medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasiglifam 50 mg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has&#xD;
           no active ingredient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the&#xD;
      study in addition to their current antihyperglycemic therapy. All participants will be asked&#xD;
      to record any time they have hypoglycemia signs and symptoms in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and European regions. The&#xD;
      overall time to participate in this study is approximately 57 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make 17 visits to the clinic. Due to potential concerns about liver safety,&#xD;
      on balance, the benefits of treating patients with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the&#xD;
      potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for&#xD;
      fasiglifam.&#xD;
