  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of five patients undergoing open abdominal surgery develops an abdominal wall defect&#xD;
      (incisional hernia) as a late complication. A fraction of these are &quot;giant&quot; hernia with a&#xD;
      fascial defect beyond 10 cm. These patients are physically severely impaired, and surgical&#xD;
      treatment is complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correction of giant incisional hernias including a relatively new and minimally invasive&#xD;
      technique, (endoscopic components separation) offers promising results. This procedure allows&#xD;
      the abdominal muscles to be joined centrally restoring the integrity of the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of patients with giant hernia is now centralized at Bispebjerg Hospital&#xD;
      allowing for a joint study between surgeons, pulmonologists, and sports medicine researchers&#xD;
      to define the functional and biophysical outcome from hernia repair. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      abdominal muscle function is significantly optimized after restoration of the abdominal wall&#xD;
      using this technique, and that muscular function is crucial for the postoperative quality of&#xD;
      life. Moreover, we want to assess whether this operation specifically optimizes the function&#xD;
      and protein synthesis of the abdominal wall muscles, and exerts a beneficial effect on lung&#xD;
      function. Finally, we will investigate if the patients with giant incisional hernia may be&#xD;
      identified by an altered composition of their connective tissue as compared with patients who&#xD;
      do not develop incisional hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study of two patient groups: 1) Patients with a giant incisional hernia&#xD;
      and 2) controls undergoing open surgery on other indications. Assessment is done pre- and&#xD;
      perioperatively and after 1 year including muscular function, lung function, abdominal wall&#xD;
      anatomy as provided by CT-scan, and quality of life. Specified biopsies from muscles and&#xD;
      connective tissue are examined for muscle fiber size/type and structure by various methods,&#xD;
      including electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Lung function is monitored by&#xD;
      blood gas concentrations, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test&#xD;
      questionnaire, and regular spirometry analyses. The studies are carried out by Ph.D. student&#xD;
      Kristian Kiim Jensen, and supervised by professor in surgery Lars Nannestad Jørgensen,&#xD;
      professor in sports medicine Michael Kjær and professor in pulmonary medicine Vibeke Backer.&#xD;

      Overall project aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study examines the abdominal skeletal muscle and connective tissue of patients&#xD;
      with giant ventral incisional hernia (VIH), and to evaluate the effect of a new endoscopic&#xD;
      components separation technique (CST) with abdominal muscle replacement upon the muscular&#xD;
      function of the abdominal wall and quality of life in patients. The study relies on the&#xD;
      following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collagen characteristics and organization are altered in patients with incisional hernia&#xD;
           as compared with patients who do not develop incisional hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reconstruction of the linea alba by endoscopic CST and medialization of the abdominal&#xD;
           rectus muscles in patients with giant VIH leads to improvement of daily function,&#xD;
           respiratory performance and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abdominal wall reconstruction including CST with re-positioning of the rectus abdominis&#xD;
           musculature increases the abdominal muscle mass and strength along with higher protein&#xD;
           synthesis of the rectus muscles and a reduction of fibrotic skeletal muscle phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 patients electively admitted for repair of a giant midline VIH, and 20 patients&#xD;
      without hernias electively operated on for other indications are included. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are pregnancy, severe heart- or lung disease, significant musculoskeletal disease, chemo- or&#xD;
      radiotherapy within three months prior to the examination, and systemic corticosteroid&#xD;
      medication. Oral and written informed consents are obtained from each participating patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength measurements of the m. rectus abdominis and the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps&#xD;
      femoris muscle are done using a Good Strength muscle test system, both static and dynamic.&#xD;
      The measurements are undertaken preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. A CT scan of the&#xD;
      abdomen and thigh is done both 1 month before and 1 year after surgery to provide a detailed&#xD;
      description of the hernia dimensions, the distance between the abdominal rectus muscles, and&#xD;
      to determine the cross sectional area of the rectus abdominis and the vastus lateralis&#xD;
      muscle. Lung function is determined by arterial blood gas, venous oxygen saturation, forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume (FEV1), forced- and vital capacity (FVC, VC) including B2-receptor agonist&#xD;
      reversal test, and maximum inspiratory- and expiratory pressure (MIP/MEP) preoperatively and&#xD;
      1 year postoperatively. Daily arterial blood gas is measured during postoperative admission.&#xD;
      Lung function is determined at 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life is assessed by the use of questionnaires. SF 36 is used for obtaining both&#xD;
      mental and physical health scores. The St. George respiratory questionnaire and MRC are used&#xD;
      to determine the level of daily lung impairment. Further, Carolina Comfort Scale assesses&#xD;
      level of pain, movement limitation, and mesh sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein turnover in both abdominal and thigh skeletal muscle is assessed by the use of a&#xD;
      flood-primed continuous infusion of ring-13C6- phenylalanine. This will be infused four hours&#xD;
      before surgery, and during this period 2-3 blood samples are drawn to verify stabilization of&#xD;
      the isotope enrichment level prior to biopsy sampling. Muscle biopsy material is divided into&#xD;
      fractions covering myofibrillar, sarcoplasmic and connective tissue proteins and analyzed&#xD;
      using mass spectrometry to allow for calculation of protein synthesis of both contractile&#xD;
      muscle protein and for muscle collagen. These procedures are repeated one year post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, biopsies of the linea alba, abdominal rectus muscle and the vastus lateralis&#xD;
      muscle are taken using needle-biopsy equipment (Bergstrøm needle). One year after surgery the&#xD;
      abdominal rectus muscle and vastus lateralis muscle again undergo the same biopsy procedure&#xD;
      using a similar technique, but this time performed per-cutaneously under ultrasonographic&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsies are examined histologically for individual muscle fiber size and type (ATPase&#xD;
      staining) as well as connective tissue and muscle structure (immunohistological examination&#xD;
      collagen I, III and IV, laminin, desmin, tenascin-C). A section of the biopsy is used for&#xD;
      mRNA expression by RT-PCR of COL1, COL3 and Tenascin-C. The content of collagen and both&#xD;
      enzymatic and non-enzymatic cross-links (HP, LP and pentosidine) are determined by HPLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The linea alba connective tissue biopsy taken perioperative is investigated by electron&#xD;
      microscopy for quantification of collagen fibril diameter, and atomic force microscopy to&#xD;
      investigate fibril mechanics and 3-D structure of the connective tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in abdominal flexor function and respiratory performance secondary to surgery is&#xD;
      described in a paired design for both groups of patients. Quality of Life SF 36 and Carolina&#xD;
      Comfort Scale are compared between the two groups of patients in an unpaired design and&#xD;
      within patient groups in a paired design to assess any change induced by surgery. Differences&#xD;
      between patient groups and change induced by surgery are assessed from the analyses on the&#xD;
      harvested biopsy materials.&#xD;
