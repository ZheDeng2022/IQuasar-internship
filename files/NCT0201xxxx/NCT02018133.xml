  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify genes that are responsive to paricalcitol (active&#xD;
      vitamin D) therapy. Scientists have found that over 30 different types of cells in the body&#xD;
      respond to vitamin D therapy, including blood vessels. Low levels of vitamin D may reduce the&#xD;
      amount of calcium in the blood, increase the amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and cause&#xD;
      the parathyroid gland (small gland located in the neck) to get bigger which is called&#xD;
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Also, low levels of vitamin D may worsen the heart&#xD;
      disease seen in dialysis patients. Paricalcitol, a man-made active vitamin D, is a&#xD;
      replacement for vitamin D for preventing and treating SHPT. Studies that followed patients on&#xD;
      dialysis have found: (1) differences in death rates between those who received active vitamin&#xD;
      D compared with no activated vitamin D, and (2) a survival benefit in chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD) patients receiving paricalcitol, over calcitriol (natural active vitamin D).&#xD;
      Researchers have considered that giving paricalcitol to people with (CKD) may also prevent or&#xD;
      slow the progression of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, physicians can only tell how well the vitamin D is working by measuring PTH&#xD;
      concentrations. This study aims to identify markers in the blood that can be used to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of Vitamin D therapy.&#xD;

      After baseline information and laboratory tests are obtained, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either oral paricalcitol at 2 mcg daily for 2 weeks or placebo. After a washout&#xD;
      period of 4 weeks, those subjects who received paricalcitol will receive placebo for 2 weeks&#xD;
      and those who received placebo will receive paricalcitol for 2 weeks. A simple blood draw&#xD;
      will be obtained from the patient on days 0, 1, and 14 of each treatment arm, and they will&#xD;
      also be assessed for side effects at the end of each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood obtained during these visits will be analyzed for any changes that may have&#xD;
      occurred in the white blood cells (WBC) and/or plasma. These samples will be tested to see if&#xD;
      there are any markers in the blood that changed after treatment with vitamin D. The samples&#xD;
      collected will be temporarily stored in the research laboratory and subsequently sent to a&#xD;
      separate laboratory (Genus Systems Company) in batches for analysis.&#xD;
