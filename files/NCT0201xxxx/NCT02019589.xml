      This study will be a Phase 3, randomized, three-cycle, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group, multiple-dose design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design has four phases: Screening Period; Open-Label Estrogen-Priming Period&#xD;
      (Run-In Period); Blinded Treatment Period; and Follow-Up. The Open Label Priming Period and&#xD;
      Blinded Treatment Period cover a total of three 28-day cycles. Clinical evaluations will be&#xD;
      performed at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Screening Period (approximately 42 Days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-Label Estrogen Priming Period (Run In Period):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone Interview (Cycle 1, Day 28 [- 3 d to ±1d])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded Treatment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 Randomization (Cycle 2, Day 12 [±2d])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 Interim (Cycle 3, Day 12 [±2d])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 End of treatment (Cycle 3, Day 24 [±1d])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 Follow-Up (Approximately 10 days after the last treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone Interview (Approximately 2-4 weeks after completion of progestin course) (Only&#xD;
           applies to subjects receiving an approved progestin therapy for proliferative&#xD;
           endometrium, as determined by biopsy.)&#xD;
