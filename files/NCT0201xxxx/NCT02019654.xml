    <textblock>
      Background: A traumatic brain injury (TBI) could mean a person is at high risk for other&#xD;
      long-lasting problems. These problems could include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),&#xD;
      depression, and post-concussive syndrome (PCS). For example, about 700,000 Americans each&#xD;
      year who have a TBI later go on to have PTSD also. Depression and PCS are also common in&#xD;
      people who had a TBI. Some people will have these problems later. These problems can&#xD;
      seriously interfere with a person s life. Some people will not have these problems at all.&#xD;
      There are many reasons for this difference. Researchers think the main reason is that people&#xD;
      have different genetic and environmental influences. Right now, we only have few kinds of&#xD;
      treatments to prevent or treat these problems after a TBI. The few treatments we have often&#xD;
      do not work well. It is important to understand what factors make a person at high risk for&#xD;
      these problems after a TBI. This could allow researchers and doctors to help address these&#xD;
      problems early. Addressing these problems earlier may help a person have better health in the&#xD;
      long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the biological changes that happen after mild to moderate TBI which could be linked&#xD;
      to the onset of PTSD, depression, and post-concussive syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study brain mechanisms that could explain risks for getting a psychiatric disorder after&#xD;
      mild to moderate TBI. This will be done using a test called functional MRI (fMRI). This test&#xD;
      takes images of the brain while a person is doing a simple task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women who are 18 to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Had a mild to moderate TBI (including concussion) in the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit is a screening visit to see if you can join the study. This visit must happen&#xD;
      within 30 days of the TBI. The visit includes lab work (blood and urine), a history and&#xD;
      physical exam done by a physician or nurse practitioner, and a psychiatric interview with a&#xD;
      behavioral health nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 happen at one, three, six and twelve months post-injury. At these visits&#xD;
      participants may have some or all of the following tests: blood and saliva collection, urine&#xD;
      collection, questionnaires and interviews to assess symptoms, a test to see your response to&#xD;
      stress (called hydrocortisone challenge), and fMRI brain imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not provide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not a substitute for seeing a primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should not replace any therapies you may be taking.&#xD;

      Objective: A traumatic brain injury (TBI) places individuals at high risk for developing&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). TBIs account for the onset of PTSD in approximately&#xD;
      700,000 Americans each year. Depression and post-concussive syndrome (PCS) are also common&#xD;
      and often comorbid with PTSD. However, even in this group, there is a high-level of&#xD;
      inter-individual response to traumatic brain injuries, suggesting that a better understanding&#xD;
      of the mechanisms underlying this risk would be of great value in directing preventive&#xD;
      interventions. The reasons for this heterogeneity are undoubtedly multi-factorial, and&#xD;
      involve a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, that we may be able to&#xD;
      understand through peripheral biomarkers and central examination of neuronal functioning. We&#xD;
      suggest that DNA methylation may be a putative biomarker of psychiatric risk, as it reflects&#xD;
      long-term changes in the function of the gene and may shape the recovery ability of the TBI&#xD;
      patient through changes in cell function. In addition, differential proteomic response,&#xD;
      including the function of the neuroendocrine system, likely relates to changes from&#xD;
      epigenetic modification in both neurons and immune cells, which may contribute to the risk&#xD;
      for the onset of PTSD as well as depression and PCS. We have previously shown that both PTSD&#xD;
      and depression are associated with endocrine alterations, leading us to question if this&#xD;
      biological change may underlie vulnerability for the onset of PTSD as well as depression and&#xD;
      PCS following a TBI. In support of the idea of shared vulnerability, patients with a TBI also&#xD;
      often display endocrine function alterations. In addition, sleep disturbance is common&#xD;
      following TBI and is a core symptom of PTSD depression and PCS, suggesting that sleep may&#xD;
      contribute to psychiatric and neurological recovery from a TBI. This line of research is&#xD;
      essential, as current treatments to prevent or treat psychiatric risk following TBI are often&#xD;
      ineffective, and even treatment of PCS is limited. This poor understanding results in our&#xD;
      limited ability to reduce the risk for compromises in the health and well-being of patients&#xD;
      who sustain a TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Participants with a moderate or mild TBI (n=100) will be followed for a&#xD;
      period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a natural history study that will recruit patients within 30 days of a&#xD;
      mild/moderate TBI, and will follow them over a one year period, with follow-up at 1, 3, 6 and&#xD;
      12 months following the TBI. Biological profiles including the concentration of inflammatory&#xD;
      proteins and neuropeptides, and DNA methylation will be examined. An optional structural and&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a hydrocortisone stimulation test will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the role of neuronal and neuroendocrine functioning following TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes of interest are the biological changes that occur&#xD;
      following TBI which are associated with the onset of psychiatric disorders of PTSD, and&#xD;
      depression, as well as the onset of PCS. The secondary aim is to examine neuronal mechanisms&#xD;
      that underlie the risks for these disorders through the use of fMRI. Additional aims will&#xD;
      determine the role of psychological resilience traits in recovery and also how sleep relates&#xD;
      to recovery and psychiatric risk.&#xD;

        This study will follow patients who sustained a mild or moderate TBI. Up to 120&#xD;
        participants (target n of completers = 100) will be enrolled into the study within 30 days&#xD;
        of the TBI and will be followed over one year. Two groups will emerge: (1) those who&#xD;
        develop PTSD, PCS, or depression and (2) those who are resistant to developing these&#xD;
        disorders. Participants must be enrolled in CNRM recruiting protocol (11-N-0084), evaluated&#xD;
        for a TBI at the George Washington University Hospital, or referred from the NIH/CC Office&#xD;
        of Patient Recruitment. NIH employees may participate.&#xD;
