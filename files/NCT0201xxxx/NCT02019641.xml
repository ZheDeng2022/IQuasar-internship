  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the result of over 200 etiological pathways arising from&#xD;
      several different insults to the lung parenchyma: inhaled substances, drug side effects,&#xD;
      connective tissue disease, infection, and malignancy. The disease can also be of idiopathic&#xD;
      origin. If prolonged, the resulting inflammation causes permanent and progressive fibrotic&#xD;
      reorganization of the parenchyma and small airways, which reduces the distensibility of the&#xD;
      lung and impedes O2 and CO2 exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the safety and efficacy of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise for patients who have interstitial lung disease (ILD) uncomplicated by pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. In an uncontrolled study, we observed more efficient cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      function, increased physical work capacity, and improved health-related quality of life&#xD;
      following aerobic exercise in this study population. Serious adverse events resulting from&#xD;
      aerobic exercise training were not observed and our work to date has established plausibility&#xD;
      for the efficacy of aerobic exercise training and its safety for patients with ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two primary treatment conditions. Patients with ILD are be randomized to either an&#xD;
      intervention consisting of aerobic exercise training plus patient education or a control&#xD;
      condition that includes patient education only. Aerobic exercise training will consist of a&#xD;
      10-week regimen of supervised treadmill walking three times a week. The duration of the&#xD;
      exercise sessions will progress from 30 minutes to 45 minutes per session over the 10 weeks,&#xD;
      as tolerated. The intensity of the exercise will be determined based on results of a&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test. Those randomized to control will not initially engage in&#xD;
      aerobic exercise training. There will, however, be a secondary study: a crossover design in&#xD;
      which subjects in the control group will complete the aerobic exercise regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be between the ages of 21 and 80 and live within a reasonable travel&#xD;
           distance from the greater Washington D.C. area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All pre and post testing will be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda,&#xD;
           Maryland. Each testing session will last about 6 hours and will consist of a medical&#xD;
           history and examination; six questionnaires on health, fatigue, activity, and mood;&#xD;
           electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, six-minute&#xD;
           walk test (6MWT); and urine pregnancy test (if applicable). Other required tests are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A maximum treadmill test: The exercise begins at an easy level and gradually increases&#xD;
           until the participant says he or she can no longer continue or the investigator decides&#xD;
           it is not safe to continue. Participants are fitted with a mask, electrodes and light&#xD;
           sensors to measure how well the heart is working and how well the muscles use oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An arterial occlusion muscle oxygenation capacity test:: During seated rest, a light&#xD;
           sensor that measures the oxygen level in the muscle is placed on the calf while a&#xD;
           pressure cuff will then be placed around the thigh. The cuff is rapidly inflated and&#xD;
           held at a high pressure for up to 10 minutes and then deflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample for complete blood count and Nt-ProBNP (a hormone that indicates damage&#xD;
           to heart muscle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aerobic exercise training and education may take place at either the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
           in Bethesda, Maryland, or the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program at INOVA Fairfax Hospital&#xD;
           in Falls Church, Virginia.&#xD;
