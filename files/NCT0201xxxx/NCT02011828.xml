    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effects of cholecalciferol treatment on&#xD;
      inflammation and insulin resistance, in patients on hemodialysis that are previously treated&#xD;
      with paricalcitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholecalciferol is produced by the action of sunlight on a cholesterol precursor in the skin.&#xD;
      This compound is then converted to calcidiol (25(OH) D3) in the liver, whereupon calcidiol is&#xD;
      converted in the kidney to calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D. However,&#xD;
      recently it has been shown that deficiency of either calcidiol or calcitriol is associated&#xD;
      with inflammation, insulin resistance and increased mortality in the general population.&#xD;
      Furthermore, when both calcidiol and calcitriol were deficient, the mortality risk was much&#xD;
      higher than the deficiency of either alone. A possible explanation is that some of the&#xD;
      non-renal tissues might critically depend on the endogenous conversion of calcidiol to&#xD;
      calcitriol and not on circulating levels of calcitriol. Thus, low circulating levels of&#xD;
      calcidiol might be associated with tissue level functional calcitriol deficiency despite&#xD;
      adequate circulating levels of calcitriol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the hypothesis is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In non-diabetic hemodialysis (HD) patients treated with therapeutic doses of&#xD;
           paricalcitol (an analog of calcitriol), calcidiol deficiency is associated with&#xD;
           inflammation and insulin resistance and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In calcidiol deficient, non-diabetic HD patients with inflammation and treated with&#xD;
           therapeutic doses of paricalcitol, cholecalciferol will reverse the calcidiol deficiency&#xD;
           and thereby, reduce inflammation and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleulin-6 (IL-6) is thought to play a central role in insulin resistance by&#xD;
      down-regulating glucose transporter-4 messenger RNA. Furthermore, IL-6 levels are&#xD;
      significantly negatively associated with calcidiol levels, therefore will be measured as the&#xD;
      primary outcome.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Non-diabetic in-center HD patients on stable doses of paricalcitol over past three months&#xD;
        with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in the therapeutic range (150-300 pg/ml) will be&#xD;
        identified from review of the dialysis program electronic medical records. Woman in the&#xD;
        reproductive age group (ages 18-55), excluding those women who have undergone hysterectomy,&#xD;
        oopherectomy will undergo a serum β-HCG levels during the selection process. If β-HCG&#xD;
        levels are positive these patients will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non diabetic patients on HD, on stable dose of paricalcitol supplements for at least 3&#xD;
             months with iPTH in target range. Of the 60 patients enrolled in the observational&#xD;
             component, those with high CRP (&gt; 3 mg/dl) and calcidiol deficiency (&lt; 15 ng/ml) will&#xD;
             be eligible to participate in the interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As the median CRP in the HEMO Study was 11 mg/L and &gt; 80% of HD patients are calcidiol&#xD;
             deficient [10], most of the screened patients will be eligible. In each year, the&#xD;
             first 12 patients who meet the above criteria and consent for the interventional&#xD;
             component, a randomized cross-over trial of cholecalciferol 50,000 IU/ week vs.&#xD;
             matching placebo will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic patients, not on paricalcitol, enrolled in other interventional studies,&#xD;
             hospitalized in the past month or treated for an infection in the past month and&#xD;
             pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will conduct a pregnancy test for women in the reproductive age group (18-55 years)&#xD;
             during the initial screening process. We will obtain serum β-HCG levels to rule out&#xD;
             pregnancy and the test will be paid for by the study. The results will be reviewed by&#xD;
             the PI. If β-HCG levels are positive these patients will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
