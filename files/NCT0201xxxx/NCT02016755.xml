    <measure>Number of Participants in Whom the Largest Ulcer Healed Completely or Gets Smaller (Photo Confirmation)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 Months</time_frame>
    <description>All summaries and analyses will be presented in tabular or graphical form. The study is not powered for the statistical inference and the test will be considered to be descriptive.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants in Whom Rest Pain (Based on 10 cm VAS Scale) Reduces by 20 mm (2 cm) or More or Was Completely Relieved.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>All summaries and analyses will be presented in tabular or graphical form. The study is not powered for the statistical inference and the test will be considered to be descriptive.&#xD;
The severity of rest pain (based on the average over previous 7 days) recorded using the 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
VAS is a 10-cm line (with score ranges 0 to 10), oriented horizontally; the left end of the line (0 mark) indicates &quot;no pain&quot;; the right end indicates &quot;pain as bad as it can be.&quot;&#xD;
The subject is asked to mark a place on the line corresponding to the average pain intensity experienced in the last 7 days.&#xD;
The distance along the scale is converted into a numeric reading by measuring the distance of the subjects mark in cm from the beginning of the scale (the 0 mark).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline of VascuQol Score for the Index Limb by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VascuQol contains 5 domains (pain, symptom, activities, social, and emotional functioning); responses were scored from 0 (lowest QOL, death) to 7 (best QOL, maximum health).&#xD;
Responses were averaged for composite overall and domain-specific scores, giving equal weight to each question and domain. The composite overall is the average of domain-specific scores.&#xD;
Responses after revascularization or major amputation were included in the analysis. In the event of death, subjects were scored as 0. For the effect of treatment on individual domains, pain, symptoms, and activities were considered the most important of the 5 domains.</description>

VAS is a 10-cm line (with score ranges 0 to 10), oriented horizontally; the left end of the line (0 mark) indicates &quot;no pain&quot;; the right end indicates &quot;pain as bad as it can be.&quot;&#xD;
The subject is asked to mark a place on the line corresponding to the average pain intensity experienced in the last 7 days.&#xD;

        <description>The VascuQol contains 5 domains (pain, symptom, activities, social, and emotional functioning); responses were scored from 0 (lowest QOL, death) to 7 (best QOL, maximum health).&#xD;
Responses were averaged for composite overall and domain-specific scores, giving equal weight to each question and domain. The composite overall is the average of domain-specific scores.&#xD;
Responses after revascularization or major amputation were included in the analysis. In the event of death, subjects were scored as 0. For the effect of treatment on individual domains, pain, symptoms, and activities were considered the most important of the 5 domains.</description>

Responses were averaged for composite overall and domain-specific scores, giving equal weight to each question and domain. The composite overall is the average of domain-specific scores.&#xD;

        <title>Change in Hemodynamic Measurement of Baseline Calculated Toe Brachial Index (TBI) of the Index Leg by Visit</title>
        <description>Summary statistics was provided for baseline and change from baseline for toe brachial index (TBI) by visit. At each visit, only subjects who have a non-missing value at both baseline and the specific visit was summarized. Two-sided one-sample t-test was performed for each visit and last observation carried forward (LOCF).&#xD;
TBI was calculated by dividing the toe systolic blood pressure by the brachial systolic blood pressure. TBI was calculated at baseline and at each visit. The change in TBI at each visit compared to the baseline value was recorded.</description>

At each visit, only subjects who have a non-missing value at both baseline and the specific visit was summarized.

ABI was calculated by dividing the ankle systolic blood pressure by the brachial systolic blood pressure. ABI was calculated at baseline and at each visit. The change in ABI at each visit compared to the baseline value was recorded.</description>
