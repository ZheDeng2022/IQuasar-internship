      This is a monocenter, open-label, uncontrolled study in accordance with §23b MPG to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of the HIFU-treatment of fibroadenoma using the TH-One device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of the breast&#xD;
      fibroadenoma using the TH-One device Secondary objective: To evaluate the tolerability of the&#xD;
      HIFU using the TH-One device&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of fibroadenoma must be based on:&#xD;
