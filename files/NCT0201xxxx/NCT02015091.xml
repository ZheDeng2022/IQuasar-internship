      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People bitten by mosquitoes carrying weakened malaria parasites could fight off the disease&#xD;
      if later exposed to normal malaria parasites. Scientists have discovered how to make the&#xD;
      weakened parasites, which can be injected by the PfSPZ vaccine. Researchers want to see if&#xD;
      people who receive the vaccine get malaria after being bitten in a controlled setting (a&#xD;
      controlled human malaria infection, CHMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if the PfSPZ malaria vaccine is safe and prevents malaria in a controlled setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults 18 45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and lab tests,&#xD;
           and EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be split into 8 groups, to be in the study for 3 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive 3 5 vaccinations, injected by a needle in an arm vein or&#xD;
           muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a health diary and be contacted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For CHMI, a cup with mosquitoes carrying malaria is applied to participants arm for 5&#xD;
           minutes. Five mosquitoes at a time are used, until 5 have bitten. Some groups will be&#xD;
           exposed to malaria more than once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After CHMI, participants will visit the clinic very frequently (including daily visits&#xD;
           for 12 days) for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn at most visits, from 1 to 20 tubes. Physical exam and medical&#xD;
           history may also be repeated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who develop malaria will be treated immediately at the clinic. Standard&#xD;
           treatment takes 72 hours. Malaria symptoms may last up to 3 days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      VRC 314 is designed as an open-label evaluation of the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine. This vaccine administered at 1.35 times 10(5) PfSPZ&#xD;
      per injection by the IV route on a schedule of 5 vaccinations was previously shown to confer&#xD;
      protection in all vaccinated subjects against CHMI performed shortly after last vaccination;&#xD;
      however there was limited durability of protection in a small number of protected subjects&#xD;
      who were rechallenged several months later. This study is designed to substantiate the&#xD;
      initial results with the IV vaccination route for protection against CHMI. Based on the&#xD;
      potential importance of dose and schedule in optimizing sustained immunity with this vaccine,&#xD;
      an increase in PfSPZ IV dosage on schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations will be evaluated for&#xD;
      protection against CHMI conducted early (about 3 weeks) and late (about 24 weeks) after&#xD;
      completion of vaccinations. To assess if a higher dose given by another route confers&#xD;
      protection, one group will receive PfSPZ IM, with half of the amount administered in each arm&#xD;
      on a schedule with 4 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are related to the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      vaccinations by the IV and IM routes of administration and protection against Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum (Pf) challenge performed via a well-established CHMI procedure early (2-4 weeks)&#xD;
      after completing schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations. The secondary objective is related to the&#xD;
      durability of protection at 20-26 weeks after the last vaccination and exploratory objectives&#xD;
      are related to the immunogenicity of the PfSPZ Vaccine and identifying potential immune&#xD;
      correlates of protection.&#xD;
