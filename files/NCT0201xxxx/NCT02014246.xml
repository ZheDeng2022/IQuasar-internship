      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two basic types of movement disorders. Some cause excessive movement, some cause&#xD;
      slowness or lack of movement. Some of these are caused by mutations in genes. On the other&#xD;
      hand, dementia is a condition of declining mental abilities, especially memory. Dementia can&#xD;
      occur at any age but becomes more frequent with age. Researchers want to study the genes of&#xD;
      families with a history of movement disorders or dementia. They hope to find a genetic cause&#xD;
      of these disorders. This can help them better understand and treat the diseases. This study&#xD;
      will not be limited to a particular disorder, but will study all movement disorders or&#xD;
      dementias in general. This study will perform genetic testing to identify the genetic causes&#xD;
      of movement disorders and dementia. Today, genetic testing can be done to analyze multiple&#xD;
      genes at the same time. This increases the chances of finding the genetic cause of movement&#xD;
      disorders and dementias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about movement disorders and dementia, their causes, and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults and children with a movement disorder or dementia, and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and blood tests. Some will have physical&#xD;
      exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a blood sample by a needle in the arm. This can be done at the clinic,&#xD;
      by their own doctor, or at home. Alternatively, a saliva sample may be provided if a blood&#xD;
      sample cannot be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can opt to send an extra blood sample to a repository for future study. Genetic&#xD;
      test will be done on these samples. The samples will be coded. The key to the code will&#xD;
      remain at NIA. Only NIA investigators will have access to the code key. Participants can&#xD;
      request to receive results of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is generally a single visit. Participants may be called back for extra&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to ascertain individuals with a clinical diagnosis of a&#xD;
      movement disorder or dementia, their affected and unaffected family members, and unrelated,&#xD;
      healthy individuals (to provide control samples); to characterize their phenotypes; and to&#xD;
      identify and further characterize genetic contributions to etiology by collecting blood&#xD;
      samples, and/or saliva samples on these individuals for DNA and induced Pluripotent stem&#xD;
      (iPs) cell line preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10,000 persons with a diagnosis of a movement disorder or dementia, 1,000 asymptomatic&#xD;
      persons who are family members/related to individuals with a diagnosis of movement disorder&#xD;
      or dementia, and 1,000 unrelated, healthy control individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study usually requires one outpatient visit to the NIH Clinical Center. Participant&#xD;
      visits may also take place when they are an inpatient at the NIH Clinical Center. Those who&#xD;
      are unable to travel to NIH may have study procedures performed at a site near their&#xD;
&#xD;
      home, such as hospital facilities, private physician offices, nursing homes, assisted living&#xD;
      facilities, local community centers, or participant homes. Participants will undergo medical&#xD;
      record review, a physical examination and biospecimen collection including&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood draw and/or saliva collection at the enrollment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional visits may be scheduled to collect additional phenotype information or to collect&#xD;
      additional biospecimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of this study is the identification of pathogenic genetic&#xD;
      variants that are causative for the movement disorder or dementia that the patient has been&#xD;
      diagnosed with. These disease-causing variants are often inherited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measure of this study is the identification of genetic variants that&#xD;
      alter susceptibility/risk for the movement disorder or dementia that the patient has been&#xD;
      diagnosed with. These genetic risk factors are associated with disease that can be apparently&#xD;
      sporadic in nature.&#xD;

             support the diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of a movement disorder or dementia by study investigators or a qualified&#xD;
             clinician by physical examination and/or review of medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 18 and above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide consent or, in the case of minors, or cognitive impairment, have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative to provide consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and participate in study procedures or for those without consent&#xD;
             capacity, able to participate in study procedures AND has a legally authorized&#xD;
