  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is becoming a leading global epidemic. DM affects several&#xD;
      systems in the body. Most of the complications encountered in DM are attributed to&#xD;
      uncontrolled hyperglycemia or poor glycemic control. Hyperglycemic stress tends to damage the&#xD;
      inner lining of the small blood vessels (endothelium). Normally, the endothelium releases a&#xD;
      chemical substance called nitric oxide (NO) which relaxes the blood vessels and also prevents&#xD;
      blockade of these vessels. Therefore damage to the endothelium (endothelial dysfunction)&#xD;
      results in diminished levels of NO which ultimately leads to occlusion of these small blood&#xD;
      vessels (microvascular occlusion). Microvascular occlusion of vessels supplying the eyes,&#xD;
      kidneys and nerves leads to serious complications like diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of late, the skeletal system has emerged as another vulnerable target of diabetic&#xD;
      microvascular disease. Patients with DM have an increased risk of developing fractures.&#xD;
      Certain predisposing factors like diabetic neuropathy and visual disturbances (retinopathy&#xD;
      and cataract) increases the likelihood of fractures in DM. More recently, evolving research&#xD;
      has demonstrated NO's prospective role in bone preservation. Earlier studies have also&#xD;
      validated the use of nitrates (donor of NO) in improving bone strength and reducing the risk&#xD;
      of fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far no study has investigated the effect of nitrates on endothelial function and bone&#xD;
      microarchitecture in patients with diabetes. The investigators therefore propose to&#xD;
      investigate the influence of nitrates on endothelial dysfunction and bone integrity in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes. 40 patients with type 2 DM will be recruited into the study;&#xD;
      20 patients will receive 20 mg of oral isosorbide mononitrate daily and the other 20 will not&#xD;
      receive the study drug. The investigators hope to demonstrate an improvement in endothelial&#xD;
      function (by measuring skin blood flow) and bone integrity (by measuring markers of bone&#xD;
      formation and bone resorption and bone mineral density - BMD) following 6 months of nitrate&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic debilitating disease that affects almost all the systems&#xD;
      in the body with accompanying diabetic complications (neuropathy, retinopathy and&#xD;
      nephropathy) adding to the global burden of DM. These diabetic complications arise as a&#xD;
      manifestation of hyperglycaemic damage induced at the cellular level particularly the&#xD;
      endothelial cells (EC). Exposure to hyperglycaemic stress causes endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      which is the major perpetrator of microvascular disease. Disruption of endothelial function&#xD;
      also marks the advent of the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that&#xD;
      includes atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). Microvascular disease occurs as a&#xD;
      result of deficiency of a potent endothelial vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO). NO plays a&#xD;
      fundamental role in vascular regulation which is mediated through vasodilation. Other&#xD;
      favourable characteristics of NO include antiplatelet activity and prevention of vascular&#xD;
      smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. Unsurprisingly, diminished NO levels in DM will&#xD;
      eventually lead to occlusion of the microvasculature in the retina, glomerulus and peripheral&#xD;
      nerve (vasa nervorum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of late, the skeletal system has also emerged as another vulnerable target of diabetic&#xD;
      microvascular disease. Certain predisposing factors like diabetic neuropathy (DN), visual&#xD;
      disturbances (retinopathy and cataract), gait abnormalities and hypoglycemia increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of fractures in DM. Among these factors DN contributes to a major extent in the&#xD;
      development of fractures especially fractures of the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current antiresorptive therapies include estrogen/ HRT (Hormone replacement therapy),&#xD;
      bisphosphonates (BPP), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) and denosumab (DMB).&#xD;
      These agents mainly retard bone resorption in the trabecular bone, with minimal effects on&#xD;
      cortical bone and are associated with only a 20-30% reduction in the risk of non-vertebral&#xD;
      fractures. Moreover, they decrease bone formation and are not devoid of adverse effects. Some&#xD;
      of these agents are also expensive and at times unavailable in some countries. All these&#xD;
      limitations challenge the discovery of an ideal agent that can prevent bone resorption,&#xD;
      increase bone formation and also reduce the risk of non-vertebral fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately the therapeutic role of organic nitrates (source of NO) in bone metabolism has led to&#xD;
      a breakthrough in this field of research. Nitrates are commonly used in the treatment of&#xD;
      angina. Since nitrates are widely available, inexpensive and associated with limited side&#xD;
      effects, it would be practical to exploit these characteristic features in the treatment of&#xD;
      bone disease and endothelial dysfunction in DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims to investigate the effect of Isosorbide mononitrate in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 DM with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Its influence on bone remodelling by assessing the levels of bone markers and its&#xD;
           ability to improve BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Its role in modulating endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised pilot study, patients with type 2 DM who receive 20 mg of Isosorbide&#xD;
      mononitrate will show:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An improvement in bone formation as measured by serum procollagen type 1 amino terminal&#xD;
           propeptide (P1NP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suppression of bone resorption as assessed by measurement of serum C-terminal&#xD;
           cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in calcaneal BMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in endothelial mediated vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS 40 female/ male subjects with type 2 DM will be considered eligible for the study.&#xD;
      They will be recruited from the Tameside Diabetes Centre and appropriate GP practices and a&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained from them prior to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is no placebo in this study, the research fellow and research nurse will be&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment the patient is receiving. As it is known that the duration of&#xD;
      diabetes can affect microvascular circulation and possibly bone metabolism, the two groups&#xD;
      will be matched for the following variables: age, gender, duration of diabetes and severity&#xD;
      of neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes self-education and management along with dietary advice will be provided to all the&#xD;
      participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of a computer-generated program the study participants will be randomised into&#xD;
      2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: 20 subjects will receive 20 mg/day of isosorbide mononitrate orally&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: 20 subjects will receive standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS Biochemical parameters at baseline and 6 months later&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum procollagen type 1 amino terminal propeptide (P1NP), a marker of bone formation&#xD;
           which indicates osteoblastic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX), a marker of bone&#xD;
           resorption Clinical parameters at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser Doppler imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calcaneal BMD (Sahara clinical bone sonometer; Hologic, Waltham, MA) Blood samples will&#xD;
           be obtained from the antecubital vein following an overnight fast and after resting for&#xD;
           15 minutes in the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the microcirculation with Laser Doppler Iontophoresis at baseline and 6 months&#xD;
      A standard measurement of microcirculation is laser Doppler iontophoresis, which is used by&#xD;
      several research institutes. In this trial the skin microcirculation will be measured on the&#xD;
      ventral aspect of the forearm using a Perimed Laser Doppler imager and iontophoresis system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial-mediated vasodilation will be measured by the iontophoresis of acetylcholine,&#xD;
      while sodium nitroprusside will be used to measure endothelium-independent vasodilation. The&#xD;
      iontophoresis system consists of an ION chamber (iontophoresis delivery vehicle device) that&#xD;
      sticks firmly to the skin and a reference electrode. The response in blood flow will be&#xD;
      imaged and quantified using the Perimed Laser Doppler Imager (Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of calcaneal BMD at baseline and at 6 months This is a simple and convenient&#xD;
      method to assess peripheral BMD and assess fracture risk. The device used is a quantitative&#xD;
      ultrasound called Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer (Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer; Hologic,&#xD;
      Waltham, MA). The calcaneus is the preferred peripheral site to assess fracture risk. This&#xD;
      device uses ultrasound waves to determine the BMD of the calcaneus. In this procedure, once&#xD;
      the bare heel is placed in the device, the BMD is calculated within 30 seconds and the&#xD;
      results are then generated on paper by the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The results obtained from this study will be reported as a difference&#xD;
      between the baseline and 6 months later following a single daily oral dose of 20 mg&#xD;
      isosorbide mononitrate. The difference between the 2 groups will also be inferred at the end&#xD;
      of 6 months. The changes in skeletal parameters (serum P1NP and CTX) and microcirculation&#xD;
      will be compared between the 2 groups using t-tests to determine post hoc differences. A&#xD;
      p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. All analyses will be conducted using the&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF THE STUDY The estimated time for enrolment of patients will be within 6 months.&#xD;
      The duration of the study is 6 months and the last follow up will be at the end of 12 months.&#xD;
