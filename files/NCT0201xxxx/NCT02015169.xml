    <textblock>
      We planned this study to investigate the efficacy and safety of XELOX (capecitabine and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin) plus lapatinib treatment in HER2-positive gastric cancer patients with liver&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide with the incidence of&#xD;
      18.9/100,000 per year and the mortality rate of 14.7/100,000 per year [1] and is the most&#xD;
      common malignancy in Korea[2]. Metastatic gastric cancer remains a therapeutic challenge for&#xD;
      medical oncologists due to poor prognosis. Several randomized phase III trials comparing&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, and mitomycin (FAM), or&#xD;
      5-FU, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate (FAMTX) with best supportive care have&#xD;
      demonstrated significantly prolonged overall survival (8 - 10 months) for chemotherapy group&#xD;
      as compared to best supportive care alone (3 - 5 months)[3, 4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In quest of a novel therapeutic target for gastric cancer, HER2 overexpression has been&#xD;
      tested and was reported in 6-35% of stomach and gastroesophageal tumors [5]. Trastuzumab, a&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal antibody which selectively targets HER2, has shown survival benefit in&#xD;
      patients with HER2(+) metastatic breast cancer [6-8]. The ToGA trial is the first randomized,&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter, phase III trial to study the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in&#xD;
      HER2(+) GC [9]. Of 3,807 tumor samples screened for Her2 status, 22.1% were Her2 positive and&#xD;
      594 patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy + trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ToGA trial demonstrated a significant survival benefit in the transtuzumab +chemotherapy&#xD;
      when compared with chemotherapy alone arm: 13.5 vs. 11.1 months, respectively (p=0.0048; HR&#xD;
      0.74; 95% CI 0.60, 0.91). ORR was 47.3% in the trastuzumab + 5-FU/CDDP (or capecitabine/CDDP)&#xD;
      arm and 34.5% in the chemotherapy alone arm (p=0.0017). The ToGA trial is the first phase III&#xD;
      trial to demonstrate survival benefit from molecularly targeted agent in gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, 70 - 80% of patients HER2 overexpressing breast cancer do not respond to trastuzumab&#xD;
      due to either primary or acquired resistance. One of the important mechanisms for trastuzumab&#xD;
      resistance is the accumulation of truncated forms of the HER2 receptor which lack the&#xD;
      extracellular trastuzumab-binding domain (Figure 2). P95HER2, an amino terminally truncated&#xD;
      carboxyl terminal fragments of HER2, is frequently found in HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines&#xD;
      and tumor specimens (~20%)[11]. Intriguingly, recent study showed that p95HER2 (+) breast&#xD;
      cancer cells were resistant to trastuzumab but remained sensitive to the antiproliferative&#xD;
      effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, both in vitro and in vivo[11]. In&#xD;
      addition, patients with p95HER2(+)breast cancer were resistant to trastuzumab with&#xD;
      significantly lower response rate when compared with full-length HER2(+) breast cancer (11.1%&#xD;
      vs 51.4%, respectively; P = 0.029).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have surveyed the incidence of p95HER2 expression in fresh frozen tissues from gastric&#xD;
      cancer and found that &gt; 60% of HER2 (3+) GC demonstrated p95HER2. Hence, the role of&#xD;
      lapatinib may be more promising than trastuzumab in GC HER2(+) patients with truncation.&#xD;
