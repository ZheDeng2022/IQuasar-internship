  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is funding exciting new research at the&#xD;
      University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation that can be a major improvement in the treatment of extremity trauma involving&#xD;
      segmental bone loss. These devastating injuries occur frequently in both civilians and the&#xD;
      military. They typically result from motor vehicle accidents, high-energy fractures, gunshot&#xD;
      injuries, and blast injuries, but also from the surgical removal of a bone segment because of&#xD;
      infection or tumor. Despite many modern medical advances in this area, bone healing that can&#xD;
      adequately replace bone loss and restore pre-injury limb function is extremely difficult to&#xD;
      achieve. Existing standard treatment procedures are exceedingly complicated, require highly&#xD;
      specialized equipment and clinical skills, and usually require many surgical procedures over&#xD;
      many months or years. Despite these effort and costs, major complications usually occur with&#xD;
      all the standard treatment options, the patient's ability to return to an acceptable&#xD;
      functional status is typically low, and, therefore, many of these patients have their limbs&#xD;
      amputated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UTMB Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation will conduct a DoD-funded&#xD;
      clinical trial to determine and compare the advantages of two new and innovative surgical&#xD;
      bone defect treatment techniques that can be significantly more effective for wounded&#xD;
      warriors or civilian patients and with these conditions. One treatment method, called &quot;the&#xD;
      Masquelet Technique&quot;, involves two-stage surgery: the first one to create a biomembrane&#xD;
      around the defect by applying a cement spacer, and then the second one for cement spacer&#xD;
      removal and defect bone grafting. The other method, developed by UTMB physicians, is &quot;the&#xD;
      Cage Technique&quot; and it comprises one-stage surgery in which a special hollow, fenestrated,&#xD;
      titanium cage filled with bone graft is implanted in the defect. Initial clinical experience&#xD;
      with both of these techniques has been very promising, but to date, there has been no&#xD;
      prospective clinical study comparing the two new methods of defect treatment. Identifying an&#xD;
      optimal surgical bone defect reconstructive technique would significantly improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of patients with these challenging conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Segmental long bone defects remain a formidable treatment challenge. All the&#xD;
      existing standard treatment options have major limitations and often culminate in limb&#xD;
      amputation or permanent functional deficits. We developed a novel, one-stage alternative&#xD;
      treatment for segmental bone loss that utilizes the cylindrical titanium mesh cage (CTMC) in&#xD;
      combination with bone graft, and have established its clinical merits in an initial clinical&#xD;
      series. Shortly thereafter, Masquelet reported another new defect reconstruction technique&#xD;
      that involves two-stage approach: first inducing biomembrane formation with a cement spacer,&#xD;
      and subsequent spacer removal and bone grafting. Both the Masquelet and the CTMC techniques&#xD;
      are based on the principle of graft containment to render optimal potential for graft to heal&#xD;
      the defect; however, they differ in primary biological versus biomechanical functions&#xD;
      provided by the containment. The Masquelet biomembrane containment, being a rich source of&#xD;
      vascular supply and growth factors, creates an excellent biological milieu for graft, but&#xD;
      requires an additional surgery and is associated with prolonged protected weight bearing&#xD;
      until graft consolidation occurs. Conversely, the benefit of the CTMC technique is primarily&#xD;
      the biomechanical support it provides for graft and the reconstructed extremity, thereby&#xD;
      permitting immediate functional restoration without mobility or weight bearing restrictions&#xD;
      during the bone healing process. Although both Masquelet and the CTMC techniques have been&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of large segmental bone defects, there is no prospective,&#xD;
      well-controlled study comparing their therapeutic efficacies for specific clinical&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Determining the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Masquelet (Arm I)&#xD;
      versus the CTMC technique (Arm II) in combination with reamer-irrigator-aspirator (RIA)&#xD;
      harvested autograft (Option A) or allograft-demineralized bone matrix (DBM) composite (Option&#xD;
      II) in the treatment of segmental long bone deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) Establish the effects of the specific patient and bone defect&#xD;
      characteristics on the treatment outcome; 2) Determine and compare clinical efficacies of the&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques (Arm I vs Arm II); 3) Establish the merits of using specific graft&#xD;
      type (Option A vs Option B) within and across each study arms; 3) Develop a quantitative&#xD;
      predictive model to improve clinical decision making, and 4) Assess and compare the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and resource expenditures incurred by the specific treatment selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Single-center, multi-site, two-arm, randomized clinical trial. Thirty patients&#xD;
      with segmental bone deficiency as a result of trauma, gunshot, iatrogenic resection due to&#xD;
      infection, nonunion, or neoplasm will be enrolled and randomized to receive either the&#xD;
      Masquelet (Arm I) or the CTMC as definitive defect treatment (Arm II). Bone graft selection&#xD;
      will include either RIA-harvested autograft (Option A) or allograft croutons-DBM composite&#xD;
      (Option B). Patients will be followed up to18 months. The data collected will include routine&#xD;
      patient baseline information, systemic and extremity injury characteristics, bone defect&#xD;
      characteristics, pre- and post-operative clinical examinations and imaging, validated&#xD;
      functional outcomes measures, and associated cost expenditure. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      used to analyze and compare the results specifically related to the rate of defect healing&#xD;
      and functional recovery. Paired t-test will be used to test the effects of the defect&#xD;
      reconstruction option on the outcome measures. Analysis of covariance will be used for&#xD;
      pair-wise comparison between the arms and within/across each bone graft option. Multiple&#xD;
      models will be used to produce an accurate predictive model which accounts for possible&#xD;
      morbidities and interactions. Derived from the joint distribution of costs and effects,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be established and compared for the study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Military Relevance: Many combat injuries involve extremity trauma with segmental bone loss,&#xD;
      and the extent to which they can be successfully treated impacts the function and quality of&#xD;
      life of the wounded warrior. The Masquelet and the CTMC been developed as innovative,&#xD;
      biologically-sound defect reconstructive techniques to address the complexity of therapeutic&#xD;
      concerns associated with these conditions (ie, immediate restoration of limb&#xD;
      alignment/stability, early motion, weight bearing). The proposed trial aims to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of these techniques to identify the one that can be instantly adopted and applied by&#xD;
      military surgeons.&#xD;

    <description>The Masquelet defect reconstruction is a two-stage technique for the treatment of large segmental bone defects that involves the induction of a biomembrane about a poly(methylmethacrylate)(PMMA) cement spacer within the defect and, following cement removal, autogenous bone grafting (harvested using Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator) or allogeneic bone graft is used to pack the defect while preserving the biomembrane. The typical time interval between the two stages is 6-8 weeks. The biomembrane not only assists in retaining the bone graft, but serves as a rich source of vascular supply and growth factors which constitute an excellent biological milieu for the graft to consolidate and heal the defect.</description>

          <title>Masquelet Defect Reconstruction</title>
          <description>The Masquelet defect reconstruction is a two-stage technique for the treatment of large segmental bone defects that involves the induction of a biomembrane using a poly(methylmethacrylate)(PMMA) cement spacer followed by cement removal and bone grafting of the defect while preserving the biomembrane. The biomembrane not only assists in retaining the bone graft, but serves as a rich source of vascular supply and growth factors which constitute an excellent biological milieu for the graft to consolidate and heal the defect.&#xD;
The first stage of the Masquelet defect reconstruction involves creating a biomembrane with a PMMA spacer; whereas the second stage performed 6-8 weeks later involves the spacer removal and packing the defect enclosed with the biomembrane with autogenous (RIA) or allogeneic bone graft. The biomembrane serves as a biological enclosure for the graft, provides vascular supply and growth factors, thereby creating an excellent milieu for the graft to consolidate.</description>

          <title>Titanium Cage Reconstruction</title>
          <description>The cylindrical titanium mesh cage technique is a single-stage surgical procedure that immediately restores limb anatomy and alignment, and provides limb stability sufficient enough for early, unrestricted mobilization while permitting bone and soft tissue healing. It involves the implantation of a fenestrated cylindrical titanium mesh cage packed with autogenous bone graft (harvested using Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator) or with allogeneic bone graft.&#xD;
After aseptic defect and soft tissue bed is achieved, the titanium cage reconstruction procedure involves the implantation of a fenestrated cylindrical titanium cage packed with simultaneously harvested autogenous bone graft using RIA or with allogeneic bone graft. The decision about the graft option is left for the treating physician, following the discussion with the patient. The cage provide a biomechanical enclosure for the graft, allows the graft to be loaded, and, thereby consolidate and heal the defect.</description>

            <title>Masquelet Defect Reconstruction</title>
            <description>The Masquelet defect reconstruction is a two-stage technique for the treatment of large segmental bone defects that involves the induction of a biomembrane using a poly(methylmethacrylate)(PMMA) cement spacer followed by cement removal and bone grafting of the defect while preserving the biomembrane. The biomembrane not only assists in retaining the bone graft, but serves as a rich source of vascular supply and growth factors which constitute an excellent biological milieu for the graft to consolidate and heal the defect.&#xD;
The first stage of the Masquelet defect reconstruction involves creating a biomembrane with a PMMA spacer; whereas the second stage performed 6-8 weeks later involves the spacer removal and packing the defect enclosed with the biomembrane with autogenous (RIA) or allogeneic bone graft. The biomembrane serves as a biological enclosure for the graft, provides vascular supply and growth factors, thereby creating an excellent milieu for the graft to consolidate.</description>

            <title>Titanium Cage Reconstruction</title>
            <description>The cylindrical titanium mesh cage technique is a single-stage surgical procedure that immediately restores limb anatomy and alignment, and provides limb stability sufficient enough for early, unrestricted mobilization while permitting bone and soft tissue healing. It involves the implantation of a fenestrated cylindrical titanium mesh cage packed with autogenous bone graft (harvested using Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator) or with allogeneic bone graft.&#xD;
After aseptic defect and soft tissue bed is achieved, the titanium cage reconstruction procedure involves the implantation of a fenestrated cylindrical titanium cage packed with simultaneously harvested autogenous bone graft using RIA or with allogeneic bone graft. The decision about the graft option is left for the treating physician, following the discussion with the patient. The cage provides a biomechanical enclosure for the graft, allows the graft to be loaded, and, thereby consolidate and heal the defect.</description>

        <description>Among patients who completed the trial for both the Masquelet and Cage arms, SF-36 demonstrated an overall progressive improvement in the score comportment, such as in Physical function (PF); Mental health (MH); Social function (SC); Bodily pain (BP); Change in health (CH); Vitality (VT); Role limitation - physical (RLP); Role limitation - mental (RLM); Health perception (HP). The most apparent improvements were observed in the Physical function (PF); Mental health (MH); Social function (SC); Bodily pain (BP); Change in health (CH); Vitality (VT) and Health perception (HP). No statistical difference were noted in overall SF-36 scores between the trail arms.</description>

        <description>An improvement in mean Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) calculated from the subjective pain questionnaire throughout the trial followup as a result of bone defect treatment for patients in the Masquelet Arm versus the Cage Arm. QALY values ranged from 0 to 1 referring to death and perfect health, respectively. There was apparent improvement in QALY at 6 month and 12 month post treatment for both trial arm patients compared to the preperative QALY scores. No statistically significant difference at any time point of the followup between the trial arms were noted.</description>

          <title>Masquelet Defect Reconstruction</title>
          <description>The Masquelet defect reconstruction is a two-stage technique for the treatment of large segmental bone defects that involves the induction of a biomembrane about a poly(methylmethacrylate)(PMMA) cement spacer within the defect and, following cement removal, autogenous bone grafting (harvested using Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator) or allogeneic bone graft is used to pack the defect while preserving the biomembrane. The typical time interval between the two stages is 6-8 weeks. The biomembrane not only assists in retaining the bone graft, but serves as a rich source of vascular supply and growth factors which constitute an excellent biological milieu for the graft to consolidate and heal the defect.</description>

          <title>Titanium Cage Reconstruction</title>
          <description>The cylindrical titanium mesh cage technique is a single-stage surgical procedure that immediately restores limb anatomy and alignment, and provides limb stability sufficient enough for early, unrestricted mobilization while permitting bone and soft tissue healing. It involves the implantation of a fenestrated cylindrical titanium mesh cage packed with autogenous bone graft (harvested using Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator) or with allogeneic bone graft.</description>
