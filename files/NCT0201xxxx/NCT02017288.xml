  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cancer of the mouth and throat is one of the most common cancers in Taiwan. This cancer&#xD;
      develops over several years, beginning as white or red patches in the mouth or throat that&#xD;
      become growths. It can also cause a condition that leads to rigidity of the cheeks. The&#xD;
      growths can be identified when a doctor looks into a person s mouth. It is currently not&#xD;
      clear why some people with abnormal growths progress to cancer while others do not.&#xD;
      Researchers want to better understand why some patients with early abnormal growths get late&#xD;
      abnormal growths. They also want to understand why some people get abnormal growths again,&#xD;
      even after they receive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand why some people with precancerous lesions in their mouth develop cancer while&#xD;
      others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 21 years and older, some with abnormal growths in the mouth, some without any, and&#xD;
      some with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit a hospital in Taiwan 2 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will answer questions about their health, lifestyle,&#xD;
           and family medical history. A doctor will examine the participant s mouth and take a&#xD;
           small piece of any growth they see. They will do this with a brush. They will also&#xD;
           photograph the participant s mouth. Participants will also give blood and saliva&#xD;
           samples, plus a small sample of a mouth rinse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are diagnosed with a late abnormal growth that is not cancer will&#xD;
           return for a second visit. They will answer the same questions and undergo the same&#xD;
           procedures as at the first study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oral cancers are ideal candidates for screening, early detection, and secondary prevention&#xD;
      given the amenability for visual inspection and specimen collection and the availability of&#xD;
      recognized precursors. Yet, there are currently no guidelines for screening, treatment, or&#xD;
      follow-up of patients with oral cancer precursors, in part, owing to the current gaps in&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the natural history of precursor lesions. We propose to conduct a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of patients with oral cancer precursors to address these knowledge&#xD;
      gaps and to investigate novel etiologic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for the cohort study, we recently conducted a pilot study in Taiwan, a country&#xD;
      with high oral cancer incidence. This pilot was aimed to streamline field operations and&#xD;
      collect preliminary data to aid in the design of the cohort study. As detailed in our&#xD;
      concept, we successfully accomplished all of the goals of our pilot study, including&#xD;
      successful recruitment and retention of patients as well as the collection of critical&#xD;
      preliminary data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these efforts, we are seeking approval to conduct a prospective cohort study of 3000&#xD;
      patients with precursors to investigate the natural history of histologically-defined oral&#xD;
      cancer precursor lesions and evaluate epidemiologic/ molecular predictors for progression.&#xD;
      After completion of the recruitment period, we plan to recruit an additional 500 patients&#xD;
      with clinically-defined precancerous lesions for passive follow-up. The prospective component&#xD;
      will be complemented by cross-sectional comparisons of epidemiologic/molecular factors across&#xD;
      750 controls, 3500 precursors, and 750 cancers.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        We plan to recruit all patients (controls, precursors, and invasive cancers) at the&#xD;
        aforementioned two hospitals. Doctors at these hospitals conduct routine visual and tactile&#xD;
        examination as part of Taiwan s national oral cancer screening program. For this screening&#xD;
        program, all individuals aged 21 years or older who chew betel-quid or smoke are screened&#xD;
        through visual inspection for the presence of precursor lesions or cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants younger than 21 years and individuals with a history of head and neck cancer&#xD;
        will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
