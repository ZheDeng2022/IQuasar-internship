    <textblock>
      The transient global amnesia, in which the memory disorder is massive, transient and pure,&#xD;
      offers a unique model for exploring episodic memory. Topographic MRI can reveal a focal and&#xD;
      selective lesion located on the CA1 region of the hippocampus better visible between 48h and&#xD;
      72h after onset of the episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is therefore a real dissociation between structural lesions witch are minimal or&#xD;
      non-existent and the massive memory disorder. This suggests that functional impairment goes&#xD;
      far beyond the structural damage in this condition. To our knowledge, no study has been&#xD;
      performed to identify this functional impairment using resting state fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigators wish to study the neural networks involved in memory impairment during&#xD;
      the acute phase of transient global amnesia using resting state imaging. This technique&#xD;
      appears to be modern and adapted to these patients population. Investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      despite limited structural lesions, a large functional network is impaired compared to that&#xD;
      observed in a group of healthy subjects. investigators believe that the alteration of the&#xD;
      functional network will explain the depth of memory impairment observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study will be to identify functional impairment in the patient group vs.&#xD;
      control group during the acute phase of transient global amnesia (TGA) using resting state&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients potentially eligible will be informed during their arrival to the emergency unit. If&#xD;
      the patient is eligible and would like to participate, information will be given. For the&#xD;
      patients willing to participate, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. Two&#xD;
      imaging exams (topographic MRI and resting state fMRI) and neuropsychological assessment will&#xD;
      be performed during three visits.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transient global amnesia is a transient, massive and pure memory disorder. Its&#xD;
      pathophysiology is poorly known, but the disease process involves the Papez circuitry, and&#xD;
      more specifically the medial part of the temporal lobes (hippocampi). It involves 3-8 per&#xD;
      100,000 people per year. The age of patients affected is between 50 and 70 years. Structural&#xD;
      MRI can confirm the diagnosis by revealing a focal and selective lesion located on the CA1&#xD;
      region of the hippocampus better observed between 48h and 72h after onset of the episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to identify neuronal functional impairment in a group of&#xD;
      patients vs. a group of healthy subjects during the acute phase of transient global amnesia&#xD;
      (TGA) using resting state fMRI imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Show correlations between functional activity observed in resting state fMRI at the&#xD;
           acute phase and cognitive performance in the patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the evolution of functional impairment in resting state fMRI between the acute&#xD;
           phase (visit 1) and post-acute phases (visit 2 and 3) in the patient group compared to&#xD;
           the control group subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocentric, pilot, prospective, controlled study including consecutive patients admitted to&#xD;
      the emergency department of the CHU of Toulouse for transient global amnesia. investigators&#xD;
      will compare two independent groups: patients and controls We expect three months between the&#xD;
      signing of consent and the end of the study. The total duration of the study will not exceed&#xD;
      27 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm number or label and arm type: This study is exploratory. investigators will compare two&#xD;
      independent groups: patients and controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent each patient TGA will receive a neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessment, a topographic MRI and an evaluation in resting state fMRI during three successive&#xD;
      visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the acute phase within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's difficult to estimate the number of subjects required to show a difference in resting&#xD;
      state between the two groups during the acute phase of TGA. No study of that type in the&#xD;
      literature is available to estimate the sample size to be recruited. In this pilot study we&#xD;
      will recruit 22 subjects in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transient global amnesia is a model for exploring memory because this disorder is&#xD;
      massive, pure and temporary. Better understand the Neural Network substrates underlying this&#xD;
      alteration could help to better understand memory disorders in other diseases (Korsakoff&#xD;
      syndrome, thalamic stroke, dissociative amnesia, Alzheimer's disease). Such discovery could&#xD;
      lead to clinical trials of functional brain stimulation as recently developed in other&#xD;
      neurological disorders in which functional impairment has been shown. (TMS, TDCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPM8 software will be used to generate activation map using fMRI images. The obtained&#xD;
      maps will be compared between groups using t test imbedded in the same software. Correlation&#xD;
      maps between cognitive performance and activation will be also calculated. Intra group&#xD;
      comparison across time will then be assessed.&#xD;
