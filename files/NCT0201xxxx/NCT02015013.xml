  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare syndrome defined by consistently low CD4 T&#xD;
      cell counts (&lt;300/mm3) without evidence of HIV infection or other known immunodeficiency.&#xD;
      Patients with ICL are at risk for opportunistic infections typically associated with HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      such as disseminated cryptococcal infection and severe human papillomavirus-related&#xD;
      dysplasia. More than 20 years since the description of ICL, its etiology, pathogenesis, and&#xD;
      management remain unclear. In this study we propose to administer the combination of&#xD;
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor to ICL patients and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with the objective of harvesting mobilized CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells&#xD;
      (HPCs) by apheresis for transfer into immunocompromised mice and for study with in vitro&#xD;
      assays. The mice studies would serve to investigate thymic development, survival, and&#xD;
      trafficking of the mobilized human cells within murine lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPCs are used for various therapies and there is an increasing use of agents that stimulate&#xD;
      the bone marrow to produce progenitor cells and move them into the bloodstream where they may&#xD;
      be harvested by apheresis. Not all patients respond to GCSF with vigorous HPC mobilization.&#xD;
      The binding of chemokine receptor CXCR4 to stromal cell derived factor (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is&#xD;
      an important interaction between a hematopoietic progenitor cell and its marrow environment.&#xD;
      Plerixafor is a CXCR4 inhibitor which blocks binding to SDF-1 resulting in the release of&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) into peripheral circulation. In pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      studies of plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF compared to G-CSF and placebo, a two-fold&#xD;
      increase in CD34+ cell count was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the important role CXCR4 plays in immune cell trafficking and its potential role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of ICL, we propose as a secondary objective to assess peripheral CD4 T cell&#xD;
      and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers and functions in ICL patients compared to&#xD;
      controls following G-CSF and plerixafor administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be screened within 12 weeks prior to the study period. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive G-CSF for 5 days with hospitalization on Day 4 for plerixafor&#xD;
      injection followed by apheresis on Day 5. Participants will return for examinations and blood&#xD;
      draws on Days 8 and 12.&#xD;
