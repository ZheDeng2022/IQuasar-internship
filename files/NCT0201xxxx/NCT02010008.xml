  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Â¡Fortaleza Latina! is a multi-level randomized trial to increase participation in mammography&#xD;
      screening among Latinas who seek care at a community health center in Western Washington.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with the partnering community health center, we have obtained lists of women&#xD;
      patients aged 42 to 74 years old who had not had a mammogram in the last two years and&#xD;
      resided within defined radii of the four clinics. Baseline and one year follow-up surveys&#xD;
      will be obtained by in person home interview. Participants are randomized within clinic to&#xD;
      intervention or comparison group. The intervention consist of two motivational interviewing&#xD;
      sessions, one in person in the home, and one telephone follow-up. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that a higher proportion of participants in the motivational interviewing arm will obtain a&#xD;
      screening mammogram within the study period than those in the comparison arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Hispanic women in the United States (US) and&#xD;
      five-year survival from breast cancer is lower in Hispanic than in non-Hispanic White women.&#xD;
      This reduced survival has a number of potential causes, but differential screening rates may&#xD;
      be a partial explanation, since Hispanic women have lower breast cancer screening rates than&#xD;
      non-Hispanic White women. The overall purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a&#xD;
      culturally-appropriate intervention aimed at increasing screening mammography rates in a&#xD;
      clinic-based sample of predominantly Mexican American women in Western Washington.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment goal of the Fortaleza Latina study is approximately 500 Latina women aged&#xD;
      40-74 who have had a clinic visit within the past 5 years, but no recent mammogram, from the&#xD;
      four selected Community Health Center clinics. After providing informed consent and&#xD;
      completing a baseline assessment, eligible women are randomly assigned to intervention or&#xD;
      comparison group, within clinic. The individual-level intervention implements motivational&#xD;
      interviewing (MI) in two participant encounters. MI is a direct counseling style, led by a&#xD;
      promotora (lay health advisor), that elicits behavior change by helping participants explore&#xD;
      and resolve ambivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 2194 women contacted by field interviewers, a total of 710 surveys have been&#xD;
      completed; of these, 542 were eligible and have been randomized and enrolled into the&#xD;
      Fortaleza Latina study (279 intervention, 263 usual care).&#xD;
