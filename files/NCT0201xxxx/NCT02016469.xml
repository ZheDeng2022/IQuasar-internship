    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of pectin and fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation on patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that patients who take pectin can promote the migration of probiotics in intestine&#xD;
      engraftment, reduce pathogenic agents'adhesion to intestinal mucosa, cut down the&#xD;
      inflammation, and to maintain intestinal flora diversity and steady state in a long time.&#xD;

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing disease, including ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Although the etiology of IBD is unknown, but more and more&#xD;
      evidence show that the inappropriate immune response to intestinal commensal bacteria leading&#xD;
      to dysbiosis, and pathogens further act to the mucosal lymphoid tissue, causing IBD. Has yet&#xD;
      not to determine the specific one or more pathogens as the cause of IBD,but literatures&#xD;
      confirm the changes of diversity of the intestine flora.Based on the current awareness of&#xD;
      changes in the intestinal flora in IBD, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) proposed in&#xD;
      recent years to rebuild the intestine flora balance to achieve therapeutic purposes. But&#xD;
      fecal bacteria of patients can not consistent with donor's for a long term after&#xD;
      transplantation and therefore it is not an ideal way for disease control. Maintaining the&#xD;
      diversity of flora in a long time so that well controlled the disease become the breakthrough&#xD;
      of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pectin is a soluble dietary fiber (DF), produced by the gut flora after a series of&#xD;
      fermentation with many metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which supply the&#xD;
      energy for epithelial cells, regulate intestinal PH and intestinal motility and join effort&#xD;
      in immune regulation with intestinal lymphoid tissue. Previous studies showed that:&#xD;
      water-soluble dietary fiber with the action of intestinal flora can cut the inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, prevent inflammation and induce regulatory T cells, but the type and dose of&#xD;
      dietary fiber used were different in different studies, and no studies have confirmed whether&#xD;
      dietary fiber could adjusted the flora colonization ability in patients with IBD. We conceive&#xD;
      that pectin by some mechanism to promote the migration of probiotics in intestine&#xD;
      engraftment, reduce pathogenic agents' adhesion of intestinal mucosa, cut inflammation, and&#xD;
      to maintain intestinal flora diversity and steady state in a long time, and than achieve the&#xD;
      goal of continue to ease IBD.&#xD;
