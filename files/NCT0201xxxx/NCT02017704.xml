      This research is being done to compare the effectiveness of high dose endorectal&#xD;
      brachytherapy (END-HDR) and the standard treatment option of chemoradiation with Capecitabine&#xD;
      in the treatment of cancer of the lowest part of the bowel (rectum).&#xD;

      Locally advanced rectal carcinoma continues to be a major oncologic problem in the United&#xD;
      States with approximately 40,000 new cases diagnosed in 2011. For stage II/III rectal&#xD;
      carcinoma, adjuvant chemoradiation(1-3) and total mesorectal excision (TME) (4, 5)represent&#xD;
      the major treatment advances that have increased cure rates over the past 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of TME, a landmark phase III German trial of stage II/III rectal cancer&#xD;
      patients established neoadjuvant 5FU-based chemoradiation (NCRT) as standard of care over the&#xD;
      same regimen given post-operatively(6). The preoperative arm showed superior local control&#xD;
      (6% vs. 13% p=0.006), a complete pathologic response of 8%, a higher rate of sphincter&#xD;
      preservation and less grade 3 toxicity compared to post-operative treatment. However,&#xD;
      disease-free and overall survival (76% versus 74%, respectively) were no different because of&#xD;
      the high rate of distant metastasis occurring in over 1/3 of patients (5yr DM 36 vs&#xD;
      38%,p=0.84). Importantly, those attaining a pathologic complete response had a decreased rate&#xD;
      of distant metastasis and improved disease-free survival. Drawbacks to the regimen include&#xD;
      acute grade 3 or 4 toxicity in 27% of patients, low compliance rates with postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy (27 - 50%), and an overall decline in anorectal function shown by long-term&#xD;
      studies(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the excellent locoregional control reported in TME surgical series, several trials have&#xD;
      investigated whether certain patients may be spared preoperative radiotherapy(7-9). Two large&#xD;
      randomized trials by Dutch and British investigators showed that a short preoperative course&#xD;
      of hypofractionated EBRT (25 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by TME surgery decreased&#xD;
      locoregional recurrence by 2/3 as compared to patients treated with TME surgery alone. In the&#xD;
      Dutch trial, patients with mid and distal rectal cancers were most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      radiotherapy. In these patients, preoperative radiation was shown to decrease locoregional&#xD;
      recurrence by 5-fold (10% to 2%); however, the hypofractionated preoperative EBRT regimen was&#xD;
      associated with a significant increase in acute and chronic morbidity. Indeed, the Dutch&#xD;
      study revealed that irradiated patients, when compared to surgery alone, had more perineal&#xD;
      wound healing problems after abdominoperineal resection (29% vs. 19%), worsening&#xD;
      deterioration of anal sphincter dysfunction, and more severe long-term effects related to&#xD;
      sexual functioning both in males (p=0.004) and females (p&lt;0.002)(10-12). Birgisson&#xD;
      Additionally, colleagues have reported a consistent negative impact on bowel function in&#xD;
      those patients undergoing sphincter preservation(13). In reviewing the long-term data of the&#xD;
      Swedish short course preoperative EBRT rectal cancer trial, Birgisson also reported a higher&#xD;
      incidence of secondary tumors (9.5%) in patients treated with preoperative radiation when&#xD;
      compared to patients having surgery alone (4.3%)(14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern approaches to address the risk of distant metastasis and poor compliance with adjuvant&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy (following NCRT) have incorporated newer effective chemotherapy agents&#xD;
      earlier in the treatment protocol. For example, oxaliplatin has been one of the most widely&#xD;
      studied agents as a result of its proven efficacy when combined with 5-fluorouracil and&#xD;
      leucovorin (FOLFOX) both in the metastatic and adjuvant settings for colon cancer(15).&#xD;
      Initial phase II studies with the addition of oxaliplatin to standard 5-FU based NCRT&#xD;
      appeared to show improved pathologic complete response rates compared to standard NCRT.&#xD;
      However, two phase III trials clearly show that the addition of oxaliplatin during 5FU-based&#xD;
      NCRT does not significantly improve pathologic complete response, locoregional control,&#xD;
      distant metastasis or survival but does increase acute grade 3-4 toxicity by two to&#xD;
      three-fold(16, 17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to limit toxicity from external beam radiotherapy is the use of intensity&#xD;
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT can limit radiation dose to normal rectum (above and&#xD;
      below the tumor) and surrounding organs at risk (OARs) such as bladder and sexual organs.&#xD;
      IMRT utilizes multiple beams of radiation to treat the rectal tumor plus a margin and limits&#xD;
      dose to OARs. While IMRT decreases radiation dose to normal structures, it requires an&#xD;
      additional 2-3 cm margin for microscopic extension (clinical treatment volume=CTV), set-up&#xD;
      error, and rectal motion (planning treatment volume=PTV). Furthermore, IMRT still requires&#xD;
      5-6 weeks of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy, is substantially more expensive than&#xD;
      conformal radiation, and is especially prohibitive in countries where access to technology&#xD;
      necessary for IMRT is limited (20). Based on the preliminary results of RTOG 0822 and others,&#xD;
      it still remains to be determined whether IMRT confers a statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in pCR, toxicity rates and QOL relative to standard NCRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel approach to limit radiation toxicity is the use of high dose rate endorectal&#xD;
      brachytherapy (Endo-HDR) (21). Endo-HDR involves the placement of a silicon multicatheter&#xD;
      applicator within the rectum to deliver large doses to the rectal tumor and mesorectum with&#xD;
      rapid dose fall off to the surrounding organs. An Iridium 192 high dose rate brachytherapy&#xD;
      source attached to a wire is inserted into each catheter to deliver a high dose of radiation&#xD;
      therapy the tumor. High dose rate brachytherapy has been well established in various&#xD;
      malignancies (prostate, uterine, sarcoma, head and neck) to escalate radiation dose to the&#xD;
      tumor over a short period of time while sparing normal tissue. Compared with NCRT and IMRT,&#xD;
      Endo-HDR delivers treatment internally to the tumor without having to pass through&#xD;
      surrounding normal tissue and organs. It requires smaller margins (CTV/PTV=~1 cm) on the&#xD;
      tumor since the applicator is positioned under fiducial guidance over the tumor without need&#xD;
      for a margin for organ motion allowing greater sparing of OARs (22). Furthermore, the area of&#xD;
      the rectum exposed to high dose radiotherapy is surgically removed at the time of resection&#xD;
      which further minimizes chronic toxicity. Important structures that may be spared include&#xD;
      bone marrow, small bowel, bladder, the autonomic nerves, sexual organs, anal sphincter and&#xD;
      skin. Considering that 1/3 of patients will develop metastases, limiting bone marrow toxicity&#xD;
      may contribute to better compliance with systemic treatment and allow for a better treatment&#xD;
      strategy to target systemic recurrence. Another distinct advantage of Endo-HDR is the&#xD;
      shortened treatment time (1 versus 6 weeks). Endo-HDR therefore provides a major logistic&#xD;
      advantage for patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy but who are geographically&#xD;
      distant from radiation centers, elderly, or medically infirmed.&#xD;
