  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) of orally administered PLX8394 in patients with advanced solid tumors. An additional&#xD;
      objective is to identify a Recommended Phase 2 (RP2D) for further evaluation in the Extension&#xD;
      Cohorts (Phase IIa portion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective of the Extension Cohorts (PART 2 portion) is to assess the objective&#xD;
      tumor response and the PK, PD, and safety of PLX8394 when the RP2D is used in patients with&#xD;
      advanced BRAF-mutated cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase I/IIa two-part study with a sequential dose&#xD;
      escalation part, followed by three parallel Extension cohorts (BRAF-mutated melanoma,&#xD;
      BRAF-mutated non-melanoma solid tumors, and BRAF-mutated classical hairy cell leukemia). Up&#xD;
      to approximately 42 patients may be enrolled in the dose escalation phase of the study,&#xD;
      depending on the number of cohorts required, number of patients per cohort needed, and the&#xD;
      need for replacement patients. Approximately 130 patients are planned to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      BRAF-mutated tumor Extension cohorts, with the goal of enrolling approximately 50 patients&#xD;
      with BRAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor-naïve melanoma, approximately 10-15 patients with BRAF/MEK/ERK&#xD;
      inhibitor-pretreated melanoma, approximately 50 patients with non-melanoma solid tumors, and&#xD;
      approximately 10-15 patients with hairy cell leukemia. The trial was intended to be a Phase&#xD;
      1/2 trial, but the trial never moved forward to Phase 2.&#xD;
