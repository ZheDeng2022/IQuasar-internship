      To demonstrate efficacy and safety of the Lutonix® Drug Coated Balloon for treatment of long&#xD;
      TASC II Class C and D lesions (≥ 14 cm) lesions in the SFA&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll patients presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain (Rutherford&#xD;
      Category 2-4) and TASC II Class C or D lesions ≥14 cm in length in the native femoropopliteal&#xD;
      artery. After successful pre-dilatation (1mm &lt; RVD) and spot stenting (if necessary, with&#xD;
      length minimized to mechanical defect), subjects will receive treatment with the Lutonix Drug&#xD;
      Coated Balloon (DCB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety and efficacy endpoint assessments are performed at 12 months. Clinical&#xD;
      follow-up continues through a minimum of 2 years and telephone follow-up through a minimum of&#xD;
      3 years.&#xD;
