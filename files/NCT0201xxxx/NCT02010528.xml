  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents have an important role in child's diabetes management. Many studies show that&#xD;
      parental psychological stress and family dynamics are associated with parental&#xD;
      diabetes-related distress and treatment outcomes among children and adolescents with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze diabetes distress (diabetes-related parenting burden and&#xD;
      fear of hypoglycemia), parental psychological well-being (anxiety, satisfaction with life,&#xD;
      positive and negative affect and adult attachment relationship pattern), family hardiness and&#xD;
      characteristics of children with type 1 diabetes in a sample of mothers and fathers of&#xD;
      children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes of ages up to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study it is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. greater parental fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes-related burden are associated with&#xD;
           lower family hardiness and worse psychological well-being parents and higher HbA1c&#xD;
           levels in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. mothers will report greater fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes-related burden and lower&#xD;
           psychological well-being comparing to fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. parents of children and adolescents with type 1diabetes will report greater anxiety,&#xD;
           lower psychological well-being and family hardiness comparing to parents of children&#xD;
           without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized and validated questionnaires will be used to determine: parental fear of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, diabetes-related burden, parent level of anxiety, psychological well-being,&#xD;
      adult attachment relationship pattern and family hardiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also measure parent daily involvement in child's diabetes management,&#xD;
      frequency of blood glucose monitoring and parent general satisfaction with glycemic control.&#xD;
      Objective measures such as child's HbA1c level and experience of severe hypoglycemia episode&#xD;
      will also be obtained. These measures will be correlated with other research variables.&#xD;
