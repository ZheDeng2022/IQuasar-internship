      Capecitabine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day (in the&#xD;
      morning and in the evening) for 2 weeks, followed by a 1 week break before repeating the next&#xD;
      dosage cycle. In this study, capecitabine will be prescribed as dosage of 900mg/m2, and&#xD;
      maintain for a whole year after the standard treatment in operable triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer patients. DFS is set as the primary outcome, OS and DDFS are also observed as the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis are made to see whether this metronomic therapy of&#xD;
      capecitabine ( 900mg/m2) will bring benefit to any of the iterms above.&#xD;
