      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized&#xD;
      perfluorinated gases mixed with oxygen as inhaled inert contrast agents to image the airway&#xD;
      spaces in subjects who have undergone single or double lung transplantation. This is an open&#xD;
      label study expanding on current work here at Duke. Images will be obtained using 19F MRI&#xD;
      during wash-in and washout for evaluation of ventilation efficiency.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label study in up to 10 lung transplant recipients post lung transplantation&#xD;
      whose post-transplant status is being monitored according to local standard of care. Each&#xD;
      subject will receive up to 20 liters of PFP/oxygen gas mixtures as a contrast agent to&#xD;
      visualize the airway and alveolar spaces in their lungs using 19F magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized&#xD;
      perfluorinated gases mixed with oxygen as an exogenous inert contrast agent to image the&#xD;
      airway spaces in subjects with transplanted lungs. This is an open label proof of concept&#xD;
      study expanding on work here at Duke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis and current observation is that PFx gases, when used as contrast&#xD;
      agents, provide functional images of the lung airways including important regional&#xD;
      ventilation information such as ventilation defect severity and gas trapping. We will test&#xD;
      the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective by addressing the following&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims Aim 1: Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of&#xD;
      lung ventilation performance in terms of ventilation efficiency during wash-in evaluation of&#xD;
      the 19F images of lung airspaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of lung ventilation performance in&#xD;
      terms of direct measures of gas trapping measured during washout of the perfluorinated gas&#xD;
      mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the work proposed in the aims is expected to demonstrate a non-invasive novel&#xD;
      quantitative approach for evaluation of regional lung function in subjects with lung&#xD;
      transplants that would allow repeated evaluation of lung function post-transplant to monitor&#xD;
      for chronic allograft rejection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for&#xD;
             enrollment into the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be â‰¥ 18 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post single or double lung transplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other trial&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to undergo a 3.0-Tesla MRI exam of the lungs and chest because of&#xD;
             contraindications (e.g. metal in the eye, claustrophobia);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to receive gas mixture by breathing because of contraindications;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial with a study drug that may impact lung function in&#xD;
             the past 14 days; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or may&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.&#xD;

          -  Female; women at risk of pregnancy are required to have a confirmed negative blood&#xD;
             pregnancy test at Screening if of childbearing potential prior to the MRI scan.&#xD;
