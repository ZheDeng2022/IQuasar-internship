  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the dose level of live, wild-type A/California/ H1N1&#xD;
      2009 virus that has an appropriate safety and illness/infectivity profile to be used as an&#xD;
      influenza virus, challenge strain in future intervention studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Illness parameters were collected by subject symptom scores as well as by physical&#xD;
      examination. Virus parameters were measured by PCR and cell culture assay (performed by&#xD;
      VisMederi srl).&#xD;
