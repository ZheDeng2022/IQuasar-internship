  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerves are the rate limiting factor that control muscle function. However, it is unknown if a&#xD;
      nutritional supplement can change the nerve-muscle interaction, and therefore alter human&#xD;
      performance. This study will be the first to examine the effects of omega-3 supplementation&#xD;
      on neuromuscular function in trained individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will come to the lab for 3 sessions, one for familiarization and two for&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization - At this time, anthropometric measurements including height, weight, BMI&#xD;
      (body mass index) and body composition will be determined. Participants will be familiarized&#xD;
      with the interpolated twitch technique and performing a maximal voluntary contraction of the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle. Next, Participant's 10 repetition maximum squat weight will be established&#xD;
      by starting at a participant selected weight and gradually increasing until only 10 squat&#xD;
      repetitions can be completed. A VO2max (maximum oxygen consumption) test will be performed on&#xD;
      a cycle ergometer using standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On testing sessions 1 and 2 the following neuromuscular and performance measures will be&#xD;
      evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quadriceps muscle voluntary activation will be assessed using the interpolated twitch&#xD;
           technique and doublet twitch technique. Participants will be seated and instructed to&#xD;
           perform three 5 second maximal voluntary isometric contractions at least 1 minute apart&#xD;
           - participant's ankle will be restrained by a padded cuff attached to a load cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the second maximal isometric contraction at 3 seconds into the contraction, a square&#xD;
           wave superimposed stimulus will be delivered for 1 milliseconds to the femoral nerve&#xD;
           from a monopolar touch-proof cathode electrode secured in the femoral triangle. 2, 7 and&#xD;
           12 seconds after the contraction a resting twitch will be delivered for comparison of&#xD;
           muscle force.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the third maximal isometric contraction, at 3 seconds into the contraction, two 1&#xD;
           millisecond square wave superimposed stimuli at 100 Hz will be delivered 10 milliseconds&#xD;
           apart. 2 seconds after the contraction the same stimulus will be applied. At 7 seconds&#xD;
           after, two stimuli will be delivered 100 milliseconds at 10 Hz apart and 12 seconds&#xD;
           after a single stimulus will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The percutaneous electrical stimulation will be delivered from a Biopac stimulator&#xD;
           (BSLSTMA, Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, California) with a maximum voltage of 400 V.&#xD;
           During familiarization, participants will receive several submaximal stimulations for&#xD;
           acclimatization before the current intensity is gradually increased until peak twitch&#xD;
           torque and muscle action potential amplitude is reached. A stimulus of 1.2 times the&#xD;
           current required to elicit peak twitch torque and action potential amplitude will be&#xD;
           used to ensure maximal activation. The interpolated twitch technique will be used to&#xD;
           examine the difference in muscle activation during maximal contraction and a&#xD;
           superimposed stimulation. Voluntary activation will be calculated using the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Voluntary activation (%) = (1- superimposed twitch / twitch evoked at rest) x 100&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surface self-adhesive silver chloride electrodes will be placed over the belly of the&#xD;
           vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and biceps femoris muscles to measure muscle&#xD;
           electrical activity (electromyography) during maximal voluntary contractions as&#xD;
           previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vertical jump - Quadriceps power will be assessed using the vertical jump test on a&#xD;
           force plate (AMTI, Watertown, Massachusetts, USA). Participants will complete two&#xD;
           attempts to jump as high as possible from crouched and two attempts using the counter&#xD;
           jump technique (participants can start from standing, bend the knees and then jump).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Push-up - Upper body strength endurance will be examined by having the participant&#xD;
           complete as many push-ups as possible in one-minute. Participants will be given&#xD;
           one-minute rest before being asked to complete as many push-ups as possible in a minute.&#xD;
           A piece of soft foam will be attached to the floor to provide participants feedback as&#xD;
           to how low the must go when performing each push-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 10RM (10 repetition maximum) squat - After completing an optional 2 to 4 repetitions of&#xD;
           75% of the their 10RM weight as determined during baseline data collection, participants&#xD;
           will complete as many repetitions as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Wingate test - Participants will be fitted to a cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport V2.0,&#xD;
           Lode, Groningen, The Netherlands). They will then cycle against a fixed resistance of&#xD;
           0.075kg / kg body mass for 30 seconds using their maximum effort. Verbal encouragement&#xD;
           will be provided to the participant to help produce their maximum effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cycling time trial - Participants will complete a 10km time trial on a cycle ergometer&#xD;
           (Excalibur Sport V2.0, Lode, Groningen, The Netherlands). Participants' inspired and&#xD;
           expired gasses will be measured using a metabolic cart (Cortex, Leipzig, Germany). Gas&#xD;
           variables and cycling power output will be measured using the supplied software. This&#xD;
           change in protocol does not alter the risk to participants as their level of&#xD;
           conditioning is quite high and similar levels of exertion would be required in their&#xD;
           daily training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation - In between sessions 1 and 2, there is a 21 day break for which participants&#xD;
      will be computer randomized to either the omega-3 supplementation or an olive oil placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will take a 2.5 mL serving of seal oil (2500 mg n-3, 255 mg DHA (docosahexaenoic&#xD;
      acid ) and 187.5 mg EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) with 500 IU vitamin D3 and 1000 IU vitamin A)&#xD;
      (Auum Inc., Timmons, On) or 2.5 mL olive oil (Bertolli, Mississauga, Ont) with 500 IU vitamin&#xD;
      D and 1000 IU vitamin A added twice daily with breakfast and dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All supplementation amounts are within the amounts specified by Health Canada Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 - After the 21 day supplementation period, participants will return to the lab for&#xD;
      a second evaluatory session using identical protocols to session 1.&#xD;
