      The purpose of the present study is the clinical assessment of the efficacy of preincisional&#xD;
      peritonsillar infiltration of dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain relief in children&#xD;
      undergoing adenotonsillectomy.&#xD;

      Background:Tonsillectomy is a common and painful procedure in children, often performed on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis. Tonsillectomy is often associated with intraoperative bleeding and&#xD;
      postoperative severe pain. Different methods such as drugs (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory&#xD;
      drugs , opioids, corticosteroids ), adjustment of surgical technique and peroperative local&#xD;
      anaesthetic infiltration have been used to reduce pain. It is known that pain after&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy or analgesic usage may lead to unwanted effects. For example, nonsteroidal&#xD;
      antiinflammatory drugs may interfere with bleeding and opioids may cause respiratory&#xD;
      depression, sedation or nausea and vomiting. There are some reported complications seen&#xD;
      infiltrations of local anaesthetics into tonsillar and adenoid beds. No studies have assessed&#xD;
      the effects of peritonsillar dexmedetomidine infiltration. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally&#xD;
      acting sympatholytic agent that has intrinsic effect of regional anesthesia with amid&#xD;
      anesthetic.Because of its analgesic and sedating activity, dexmedetomidine has been used&#xD;
      previously as an nasal premedication in patients undergoing tonsillectomy, but its use, as a&#xD;
      peritonsillar infiltration has not been evaluated. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective&#xD;
      alfa-2 adrenoreceptor agonist recently introduced to anesthesia practice producing&#xD;
      dose-depended sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia (involving spinal and supraspinal sites),&#xD;
      without respiratory depression. Also Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists have peripheral analgesic&#xD;
      effects. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the effects of preincisional,&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 2µg/kg peritonsillar infiltration by peritonsillar normal saline grup on&#xD;
      intraoperative bleeding and hemodynamics, postoperative recovery including pain, sedation,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy, and the recording of&#xD;
      any adverse effects that might develop during the 24-h study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Seventy patient were randomized into two groups: group S peritonsillar 2ml normal&#xD;
      saline (1 ml per tonsil), group D 2mikro gram/kg dexmedetomidine in 2 ml normal saline (1 ml&#xD;
      per tonsil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After institutional Ethics Committee approval and parents written consent, 70 children aged&#xD;
      3-9 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists 1-2 status, scheduled for adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      were enrolled in this randomized, prospective, triple-blind clinical study. Children with&#xD;
      systemic disease, metabolic and endocrin disorders, growth developmental and motor-mental&#xD;
      retardation, those who had a history of allergy to any of the study drugs, peritonsillar&#xD;
      abscess, hypertension, psychiatric and epileptic disorders, chronic pain syndrome, and those&#xD;
      who received analgesics within 24 h prior to surgery were excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children were unpremedicated. Anaesthesia was induced with sevoflurane 8% and nitrous&#xD;
      oxide 70% in oxygen or intravenous induction with propofol (2,5-3 mg/kg). After induction&#xD;
      rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg was administered for muscle relaxation and fentanyl 1 µg/kg before&#xD;
      tracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-3% and nitrous oxide 30%&#xD;
      in oxygen. After intubation children were randomized into two groups:Group D 2µg/kg&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine in 2 ml normal saline (1 ml per tonsil), Group S peritonsillar 2ml normal&#xD;
      saline (1 ml per tonsil) via peritonsillar infiltration. For the infiltration, all injections&#xD;
      were performed through the tonsillar capsule and anterior plica. After the infiltration, a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 min was allowed for the onset of action of dexmedetomidine before&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy. Adenotonsillectomy was performed with snare technic by the same surgeon&#xD;
      in all cases. Heart rate, arterial pressure and oxygen saturations (SpO2) were recorded at 10&#xD;
      min interval during operation.All patients received metoclopropamide 0,2 mg/kg i.v. before&#xD;
      end of the surgery. After extubation the patients were taken to the postanesthesia care unit&#xD;
      where an anesthetist and nurses who were unaware of the study drug observed the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Hannallah pain scale (observational pain scores-OPS), nausea, vomiting, bleeding,&#xD;
      rescue analgesia, sedation and Aldrete scores were recorded on arrival in the postanesthesia&#xD;
      care unit, at 15th, 30th, 60th, 90th and 120th min. Patient with OPS scores &gt;4, for a patient&#xD;
      request for pain medication, received 1mg/kg Tramadol drop as supplementary analgesia. The&#xD;
      first analgesic requirement time recorded. Children vomiting twice or more in PACU received&#xD;
      additional antiemetic drug (metoclopropamide 0,2 mg/kg i.v.). Agitation was measured with&#xD;
      Pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale. Patients with an Aldrete score of 9 were&#xD;
      transferred to the postoperative surgical ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding and sedation were assessed in the postoperative surgical&#xD;
      ward at0,2,4,6h follow-up by the nurses who were trained fort he use of scores involved.&#xD;
      Analgesic requirement were recorded. Pain was measured at rest and with swallowing. All&#xD;
      patients were discharged at the and of the day and stayed home at night. Before the&#xD;
      discharge, parents were given a prescription for acetaminophen (15 mg/kg oral dose) to be&#xD;
      given when needs to analgesia. Postoperative pain during the first 24 h was assessed using a&#xD;
      four-point scale: 0=no pain, 1=mild pain, 2=moderate pain, 3=severe pain by questioning their&#xD;
      parents. Patients were interviewed on the day after surgery to asses the postoperative pain,&#xD;
      vomiting, bleeding and rescue analgesia. Family satisfaction was assessed as follows: 1=poor;&#xD;
      2=good; 3=perfect.&#xD;
