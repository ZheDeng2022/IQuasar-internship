    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in the care of mothers and newborn infants, many infants&#xD;
      (approximately 20 per 1000 live births) continue to need resuscitation at birth. A proportion&#xD;
      of these infants will have sustained significant injury through interruption of their blood&#xD;
      and oxygen supply prior to delivery (perinatal asphyxia). In 2-3 babies per 1000 this will&#xD;
      lead to brain swelling and the risk of long term brain injury called neonatal&#xD;
      hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE remains a cause of neonatal death and long term&#xD;
      disability. Early and accurate prediction of outcome would allow us to intervene during the&#xD;
      window of the first 6 hours following birth, prior to secondary reperfusion and secondary&#xD;
      brain injury. Estimating severity of injury can be difficult in newborn infants. Condition at&#xD;
      birth does not predict neonatal, or longer term outcome. Biomarkers which could be measured&#xD;
      at the time of birth and analysed at the bedside would offer these infants the best chance of&#xD;
      timely and effective intervention. Through the BIHIVE study we have identified a number of&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers in hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. These markers are present in&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood and have been identified through proteomic and metabolomic analysis of a&#xD;
      stored biobank of samples from a recruited cohort of infants with perinatal asphyxia and&#xD;
      hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. We now wish to validate these biomarkers in an additional&#xD;
      cohort, and will continue to explore new biomarkers in our stored biobank of umbilical cord&#xD;
      samples. In addition we wish to assess our ability to predict neurodevelopmental and&#xD;
      behavioural outcome in these infants. In this way we will determine the most robust&#xD;
      biochemical and clinical markers for the prediction of early and medium term outcome in HIE.&#xD;
      This study will establish the evidence base and validation of these biomarkers to the point&#xD;
      where they can be developed into a bedside diagnostic algorithm which can be used in the&#xD;
      labour ward to immediately identify those infants at risk of HIE in time to prevent secondary&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;

      Background and current knowledge in the area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal asphyxia is one of the commonest causes of neonatal death and long term disability,&#xD;
      occurring in 20 per 1000 live births. Of these, approximately 2-3 per 1000 will go on to&#xD;
      develop hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) (1). In Ireland and the UK HIE is the third&#xD;
      commonest cause of neonatal mortality, accounting for 9% of all deaths, and 21% of term&#xD;
      deaths, while globally it is estimated to cause over 1 million neonatal deaths each year. For&#xD;
      the survivors there is significant secondary morbidity associated, including cerebral palsy&#xD;
      (15%), severe cognitive delay (11%), seizure disorders (8%), sensori-neural deafness (7%),&#xD;
      and visual loss (3%)(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIE is an evolving process, which can be simplified into two insults. The initial insult is&#xD;
      significant cerebral hypoxia and/or ischaemia which is followed by energy depletion, from&#xD;
      anaerobic metabolism leading to the accumulation of lactate, and loss of cellular integrity.&#xD;
      This sets in motion a cascade of events with the resultant formation of free radicals,&#xD;
      proteases and caspases leading to cell damage and apoptosis, the secondary insult(3). The&#xD;
      secondary energy failure has been shown to occur between 6-48 hours after the initial insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently no therapeutic intervention which could reduce the associated morbidity or&#xD;
      mortality existed. However the recent publications of several international trials, and their&#xD;
      subsequent meta-analysis has shown that early induced hypothermia is beneficial in HIE,&#xD;
      improving survival and reducing neurological disability (4-5). Induced hypothermia has now&#xD;
      become a standard of care in moderate/severe HIE. However to be effective it must be&#xD;
      commenced within 6 hours of delivery, before the secondary energy failure occurs. In this&#xD;
      narrow window of time the population who would benefit from treatment must be identified,&#xD;
      resuscitated, stabilised and cooled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately the ability to recognise and diagnose those who would benefit from therapy is&#xD;
      not always possible within this time period. We have shown that the current standard methods&#xD;
      to identify those at risk of HIE such as acid-base balance, lactate and Apgar score and&#xD;
      initial neurological assessment are unreliable (6). Neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) is&#xD;
      useful for the grading of encephalopathy and is an excellent predictor of long term outcome.&#xD;
      In particular its evolution over the first 24 hours following delivery strongly correlates&#xD;
      with outcome (7). However it requires a highly specialised skill set that is rarely available&#xD;
      to the neonatologist in the acute setting. Amplitude integrated EEG is more widely used by&#xD;
      clinicians, but its interpretation is user dependent, and the majority of neonatologists&#xD;
      report they are not confident in their own interpretive ability (8). The need for early and&#xD;
      reliable prediction of outcome in HIE has never been greater. A quick, cheap, reproducible,&#xD;
      non-user dependent method for quantifying severity of HIE and likely prognosis is an urgent&#xD;
      need. Many biochemical and haematological markers have been proposed in perinatal asphyxia,&#xD;
      but none have led to clinical advances, or commercially viable bedside tests (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 2 years, here in the Cork University Maternity Hospital, through the BIHIVE&#xD;
      study (Biomarkers in Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy study) we have identified potential&#xD;
      biochemical markers in umbilical cord blood which can accurately identify those infants who&#xD;
      will progress to moderate/severe encephalopathy (10,11). The BIHIVE study has adopted a&#xD;
      multifaceted approach to identifying blood-borne biomarkers in HIE through 1) targeted&#xD;
      proteomic profiling using Luminex technology 2) miRNA profiling 3) comprehensive mapping of&#xD;
      the blood metabolome using both Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to recruit a cohort of infants with clearly defined perinatal asphyxia and HIE,&#xD;
      classified using both repeated neurological assessment and multichannel EEG. At the time of&#xD;
      birth, umbilical cord blood will be drawn, processed and banked, using strict standard&#xD;
      operating procedures (SOPs) which we have developed for this purpose. These procedures will&#xD;
      ensure that all specimens will be suitable for later proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic&#xD;
      and genomic analysis. Using a systems biology approach we have studied multiple proposed&#xD;
      markers in the stored umbilical cord blood from our discovery cohort, initially focusing on&#xD;
      the proteome and metabolome. Through this work we have already identified a number of&#xD;
      biomarkers present in umbilical cord blood with the potential to predict the development of&#xD;
      moderate/severe HIE. Our early data is extremely promising. Our initial metabolomic analysis&#xD;
      has shown that we can differentiate between HIE and controls with an area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUROC) of 0.92. Further analysis will be required to identify and quantify the exact&#xD;
      metabolite peaks which produce this differentiation. We now wish to validate these findings&#xD;
      in a further cohort of infants with perinatal asphyxia and HIE, and to validate our ability&#xD;
      to predict longer term neurological outcome. Our pilot work examining microRNA changes in the&#xD;
      cord blood of infants with moderate/severe HIE is also very encouraging with significant&#xD;
      upregulation of a multiple studied miRNAs in both asphyxia and HIE. The most promising miRNAs&#xD;
      are now being quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplication and will be&#xD;
      validated in the discovery cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future cohort-BIHIVE2: To develop these markers further to the point where we have validated&#xD;
      a marker with &gt;90% sensitivity and specificity for moderate/severe HIE we will need to&#xD;
      recruit a further cohort of carefully recruited infants with high quality biobanking at birth&#xD;
      and detailed clinical phenotyping. This is the main work of this current application. We will&#xD;
      require a further cohort of 300 infants with perinatal asphyxia, of whom 60 will develop HIE&#xD;
      and 30 will develop moderate to severe HIE. We will also need to recruit 300 contemporary&#xD;
      control infants. To recruit this number of infants with perinatal asphyxia we will need to&#xD;
      study 30,000 live births. We have therefore expanded our study centres to include Karolinska&#xD;
      University Hospital, Stockholm, a large state of the art maternity hospital with 10,000 live&#xD;
      births per annum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further validation will allow us to develop an algorithm of clinical and biochemical markers&#xD;
      which will provide a sensitive and specific predictive test for moderate/severe HIE.&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental follow up of both cohorts will allow us to assess our ability to predict&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcome at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly we will examine the exact timing of biomarker alteration using a timed animal model of&#xD;
      hypoxic-ischaemic injury (HI). In clinical studies hypoxic-ischaemic injury is unpredictable&#xD;
      and its timing is often impossible to estimate. Dr Tracey Bjorkmann in Queen's University,&#xD;
      Brisbane has developed a piglet model of HI which produces HI induces seizures and a level of&#xD;
      injury equating to moderate to severe HIE (12). She has agreed to collaborate with our&#xD;
      programme and will provide piglet samples of serum taken at 0,1,2 and 12 hours following HI.&#xD;
      These samples will be invaluable in examining the progression of biomarker derangement and&#xD;
      will help us to time neonatal brain injury after delivery.&#xD;
