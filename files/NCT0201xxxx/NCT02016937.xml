    <textblock>
      In our study we aimed to compare the lactation process by mothers who were undergoing&#xD;
      elective Caesarian section under general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia&#xD;
      and normal vaginal birth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups: group G (general anesthesia for Caesarean&#xD;
      section, n=21), group S (spinal anesthesia for Caesarean section, n=21), group E (epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia for Caesarean section, n=21), group V (normal vaginal birth without anesthesia,&#xD;
      n=21). Blood sample of 3 mililiters was taken from all patients 2,5 hours before procedure&#xD;
      and oxytocin and prolactin levels in this blood samples were determined. No patient received&#xD;
      premedication. Group G (general anesthesia for Caesarean section) received preoxygenation&#xD;
      with 100% oxygen for 3-5 minutes before intubation. In order to let fetus minimally affected&#xD;
      by the anesthetic agents, induction was performed after the disinfection and covering up of&#xD;
      surgery area. Induction was performed with propofol (2 mg/ kg) and rocuronium (0,6 mg/kg).&#xD;
      After onset of neuromuscular block, patients were intubated with compression maneuver of&#xD;
      cricoid cartilage. Controlled ventilation was provided with anesthesia machine Datex Ohmeda&#xD;
      S/5 Avance with tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg, respiration frequency of 10-12 min. Anesthesia&#xD;
      was maintained with oxygen (50%) , air (50%), sevoflurane of 1 MAC. When necessary rocuronium&#xD;
      0,15 mg/kg was administered. After delivery of the newborn, fentanyl 1-1,5 mcg/ kg was&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group S (spinal anesthesia for Caesarean section) received 750-1000 mL of 0,9%&#xD;
      NaCI solution (10-15 mL/kg) as infusion in 20-30 minutes. Under strict aseptic precautions a&#xD;
      25G Quincke spinal needle was introduced into L3-L4 or L4-L5 intervertebral space in midline&#xD;
      approach in sitting posture, and, after confirming free flow of CSF, predetermined 10-11 mg&#xD;
      of drug solution (hypertonic bupivacaine 0,5%) was injected. We let the operation begin when&#xD;
      sensory and motor blockade were verified. Oxygen of 100% (3 L. min) was administered&#xD;
      throughout the operation via nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group E (epidural anesthesia for Caesarean section) received 750-1000 mL of 0,9%&#xD;
      NaCI solution (10-15 mL/kg) as infusion in 20-30 minutes. We conducted epidural anesthesia&#xD;
      with 18-gauge Tuohy needle at L3-L4 or L4-L5 epidural space by midline approach at sitting&#xD;
      position. 3 -5 minutes after injection of 3 ml lidocaine as test-dose, when the patient has&#xD;
      no sign of subarachnoid injection like prickling in lower extremities or of intravascular&#xD;
      injection like nausea, vomiting, tachicardia, tinnitus, a 20-gauge epidural catheter was&#xD;
      inserted to cephalad. We injected 10 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine via epidural catheter. We let the&#xD;
      operation begin when sensory and motor blockade were verified. Oxygen of 100% (3 L. min) was&#xD;
      administered throughout the operation via nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in all 3 groups were monitorised in the operation room with a monitor of&#xD;
      Datex-Ohmeda and electrocardiogram (ECG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SPO2) were recorded. Efedrin 5-10 mg and/or atropin 0,5 mg was administered when significant&#xD;
      hypotension and bradicardia occurred. After delivery of the newborn 30 IU of oxytocin in a&#xD;
      1000cc solution of 0,9% NaCI was infused and if patient was not hypertensive,&#xD;
      methylergonovine of 0,2 mg was administered intramuscular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group V (spontaneous vaginal birth without anesthesia) were spectated by&#xD;
      gynecologists in the Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics during the delivery. They received&#xD;
      no anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups blood samples were taken at the 24th hour after delivery and oxytocin and&#xD;
      prolactin levels were measured. Plasma of blood samples taken before and after delivery were&#xD;
      stored at a temperature of -80°C. Prolactin levels were determined with chemiluminescense&#xD;
      immunoassay technique Cobas e 601 (Roche® Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using a commercial&#xD;
      kit (Roche®). Oxytocin levels were determined with a commercial ELISA kit (Cusabio Biotech&#xD;
      CO. Ltd). By all patients onset time of lactation was recorded.&#xD;
