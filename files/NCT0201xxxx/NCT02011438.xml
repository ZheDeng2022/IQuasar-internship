  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among adolescents, SAD and depression are prevalent, highly comorbid, and can be chronic and&#xD;
      impairing. Interpersonal peer victimization (IPV) is a key stressor that contributes to both&#xD;
      social anxiety and depression in adolescents; it includes relational (e.g., social exclusion)&#xD;
      and reputational (e.g., spreading rumors) forms of peer victimization. Currently, there are&#xD;
      no preventive interventions for adolescent SAD. Also, effective preventive interventions for&#xD;
      adolescents have not yet integrated a focus on both social anxiety and depression or targeted&#xD;
      specific peer risk factors. Interventions for depression and for bullying have not addressed&#xD;
      IPV, which is less observable than overt victimization (e.g., threats, physical acts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the Peers Emotions and Relationships (PEERS/UTalk) intervention, will take an&#xD;
      integrated approach to reducing risk for SAD and depression by modifying and adapting an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention for depression, Interpersonal Psychotherapy- Adolescents Skills&#xD;
      Training (IPT-AST), that focuses on improving interpersonal skills and managing conflict. We&#xD;
      will add a) elements of anxiety-based treatments (e.g., exposures) and b) strategies for&#xD;
      handling challenging peer experiences. PEERS/UTalk will have a positive focus and will target&#xD;
      adolescents who report elevated symptoms of social anxiety and/or depression and high levels&#xD;
      of IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following are the aims and hypotheses of the Pilot-Randomized Controlled Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Evaluate PEERS/UTalk. We will screen adolescents and conduct a pilot randomized trial of&#xD;
      PEERS (U Talk) versus an Education/Support (ES) condition with up to 60 &quot;high-risk&quot;&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Both PEERS/UTalk and ES conditions will demonstrate: (a) feasibility via rates&#xD;
      of participation and study completion, (b) intervention credibility via adolescents' ratings&#xD;
      of acceptability and satisfaction, and (c) high rates of clinician fidelity to the respective&#xD;
      manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Adolescents randomized to PEERS/UTalk will show improvements in primary&#xD;
      outcomes (less IPV, fewer symptoms of social anxiety and depression, improved clinician&#xD;
      ratings) relative to those in the ES condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The benefits of PEERS/UTalk over ES will be apparent on the secondary outcomes&#xD;
      of increased quality of close friendships, increased peer support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims: We will examine: (1) the durability and persistence of PEERS/UTalk&#xD;
      intervention effects versus ES on primary outcomes at 6-month follow-up and (2) potential&#xD;
      moderators of response to the PEERS/UTalk intervention, recognizing that there are power&#xD;
      limitations in doing so.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the Pilot-Randomized Controlled Trial (P-RCT) will be provided with&#xD;
      PEERS/UTalk or an Education/Support (ES) control condition, and will receive up to 3&#xD;
      individual and up to 10 group sessions of either. Clinicians will be clinical postdoctoral&#xD;
      trainee or doctoral students in clinical psychology with specialized training in&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments for youth and experience working with child populations; all&#xD;
      clinicians will receive intensive training on the PEERS/UTalk intervention prior to the&#xD;
      P-RCT. The research-specific intervention is conceptualized as a preventive intervention,&#xD;
      with the possibility of altering the length of the program as needed. The intent is to&#xD;
      develop PEERS/UTalk so that it fits within a 60-90 minute period that meets about once a&#xD;
      week, during one school semester, or could potentially be conducted as an after-school&#xD;
      &quot;club.&quot; As is typical of adolescent school-based prevention programs, the groups will be&#xD;
      co-ed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEERS/UTalk intervention will consist of the following: The first 2 sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted individually, during school, and be modeled on procedures used in Interpersonal&#xD;
      Psychotherapy - Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST), which are further modified to address&#xD;
      issues of social anxiety and of IPV. The first 2 sessions are about 45-60 minutes long; a&#xD;
      clinician meets with each adolescent to assess PV experiences and socially anxious and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, provides a framework for the group, and conducts an abbreviated&#xD;
      interpersonal inventory. The interpersonal inventory is a clinical interview in which the&#xD;
      clinician and adolescent review significant peer and other relationships looking for&#xD;
      strengths as well as problems and patterns of communication and problem-solving; we have&#xD;
      adapted this interview to incorporate IPV experiences and how they influence the adolescent's&#xD;
      feelings of social anxiety or depressive symptoms. Together the adolescent and clinician&#xD;
      identify interpersonal goals for the group. An inventory of IPV experiences that are&#xD;
      challenging for adolescents will also be obtained. The next sessions (up to 10) will be&#xD;
      group-sessions (up to 8 adolescents per group) and will incorporate key elements of IPT-AST&#xD;
      (modified to integrate strategies for social anxiety, taken from the Unified Protocol for the&#xD;
      Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Youth [UP-Y]); these treatment elements will be adapted&#xD;
      to include examples of IPV experiences and strategies for handling them. We plan to build on&#xD;
      the IPT-AST intervention model because of its focus on improving interpersonal relations and&#xD;
      enhancing social skills and supportive relationships. However, we also plan to incorporate&#xD;
      strategies from the UP-Y to help teens manage social anxiety; and for all sessions we will&#xD;
      cover both social anxiety and depressive feelings and adjust the examples, exercises, and&#xD;
      homework assignments so that they incorporate strategies for handling IPV experiences. We&#xD;
      also will review the Miami-Dade County Public Schools bullying policy so adolescents know how&#xD;
      to handle more serious events, should they arise. Specifically, the first group session will&#xD;
      educate members about the symptoms of social anxiety and depression, outline interpersonal&#xD;
      problem areas and IPV experiences, and discuss the relationship between feelings and&#xD;
      interpersonal interactions. During session 2, discussion and activities help adolescents&#xD;
      understand the impact of their words and actions on others, and the feelings that result from&#xD;
      a given interaction, including IPV experiences. In session 3, adolescents are introduced to&#xD;
      different communication and interpersonal strategies (using &quot;I feel statements&quot;, finding the&#xD;
      right time to have a conversation) and practice these skills by role-playing hypothetical&#xD;
      situations, including ones that involve IPV (e.g., social exclusion, handling an embarrassing&#xD;
      situation). In sessions 4-6, group members apply the interpersonal strategies to different&#xD;
      relationships in their lives, particularly peer relationships that are linked to IPV&#xD;
      experiences and to socially anxious and depressive symptoms. The group also discusses how&#xD;
      these techniques can help the adolescents develop new relationships. Adolescents try these&#xD;
      techniques outside of group and report back about how the interactions went. Session 7 is&#xD;
      devoted to practicing exposure to social situations that are associated with uncomfortable&#xD;
      feelings, particularly those occurring in an interpersonal context. Adolescents learn about&#xD;
      positive friendship qualities and discuss how to identify these characteristics in others. In&#xD;
      session 8, adolescents discuss peer and cyber victimization, as well as how to handle&#xD;
      challenging peer situations. During group sessions 9-10, the group reviews the strategies&#xD;
      learned and changes that have occurred in the adolescents' relationships and symptoms. Group&#xD;
      members are encouraged to continue the interpersonal work on their own.&#xD;
