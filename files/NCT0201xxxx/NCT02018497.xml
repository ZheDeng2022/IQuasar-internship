      The essential arterial hypotension and allostasis registry is a prospective, observational&#xD;
      research that has the purpose of demonstrating that essential blood pressure (BP) disorders&#xD;
      and the associated comorbidities are a result of the inappropriate allostatic response to&#xD;
      daily life stress. This required a functioning brain orchestrating the evaluation of the&#xD;
      threat and choosing the response, this is a mind-mediated phenomenon. If the response is&#xD;
      excessive it contributes to high BP, if deficient to low BP, and the BP itself will identify&#xD;
      the allostatic pattern, which in turn will play an important role in the development of the&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, consecutive patients of any age and gender that visit a cardiologist's office in&#xD;
      Medellin, Colombia, are recruited. Individuals are classified according to their arterial BP&#xD;
      and allostasis and follow them in time to see what kind of diseases develops the most&#xD;
      (including BP) in the follow up according to the categorization of the characteristic chosen&#xD;
      and after adjustment for confounder's variables. In addition, stress events with their date&#xD;
      are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of the diseases are multifactorial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical, biochemical, psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of development&#xD;
      dynamically interact to shape the health development process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A person´s health depends on their:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Biological and physiologic systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. External and internal environment (a) physical, b) internal behavioural and arousal&#xD;
           state as registered by the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Their interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allostatic mechanisms to the internal and external stressors (allostatic load) involves a&#xD;
      network composed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Functional systems; mediated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The Autonomic Nervous System&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The endocrine system&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Structural changes: whenever the internal and/or external stressors are long lasting&#xD;
           and/or strength enough, they may induce changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Epigenetic, endophenotypes, polyphenism.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Plasticity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The interaction between a) and b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The network response do not affect exclusively the BP, propitiating the development of&#xD;
      comorbidities, which may prompt strategies for prevention, recognition and ultimately,&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allostatic model defines health as a state of responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of psycho-biotype: The allostasis is the result of both: biological (allostasis)&#xD;
      and psychological (psychostasis) abilities. It is proposed that both components behave in&#xD;
      similar direction and magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune disorders may be associated with the development of cancer. High BP population has a&#xD;
      higher sympathetic and lower vagal tone, this has been associated with a decrease in the&#xD;
      immune´s system function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources and energy depletion: Terms like weathering have been used to describe how&#xD;
      exposures to different allostatic loads gradually scrape away at the protective coating that&#xD;
      keeps people healthy. It is postulated that High BP individuals have more resources and&#xD;
      energy.&#xD;

      DEFINITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE CLASSIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) is a complex physiological variable in regard to its measure,&#xD;
      behavior between BP taken in the same visit at the office and between these and ABPM,&#xD;
      chronobiology (different day time BP levels), evolution in time, meaning and classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not appropriate approach or analysis may be addressed without taking into account all the BP&#xD;
      characteristics that have demonstrated prognostic implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to arrive to the most comprehensive analysis, BP classification takes into account&#xD;
      the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Cause of BP disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Primary or Essential: Not clear causes may be identified. Multiple mechanisms may be&#xD;
      involved, obvious players and contributors, but no definitive cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Secondary: an identifiable cause is characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The sitting, supine, standing BP and/or ABPM value&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. High arterial BP (HBP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the office: the average of the two systolic or diastolic sitting, supine, standing BP&#xD;
           are considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Office Supine SBP ≥140 mm Hg and/ or DPB ≥90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Diagnosis HBP: As single criteria in the abscence of ABPM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ambulatory BP Monitoring (ABPM):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 24 hrs: SBP ≥130; DBP ≥80 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Awake (06:00-22:00): SBP ≥135; DBP ≥85 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Night (22:00-06:00): SBP ≥125; DBP ≥70 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Both at the office and ABPM always predominate ABPM:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. HBP in ABPM at 24 hrs, awake or night time, regardless of the office BP&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Masked hypertension (MHBP): HBP AWAKE in the ABPM and NBP or LBP at the office.&#xD;
&#xD;
                B. Low BP (LBP) Since there are no clear limits in ABPM for LBP, only office supine&#xD;
                SBP and/or DBP will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
                SBP &lt;90 DBP &lt;60&#xD;
&#xD;
                C. Normal BP (NBP) &gt; 90 SBP &lt;140 &gt; 60 DBP &lt;90 White Coat Hypertension (WCHBP):&#xD;
                Normal BP AWAKE in the ABPM and HBP at the office.&#xD;
&#xD;
                D. NIGHT BP&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Night HBP: HBP at night in the ABPM&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Night NBP: NBP at night in the ABPM&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Night LBP: LBP at nigth in the ABPM .&#xD;
&#xD;
                III. The BP orthostatic response (Supine minus Standing [SUPINE] and Sitting minus&#xD;
                Standing [SITTING], example: SUPINE OH, or SITTING OH)&#xD;
&#xD;
                A. Orthostatic hypotension (OhypoT): Drop in BP upon standing&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  20 mmHg if SBP is normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  30 mmHg if SBP ≥140&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  10 mmHg in DBP&#xD;
&#xD;
                B. Orthostatic Hypertension (OhyperT) Rise in SBP upon standing ≥20 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
                C. Orthostatic Normotension (ONT): No criteria for Ohypot or OhyperT&#xD;
&#xD;
                .&#xD;
&#xD;
                IV. The circadian component of BP&#xD;
&#xD;
                A. Normal Dipper (NDBP): average decrease of SBP between day and night time greater&#xD;
                than 10% and less than 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
                B. Extreme Dippers (EDBP): greater than 20% fall&#xD;
&#xD;
                C. Nondippers (NonDBP): less than 10% fall&#xD;
&#xD;
                D. Reverse dippers (RDBP): night time BP higher than daytime average&#xD;
&#xD;
                E. Abnormal early Morning BP Surge (BPS): A rise ≥50 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
                .&#xD;
&#xD;
                V. BP response to treatment (requires office BP and ABPM)&#xD;
&#xD;
                A. True Control HBP (TCHBP): NBP at the office and the ABPM AWAKE&#xD;
&#xD;
                B. True Resistant HBP (TRHBP): HBP at the office and the ABPM AWAKE&#xD;
&#xD;
                C. False Control HBP (FCHBP): NBP at the office and HBP in the ABPM AWAKE&#xD;
&#xD;
                D. False Resistant HBP (FRHBP): HBP at the office and NBP in the ABPM AWAKE&#xD;
&#xD;
                Patients must be in the absence of medication for Essential hypotension diagnosis&#xD;
                and hypotension must be dismissed as a secondary manifestation of another disease&#xD;
                or other condition such as dehydration, medication causing hypotension for other&#xD;
                conditions or secondary dysautonomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
                There are 3 types of orthostatic hypotension Initial: in the first 30 sec. after&#xD;
                assuming the standing position Classic: It occurs between the 1st and 3rd min.&#xD;
                Late: It occurs between 5 and 45 min. later (no patients within this category)&#xD;
&#xD;
                ESTIMATION OF TARGET-ORGAN DAMAGE Electrocardiogram, Doppler color echocardiogram,&#xD;
                creatinine and urinalysis, lipid and metabolic profile and microalbuminuria are&#xD;
                requested to the patients; carotid Doppler is also requested in patients with&#xD;
                suspect of disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
                ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION TREATMENT. The treatment starts with a low-sodium diet (by&#xD;
                nutritionist whenever possible), increase in fruits and vegetables intake, weight&#xD;
                loss, aerobic exercise, stop smoking, and changes in lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The pharmacological first step is the use of IECAs (ARA II if there is cough),&#xD;
                calcium channel blockers, the use of diuretics like the Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg&#xD;
                (or up to 25mg). If there is orthostatic hypotension, it is considered to start&#xD;
                with Amlodipine. In those patients with tachyarrhythmia, heart failure or coronary&#xD;
                disease Beta blockers are chosen. Alpha blockers are the last step therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                ESSENTIAL HYPOTENSION TREATMENT The treatment starts with the use of&#xD;
                non-pharmacological measures consisting of postural hygiene (avoid assuming the&#xD;
                standing position abruptly, avoid staying in the standing position for too long),&#xD;
                eat salty (10 g), drink more than 2 liters of water per day, do aerobic exercises,&#xD;
                and raise the head of the bed. If there is not improvement, the patient can wear&#xD;
                gradient tights up to the waist. Next step is start Fludrocortisone 0.05 daily or&#xD;
                every other day. The last step is Midodrine (from 5 to 20mg daily, distributed at&#xD;
                06:00, 10:00 and 14:00 hrs or when needed, avoid it after 6:00 pm). Counterpressure&#xD;
                maneuvers are recommended if there is a threat of syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
                ALLOSTASIS&#xD;
&#xD;
                For the effects of what is mentioned here, allostasis is defined as the ability to&#xD;
                maintain homeostasis through the neuroendocrine and immune response to the stress&#xD;
                of any type. There is experimental evidence, measuring the sympathetic nerve&#xD;
                activity during the mathematical stress with microneurography of the peroneal nerve&#xD;
                (muscle sympathetic nerve activity or MSNA) that the response may be increasing,&#xD;
                neutral or decreasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The alterations in blood pressure are considered objective, which may be the result&#xD;
                of strategies and different responses to stress (adaptability), through the&#xD;
                neuroendocrine system (mainly the sympathetic nervous system).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The following variables are evaluated to describe the Allostasis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SYMPTOMS OF HYPOTENSION: postural dizziness, dizziness after squatting, dizziness during&#xD;
           childhood or adolescence (in elementary school, high school and occasionally in college)&#xD;
           during the mass, at public events, religious processions or military parades. It is also&#xD;
           taken into account the previous diagnosis of low pressure or &quot;hypoglycemia&quot; (which in&#xD;
           our culture mainly refers to symptoms of orthostatic hypotension).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HISTORY OF NEURALLY MEDIATED SYNCOPE OR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE diagnosed by the scores of&#xD;
           Calgary or Tilt-test; or vasovagal syncope (syncope caused by seeing blood, a&#xD;
           venipuncture or donating blood; pain, by seeing or speaking about dramatic things, when&#xD;
           coughing, swallowing, defecating, urinating, laughing, or other situations). If these&#xD;
           situations occur with significant dizziness or pre-syncope, but not syncope itself, it&#xD;
           is called vasovagal component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BLOOD PRESSURE: Low BP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allostasis is classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypo-allostasis: presence of at least one of the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Symptoms of hypotension and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Neurally mediated syncope (clinical or at the tilt-test) or vasovagal syncope&#xD;
                and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Hypotension at the office or at the tilt-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Normal-allostasis: normal blood pressure and no symptoms of hypotension, no neurally&#xD;
           mediated syncope or vasovagal syncope (spontaneous or induced in the tilt table test)&#xD;
           and no presence of hypotension. Include those who develop permanent hypertension after&#xD;
           65 yo. After this age, structural components mainly in the Windkessel vessels, may&#xD;
           contribute more than the increased sympathetic tone to the hypertension phenomenon. For&#xD;
           end points analysis, patients developing Hypertension after 65 yo are considered&#xD;
           hypertensives in their BP group, but normal in the adaptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hyper-allostasis: Arterial hypertension starting before 66 yo, with no identifiable&#xD;
           cause, no symptoms of hypotension, no neurally mediated syncope or vasovagal syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allostasis scores (scores between 1 and 7 apply for hypo-allostasis only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Only symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Only essential hypotension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Only neurally mediated syncope&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 1 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Normotensive&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Hypertensive&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The patient does not remember&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus then, 3 groups of blood pressure are recognized at the moment of evaluating their impact&#xD;
      on the comorbidities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normotensive&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypotensive&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypertensive, that in turn can be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypertensive since the admission&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Previously hypotensive&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Previously normotensive&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LABORATORY EXAMINATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete blood count Basal glycemia and 2 hr post-load 75 g glucose Insulinaemia Glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin Serum ferritin Thyroid stimulating hormone and sometimes free thyroxine Sodium and&#xD;
      serum potassium Uric acid Lipid profile Creatinine Basal serum cortisol and/or&#xD;
      post-Adrenocorticotropic hormone 24-hr urinary free cortisol Post-dexamethasone cortisol: in&#xD;
      those with high cortisol with not recognized cause Microalbuminuria Others depending on the&#xD;
      case, such as: 24-hr urine catecholamines (Epinephrine, Norepinephrine and Metanephrines),&#xD;
      gliadin antibodies, vanillylmandelic acid, parathyroid hormone, vitamin B12, folic acid,&#xD;
      ANAs, testosterone, creatinine clearance, antibodies against human hemoglobin in stool,&#xD;
      hypersensitive reactive C protein, 24-hrs urinary sodium, brain natriuretic peptide, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not a single laboratory to make the blood tests, so there are different values of&#xD;
      normality for some tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHYSICAL EXAMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every medical consultation, the patient is weighed wearing trousers or skirt. The waist is&#xD;
      measured at an equidistant level between the last rib and the iliac crest. The hip is&#xD;
      measured at the level of the greater trochanter. Finally, the size that appears in the&#xD;
      identity card of the patient, or the latest measurement is written down. After May 2016&#xD;
      measurements are taken in the office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAKING OF BLOOD PRESSURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is performed using a mercury sphygmomanometer from Tycos brand (it is revised annually in&#xD;
      accordance with the current rules of the Ministry of Health), and it is controlled that the&#xD;
      mercury column falls to 2 mm per second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bracelet must cover approximately the 80% of the forearm. We have three sizes of&#xD;
      bracelets as needed, including a pediatric bracelet. This should be positioned at heart&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appearance of the first sound and the disappearance of Korotkoff sounds are taken as&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic BP respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 BP measurements are taken, two on supine position and the second one after 5 min.&#xD;
      supine, this second supine value is the one used to calculate the BP drop upon standing.&#xD;
      Later, and having the bracelet previously inflated, the BP is taken immediately once the&#xD;
      up-right position is assumed (first 30 sec). Then, additional pressures are taken at the&#xD;
      first, second and third min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since November the 30th, 2017, two additional BPs will be taken in a seated position; these&#xD;
      will be taken at the beginning of the BP taking session. The patient will be seated&#xD;
      comfortably with their right arm resting at the heart level. The BPs, HRs, COs and SVRs will&#xD;
      be taken first after one minute of having the patient sit comfortably and then again after&#xD;
      two minutes. Later on, the patient will assume the first supine position and the protocol&#xD;
      continues as explained previously; however, the interval between the two BPs taken at the&#xD;
      supine position will be of one and three minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on January 2018, an immediate standing BP after seated position will be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive beat to beat BP taken was no longer used since March 2020 because the COVID-19&#xD;
      Pandemic. Few patients have been seen since then, BP is taken with mercury sphygmomanometer&#xD;
      always in sitting position and sometimes, in supine and standing position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same process is fulfilled for the HR, taken in 15 sec. During the taking of blood&#xD;
      pressure neither the patient nor the doctor talk, and it is avoided making any comments that&#xD;
      might alter the patient psychologically, and potentially modify their BP levels. The patient&#xD;
      is asked to have an empty bladder and the Physician tries to support the patient´s arm at the&#xD;
      heart level in every position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NON-INVASIVE BEAT TO BEAT BP MONITORING Non-invasive, beat to beat, BP monitoring and Cardiac&#xD;
      Output (CO) and Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) started to be used since May 2017 to&#xD;
      measure BP, HR, CO, SVR. CNAP Monitor 500, CNSystems, is CE and FDA approved. It is intended&#xD;
      to be use in every consecutive patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rings, bracelets, and wristwatches should be withdrawn from the right arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fingers in the cuffs should not be bending since this could increase BP artificially.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The arm will rest beside the body, relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. When standing, the physician or person taking BP should take the patient´s right arm and&#xD;
           help him stand up in an attempt to decrease the arm´s movement and avoid interference on&#xD;
           the recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The forearm is kept at the heart level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A screen´s photography will be taken with the cellphone after every BP measure (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A label is placed on the recording just after the seating position and before standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If the immediate standing BP taken shows a drop in the BP but systemic vascular&#xD;
           resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO) are those of the supine position then the BP&#xD;
           won´t be registered and a picture should be taken immediately SVR and CO are&#xD;
           recalculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. If BP starts to rise, review that fingers in the cuff are straight.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. If in doubt, make a manual measure of the BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. BP and HR date along with SVR and CO will be introduced in the fields of the BP and HR&#xD;
           taken with the sphygmomanometer and usual physical examination. New fields were created&#xD;
           for SVR and CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The completed data is introduced as 3 attachment files for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (HEWLETT PACKARD AND MORTARA) A careful reading of each plot is made in&#xD;
      which the HR, PR and cQT intervals, and QRS complex are recorded (automatic measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 HOURS ECG MONITORING (HOLTER) It is specified the patient rhythm, if is under medication&#xD;
      that may affect the heart rate variability (HRV) and, it is recorded the name and type of&#xD;
      drug. The number of supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes are counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The components of heart rate variability (HRV) allows calculating the sympathovagal balance&#xD;
      (SVB) in 24 hrs, in the day (06:00 to 22:00) and at night (22:00 to 6:00).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), very low frequency (VLF), Total power (TP) LF or HF&#xD;
      one = LF or HF x 100/ TP-VLF SVB = LFone/HFone&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING (ABPM) The systolic and diastolic BP and HR are&#xD;
      registered in 24 hrs, in the day and at night, as in the 24-hr Holter monitoring. This test&#xD;
      is requested for all patients in order to define the presence of white coat hypertension or&#xD;
      masked hypertension and to define an effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morning surge in SBP: It results from the difference between the averages of SBP taken in the&#xD;
      first 2 hrs from awakening and the lower nighttime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLOR DOPPLER ECHOCARDIOGRAM AND/OR STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM It is made the measurement of the&#xD;
      heart and if the response to stress is positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ejection fraction (EF) is usually measured by the technique of Simpson or in a&#xD;
      qualitative way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body surface area = (weight x height / 36) X 1/2 Cardiac mass = 1.05 [(LVDD + SW + PW)3 -&#xD;
      LVDD3] - 14 Cardiac mass index = cardiac mass / body surface area&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND It is recorded the presence of fatty liver and abdominal aortic aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY AND COLONOSCOPY The main findings are recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY Indication: For those who belong to the protocol and will indicate it,&#xD;
      it is tried that the indication belongs to a score between 7 and 9 (appropriate test for a&#xD;
      specific indication) of the recommendation of the working group aforementioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome or positive test for myocardial&#xD;
           ischemia in individuals with moderate or high cardiovascular risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias with unidentifiable cause that&#xD;
           stop spontaneously or require resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction at basal conditions (ejection fraction&#xD;
           &lt;40%) and evidence of viability in the affected segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evidence of new segmental alteration of motility of unknown etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Suspected ischemic mitral regurgitation or interventricular septal defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Presence on the CT scan of lesions &gt;50% on the left main trunk or other vessels, or&#xD;
           possibly obstructive lesions of debatable severity in symptomatic patients (when in the&#xD;
           left main trunk, also in asymptomatic patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is classified according to the obstruction to coronary flow as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesion &lt;50%, non-obstructive (if not the left main trunk)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 50-69%, intermediate lesion (if not the left main trunk)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt;70% or &gt;50% of the left main trunk, it is a significant obstructive lesion. It is&#xD;
           neither specified the number of affected vessels nor the vessel diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY The patient must be in a fasting state and stop taking medications&#xD;
      that affect the study for at least 5 half-lives. It is made by puncturing the right femoral&#xD;
      vein, electro-catheters are placed in the high right atrium, in the bundle of His and in the&#xD;
      right ventricular apex. It is stimulated the double of the thresholds to 3 cycle lengths&#xD;
      (600, 500 and 430 ms) and three extra cycles, starting at 350 ms, and with successive&#xD;
      decreases of 10 ms until the refractory period is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is made at basal conditions and in presence of Isoproterenol up to 4&#xD;
      micrograms/min; the sedation is obtained with Midazolam, administered 10 min. before starting&#xD;
      the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinus function tests: Sinoatrial conduction time (by Narula method), the sinus node recovery&#xD;
      time (SNRT) and the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT)). For the SNRT, it is&#xD;
      stimulated to several cycle lengths for one min, with decreases of 100 ms up to 430 ms, and&#xD;
      the longest pause is considered as the recovery time; if greater than 1500 ms is considered&#xD;
      abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CSNRT is the result of SNRT minus the cycle length of the patient. It is considered&#xD;
      abnormal 500 ms or more (sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%). Additionally, at five&#xD;
      min, it is evaluated the response of the HR to the infusion of 3 micrograms of Isoproterenol&#xD;
      per min. (an increase of 25% from basal HR) and the intrinsic HR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This latter is made by administering Atropine 0.04 mg/kg and propranolol 0.2 mg/kg, the&#xD;
      intrinsic HR is dependent on the age, and is calculated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      118.1 - (0.57 x age), for people under the age of 45 the value is adjusted +14% and for&#xD;
      people over the age of 45 +18%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with syncope and ischemic heart disease, when the initial evaluation&#xD;
           suggests an arrhythmic cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with syncope and bundle branch block, when the noninvasive evaluation has&#xD;
           not clarified the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When brief and sudden palpitations precede syncope, when the noninvasive evaluation has&#xD;
           not clarified the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In some cases of Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and&#xD;
           hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In high-risk patients in whom other methods have not clarified the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TILT TABLE TEST The patient is connected to the noninvasive BP beat to beat monitor. (Task&#xD;
      Force Monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must be fasting for at least 4 hrs; should stay 5 min. in supine position and&#xD;
      then is tilted at 60 degrees for 20 min. Then, it is administered 400 micrograms of&#xD;
      sublingual nitroglycerin for 20 min. more. The tilt table test (TTT) is considered positive&#xD;
      if the patient presents syncope or if the systolic blood pressure is lower than 60 mmHg. The&#xD;
      hemodynamic variables, the HR variability, and the BP are written down for those patients who&#xD;
      have these values available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other diagnoses written down on the TTT are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST): It is defined as a HR greater than 90 bpm in&#xD;
           supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthostatic hypotension (OH):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fall in the systolic BP ≥20 mmHg or in diastolic BP ≥10 mmHg, at any time of the TTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Orthostatic Hypertension: rise in SBP ≥20 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asystole: Isoelectric line that last for more than 3 sec. on the electrocardiogram plot.&#xD;
           The duration in sec. of the asystole is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronotropic incompetence (CI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      It refers to the inability of the heart to increase the HR more than 10% when standing up&#xD;
      within the first 10 min, and if the HR in supine &lt;70 bpm. Also, if this criterion is not met&#xD;
      but the HR to 60 degrees is lower than 65 bpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single syncope episode of unknown origin in high risk patients, or recurrent syncope in&#xD;
      absence of organic heart disease; or in presence of organic heart disease if cardiac etiology&#xD;
      was previously dismissed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show to the patient that he/she has this mechanism of syncope. To discriminate between&#xD;
      reflex and orthostatic syncope To differentiate syncope from epilepsy To diagnose patients&#xD;
      with recurrent unexpected falls To evaluate patients with recurrent syncope and psychiatric&#xD;
      disease Many patients referred by other colleagues already have the TTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAROTID SINUS MASSAGE (CSM) It is made during the TTT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications for the accomplishment of the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of carotid bruit during the neck auscultation. The test consists of doing&#xD;
           pressure and circular movements during 10 sec. on each carotid sinus, allowing an&#xD;
           interval of 1 min. between both sides. The massage is made at 0 and 60 degrees tilt. It&#xD;
           is considered a vasodilatory response if the systolic BP falls at least 50 mmHg, and&#xD;
           chronotropic response if an asystole last 3 or more sec. If this latter occurs, it is&#xD;
           expected the patient to recover and the carotid massage is repeated after applying&#xD;
           atropine 1 mg. If still positive for syncope it is considered a mixed response to the&#xD;
           CSM.&#xD;

      GENERAL OBJECTIVE To demonstrate if the essential arterial BP group and/or the adaptability&#xD;
      are clinically important and try to identify the mechanism involve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES To demonstrate that the three groups of blood pressure differ in the&#xD;
      numbers taken as much in the doctor's office as in the ambulatory BP monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inquire what variables are different between the groups of BP. To inquire which&#xD;
      comorbidities are more associated with each group of blood pressure and evaluate whether the&#xD;
      differences persist after a multivariate analysis. The same will be done with the&#xD;
      adaptability groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide hypotheses or evidences to explain the findings of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN OF THE STUDY This is an observational, analytic, cohort type study that aims to&#xD;
      compare the differences between groups of patients classified according to their BP numbers&#xD;
      and their adaptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, variables of the clinical, paraclinical, imaging and comorbidities profile will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database is designed to be flexible. It allows choosing different conditions in different&#xD;
      variables. The diagnoses have 3 options: No, New and Old. It is recorded the date of the&#xD;
      physical examinations, the diagnoses and the paraclinical results to ensure accuracy in the&#xD;
      calculation of the age and the relationship between the different variables during the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reports will be of prevalence (cross-sectional) and incidence (cohort). To evaluate the&#xD;
      significance between the groups of blood pressure depending on morbidities and other&#xD;
      variables, it is used a generalized linear model by adjusting the effect of the response&#xD;
      variable based on the age, gender and tension group in all cases. In some cases, and when the&#xD;
      response variable requires it, it is added the body mass index (BMI). When the response&#xD;
      variable is qualitative, it is used a logit link function and it is obtained the&#xD;
      corresponding Odds ratio with confidence intervals to 95%; while if the variable is&#xD;
      quantitative it is used the identity function. Finally, the multiple comparison test of&#xD;
      Tukey-Kramer is made in order to compare the groups of tension with a significance level of&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the relationship between the blood pressure groups and the comorbidities, and&#xD;
      other variables, the free events survival rates among participants using a Kaplan Meir&#xD;
      survival curves, adjusted for age and other related variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diagnosis of coronary disease, it was used a generalized linear model in which was&#xD;
      evaluated the adjustment of the effect in the groups of tension by age, gender, and body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), diabetes mellitus (DM), systolic and diastolic blood pressure in supine, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking, and blood pressure group. Variables were selected by&#xD;
      the method of Backward maintaining in the model those variables with a significance level of&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIMITATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Because patients were recruited at the doctor's office, some of them may decide not to&#xD;
           take the required tests or decide not to come back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Some insurance companies may not provide some test, like the Ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
           monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The attending practitioner may be busy with too much work and has not available time to&#xD;
           see the patients opportunely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The blood tests can be done at different sites and by different operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Black population is not represented in this sample.&#xD;
