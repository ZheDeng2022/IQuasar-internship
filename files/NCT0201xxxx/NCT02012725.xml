      This study is a feasibility study to validate magnetizatin transfer (MT)-weighted balanced&#xD;
      steady state free precession (bSSFP) cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) against current&#xD;
      clinical gold standard diagnostics, and to determine the applicability of MT-weighted bSSFP&#xD;
      cine CMR for diagnosis of fibrotic remodeling in chronic kidney disease (CKD5) patients.&#xD;
      Participants will not receive a study drug or placebo and will not be randomized. A total of&#xD;
      250 participants will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;

      This study had two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Participants will be enrolled in this arm if they have been referred to the Gill Heart&#xD;
      Institute MRI center for diagnostic late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) -CMR imaging of&#xD;
      fibrosis, or if they are a healthy volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is a Gill Heart Institute referral patient , they will receive an&#xD;
      intravenous (through a vein in the arm) infusion of gadolinium as part of their clinical&#xD;
      examination. Participants will also have electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform performed in order&#xD;
      to gate the MRI scan. The MRI scan of the heart, for which the participant has been referred&#xD;
      will last approximately 1 hour. Participants will have an additional 5-10 minutes of scans&#xD;
      performed, none of which require additional infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is a healthy volunteer, they will have an ECG waveform performed in order&#xD;
      to gate your MRI scan, and they will have approximately 30-45 minutes of scanning performed&#xD;
      on their heart. Participants will not receive an infusion of gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Only participants who are already participating in a study being conducted by Dr.&#xD;
      Harmut Malluche at the University of Kentucky, Department of Nephrology or, if you are a&#xD;
      healthy volunteer, will be enrolled into this arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this arm participants will receive an MRI of their heart, lasting 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
      Participants will not receive an infusion of gadolinium.&#xD;
