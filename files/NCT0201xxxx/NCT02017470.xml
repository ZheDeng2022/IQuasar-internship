    <textblock>
      This research focuses on health needs, constructed meanings of health, and meaningful health&#xD;
      promotion tactics among women who are heart disease patients. Women with heart disease are&#xD;
      considered as a highly vulnerable group for cardiovascular disease-related deaths in&#xD;
      Singapore. Because the culture-centered approach has previously demonstrated that&#xD;
      community-driven participatory processes of the Culture-Centered Approach (CCA) foster&#xD;
      positive changes in health outcomes, this project highlights involvement of community members&#xD;
      in developing effective health promotion regarding heart health. Rather than relying solely&#xD;
      on interventions created by outside experts, The investigators aim to engage in Heart Health&#xD;
      promotion that is meaningful through the involvement of these community members in processes&#xD;
      of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators seek to engage these women who are heart disease patients in&#xD;
      developing a heart health intervention that is beneficial to them. Through in-depth&#xD;
      interviews, focus groups, the formation of advisory boards, and community-wide dialogue&#xD;
      workshops led by these women, the investigators seek to identify specific heart health&#xD;
      promoting strategies and tactics that are meaningful to the lived experiences of the women.&#xD;
      As part of the overall solution, this project will work alongside the Women's Heart Health&#xD;
      Clinic to create training materials and disseminate findings based on our analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as the methodology, the investigators are using the Culture-Centered Approach (CCA) as&#xD;
      well as using biomedical measures for evaluation. First, an advisory board will be formed to&#xD;
      inform each step of our methodology and data analysis. First, the investigators will&#xD;
      randomize one group of patients into the control group and one group into the experimental&#xD;
      group. The investigators will conduct baseline measures for both groups. For the control&#xD;
      group, the investigators will measure biomedical data at 3 times (3 months, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months). For the experimental group, the investigators will create advisory board that will&#xD;
      consist of approx. 4 physicians and 6 patients. In-depth interviews will be conducted with&#xD;
      women who have experienced CVD and who live in Singapore. Each interview will last a maximum&#xD;
      of 90 minutes. Interviewees will be asked questions about how they understand health, their&#xD;
      health experiences, and the obstacles they face in accessing health care in Singapore. Data&#xD;
      from the interviews will be analyzed with the advisory board and will be used to guide&#xD;
      discussion for the focus groups of women in the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group sessions, each lasting a maximum of 90 minutes, will be conducted with the&#xD;
      patients in the experimental group. In each session, the participants will collectively&#xD;
      develop potential solutions for the issues that emerged during the earlier interviews.During&#xD;
      the one-year period of study, a participant in the experimental group can participate in one&#xD;
      or many of the one-on-one interviews, focus groups, or other activities planned based on the&#xD;
      feedback of the participants. Based on the information given in the interviews, advisory&#xD;
      board meetings, and focus groups, an intervention will be designed and carried out for the&#xD;
      experimental group. This group will also be evaluated at 3 time points (3 months, 6 months,&#xD;
      and 12 months) in addition to baseline.&#xD;

      The investigators are proposing a randomized clinical and social scientific trial comparing&#xD;
      outcomes among women with cardiovascular disease into 2 treatment groups: (1) conventional&#xD;
      general cardiology outpatient programme; (2) gender-tailored women's heart health outpatient&#xD;
      programme consisting of general cardiologist, advanced practice nurse, dietician,&#xD;
      physiotherapist and occupational therapist. Participants will include consecutive women&#xD;
      admitted to NUH for general cardiology problems and those attending general cardiology&#xD;
      clinics. Women requiring sub-specialty care (eg valve clinic, pulmonary hypertension clinic,&#xD;
      congenital heart clinic) will be excluded. The investigators will randomly assign 150 women&#xD;
      to a control group (where only the biomedical variables will be measured throughout the&#xD;
      course of a year's time) and 150 to an experimental group (where the biomedical variables&#xD;
      will be measured in addition to the participants' involvement in interviews, focus groups,&#xD;
      and prospective workshops based on expressed needs). Randomization will occur through the&#xD;
      consent process and after the participant is assigned to a group, the full involvement will&#xD;
      be explained. If randomized into the experimental group, the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      give consent for participation in one-on-one interviewing, focus group discussions, and the&#xD;
      forthcoming health promotion strategies that are developed based on the data collected. There&#xD;
      will be minimal risk involved in all of these intervention components since the investigators&#xD;
      are involving our participants throughout the development process for any future&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to develop the cultured-centred approach/processes for the women heart health&#xD;
      programme, the investigators will begin by forming an advisory board comprising of the women&#xD;
      patients, nurses, as well as providers. The advisory board will comprise of 8 members (4&#xD;
      patients, 2 nurses, 2 doctors). The advisory board will meet in the first month of the&#xD;
      project and will subsequently meet every two months. Based on the inputs of the advisory&#xD;
      board and the objectives established by the board, the research team will develop a design&#xD;
      for conducting in-depth interviews with 20 patients (each in-depth interview will take 60 to&#xD;
      90 minutes). The interviews will take place from month 2 to month 4. The advisory team will&#xD;
      then analyze interview data and in collaboration with NUS Communication and New Media design&#xD;
      team, materialized health-promoting strategies into workshops, to be conducted as part of the&#xD;
      intervention programme. Additionally, on the basis of the interview data six workshops will&#xD;
      be conducted in groups of 4 to develop health promoting strategies and tactics. The NUS&#xD;
      Communication and New Media (CNM) design team will collaborate with the workshop participants&#xD;
      to develop and implement the tactics. The workshops and material development will take place&#xD;
      in months 4 through month 6 of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the strategies and tactics have been developed, a baseline survey will be conducted with&#xD;
      150 women in the CCA experimental group and 150 women in the control group. For the&#xD;
      experimental group only, we will be conducting semi-structured short interviews. Additionally&#xD;
      the following clinical assessments will occur for both the experimental and control groups at&#xD;
      baseline and the 12 month visit: change in cardiovascular risk markers (lipids, fasting&#xD;
      glucose, waist circumference, body-mass-index, blood pressure, hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, body fat&#xD;
      analysis), vascular reactivity (endoPAT), and arterial stiffness measurement, quality of life&#xD;
      (SF-36 Health Survey), depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) and&#xD;
      Duke activity status index. The patients' cardiovascular risk markers (Cr, Hba1C, Lipid panel&#xD;
      or any other routing blood tests depending on physician), ordered as part of standard care&#xD;
      will be recorded as well. Patients will be followed for 12 months for recurrent&#xD;
      hospitalizations and deaths. Once the participants join the study, if randomized into the&#xD;
      experimental group, they will be required to participate in one of the following activities:&#xD;
      one-on-one interview, focus group, or joining the advisory board. The control group will only&#xD;
      participate in the clinical assessments and a baseline interview (administration of&#xD;
      questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that health interventions should be developed from a grassroots&#xD;
      approach incorporating the opinions and advice of the target population themselves. For the&#xD;
      experimental group, they will be participating in the development of a heart health&#xD;
      intervention based by sharing their experiences through our interviews, focus groups, and&#xD;
      advisory board. The investigators believe that focusing on the voices and expertise of the&#xD;
      population to develop an effective intervention will result in improved health outcomes for&#xD;
      our experimental group. In order to understand to what extent, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      compare both the biomedical and social scientific measures of the experimental group to the&#xD;
      control group. Any intervention materials will of course be made available to the control&#xD;
      group after the study is complete.&#xD;
