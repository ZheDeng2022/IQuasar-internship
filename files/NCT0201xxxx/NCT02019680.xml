      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Eating fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables with chemicals called flavonoids may protect against heart disease and improve&#xD;
      blood flow to the heart. They are found in blackcurrant berries. Oils found in fish and&#xD;
      mussels called omega-3 fats have also been shown to protect the heart. Researchers want to&#xD;
      know if blackcurrant extract and omega-3 fats can improve blood flow, which may increase&#xD;
      blood to the heart. They also want to learn about the health of blood vessels and how the&#xD;
      heart works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn if blackcurrant extract and omega-3 fats will improve blood flow and make the&#xD;
      heart beat stronger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults 55 to 75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 will take 6 7 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have physical exam and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small device like a microphone will be placed on their arm to take pictures of blood&#xD;
           vessels. A blood pressure cuff will be tightened on their arm and more pictures will be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure cuffs will be placed on their arms and legs. They will be tightened at&#xD;
           the same time and blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their eating and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 8 weeks, participants switch from taking blackcurrant and/or omega-3 tablets to a&#xD;
           placebo to no tablets. &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 8 weeks, they will have another shorter clinic visit that will repeat most of&#xD;
           visit 1.&#xD;

      Numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of fruits, vegetables and omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The cardioprotective properties may be&#xD;
      attributed to the bioactive compounds found in fruits and vegetables called flavonoids. High&#xD;
      concentrations of flavonoids with antioxidant activity are found in blackcurrant extract.&#xD;
      Flavonoids like omega-3 fatty acids may improve vascular function by increasing the&#xD;
      bioavailability of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. PCSO-524 (Pernacanaliculus&#xD;
      supercritical oil) is of particular interest as a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids derived&#xD;
      from the green-lipped mussel. The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of&#xD;
      blackcurrant extract, PCSO-524 or the combination of blackcurrant extract &amp; PCSO-524 on&#xD;
      endothelial function (flow-mediated brachial artery dilation) and arterial stiffness&#xD;
      (cardioankle vascular index) as indicators of cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis. These&#xD;
      indices also provide an assessment of structure and function of the artery. The effects of&#xD;
      the supplements on biomarkers of vascular health (endothelial dysfunction, inflammation,&#xD;
      injury, oxidative stress, nitric oxide status), lipids and fatty acid profile, and flavonoid&#xD;
      profiles will also be determined. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,&#xD;
      122 healthy older adults (ages 55-75) will be given either blackcurrant extract (1000 mg),&#xD;
      PCSO-524 (400 mg), or blackcurrant extract (1000 mg) &amp; PCSO-524 (400 mg) daily for 8 weeks&#xD;
      while consuming their usual diet. The study will include 4 visits at 8 week intervals&#xD;
      consisting of treatment, washout and placebo phases.&#xD;
