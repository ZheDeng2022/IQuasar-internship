      Study objectives To investigate if early controlled mobilization of the ankle in week 3 to 8&#xD;
      affects the functional outcome and patient reported outcome after treatment of acute Achilles&#xD;
      tendon rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, controlled trial (RCT). 130 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Begins January 2014. Study period is 4-5 years; recruitment is expected to span 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setup At Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre the majority of patients with acute ATR are&#xD;
      treated non-operatively. A cast is applied in the emergency room. After 2 weeks the bandage&#xD;
      is changed to a removable orthosis and full weight bearing is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who choose to participate in the trial will - through randomisation - be placed in&#xD;
      one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intervention group: Must perform controlled mobilization-exercises from the&#xD;
           beginning of week 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group: In line with the current treatment regimen the patients must keep the&#xD;
           boot on at all times and they are not allowed to move the ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol for the two groups is similar concerning orthose, removal of wedges and&#xD;
      weight-bearing. The only difference is that patients in the intervention group are instructed&#xD;
      to do ankle exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-examinations in relation to the study Follow-up is done at 8 and 16 weeks plus 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. The study's primary endpoint is at the 12 month mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Patients who are treated for acute Achilles tendon rupture at Copenhagen&#xD;
      University Hospital Hvidovre. Patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria but do not wish to&#xD;
      participate are treated according the standard regimen (non-operatively without early&#xD;
      controlled movement of the ankle joint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients 65 patients will be included in each group (a 130 patients in total).&#xD;

      Study objectives To investigate if early controlled mobilization of the ankle in week 3 to 8&#xD;
      affects the functional outcome and patient reported outcome after treatment of acute Achilles&#xD;
      tendon rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Type of study The study is performed as a single-blinded, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT). The randomisation is computer based; opaque envelopes are used. In total 130&#xD;
      patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule Recruitment of patients for the study begins 1st of November 2013. The expected&#xD;
      study period is 4-5 years; the recruitment itself is expected to span 2 years, provided that&#xD;
      an average of 6 patients is included per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Setup At Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre the majority of patients with acute&#xD;
      ATR are treated non-operatively. A cast is applied in the emergency room. After 2 weeks the&#xD;
      bandage is changed to a removable orthosis and full weight bearing is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who choose to participate in the trial will - through randomisation - be placed in&#xD;
      one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intervention group: Must perform controlled mobilization-exercises from the&#xD;
           beginning of week 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group: In line with the current treatment regimen the patients must keep the&#xD;
           boot on at all times and they are not allowed to move the ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol for the two groups is similar concerning orthose, removal of wedges and&#xD;
      weight-bearing. The only difference is that patients in the intervention group are instructed&#xD;
      to do ankle exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measures will be taken to ensure compliance within the groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intervention group: The patients will be equipped with training diaries in which&#xD;
           they will record their training for each of the five daily training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group: The orthosis will be sealed. If the boot is removed it can be&#xD;
           registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding The doctors and physical therapists who will conduct the follow-up will be&#xD;
           blinded to the intervention. This is ensured as a Project Nurse will be in charge of the&#xD;
           randomisation. The patients will be given a direct phone number for the Project Nurse,&#xD;
           as he/she will be in charge of treatment related question and enquiries during the&#xD;
           intervention period. Potential medical queries will be discussed with one of the&#xD;
           affiliated doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-examinations in relation to the study Follow-up is done at 8 and 16 weeks plus 6&#xD;
           and 12 months. The study's primary endpoint is at the 12 month mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Population Patients who are treated for acute Achilles tendon rupture at Copenhagen&#xD;
           University Hospital Hvidovre. Patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria but do not wish&#xD;
           to participate are treated according the standard regimen (non-operatively without early&#xD;
           controlled movement of the ankle joint).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Number of patients 65 patients will be included in each group (a 130 patients in total).&#xD;
           The sample size calculation is based on a clinical relevant difference of 10 point in&#xD;
           ATRS, a standard deviation (SD) of 16 and power of 0.90 (two sided). In a previous&#xD;
           material, with a fully comparable population, we found a SD of 16 points at the 1 year&#xD;
           post-examination. 54 patients is required in each group; due to the risk of drop out 65&#xD;
           patients will be included in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age 18-70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Terminal illness or severe medical illness: ASA score higher than or equal to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The space between the rupture and the calcaneus is less than 1cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Registration&#xD;
&#xD;
           All relevant data is recorded in a specially designed database. The data registration&#xD;
           will be reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is evaluated at 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ATRS: Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score 25 A patient reported validation score&#xD;
           developed to assess symptoms and physical activity after treatment for Achilles tendon&#xD;
           rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Heel-rise work test: Endurance test where the patient stands on one leg and lifts the&#xD;
           heel up and down until exhaustion. The number and the height of the heel-rises are&#xD;
           counted and measured. The results are then compared to the weight of the patient and the&#xD;
           total work is estimated. The MuscleLab ® (Ergo Test Technology, Oslo, Norway)&#xD;
           measurement system is used 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Single heel-rise test: The patient stands with the foot in neutral position. It is&#xD;
           recorded whether the patient is able to make a single heel-rise on the injured leg. The&#xD;
           heel-rise is acknowledged if the heel can be lifted at least 2 cm with stretched knee.&#xD;
           The MuscleLab ® (Ergo Test Technology, Oslo, Norway) measurement system is used 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasound: The length between the calcaneus and the distal tip of the medial head of&#xD;
           the gastrocnemius muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Amlangs ultrasound classification 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cost effectiveness analysis: A cost effectiveness analysis will be performed comparing&#xD;
           the two treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DVT screening: Ultra sound for deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) will be performed after 2 and&#xD;
           8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Perimeter of calf: The perimeter of the calf is measured at the widest point on the&#xD;
           injured side after 16 weeks. The distance from this point to lower edge of the patella&#xD;
           is measured in centimeters. The distance is used to measure the perimeter on the healthy&#xD;
           leg and for all subsequent measurements during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Re-ruptur (RR): It is registered if the tendon re-ruptures during the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Work: Hard physical labour involving heavy lifting, climbing stairs or climbing the&#xD;
           ladder. E.g. bricklayer, paviour, carpenter, dustman, mailman.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Moderate physical work that involves a lot of walking. E.g. salesperson, shop assistant,&#xD;
           nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Light physical work which only involves light walking. E.g. office work&#xD;
&#xD;
           Return to work: It is recorded how many days have passed before work is resumed&#xD;
           part-time and full-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sport: Does the patient do sports? If yes, what kind, how many hours per week on average&#xD;
           and at what level (professional, amateur, exerciser).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Return to sport: It is recorded how many days have passed before sport activities are&#xD;
           resumed and how many days have passed before sport activities reach a premorbid level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Health information: Former disease in or around the Achilles tendon, rheumatic disease,&#xD;
           dominant leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other data: Age, Cpr.nr., other master data necessary to identify and call back the&#xD;
           patient for post-examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are covered by the patient insurance of Copenhagen University Hospital&#xD;
           Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol as well as the patient information and declaration of consent must be&#xD;
           approved by the National Committee on Health Research Ethics before inclusion of&#xD;
           patients will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project manager is responsible for informing the National Committee on Health&#xD;
           Research Ethics of any critical adverse event and/or major changes of the protocol. All&#xD;
           correspondence will be filed by the project manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Declaration of consent All patients will receive verbal and written information&#xD;
           concerning the study. The inclusion will take place after a declaration of consent has&#xD;
           been obtained. It is the responsibility of the investigators to provide patients with&#xD;
           comprehensive verbal and written information concerning the course of the study,&#xD;
           purpose, potential risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
           The two groups are described descriptively regarding demographic parameters as well as&#xD;
           primary and secondary endpoints as described above in the paragraph &quot;Data registration&quot;.&#xD;
           Comparison of the primary and secondary outcomes of both groups is done by using&#xD;
           relevant statistics according to the characteristics of the variables and if necessary&#xD;
           the normal distribution. The change of the outcomes over a period of time is described&#xD;
           within each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research group&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is carried out as collaboration between the research unit, Clinical&#xD;
           Orthopaedic Research Hvidovre (www.corh.dk) and the Department of Physical- and&#xD;
           Occupational Therapy, both at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis and writing articles The data analysis and the drawing up of articles are&#xD;
           done by the project manager and last-author. The project group is regularly involved in&#xD;
           the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Economic conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is funded by the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and the Department of&#xD;
           Physiotherapy, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project group has independently initiated the study. Patients will not receive any&#xD;
           fees for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Publication It is expected that the study will be published in an international,&#xD;
           high-impact journal. We will furthermore seek to have the results presented at both&#xD;
           national and international medical conventions. The results will also be published&#xD;
           online and in other relevant media.&#xD;
