  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (MA) abuse is a national public health concern. People who are dependent on&#xD;
      MA have problems with mental functions (e.g., learning, remembering, focusing attention,&#xD;
      solving problems). Such problems can interfere with their treatment for MA abuse, and thereby&#xD;
      may promote continued drug use. While the effects of MA have been studied in rodents and&#xD;
      non-human primates, its effects on the human brain have not been well characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study of nontreatment seeking individuals who use MA compared to individuals who do&#xD;
      not use MA(control participants). The study has three goals: 1. it aims to identify the brain&#xD;
      regions and pathways that may contribute to the problems of MA abusers in performing mental&#xD;
      tasks; 2. it will serve as a double-blind, placebocontrolled,within-subjects study to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability, and positive effects of MA in MA-abusing volunteers&#xD;
      treated with atomoxetine or placebo; 3. It aims to compare the brain activity as measured by&#xD;
      structuraland functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These are noninvasive brain&#xD;
      imaging procedures, that will be used to study brain function while control and MA using&#xD;
      participants take atomoxetine or placebo and perform tests of memory and concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MA abusing participants will undergo a 1-day outpatient screening and if it is safe for the&#xD;
      participants to proceed with the study they will participate in two inpatient phases of the&#xD;
      study that will occur in the UCLA research setting, the General Clinical Research Center. The&#xD;
      first inpatient stay will be 15 days, and the second will be a 9 days stay that includes drug&#xD;
      administration and assessments. There will be at least a two week interval between inpatient&#xD;
      phases. During the inpatient phases participants will receive alternating study drugs;&#xD;
      atomoxetine or placebo and four sessions of IV MA administration or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study schedule for control participants will include a 1-day outpatient screening and two&#xD;
      phases of outpatient administration of atomoxotime or placebo with a two week study drug free&#xD;
      interval between the phases. Four to five of the outpatient study visits will involve&#xD;
      cognitive tests and brain imaging studies.&#xD;

      As a preliminary step, the investigators will screen the experimental data for normality and&#xD;
      for potential associations between outcome variables with demographic variables at baseline.&#xD;
      In cases of strong deviations from normality, log or power transformations will be used as&#xD;
      appropriate. For the subjective effects questionnaires, the peak effect will be identified&#xD;
      for each subject and used as the dependent variable. The primary analytical technique will be&#xD;
      linear mixed effects regression. The general linear mixed model (GLMM) is equivalent to&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA when all subjects have complete data but automatically handles&#xD;
      missing observations, producing unbiased estimates as long as the values are missing at&#xD;
      random. This approach will allow use of the data from subjects who complete only part of the&#xD;
      protocol or who have invalid measurements on some tests, greatly enhancing our power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is as large or greater than those in the previous human laboratory studies&#xD;
      assessing safety and initial efficacy of agonist-like pharmacotherapies for stimulant&#xD;
      dependence. For example, these previous studies used samples of 7 (Herin et al., 2010; Stoops&#xD;
      et al., 2008; Dackis et al., 2003), and 10 (Sofuoglu et al., 2009) subjects to obtain&#xD;
      significant reductions in subjective effects of d-amphetamine by atomoxetine and those of&#xD;
      cocaine by modafinil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be conservative, the investigators base power estimates on completers but will use&#xD;
      available data from all 30 subjects in GLMM analyses. This should substantially increase&#xD;
      power (power for GLMM and repeated measures ANOVA are equivalent except that ANOVA cannot&#xD;
      utilize incomplete data, while a GLMM can).&#xD;

               8. Three or more consecutive ectopic ventricular complexes at a rate of greater than&#xD;
                  100/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. These are extreme values and we do not anticipate this would occur based on prior&#xD;
                  experience by ours and other groups administering repeated doses of MA in the&#xD;
                  laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;

             idiopathic seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of head trauma that resulted in neurological sequelae (e.g., with loss of&#xD;
             consciousness [LOC] &gt; 15 minutes, or that required hospitalization. Also, individuals&#xD;
             with 3 or more head injuries with LOC &gt; 5 minutes will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meet criteria for abuse or dependence of either alcohol or other illicit substances&#xD;
             (other than nicotine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have physiological dependence on alcohol or a sedative-hypnotic, (e.g., a&#xD;
             benzodiazepine) that requires medical detoxification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Meet the diagnostic criteria for the following Axis I disorders: psychosis, bipolar I&#xD;
             disorder, organic brain disease, dementia, major depression, schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
             or schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have any evidence of clinically significant heart disease, hypertension or significant&#xD;
             medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have any history of hypersensitivity to atomoxetine, glaucoma, motor tics or with a&#xD;
             family history or diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have any preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing, small bowel inflammatory&#xD;
             disease, intestinal adhesions, past history of peritonitis, or cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Be pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have a significant family history of early cardiovascular morbidity or mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have a diagnosis of adult asthma, including those with a history of acute asthma&#xD;
             within the past two years, and those with current or recent (past 2 years) treatment&#xD;
             with inhaled or oral beta-agonist or steroid therapy (due to potential serious adverse&#xD;
             interactions with atomoxetine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Be actively using albuterol or other beta agonist medications, regardless of formal&#xD;
             diagnosis of asthma. If respiratory disease is excluded and the subject will consent&#xD;
             to discontinue agonist use, s/he may be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. For subjects suspect for asthma but without formal diagnosis, 1) have a history of&#xD;
             coughing and/or wheezing, 2) have a history of asthma and/or asthma treatment two or&#xD;
             more years before, 3) have a history of other respiratory illness, e.g., complications&#xD;
             of pulmonary disease (exclude if on beta agonists), 4) use over-the-counter agonist or&#xD;
             allergy medication for respiratory problems (e.g., Primatene Mist): a detailed history&#xD;
             and physical exam, pulmonary consult, and pulmonary function tests should be performed&#xD;
             prior to including or excluding from the study or 5) have an FEV1 &lt;70 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have any illness, condition, and/or use of medications that in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             Principal Investigator and the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or&#xD;
             successful completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have active syphilis that has not been treated or refuse treatment for syphilis (see&#xD;
             note).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects who are HIV-positive will be excluded because HIV infection and the&#xD;
             development of AIDS produce alterations in brain activity. Such effects on brain&#xD;
             activity could confound the results of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Have a current or past history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Have neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Have evidence of significant liver or kidney dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Have a history of urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Be UCLA students or staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Have evidence of active tuberculosis infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Only for MRI Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  We will exclude any participant from MRI scanning procedures whose body contains&#xD;
                  a ferromagnetic implanted device that might produce a safety hazard during fMRI.&#xD;
                  We will follow guidelines found in the manual, Magnetic Resonance: Bioeffects,&#xD;
                  Safety, and Patient Management72 ,supplemented by the current information&#xD;
                  published on the International MR Safety Web Site:&#xD;
                  http://www.mrisafety.com/safety_info.asp Note: Syphilis testing will not be&#xD;
                  performed as part of this study and the study will rely solely on subjects' self&#xD;
                  report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for Discontinuation Following Initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive urine drug screen or breath test indicating illicit use of cocaine, MA,&#xD;
             alcohol, opiates, or other abused drugs not delivered as part of this protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to comply with study procedures. -&#xD;
