      Background: Persistent nonspecific low back pain (PNSLBP) is one of the most common low back&#xD;
      pains worldwide. Many interventions were tried including wet cupping which is commonly used&#xD;
      for pain conditions in Saudi Arabia and other parts in the world but without solid scientific&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This study aims at determining safety and efficacy of wet cupping for treating PNSLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a randomized wait-listed controlled clinical trial. Eligible patients with&#xD;
      history of at least 3 months of PNSLBP will be randomized in to two groups, 45 patients each.&#xD;
      The first group will be given wet-cupping treatment at two acupuncture points of urinary&#xD;
      Bladder (BL) meridians among the BL23, BL24 and BL25, 6 times within 2 weeks. The second&#xD;
      group will serve as a control group. Usual care, including providing brochures for exercise,&#xD;
      general advice for PNSLBP and acetaminophen, will be allowed in both groups. Separate&#xD;
      assessors participated in the outcome assessment. Investigators will use the 0 to100&#xD;
      numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain, the McGill Pain questionnaire for pain intensity (PPI)&#xD;
      and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), and to assess acetaminophen use and safety&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: To provide data on the safety and effectiveness of wet cupping in treating&#xD;
      PNSLBP and open the way for integrative medicine in Saudi Arabia&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of wet cupping in the treatment of NSLBP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective: To assess the effect of wet cupping on Pain (difference in the NRS&#xD;
           from base to the end of two weeks) compared to the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-To compare Functioning (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) from the base to the end of the&#xD;
      two weeks of wet cupping sessions&amp; two weeks later in the two groups II-To compare NRS from&#xD;
      base to two weeks after the end of cupping III-To compare Number of Acetaminophen tables&#xD;
      taken at the end of two weeks. IV-To evaluate Safety of wet cupping&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIS: The hypothesis of this study is that the improvement of Numeric Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS) for Pain at the end of the study will be greater in the Wet Cupping Treatment&#xD;
      group than in the Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Design: a randomised, waiting-list controlled, open-label, parallel trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Type: Interventional&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition: Persistent Non Specific Low Back Pain (PNSLBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case definition parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low back pain: is defined as pain and discomfort, localized , below the costal margin&#xD;
           and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without referred leg pain.,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent low back pain: is defined as low back pain persisting for at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
           We do not deal specifically with repeated, short bouts of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonspecific low back pain: is defined as&quot; low back pain that is not attributable to a&#xD;
           recognizable, known specific pathology (e.g. infection, tumour, osteoporosis, fracture,&#xD;
           structural deformity, inflammatory disorder (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis), radicular&#xD;
           syndrome or caudal equine syndrome).&quot;&#xD;
