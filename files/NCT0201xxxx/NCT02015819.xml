  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and determines the best dose of genetically&#xD;
      modified neural stem cells and flucytosine when given together with leucovorin for treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. Neural stem cells can travel to sites of tumor in&#xD;
      the brain. The neural stem cells that are being used in this study were genetically modified&#xD;
      express the enzyme cytosine deaminase (CD), which converts the prodrug flucytosine (5-FC)&#xD;
      into the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Leucovorin may help 5-FU kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells. The CD-expressing neural stem cells are administered directly into the brain. After&#xD;
      giving the neural stem cells a few days to spread out and migrate to tumor cells, research&#xD;
      participants take a 7 day course of oral 5-FC. (Depending on when a research participant&#xD;
      enters the study, they may also be given leucovorin to take with the 5-FC.) When the 5-FC&#xD;
      crosses into brain, the neural stem cells convert it into 5-FU, which diffuses out of the&#xD;
      neural stem cells to preferentially kill rapidly dividing tumor cells while minimizing&#xD;
      toxicity to healthy tissues. A Rickham catheter, placed at the time of surgery, will be used&#xD;
      to administer additional doses of NSCs every two weeks, followed each time by a 7 day course&#xD;
      of oral 5-FC (and possibly leucovorin). This neural stem cell-based anti-cancer strategy may&#xD;
      be an effective treatment for high-grade gliomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the phase II recommended dose of intracerebrally administered cytosine deaminase&#xD;
      (CD)-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) in combination with oral 5-fluorocytosine (FC)&#xD;
      (flucytosine) and leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs&#xD;
      followed by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity (anti-NSC T cell and/or antibody&#xD;
      response) with repeat doses of NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of&#xD;
      5-FC and 5-FU at the maximum tolerated dose/maximum feasible dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or&#xD;
      complete response) of this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of CD-expressing genetically modified neural stem&#xD;
      cells and flucytosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive CD-expressing neural stem cells intracranially (IC) on days 1 and 15 and&#xD;
      flucytosine orally (PO) every 6 hours on days 4-10 and 18-24. Depending on when a subject&#xD;
      enters the study, they may also be given leucovorin orally every 6 hours on days 4-10 and&#xD;
      18-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1&#xD;
      year, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

Stable Disease (SD): Dose not qualify for CR, PR, or PD, stable non-enhancing FLAIR/T2 lesions, stable or reduced corticosteroids, clinically stable.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): &gt;=25% increase in enhancing lesion despite stable or increasing steroid dose, increase (significant) in non-enhancing T2/FLAIR lesions that is not attributable to other non-tumor causes, any new lesions, clinical deterioration</description>

          <description>Per RANO criteria:&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all enhancing disease that is sustained for at least 4 weeks, stable or improved non-enhancing FLAIR/T2 lesions, no new lesions, off corticosteroids, and neurologically stable or improved.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): &gt;= 50% decrease of all measurable enhancing lesions, sustained or at least 4 weeks, no progression of non-measurable disease, stable or improved non-enhancing FLAIR/T2 lesions, non new lesions, corticosteroid dose stable or reduced, and neurologically stable or improved.&#xD;
Stable Disease (SD): Dose not qualify for CR, PR, or PD, stable non-enhancing FLAIR/T2 lesions, stable or reduced corticosteroids, clinically stable.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): &gt;=25% increase in enhancing lesion despite stable or increasing steroid dose, increase (significant) in non-enhancing T2/FLAIR lesions that is not attributable to other non-tumor causes, any new lesions, clinical deterioration</description>
