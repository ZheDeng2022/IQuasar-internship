  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that resistance training (RT) is beneficial to increase&#xD;
      muscle strength, improve functional ability and the ability to rapidly produce force, known&#xD;
      as the contractile rate of force development (RFD) in older adults. However, much less&#xD;
      research has focused on the effect of RT on the lower extremity muscle strength, contractile&#xD;
      RFD and impulse in middle-aged and older people with musculoskeletal conditions, especially&#xD;
      for osteoporosis (OP) (or osteopenia) or knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to investigate the effect of RT on the lower extremity muscle strength, RFD&#xD;
      and impulse in middle-aged and older people with musculoskeletal conditions, especially for&#xD;
      OP and knee OA (KOA). The investigators hypothesized that such a training program would lead&#xD;
      to induce not only specific muscle strength enhancement but also an increment in contractile&#xD;
      RFD and impulse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) are the two most common musculoskeletal conditions&#xD;
      in older adults, causing high healthcare costs and negative effects on quality of life.&#xD;
      Previous studies have reported that OP and OA has a strong association with sarcopenia, a&#xD;
      term defined as age-related involuntary loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength or&#xD;
      function.A decline of muscle mass and strength in older adults may limit a variety of&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADLs) and increase morbidity and mortality. However, many ADLs&#xD;
      often involve faster limb movements with contraction times of 50 - 200 ms (i.e. sit-to-stand&#xD;
      performance and avoiding falls). Therefore, in addition to muscle mass and strength, the&#xD;
      ability to rapidly produce force, known as the contractile rate of force development (RFD),&#xD;
      and the area under the force-time curve, defined as contractile impulse, seem to be important&#xD;
      to adequately characterize the performance of ADLs in older adults. Typically, resistance&#xD;
      training (RT) is often prescribed to increase muscle strength, improve functional ability and&#xD;
      eliminate much of age-associated muscle atrophy and weakness in a healthy population. Other&#xD;
      studies have also shown that implementation of RT can help improve RFD in healthy young and&#xD;
      elderly individuals following RT. However, it still unclear that the effect of RT on&#xD;
      contractile RFD and impulse in middle-aged and older people with musculoskeletal conditions.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects on the lower extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength, contractile rate of force development (RFD), impulse in middle-aged and older&#xD;
      people with osteoporosis (OP)(or osteopenia) or knee osteoarthritis (KOA) after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      resistance training.&#xD;
