      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and longevity of color and&#xD;
      Tooth sensitivity of patients undergoing home whitening peroxide 10% carbamide ( Whiteness&#xD;
      Perfect , FGM , Joinville , Santa Catarina , Brazil) , and the relationship with the&#xD;
      cigarette use for tooth whitening. They will be selected 120 patients with incisors darker&#xD;
      than A2, higher plants will be divided into 2 groups per center (n = 30 ) , GE - Group&#xD;
      Experimental ( smoking) and GC - Group Control ( non-smoking) . For the two groups will be&#xD;
      used Carbamide peroxide 10% for 3 hours daily for a period of 3 weeks. Color will evaluated&#xD;
      through the Vita Classical scale and Vita Easyshade Spectrophotometer in the periods: Home ,&#xD;
      for tooth whitening (1st , 2nd and 3rd week) and post- whitening ( 1 week and 1 month , 2 and&#xD;
      3 months). Patients recorded the perceived sensitivity through Numerical Analogue Scale (NRS&#xD;
      ) with values from 0 to 4, where 0 = no sensation, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe and 4 =&#xD;
      significant , also in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS ), with values from 0 to 10 where 0 = 10&#xD;
      = severe tenderness and sensitivity. for color analysis will be made two-way ANOVA (group vs.&#xD;
      treatment time ), being Over time the repeated measure ( α = 0.05). Test will be held on&#xD;
      Tukey to contrast the average ( α = 0.05). The sensitivity will be evaluated by the Fisher&#xD;
      exact test . It is expected that there is no difference on the effectiveness of home&#xD;
      whitening and tooth sensitivity between smokers and nonsmokers.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted under the CONSORT recommendations and respecting the principles&#xD;
      of Helsinsky convention and corresponds to a multicenter study in conjunction with the&#xD;
      University of Ponta Grossa Brazil (Deputy resolution protocol and ethics committee (Appendix&#xD;
      A and B ) . Will be invited to participate in the study to patients who come to the clinic&#xD;
      through FOUCH public posters. Subsequently 120 volunteers will be selected on the criteria&#xD;
      that qualify inclusion and exclusion from the study will be reported all volunteers were&#xD;
      examined not qualify under the criteria for inclusion as part of the initial n , according to&#xD;
      CONSORT recommendations .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed ( TCLE ) consent (Appendix 3 ) shall be made prophylaxis teeth of&#xD;
      the upper and lower teeth , for the removal of extrinsic stains jet sodium bicarbonate (&#xD;
      Profi class , Ribeirao Preto , Sao Paulo , Brazil) , two weeks before the beginning of tooth&#xD;
      whitening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in this study must be over 18, in good general health and buccal, have&#xD;
      teeth free of carious lesions and periodontal disease, which agree with the informed consent&#xD;
      document . And the color of the anterior teeth higher is classified as A2 or greater value ,&#xD;
      according to the scale VITA Classical (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany) and the&#xD;
      spectrophotometer Easyshade Vita (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). Evaluation of&#xD;
      color through the VITA scale Classical will be made independently by two calibrated&#xD;
      investigators and blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be excluded from the study patients: they have already made treatment tooth whitening, or&#xD;
      dental prosthesis having options at the upper front teeth , who are pregnant or lactating ,&#xD;
      presenting gingival recession, sensitivity dental, endodontic treatment in anterior maxillary&#xD;
      teeth, which have a coloring severe internal, if they have non-carious cervical lesions, are&#xD;
      taking medications , using fixed orthodontic appliances, submit bruxism habits, which have&#xD;
      visible teeth cranks and those who are not available to attend the controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Patients will be divided into two groups (n = 60 ), GC (control group) and GE&#xD;
      (group experimental ). At the initial consultation volunteers will be asked about smoking&#xD;
      habits daily. Patients who do not smoke will be part of the GC, and heavy smokers (more than&#xD;
      10 day ) will be part of GE.A cigarettes all smokers are complementary be given a booklet of&#xD;
      tips for quitting smoking and damage, and sites where to find more information. (Annex C )&#xD;
      The teeth whitening technique selected for this study, is the technique of home bleaching,&#xD;
      validated for both groups. Treatment and follow-up will no cost to the patient . For the&#xD;
      development of individual buckets, this will be through impression of the upper and lower&#xD;
      arch of each patient Jeltrate Plus alginate ( Dentply, Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil),&#xD;
      the molds will be cast in plaster and immediately after printing. After obtaining this&#xD;
      plaster model is cut and taken to the vacuum laminator ( Protécni, Araraquara, Sao Paulo,&#xD;
      Brazil) for making buckets individual vinyl acetate 1 mm thick (Plate Pail Whiteness -FGM,&#xD;
      Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil). Cuvettes acetate be cut an inch margin on gingival . For&#xD;
      both groups of PC gel will be used 10% ( Whiteness Perfect, FGM, Joinville, Santa Catarina,&#xD;
      Brazil ), for a period of 3 hours a day for three weeks ) . After the test cuvette acetate&#xD;
      individual, the method of application of the product will be carefully explained to each&#xD;
      patient in the study as follows : Dispense a drop in the region of the product corresponding&#xD;
      to the buccal surface of each tooth in the tray. The amount of gel should be sufficient to&#xD;
      remain in contact with the buccal tooth surface without covering the gingival third,&#xD;
      preventing injuries from it. After this period, patients will be instructed to withdraw the&#xD;
      tray with the whitening gel and perform vigorous mouth rinsed with water to complete removal&#xD;
      of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Color Subjective method Color will be assessed by the scale VITA Classical&#xD;
      (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany ), consisting of 16 color guides, organized by&#xD;
      value, higher value (B1 ) to low value ( C4 ). Although this scale is not linear, it is&#xD;
      organized according to a ranking range valor. Represent and the purpose of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two blind reviewers record the color of the right maxillary central incisor patients through&#xD;
      the scale VITA Classical (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). At the following times :&#xD;
      initial, 1st week, 2nd week, 3rd week (active phase bleaching) and post- bleaching periods :&#xD;
      1 week, 1 month, 2 and 3 months. Evaluators always record the color independently in the same&#xD;
      room with the same lighting. If there is a discrepancy in the color registration, a new&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted together until a consenso. The area chosen for color measurement&#xD;
      is the middle third of the labial surface of the central incisor, according to the ADA&#xD;
      specifications . The color change will be evaluated by means of varying scale Vita units (&#xD;
      ΔUEV ) organized by value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective method The color will also be measured with the spectrophotometer Easyshade ( Vita&#xD;
      Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany ) according to the CIELab system of Vita. Calibration of&#xD;
      equipment will always be made before each measurement, and three measurements for each tooth&#xD;
      will be made. The evaluation will be conducted at the same times that the method subjective.&#xD;
      For standardize the measuring of color, a mold of the teeth of the upper arch with heavy&#xD;
      condensation silicone (Coltoflax profile and cub, Vigodent, Rio de Janeiro will be held,&#xD;
      Brazil ) for making a silicone matrix. The matrix was used to standardize the region of the&#xD;
      tooth in which the color is measured with the spectrophotometer. The matrix will be drilled&#xD;
      in the vestibular region, in the middle third, in the upper teeth, using a scalpel circular 6&#xD;
      mm in diameter, Biopsy punch ( Miltex, York, PA USA), similar diameter to the tip of the&#xD;
      spectrophotometer Vita Easyshade. Color recurrence begins the day the patient is bleached,&#xD;
      the spectrophotometer used has a sufficient sensitivity to determine minimal color changes,&#xD;
      is based on the construction algorithm for the detection of the dimensions h and b color .&#xD;
      (Jadad et al. , 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the Dental Sensitivity In the initial clinical examination of patients ,&#xD;
      baseline sensitivity is measured by the vertical , horizontal drum , air jet application and&#xD;
      probing of all teeth, so it can be compared with the sensitivity during the whitening&#xD;
      dental.Durante whitening, patients record the presence or absence of tooth sensitivity, in a&#xD;
      newspaper of tooth sensitivity using analog numerical scale (ENR ), with values from 0 to 4,&#xD;
      where: 0 = no tenderness, 1 = Slight, 2 = moderate 3 = considerably and 4 = severe. And on&#xD;
      the visual analogue scale (VAS ) with values from 0 to 10 where 0 = no sensitivity and 10 =&#xD;
      severe. Patients mark a vertical line across the horizontal line of the scale corresponding&#xD;
      to the intensity of tooth sensitivity. After measurement in millimeters are made with the aid&#xD;
      of a millimeter ruler. Annex 5 and 6 values will be organized into two categories: percentage&#xD;
      of patients with tooth sensitivity at some time during treatment ( absolute risk sensitivity&#xD;
      ) and intensity of tooth sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe sensitivity will be immediately assisted by investigators to reverse the&#xD;
      painful picture using desensitizing and / or analgesics and anti-inflammatories for pain&#xD;
      relief, the patient will be removed from study. If sensitivity is used desensitizing FMG KF&#xD;
      2% ( nitrate Potassium and Sodium Fluoride 2%, Joinville, Brazil) , the literature does not&#xD;
      present any report about RAM, if for any reason there is any Medical Adverse Event the&#xD;
      research team will be responsible for any additional medical or dental treatment required and&#xD;
      its follow-up, in the wake of whitening procedure ( restorations, endodontics, etc. )&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The color data obtained by the objective and subjective analysis will be&#xD;
      evaluated by analysis of variance of two factors (ANOVA ) for repeated measures ( time vs.&#xD;
      treatment groups ) ( α = 0.05). Tukey's test performed to test the means ( α = 0.05). The&#xD;
      absolute risk of sensitivity will be evaluated by the Fisher exact test .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling calculation was obtained by the G -Power 3.1 program considering a Beta error 0.8,&#xD;
      and an alpha error 0.05, meaning a sample calculation of 25 patients per group per center,&#xD;
      considering the drop-out reported in other published work ( 5%) was decided to increase to 30&#xD;
      the n sample size for each group per center. Coincident with the Odds Ratio of all clinical&#xD;
      work whitening the past 10 years.&#xD;
