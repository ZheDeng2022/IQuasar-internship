  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements during the past 20 years in blood glucose and blood pressure control,&#xD;
      diabetic kidney disease remains one of the most important causes of health problems in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. Novel treatments to complement blood glucose and blood pressure&#xD;
      control are urgently needed. The goal of this study is to see whether a medication called&#xD;
      allopurinol may help prevent loss of kidney function among people with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
      Allopurinol has been used for many years to decrease high blood uric acid and treat gout - a&#xD;
      disease characterized by arthritis, especially of the foot joints. There is evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that allopurinol might also be useful in people with diabetes who have normal or&#xD;
      moderately impaired kidney function to decrease the risk of developing advanced kidney&#xD;
      disease in the future. To prove this beneficial effect of allopurinol, we will be conducting&#xD;
      an international clinical trial at eight diabetes centers, enrolling approximately 480&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes who are at increased risk of developing kidney disease.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to take allopurinol or placebo (inactive pill) for&#xD;
      three years, during which they will be followed through periodical visits. To prevent any&#xD;
      possible bias, neither the participants nor the clinical staff knows who is taking&#xD;
      allopurinol and who is taking the placebo. Kidney function will be measured at the beginning&#xD;
      and at the end of the treatment period to see whether patients taking allopurinol experience&#xD;
      a slower loss of kidney function over time as compared to those taking the inactive pill. If&#xD;
      this trial is successful, the reduction in health problems resulting from the prevention or&#xD;
      delay of kidney function loss due to the use of allopurinol would have a major impact on the&#xD;
      lives of type 1 diabetic patients as well as on society at large, significantly reducing the&#xD;
      human and financial costs associated with diabetic kidney disease. Because of the emphasis on&#xD;
      early intervention, the proposed trial, if successful, will establish a new paradigm in&#xD;
      treatments to slow or prevent progression towards end stage kidney disease in type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      far beyond anything achieved to date.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in the past 20 years in glycemic and blood pressure control and the&#xD;
      introduction of 'renoprotective' drugs such as renin-angiotensin system blockers, the&#xD;
      incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is not declining. Novel&#xD;
      therapies to complement these interventions are urgently needed. Mounting evidence from&#xD;
      prospective studies indicates that moderately elevated serum uric acid is a strong,&#xD;
      independent predictor of an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and increased rates of&#xD;
      loss of kidney function among T1D persons. To study whether uric acid lowering can reduce&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss in T1D, we have established the PERL (Preventing Early&#xD;
      Renal Function Loss in Diabetes) Consortium including investigators from Joslin Diabetes&#xD;
      Center, the Universities of Minnesota, Colorado, Toronto, and Michigan, Northwestern&#xD;
      University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark.&#xD;
      With the support of NIH grant R03 DK094484, the Consortium has designed a three-year,&#xD;
      multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with the specific&#xD;
      aim of evaluating the efficacy of the urate-lowering drug allopurinol, as compared to&#xD;
      placebo, in reducing kidney function loss among subjects with T1D. The trial is targeted to&#xD;
      T1D patients with microalbuminuria or moderate macroalbuminuria or ongoing kidney function&#xD;
      decline and serum uric acid levels ≥ 4.5 mg/dl, since these are the patients who are at very&#xD;
      high risk of having rapid GFR decline and might benefit most from reductions in uric acid&#xD;
      levels. Study subjects will be required to have a GFR between 40 and 99 ml/min/1.73 m2,&#xD;
      consistent with the goal of intervening relatively early in the course of clinical DN rather&#xD;
      than at later stages when structural changes are far advanced and a very large proportion of&#xD;
      kidney function has already been lost. The primary endpoint of the study will be the GFR (as&#xD;
      measured by iohexol plasma disappearance) at the end of a 2-month wash-out period after the&#xD;
      3-year intervention. Sample size calculations under various dropout and non-adherence&#xD;
      scenarios suggest that 240 subjects in each treatment arm would provide at least 80% power to&#xD;
      detect a clinically meaningful and achievable reduction in GFR decline in the allopurinol vs.&#xD;
      the placebo group.If we demonstrate that allopurinol can halt or slow down GFR decline in T1D&#xD;
      subjects, we will provide a safe and inexpensive intervention to prevent or delay kidney&#xD;
      failure in T1D that can be applied at the earliest clinically detectable stages of renal&#xD;
      injury. It is difficult to overstate how significant this finding would be, both from the&#xD;
      perspective of public health and that of persons with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-one of the 530 participants in this study were recruited as part of a pilot study&#xD;
      (JDRF 17-2012-377, NCT01575379) and transferred to the main study (NCT02017171) when this was&#xD;
      funded. Eligibility criteria for the pilot study were the same as those for the main study,&#xD;
      with the exception of a wider estimated GFR interval at entry in the run-in period&#xD;
      (eGFR=35-109) ml/min/1.73 m2) and the additional requirement of a measured GFR (iGFR) between&#xD;
      45 and 99 ml/min/1.73 m2 at the end of the run-in period. Pilot subjects joined the main&#xD;
      study at a time point corresponding to the time elapsed from randomization in the pilot.&#xD;
      Thus, they were exposed to the study medication for the same length of time (3 years) as&#xD;
      participants who were directly enrolled in the main study. Outcomes measures were those of&#xD;
      the main study, regardless of whether participants were transferred from the pilot or were&#xD;
      directly enrolled in the main study.&#xD;
