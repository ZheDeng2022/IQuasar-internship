  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For national antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs, the most important health system goals in&#xD;
      reducing morbidity and mortality among HIV-infection patients are to initiate treatment as&#xD;
      early as eligibility criteria allow and to achieve the highest possible long-term retention&#xD;
      of patients on ART. In South Africa, cohort data have consistently found high attrition among&#xD;
      ART patients, with the combined cumulative outcomes of death and loss to follow up averaging&#xD;
      25-40% over the first five years after ART initiation. Like many other middle income&#xD;
      countries, South Africa also faces very high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and&#xD;
      NCD risks. Despite this, there are virtually no studies looking at interactions between ART&#xD;
      and NCDs, and none that have considered the effect of NCDs and NCD risk factors on achieving&#xD;
      the second health system goal mentioned above: long term retention on ART.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main RapIT study focuses on rapid initiation of ART, with short-term (6-month) attrition&#xD;
      from treatment and viral suppression as the primary outcomes. In this supplemental study, we&#xD;
      will evaluate the role of NCDs and NCD risk factors on long-term retention on ART, with&#xD;
      outcomes including mortality, loss to follow up, viral suppression and immunologic&#xD;
      improvement, and physical functioning, ability to perform normal daily activities, and&#xD;
      economic productivity among patients already on ART. The study will enroll up to 400 adult&#xD;
      patients already on ART for â‰¥ 12 months at the RapIT study site. At enrollment, consented&#xD;
      subjects will be screened for elevated levels of several NCD risk factors including body mass&#xD;
      index; glucose using HbA1c levels; blood pressure and cholesterol; as well as signs of&#xD;
      abnormalities in hepatic, renal, and lung function. A medical history will be taken, and a&#xD;
      questionnaire will gather information about chronic pain, alcohol use, smoking, physical&#xD;
      functioning, ability to perform normal daily activities, and economic productivity. Referral&#xD;
      for further NCD diagnosis and care will be offered as needed. Existing electronic medical&#xD;
      records will be accessed to obtain retrospective data since ART initiation and to follow&#xD;
      subjects prospectively for up to 24 months after the enrollment screening is completed. Six&#xD;
      months after enrollment, subjects with NCDs or at high risk of NCDs will be re-screened at a&#xD;
      routine ART medication pickup visit to assess uptake of referral and whether risks,&#xD;
      conditions, or outcomes have changed. The study will help identify reasons for poor outcomes&#xD;
      on ART and point to interventions that will help achieve the overall goals of the national&#xD;
      ART program.&#xD;

        The study population will be non-pregnant adults who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
        for HIV at least 12 months prior to study enrollment and are at least 35 years old. The age&#xD;
        restriction will allow the study to focus on older patients who are at greater risk of&#xD;
        NCDs. Pregnant women will be excluded because they face a different set of NCD risks&#xD;
        directly related to pregnancy; women less than 6 months post-partum are also excluded to&#xD;
        allow for the remaining effects of pregnancy.&#xD;
