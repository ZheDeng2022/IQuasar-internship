    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:Sleep Disorders are very common during pregnancy but the their exact role in&#xD;
      causation of pregnancy related disorders is yet to be determined. OSA can complicate&#xD;
      pregnancy given the risk factors of weight gain, upper displacement of the diaphragm, and&#xD;
      hormonal-induced hyperaemia of the nasopharyngeal passages. SDB confers the risk of&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and foetal&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would involve pregnant females which would be prospectively followed in pregnancy&#xD;
      and post partum to know the prevalence of sleep disorders in pregnancy. Diagnosis of sleep&#xD;
      disorders would be confirmed by overnight polysomnography and ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring. Pregnancy outcomes, both maternal and fetal would be recorded and its relation&#xD;
      with sleep disorders in pregnancy would be analysed.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess sleep quality during pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To know prevalence of various sleep disorders during pregnancy including restless leg&#xD;
           syndrome, symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the effect of sleep disorders on maternal and fetal outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the relation of obstructive sleep apnea with pregnancy induced hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material &amp; Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Longitudinal prospective case-control study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consecutive patients undergoing antenatal check up at the Antenatal Clinic at AIIMS&#xD;
           hospital during will be evaluated using questionnaires for sleep quality. Preliminary&#xD;
           screening question for sleep disturbance in pregnancy to all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires used: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (covers insomnia, RLS, snoring and&#xD;
           sleep related breathing disorders); Epworth Sleepiness Score (for Excessive daytime&#xD;
           sleepiness); Modified Wisconsin Score; Modified Berlin Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To now association between Obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy induced hypertension&#xD;
           patients who develop symptomatic OSA will be offered polysomnographic evaluation during&#xD;
           the second/third trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An offer of similar services will be made to pregnant females who do not develop&#xD;
           pregnancy induced hypertension at a similar gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case: patient with OSA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: patients without OSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We proposed to determine that what proportion of the cases were exposed to sleep&#xD;
           disorders and what proportion are not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We also planned to determine what proportion of controls is exposed and what proportion&#xD;
           is not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases and controls would be matched for age ,parity, BMI,previous h/o pre-eclampsia in first&#xD;
      trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence of various sleep disorders in pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maternal outcome: Development of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), gestational&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus, complicated pregnancy requiring admission, preterm delivery,&#xD;
           ante-partum hemorrhage, delivery requiring intervention (Caesarian section,&#xD;
           forceps/ventouse application)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fetal outcome: APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min, IUGR, IUD, low birth weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of convenience of 200 patients (who respond to questionnaire) and satisfy inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be followed up prospectively to assess the effect of sleep&#xD;
      disorders on pregnancy outcome.As per estimates from literature sample size for case control&#xD;
      part would be 20 for cases and 40 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation specifically related to projects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using Somnomedic systems, GmbH polysomnography machine by trained staff nurses and&#xD;
           technicians at:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obstetrics ward, AIIMS hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Home based portable PSG in non admitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ambulatory blood pressure by the Oscar 2™ system from SunTech Medical, USA. The Oscar 2&#xD;
           is clinically validated to all three internationally recognized standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  British Hypertension Society1 (A/A)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  European Society of Hypertension International Protocol2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AAMI SP103&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient comfort The Oscar 2 and the Orbit™ BP cuff make patient comfort a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The SunTech Medical, Inc. patented Orbit cuff uses an innovative stretch-sleeve&#xD;
                design to maintain cuff placement and promote patient comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Oscar 2 is a light, compact monitor that uses motion tolerant algorithms to&#xD;
                reduce re-inflates and failed readings. The auto-intelligent inflation pressure&#xD;
                also reduces measurement time, promoting patient comfort by controlling cuff&#xD;
                inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening Polysomnography using Apnea linkTM PLUS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A quick and easy sleep-screening tool designed to help identify more patients at&#xD;
                risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A premium, compact device that can be used at home&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Investigation Required&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine clinical antenatal examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure measurement&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  These investigations are routinely done in ante natal clinic at AIIMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected on a pre-designed proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis will be performed using STATA 11 for Windows software (intercooled&#xD;
           version, Stata Corporation, Houston, TX, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After assessing for approximate normal distribution, all continuous variables will be&#xD;
           summarized as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Categorical variables will be expressed as n (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cases and controls will be compared using unpaired t-test if the data was normally&#xD;
           distributed and the Mann-Whitney U test if not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A p values of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confounding factors influencing pregnancy outcomes will be subject to multivariate&#xD;
           analysis to determine significance.&#xD;
