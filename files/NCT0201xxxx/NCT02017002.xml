    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is a technically complex procedure which is associated&#xD;
      with high perioperative mortality, even in high volume centers[1]. To facilitate the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery of esophagectomies patients by reducing surgical trauma, an increasing&#xD;
      number of surgeons have attempted minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) to treat patients&#xD;
      with esophageal cancer.[2-10] However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal method for&#xD;
      performing an esophagectomy with the minimally invasive surgical technique. In addition, the&#xD;
      benefit of this approach has not been well confirmed based on the limited retrospective&#xD;
      comparative studies at the present time [3, 11-12], although its potential benefit improving&#xD;
      the immediate postoperative including the total morbidity and pulmonary complication has been&#xD;
      demonstrated by meta-analyses[13]. Especially it is unclear whether adding laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures in MIE can contribute to further improvement of the perioperative outcome of the&#xD;
      patients.[3] Previously, the investigators have found that adding of laparoscopic procedure&#xD;
      in performing the esophageal reconstruction procedure after VATS esophagectomy can provide&#xD;
      further benefit in reducing the postoperative major complications and fasten the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery16. For the most cases, the patients was receiving tri-incision&#xD;
      esophagectomy, i.e. VATS esophagectomy in the chest, laparoscopic gastric mobilization in the&#xD;
      abdomen and left cervical esophagogastrostomy. In such circumstances, a cervical incision was&#xD;
      required for esophagogastrostomy after esophagectomy and gastric mobilization. However, for&#xD;
      the patients with lower-to mid third esophageal cancer, some surgeon performed Ivor Lewis&#xD;
      esophagectomy, which performing the esophagogastrostomy in the chest after gastric&#xD;
      mobilization without cervical incision wound. Although both of these procedures have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be feasible and safe, there is much debate about the advantage and&#xD;
      disadvantage of these two approaches. For tri-incision esophagectomy, patients have the&#xD;
      chance to have cervical lymph node dissection and the esophagus can be resected up to the&#xD;
      neck. However, it is more time-consuming and associated with more surgical trauma by adding a&#xD;
      cervical incisional wound and more tissue dissection around the cervical trachea as compared&#xD;
      to that done by Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. In contrast, for the Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, the&#xD;
      resection of esophagus was limited to the level of thoracic inlet and cervical lymph node&#xD;
      dissection was impossible unless a neck incision was further created. However, it takes less&#xD;
      time in performing the whole procedure by saving a neck incision.&#xD;

      Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is a technically complex procedure which is associated&#xD;

      For the most cases, the patients was receiving tri-incision esophagectomy, i.e. VATS&#xD;

      cervical esophagogastrostomy. In such circumstances, a cervical incision was required for&#xD;
      esophagogastrostomy after esophagectomy and gastric mobilization. However, for the patients&#xD;

      which performing the esophagogastrostomy in the chest after gastric mobilization without&#xD;

      unless a neck incision was further created. However, it takes less time in performing the&#xD;
      whole procedure by saving a neck incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we would conduct a prospective randomized study to compare the surgical&#xD;
      results between the Tri-incision and Ivor Lewis approaches for esophagectomy in treating&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. Both of the procedures will be performed by video-assisted thoracic&#xD;
      surgical (VATS) esophagectomy and laparoscopic gastric mobilization and esophageal&#xD;
      reconstruction. The primary end-point will be the overall survival and secondary end-point&#xD;
      would be perioperative complication, postoperative recovery and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods This study will include patients with a diagnosis of esophageal cancer&#xD;
      who will undergo curative surgical resection in the surgical department of the National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital. All the patients will receive staging study for the tumor&#xD;
      including computed tomography (CT) of the brain, neck, chest and abdomen, panendoscopy with&#xD;
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), position emission tomography with computed tomography&#xD;
      (optionally) and bronchoscopy for the tumor locating at the mid-to-low third of thoracic&#xD;
      esophagus. The patient was cared according to the perioperative routine protocols of the&#xD;
      thoracic surgical department of the National Taiwan University Hospital, including&#xD;
      preoperative respiratory and exercise training, nutritional support and postoperative&#xD;
      bronchoscopic toileting, and chest physical therapy. Jejunostomy feeding was started in the&#xD;
      postoperative day 2 or 3, the oral intake was started 10 days to 2 weeks after surgery once&#xD;
      no anastomotic leakage is demonstrated by the contrast swallowing image studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor lung function with FEV1 less than 70% of prediction. Major systemic co-morbidity : e.g.&#xD;
      CVA, end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of tracheal invasion or distant metastasis of the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end pint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease-free survival duration Surgical complication Postoperative ICU stay and hospital stay&#xD;
      Quality of Life Change of lung function after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and perioperative care Epidural analgesia once agreed by the patients was&#xD;
      administered before surgery. The patients were intubated and ventilated with double-lumen&#xD;
      endotracheal tube during surgery. After surgery, extubation was given once satisfactory&#xD;
      general condition including oxygenation, spontaneous breathing and vital signs are observed.&#xD;
      However, temporary ventilator support will be given to the patients with high surgical risk&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit (ICU) and was weaned off based on weaning parameters and the&#xD;
      general condition of the patients. Jejunostomy feeding was begun after stool or flatus&#xD;
      passage was detected. Oral intake began after an esophagogram examination revealed no&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage, and was usually 10 to 14 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative clinical follow-up The patients will be followed up in the out-patient clinics&#xD;
      after discharge at least tri monthly. Pan-endoscopy, computer tomography of brain, neck,&#xD;
      chest and abdomen will be done every three months immediately 2 years after surgery and every&#xD;
      six months thereafter. Life quality and lung function will be evaluated one, three and six&#xD;
      months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the difference of 10% in postoperative complication between the two groups of study, 50&#xD;
      patients will be required to recruited in each study group. The status of surgical&#xD;
      complications, disease progression or recurrence and survival will be evaluated each year.&#xD;
      Any significant difference once detected under analysis will call to early termination of the&#xD;
      study to protect the patients from injury by inadequate treatment.&#xD;
