  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An isolated bout of unaccustomed maximal eccentric exercise is associated with muscle force&#xD;
      loss for 2-4 days, mild reversible muscle tenderness, and ultra-structural damage to the&#xD;
      muscle fibers, elevation of muscle proteins in serum, and a detriment in range of motion.&#xD;
      This single center, pilot study is designed to optimize conditions for the robust measurement&#xD;
      of functional deficits after muscle damage and to identify markers of repair over 22 days to&#xD;
      inform future intervention studies. The primary measure will be limb force (assessed&#xD;
      electronically from the ergometer), previous studies have demonstrated that functional&#xD;
      measures return fairly rapidly, usually between 2-4 days. Additionally, several biomarkers of&#xD;
      muscle function will be measured over 22 days, as well as changes in protein synthesis in&#xD;
      biopsy samples Deuterium-labelled water (D2O) will be consumed by all study participants from&#xD;
      Day-3 through Day 22 to aid in quantifying newly synthesized proteins.&#xD;
