  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity is a very important problem in this country. Prematurity can cause problems with&#xD;
      organ (such as the brain, heart, kidneys) growth and development. A very important part of&#xD;
      keeping premature babies healthy is ensuring good blood flow to all of these organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some premature babies have problems with their hearts and getting enough blood out to the&#xD;
      rest of their bodies. This problem is referred to as hypotension (low blood pressure) and is&#xD;
      found by looking at blood test values and while examining the baby. These babies will need&#xD;
      medications to help their heart deliver blood to all of the important areas in their bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies who have hypotension requiring medications tend to have more problems than premature&#xD;
      babies that don't need hypotension medication. Some of these problems include a higher risk&#xD;
      of bleeding into their brain, kidney problems, liver problems, intestinal (gut) problems&#xD;
      causing difficulty tolerating feeds, and a very dangerous infection of their intestines. Some&#xD;
      long term effects include hearing loss, developmental delay, and learning problems in the&#xD;
      future that are worse than other premature babies who did not have hypotension. Hypotensive&#xD;
      premature babies also have a higher risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of hypotension in the first week of life is still not known. We know that babies&#xD;
      have to get used to being in the outside world instead of in the womb. A lot of changes with&#xD;
      the heart and lungs have to happen for them to not be affected by that transition. If we&#xD;
      could gain a better understanding of those changes, we might be able to prevent some of these&#xD;
      issues from happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look closely at premature babies with and without hypotension to assess the&#xD;
      heart and lung changes in the first week of life. To do this, we will use monitoring machines&#xD;
      and tests to get a better idea of all the changes that happen. This information will help all&#xD;
      neonatologists who care for premature babies.&#xD;

      Screening Phase: The subject's parents/guardians/legally authorized representative will be&#xD;
      approached if the infant's birth weight makes them eligible for this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase: During this study, we will use the monitoring methods normally used in the&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and some new monitoring methods to find out all the&#xD;
      changes that the infant's heart and lungs go through during the first week after delivery.&#xD;
      During this period the study doctor and staff will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect demographic (age, race, ethnicity) and labor/delivery information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform serial physical exams to evaluate the infant's skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Take several blood samples (2-3 drops per sample) to measure the lactate, troponin, and&#xD;
           creatinine levels. These blood samples will be taken 1-4 times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform Echocardiograms (ultrasound of the heart) on a daily or more or less frequent&#xD;
           basis. In between echocardiograms, we will monitor cardiac output with a non-invasive&#xD;
           monitor using leads similar to those used for regular heart rate monitoring in the NICU.&#xD;
           These tests are being done solely for research purposes and will be paid for by the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measure the amount of blood flow reaching the infant's brain and kidneys using a&#xD;
           near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) machine. This test is being done solely for research&#xD;
           purposes and will be paid for by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Perform Electrocardiograms (ECGs) to monitor how much blood flow is reaching the&#xD;
           infant's heart. The sticky pads required for this test will be attached to the infant's&#xD;
           chest as part of his/her routine care. For the purposes of this study, we will&#xD;
           continuously monitor the machine to record the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Measure the amount of blood flowing in one of the arteries in the brain using cerebral&#xD;
           Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Record results from any other monitoring tools the infant's doctor is using as part of&#xD;
           his/her routine care. This will help us identify patterns that might lead to issues in&#xD;
           premature babies. We will also be studying the effects of any medications the infant's&#xD;
           doctor prescribes; especially those used for low blood pressure.&#xD;
