      The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of a single preoperative dose of vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol, intraoperative oxytocin infusion, IV carbetocin and pericervical tourniquet for&#xD;
      the reduction of blood loss during of abdominal myomectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common benign tumours among women. Fibroids are&#xD;
      found in approximately 20% of women over 35 years of age. They are mostly asymptomatic, but&#xD;
      in 20-50% of patients, fibroids may cause problems such as heavy menstrual bleeding, anaemia,&#xD;
      pelvic pain and pressure,symptoms from extrinsic compression of the colorectal and urinary&#xD;
      tract,recurrent abortion and infertility. Surgery is indicated for symptomatic uterine&#xD;
      leiomyomas; hysterectomy for women who have completed childbearing (women &gt; 40 years old),&#xD;
      and myomectomy for women &lt;40 years old who wish to preserve uterine and fertility .Myomectomy&#xD;
      can be accomplished by laparotomy, laparoscopy, or hysteroscopy (transvaginal) approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine fibroids have a rich blood supply which may result in intensive bleeding during the&#xD;
      myomectomy procedure.This surgical procedure may be associated with substantial morbidity, in&#xD;
      particular major blood loss especially in abdominal myomectomy. Fletcher reported that 23%&#xD;
      patients undergoing open myomectomy lost over 1000ml of blood. Other studies reported the&#xD;
      operative blood loss range between 100 ml and 3000 mls. Blood transfusion can be required in&#xD;
      up to 20% of the women during abdominal myomectomy and may require hysterectomy in up to 2%&#xD;
      of patient undergoing abdominal myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of interventions have been introduced to reduce bleeding rate during myomectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. interventions on uterine arteries as peri cervical mechanical tourniquet, preoperative&#xD;
           clamping or embolization of bilateral uterine and/or ovarian arteries (UAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. uterotonics as ergometrine, oxytocin, misoprostol, peri-operative injection of ascorbic&#xD;
           acid, or intraoperative vasopressin or terlipressin injection (hormonal tourniquet) into&#xD;
           myometrium , or intra-myometrial infiltration of bupivacaine plus epinephrine,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. myoma dissection techniques as use of laser, electrosurgery and chemical dissectors such&#xD;
           as mesna.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. GnRH analogues reduce haemorrhage during surgery if used for 2-4 months preoperatively.&#xD;
           GnRH analogues are expensive and may make removing fibroids difficult because of reduced&#xD;
           distinction between capsule and myometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these strategies may be associated with some complications, and some of these are&#xD;
      ineffective or expensive or require extra steps before the actual procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Foley catheter, often used as a tourniquet in low resource countries, is cheap and&#xD;
      readily available;however, they require intermittent release intraoperatively to prevent the&#xD;
      build-up of toxins and tissue ischemia, and may be impracticable to apply sometimes. Once the&#xD;
      tourniquet is removed, there is bleeding from the raw myometrium and cavities with the&#xD;
      possibility of increased blood loss and blood transfusion. Tourniquet occlusion of uterine&#xD;
      and ovarian vessels prior to myomectomy was reported by Kongenyuy et al to have higher&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing intraoperative blood loss when compared to other interventions.&#xD;
      Mechanical vascular occlusion techniques such as tourniquet or uterine artery embolization,&#xD;
      though popular in recent years have significant disadvantages as (i) require additional&#xD;
      interventions or a separate procedure during the operation (ii) difficulty of access to the&#xD;
      uterine artery with large and laterally placed myomas and (iii) difficulty of placing the&#xD;
      tourniquet. In practice,there are instances when application of the tourniquet is&#xD;
      impracticable and another method is indicated as in case of significant pelvic adhesions and&#xD;
      leiomyoma in the broad ligament, uterine isthmus or cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical agents are always an attractive option to arrest haemorrhage. Preoperative&#xD;
      Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, was registered in many countries for use in&#xD;
      gynaecology and obstetrics. Its popularity in developing countries is accounted by its&#xD;
      advantages over other interventions as being inexpensive choice with thermal and light&#xD;
      stability and shelf life of several years in tropical conditions. It acts by promoting&#xD;
      myometrial contractions and reducing uterine artery blood flow significantly and thus&#xD;
      reducing bleeding during myomectomy . Reports on misoprostol use to control blood loss in&#xD;
      abdominal myomectomy showed a reduction in intra and post-operative blood loss, surgical&#xD;
      time, and post-operative blood transfusion . Misoprostol has advantage of multiple routes of&#xD;
      administration as sublingual, oral, rectal or vaginal. The bioavailability curve of rectal&#xD;
      and vaginal misoprostol is qualitatively similar although rectal route has longer half-life&#xD;
      with lesser side effects than oral route. The peak plasma level of 400 Î¼g of vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol is reached one to two hours after administration and is sustained for four hours,&#xD;
      and the side effects are self-limiting . Another advantage of Misoprostol is that it is much&#xD;
      cheaper than GnRH analogues; the most popular method for reducing bleeding in myomectomy&#xD;
      operation. Another advantage over GnRH analogues is that the effect of GnRH analogues&#xD;
      achieved only after an average time of 3 months while misoprostol can be administered an hour&#xD;
      before the operation and significantly reduces intra-operative blood loss. Side effects of&#xD;
      misoprostol appear within 90 minutes of administration, i.e., while patient is under&#xD;
      anaesthesia and are less disturbing in nature such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, fever and chills. Single dose of misoprostol is associated with lower incidence of&#xD;
      shivering and hyperpyrexia and with no serious systemic side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin is a hormone secreted mainly from the pituitary gland. Its main function is uterine&#xD;
      contraction during labour and delivery. Oxytocin is the agent of choice in the prevention of&#xD;
      postpartum uterine atony and bleeding. Oxytocin acts directly on the myometrium through the&#xD;
      oxytocin receptor(OXTR) and stimulates contractions. Oxytocin affects oxytocin receptors in&#xD;
      the myometrium and fibroid tissue, which stimulates synthesis and release of contractile&#xD;
      prostaglandins. Increased uterine contractility directly affects uterine vascular structures,&#xD;
      decreasing blood supply to the arteries and fibroids. Decreased blood volume in the uterus&#xD;
      and constricted uterine vasculature due to uterine contraction and vaso-constrictive effect&#xD;
      of oxytocin results in reducing intraoperative blood loss. Oxytocin receptors also exist in&#xD;
      the nonpregnant uterus with a 50-100 times lower concentration than in pregnant uterus.The&#xD;
      expression of oxytocin receptors have been identified in the endometrium as well as in the&#xD;
      microvascular endothelial cells of the myometrium. Further, oxytocin receptors were found to&#xD;
      be higher in fibroids than in normal myometrium. Main side effects caused by oxytocin are&#xD;
      tachycardia, hyponatremia and hypotension but usually these side effects don't occur with low&#xD;
      doses but it should be used cautiously because an intravenous bolus of 10 IU oxytocin could&#xD;
      be detrimental to women with heart disease or to women who are hypovolemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, oxytocin has a short half-life (4-10 minutes), necessitating continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion. Moreover, saturation of myometrial oxytocin receptors could reduce its&#xD;
      effectiveness, and excessive dosing can lead to coronary-artery contraction and hypotension;&#xD;
      additionally, water intoxication can occur owing to its anti-diuretic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbetocin is a long-acting synthetic octapeptide analogue of oxytocin(which is a&#xD;
      nonapeptide) with agonist properties at the oxytocin receptor. The molecular changes give&#xD;
      Carbetocin more stability and avoid early decomposition .Originally, it is an obstetric drug&#xD;
      used to control postpartum hemorrhage . In recent times, it has been studied in the reduction&#xD;
      of bleeding during myomectomy, but the available data are limited. The pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      properties of Carbetocin are comparable to those of endogenous oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbetocin selectively binds to oxytocin receptors in the smooth muscle of the uterus&#xD;
      resulting in rhythmic uterine contractions, increased frequency of existing contractions, and&#xD;
      increased uterine tone. During surgery, addition of carbetocin will lead to strong muscle&#xD;
      contractions that makes myometrium pale with less bleeding and myoma will become more&#xD;
      protruding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be administered as a single-dose injection, either intravenously or intramuscularly or&#xD;
      can be given intramyometrial. Intravenously administered Carbetocin has a half-life of&#xD;
      approximately 40 minutes, around 4-10 times longer than that reported for oxytocin. Following&#xD;
      intramuscular injection, Carbetocin reaches peak plasma concentrations in less than 30&#xD;
      minutes and has 80% bioavailability. Carbetocin onset of action is rapid irrespective of&#xD;
      administration route, but duration of action is longer following intramuscular injection as&#xD;
      contractions continue for 60 minutes after the intravenous injection and for 120 minutes&#xD;
      after the intramuscular administration. The optimal Carbetocin dose (intravenous or&#xD;
      intramuscular) is100 Î¼g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative uterine embolization decreases blood loss during a myomectomy, however, this&#xD;
      option is limited by the accessibility of equipment and by having trained physicians to&#xD;
      complete the procedure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressin is not a cost-effective choice and there can be associated pulmonary oedema,&#xD;
      temporary increase in blood pressure and myocardial infarction with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will compare the effectiveness of a single preoperative dose of vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol ,intraoperative oxyÂ¬tocin infusion, IV carbetocin and pericervical tourniquet for&#xD;
      the reduction of blood loss at the time of abdominal myomectomy.&#xD;
