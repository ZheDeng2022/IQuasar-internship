      Aim: Orthognathic surgeries are generally associated with blood loss, swelling, postoperative&#xD;
      nausea vomiting (PONV), and pain. The aim of this study is to improve postoperative outcome&#xD;
      in patients undergoing orthognatic surgeries by the use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery&#xD;
      (ERAS) protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material methods: After Ethics Committee approval (2020/965), the data of 90 patients who&#xD;
      underwent elective orthognathic surgery, were investigated. Following standard monitorization&#xD;
      and general anesthesia; Group 1 patients were applied traditional approach and received&#xD;
      intraoperative 10 mL/kg/h IV izolen infusion. Group 2 received ERAS approach. Patients in&#xD;
      Group 2 did not preoperatively smoke for 48 hours, drank clear liquids until the last 2&#xD;
      hours, and received 6 mL/kg/h IV izolen intraoperatively. In these; gastric aspiration was&#xD;
      also applied before extubation, PONV prophylaxis and patient controlled analgesia was added&#xD;
      to the routine plans for the first postoperative 48 hours. The primary endpoint was length of&#xD;
      hospital stay. The secondary endpoints were intraoperative follow-up data, length of&#xD;
      postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, opioid&#xD;
      consumption and PONV incidences through the postoperative first 48 hours, and satisfaction&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;

      Aim: Orthognathic surgeries are extensive surgeries including both soft and hard tissues of&#xD;
      the facial region of the skull associated with blood loss, inflammatory reactions, massive&#xD;
      swelling, postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV), and severe pain. Therefore; in most of the&#xD;
      patients who are with dentofacial deformity and undergo orthognathic surgery, postoperative&#xD;
      recovery generally requires a long troublesome period. The aim of this study is to improve&#xD;
      postoperative outcome by the use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material methods: After Ethics Committee approval (2020/965), the data of 90 patients who&#xD;
      underwent elective orthognathic surgery, were investigated. Following standard monitorization&#xD;
      and general anesthesia; Group 1 patients were applied traditional approach and received&#xD;
      intraoperative 10 mL/kg/h IV izolen infusion. Rescue analgesics and PONV prophylaxis were&#xD;
      applied when required through the postoperative first 48 hours. Group 2 received ERAS&#xD;
      approach. Patients in Group 2 did not preoperatively smoke for 48 hours, drank clear liquids&#xD;
      until the last 2 hours, and received 6 mL/kg/h IV izolen infusion intraoperatively. In these;&#xD;
      gastric aspiration was also applied before extubation, PONV prophylaxis was supported&#xD;
      routinely, and patient controlled analgesia was added to the routine analgesia plan for the&#xD;
      first postoperative 48 hours. The primary endpoint was length of hospital stay. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints were intraoperative follow-up data, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, opioid&#xD;
      consumption, PONV incidences, length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, satisfaction&#xD;
      scores of two groups through the postoperative first 48 hours.&#xD;
