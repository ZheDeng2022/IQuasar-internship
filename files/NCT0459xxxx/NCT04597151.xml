  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial evaluates the feasibility of a group diet education program for stage I-IV&#xD;
      colorectal cancer survivors. Providing a nutrition education program for colon and rectal&#xD;
      cancer survivors may help them have better access to the tools necessary to make healthy food&#xD;
      decisions that can impact their cancer outcomes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the feasibility and acceptability of a group diet education intervention for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFGH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe perceived barriers to healthy diet among CRC survivors at ZSFGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate for differences in feasibility and acceptability of a group diet education&#xD;
      program, based on sociodemographic factors such as education, food insecurity, employment,&#xD;
      and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore changes in health-related behaviors pre and post intervention using a&#xD;
      validated lifestyle score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attend group diet education sessions over 1.5-2 hours every 2 weeks (weeks 1, 3, and&#xD;
      5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Lifestyle Score on the National Institute of Health (NIH)/ National Cancer Institute (NCI) Automated Self- Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ASA24Â® Dietary Assessment Tool is a free, web-based tool that enables multiple, automatically coded, self-administered 24-hour diet recalls and/or single or multi-day food records, also known as food diaries. The ASA24 system consists of a respondent website used to collect dietary intake data and a researcher website used to manage study logistics and obtain nutrient and food group data files to obtain analysis files for 65 nutrients and 37 food groups. This data is used to generate a standardized lifestyle score pre- and post-intervention with possible range: 0-7, based on participant's body mass index and intake of fruits and vegetables, fiber, ultra-processed foods, red meat, processed meat, sugar-sweetened drinks, and alcohol. This standardized score quantifies the degree to which participants' lifestyles are consistent with the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) / American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR) Recommendations.</description>
