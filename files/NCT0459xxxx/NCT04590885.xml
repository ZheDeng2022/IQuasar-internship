      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the Couple Communication Skills Training&#xD;
      (CCST) intervention in 250 patients with advanced cancer and their spouses/intimate partners.&#xD;
      Couples will be randomized 1:1 to receive either the CCST or to an attention control&#xD;
      condition (Healthy Living Information; HLI). We will evaluate CCST effects on a range of&#xD;
      patient and partner relationship and psychological outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients and their intimate partners, advanced cancer poses significant challenges that&#xD;
      can negatively impact both individuals and the couple's collective well-being. Couples'&#xD;
      ability to communicate openly and effectively with each other about cancer-related concerns&#xD;
      can improve their psychological adjustment and quality of their relationship. Open and&#xD;
      effective communication may also lead to better symptom management and goal-concordant care.&#xD;
      However, many couples report difficulties communicating about cancer, even in the context of&#xD;
      overall satisfying relationships. This can have a number of deleterious consequences,&#xD;
      including deficits in emotional support, decreases in intimacy and relationship quality, and&#xD;
      increased psychological distress. Thus, interventions designed to facilitate effective&#xD;
      communication between cancer patients and their partners are likely to have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on both individual and relationship functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research, including studies conducted by our team, has found that couple-based&#xD;
      interventions that target communication lead to positive outcomes for cancer patients and&#xD;
      their partners. However, most prior studies have been limited by reliance on an in-person&#xD;
      treatment delivery format which keeps many couples from participating. In addition, prior&#xD;
      studies have not targeted interventions to couples who are most likely to benefit. There is&#xD;
      increasing evidence that psychosocial interventions for cancer, including couple-based&#xD;
      interventions, should be targeted to those at risk of poor outcomes. Our prior research&#xD;
      indicates that couples who report communication difficulties (e.g., high levels of holding&#xD;
      back from discussing cancer-related concerns) have increased psychological distress and&#xD;
      poorer relationship functioning and are most likely to benefit from a couple communication&#xD;
      intervention specifically designed to addressed their communication problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are (1)To determine whether CCST significantly improves&#xD;
      patients' and partners' individual psychological adjustment (i.e., psychological distress,&#xD;
      life completion) and patient health and health care outcomes (physical well-being, symptom&#xD;
      distress, advance care planning discussions and completion of advance directives,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and emergency department visits) compared to an education condition. (2) To&#xD;
      determine whether, for couples receiving the CCST intervention, improvements in psychological&#xD;
      adjustment, relationship functioning, and patient health are mediated by improvements in&#xD;
      their communication, including objective measures of communication quality and communal&#xD;
      coping (e.g., &quot;we-talk&quot;) derived from couple conversations and self-reported protective&#xD;
      buffering. (3) To examine differences in response to the CCST intervention for patients&#xD;
      versus partners, for male versus female participants, and for patients with different cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses (breast, lung, GI, GU). (4) To conduct an implementation-related process evaluation&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
