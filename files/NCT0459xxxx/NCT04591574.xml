  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On discharge from intensive care (ICU) patients are often severely anaemic (have a low level&#xD;
      of haemoglobin (Hb) in their red blood cells (RBC)). Anaemia can persist for many months&#xD;
      making patients feel tired and fatigued. Regaining pre-illness health and energy levels can&#xD;
      take a long time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ABC Post Intensive Care Trial will be the first trial to investigate if an anaemic ICU&#xD;
      patient's health can be improved by treating with RBC transfusions following ICU discharge.&#xD;
      We will compare the current approach as per national guidelines (restrictive transfusion),&#xD;
      with a more active transfusion regime to correct anaemia from ICU discharge to hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will take place in acute hospitals throughout the UK where patients are discharged&#xD;
      after a period of time in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients discharged, or ready for discharge from ICU will be approached to consider&#xD;
      participation in the trial. Once Hb level drops below 94g/L they would become eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion (subject to meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria). The main indication for being&#xD;
      excluded from participating in the trial is that transfusions are contraindicated (not&#xD;
      appropriate for the patient) or they have an objection to blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group allocation will be randomly assigned at ICU discharge. We will explore which patients&#xD;
      benefit most from transfusions and those who gain no benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have their Hb level checked at least weekly whilst in hospital and based on the&#xD;
      result will have RBC transfusions as required according to the treatment regime they were&#xD;
      randomised to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the research is based on self-reported quality of life so participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a number of questionnaires at set time-points from randomisation to 6 months post&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be actively on trial for approximately 6 months. The five-year follow&#xD;
      will be done using routinely collected data from national databases.&#xD;
