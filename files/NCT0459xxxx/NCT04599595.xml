    <textblock>
      MS (Multiple Sclerosis) is the most common neurological disease involving disabilities in&#xD;
      young adults, with bowel symptoms, in particular constipation and fecal incontinence. The&#xD;
      main objectives of the study are to assess the prevalence, characteristics, severity and&#xD;
      impact on the Quality of Life of intestinal disorders in this population, to correlate the&#xD;
      severity and characteristics of constipation and fecal incontinence with Intestinal Transit&#xD;
      Time and the time dedicated to the evacuation, and how these items change in relation to the&#xD;
      use of transanal irrigation (TAI). Another objective is to identify the composition of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota in MS patients in relation to the type of bowel characteristics,&#xD;
      comparing it with microbiota profile of the healthy population of the same region of origin,&#xD;
      Emilia-Romagna, Italy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS (Multiple Sclerosis) is the most common neurological disease involving disabilities in&#xD;
      young adults, with Central Nervous System involvement in both the brain and spinal cord. In a&#xD;
      recent review, its incidence in the United Kingdom is estimated at 7 new cases per 100,00&#xD;
      inhabitants per year, with a prevalence of about 100,000 patients. Bowel symptoms, in&#xD;
      particular constipation and faecal incontinence, affect more than two thirds of MS patients,&#xD;
      and have a significant impact on patients' quality of life (QoL) by significantly limiting&#xD;
      their social, occupational and emotional life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, bowel management based on Transanal Irrigation (TAI) has also been proposed in&#xD;
      patients with MS, but TAI efficacy on intestinal transit time and patient's compliance with&#xD;
      TAI have not been defined yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the prevalence, characteristics, severity and&#xD;
      impact on the Quality of Life of intestinal disorders in patients who consecutively refer to&#xD;
      the neurological clinic for the diagnosis and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis at Ferrara&#xD;
      University Hospital, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to correlate the severity and characteristics of constipation and&#xD;
      fecal incontinence with intestinal transit time and the type of faeces evacuated according to&#xD;
      the Bristol Stool Form Scale; to evaluate the costs in terms of the precautions (diapers,&#xD;
      traverses, drugs, medicated clysms, etc.) and the time dedicated to the evacuation, and how&#xD;
      these items change in relation to the use of TAI; and finally, to study the composition of&#xD;
      the intestinal microbiota in MS patients in relation to the type of bowel characteristics,&#xD;
      comparing it with the profile of the healthy population of the same region of origin,&#xD;
      Emilia-Romagna, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposed is a monocentric prospective observational study. The study population&#xD;
      will be composed of patients who will consecutively refer to the Neurological Clinics of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy for a number of about 150 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two phases.The first phase will be the selection of eligible&#xD;
      patients by administering two self-filling questionnaires: PacQol (Patient Assessment of&#xD;
      Constipation Quality of Life) and NBD (Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PacQol score ≥ 32 will be sent to the surgical clinic for the second phase.&#xD;
      During the latter phase, patients will undergo a number of visits varying from 1 to 4&#xD;
      depending on the patient's willingness to continue the study. After the illustration of the&#xD;
      purpose and protocol of the study to the patient, classification of constipation and/or&#xD;
      faecal incontinence in accordance with the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria will be assessed,&#xD;
      with consideration of other possible etiopathogenetic factors other than MS. Further&#xD;
      questionnaires will be filled in to evaluate the disease status (Constipation scoring system&#xD;
      by Agachan-Wexner, Obstructed defecation score by Altomare, Fecal Incontinente grading scale&#xD;
      by Jorge-Wexner); if the patient will consent to the continuation of the study, he will be&#xD;
      given 7-days food diaries, evacuation diaries, radiopaque markers, stool collection container&#xD;
      and appointment date for plain abdominal X-ray which may coincide with the appointment for&#xD;
      examination number 2 (visit 2 or 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, radiopaque markers Intestinal Transit Study will be performed according to the&#xD;
      Bouchoucha procedure revised by Abrahamsson, which involves ingestion of 10 markers for 6&#xD;
      days at the same time and execution of a plain abdominal X-ray on the 7th day. During this&#xD;
      week the patient will complete an evacuation diary recording the time and number of&#xD;
      evacuations, the method of eventual bowel care, the consistency of faeces according to the&#xD;
      Bristol Scale, any episode of fecal incontinence, the type of hygiene measures in general,&#xD;
      the number of enemas, diapers, and any other garrison used in relation to the evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to collect a faecal sample in a container during the last week before&#xD;
      the following inspection at Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit, the outcome of the plain abdominal X-ray will be discussed, the&#xD;
      completed diaries will be collected, and the faecal sample will be stored at -20 C° and&#xD;
      subsequentely sent to the Laboratory of the Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology of the&#xD;
      University of Bologna, Italy for the analysis of the intestinal microbiome composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe NBD impairment will be offered the adoption of TAI as a way to manage&#xD;
      their own evacuation, replacing any other measure used until that moment (suppositoires,&#xD;
      enemas) with the exception of the possible intake of macrogols and/or prebiotics and/or&#xD;
      probiotics which instead can be continued. This treatment will be proposed to all patients&#xD;
      with severe impairment of intestinal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAI training with Peristeen will be carried out at the surgical clinic of the Surgical&#xD;
      Department of the Ferrara University Hospital, Italy, by the personnel involved in the study,&#xD;
      usually in a single session, but more sessions may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following 4 weeks, patients will continue to use the Peristeen at home according&#xD;
      to the instructions provided by the training staff collecting a stool sample each week.&#xD;
      During the last of the four weeks of TAI use patients will repeat the compilation of food&#xD;
      diaries, evacuation diaries, the radiopaque markers Transit Time, and collection of the stool&#xD;
      for microbiota analysis. The appointment for the radiography could coincide also in this case&#xD;
      with the following visit (visit 3 or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last visit the outcome of Transit Time X-ray will be discussed, completed diaries&#xD;
      and stool samples will be collected, and PAC-QoL questionnaire will be submitted to patients&#xD;
      who completed the study pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked about overall satisfaction of TAI treatment with Peristeen by means of&#xD;
      a numerical assessment from 0 to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, any comment will be noted as well any events that might be related to TAI irrigation&#xD;
      with Peristeen will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a neurological examination 3 months after the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole duration of the study will be of 2 years.&#xD;
