  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of movement and posture disorders responsible for&#xD;
      activity limitation due to brain damage that occurs during fetal development or during the&#xD;
      first year of a child's life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the multitude of treatment options available, the choice of treatment is a key&#xD;
      determinant that greatly influences the potential for improvement in motor function. This&#xD;
      choice is based in particular on a diagnosis resulting from the comparison of a Clinical Gait&#xD;
      Analysis (CGA) and a clinical examination, carried out by a practitioner, aimed at evaluating&#xD;
      as accurately as possible the deficiencies present in children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the latter examination, passive inter-segmental stiffness and spasticity, both&#xD;
      limiting factors in the mobility of the child with CP, are assessed. However, there are&#xD;
      significant uncertainties in these measurements, which depend, among other things, on the&#xD;
      examiner's feelings. The enrichment of this clinical assessment therefore requires the&#xD;
      introduction of quantitative and objective measures. Portable dynamometers are increasingly&#xD;
      used to measure the resistance of a joint during passive solicitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, both passive inter-segmental stiffness and spasticity can be characterized using&#xD;
      instrumental methods. However, in the majority of studies proposed in the literature, the&#xD;
      biomechanical computational model used is not unified with that of the CGA, thus altering the&#xD;
      approximation of the parameters measured on the table with those estimated during gait.&#xD;
      However, in order to evaluate the extent to which these phenomena occur during gait, it is&#xD;
      important to follow the same biomechanical calculation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our team proposes a new dynamometric measurement protocol for passive inter-segmental&#xD;
      stiffness and spasticity adapted to the PC child. Nevertheless, in order to guarantee the&#xD;
      reliability of the measurements, manual dynamometric solicitation methods must follow&#xD;
      standardized protocols, and their psychometric properties must be defined before they can be&#xD;
      used in clinical practice. This is why we wish to study the reliability of this new solution&#xD;
      for dynamometric quantification of passive inter-segmental stiffness and spasticity in&#xD;
      children with CP.&#xD;
