  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of SX-682 that can be given&#xD;
      alone and in combination with nivolumab in treating patients with RAS-Mutated, microsatellite&#xD;
      stable (MSS) colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). SX-682 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving SX-682 alone and&#xD;
      together with nivolumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of CXCR1/2 Inhibitor SX-682 (SX-682) alone and in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory RAS mutated microsatellite stable&#xD;
      (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), including the maximum dose that can be&#xD;
      administered until adverse effects prevent further dose increases (i.e., the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose [MTD] or recommended phase 2 dose), and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the efficacy of SX-682 in combination with nivolumab on the basis of the&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR), the duration of response, and the rate of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the single-dose and multidose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SX-682.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess overall survival (OS). II. Explore potential biomarkers associated with&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic and clinical response to SX-682 alone and combined with nivolumab, where the&#xD;
      biomarker measures include, but are not limited to, tumor CMS4, gene expression,&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations (KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutation status via ribonucleic&#xD;
      acid [RNA] and DNA sequencing), IRF2 (interferon regulatory factor 2) expression, lymphocyte&#xD;
      clonality (via sequencing), myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs), regulatory T-cells&#xD;
      (Tregs) and CD69/CD8 T cells, and in the circulation, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), T- and&#xD;
      B-cell subpopulations, neutrophils, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), MDSCs, Tregs,&#xD;
      the CD4:CD8 ratio, chemokines and cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of CXCR1/2 Inhibitor SX-682, followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONOTHERAPY STAGE: Patients receive SX-682 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMBINATION STAGE: Patients receive SX-682 PO BID on days 1-56 and nivolumab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 29. Treatment repeat every 56 days weeks for up to 12&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients with no have tumor response are followed up every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for 90 days, and patients with tumor response every 3 months for up to 6 months.&#xD;

          -  Women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L&#xD;
             or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to&#xD;
             the start of study drug&#xD;

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year while on study and for a period at least 6&#xD;
