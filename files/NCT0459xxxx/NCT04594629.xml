    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in 120 patients aged from 54-65 years scheduled for elective valve&#xD;
      replacement surgeries. Patients were randomly allocated to nitro glycerine or PGI2 groups.&#xD;
      Patients of nitro glycerine group received nebulized nitro glycerine at a rate of 2.5-5&#xD;
      mcg/kg/min (5 mg, 1 mg/ml) over 10 minutes by ultrasonic nebuliser. Patients of PGI2 group&#xD;
      received nebulized PGI2 (epoprostenol), 20000 ng/ml (20000 ng/ml in 60 ml syringe was&#xD;
      attached to an intravenous pump which delivers a titrating rate of 8 ml/h . The primary&#xD;
      outcome was mean pulmonary artery pressure. The secondary outcomes included mean arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure (MAP) (mmHg), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, cardiac index (CI) (l/min/m2) right ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (RVEF), central venous pressure(CVP) , 30-day mortality rate and the&#xD;
      incidence of complications such as facial flushing, hypotension and re-exploration for&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is the most challenging complication of valvular&#xD;
      heart disease about 73% of the patients particularly in those posted for mitral valve&#xD;
      replacement surgery Methods This prospective study was conducted in 120 patients aged from&#xD;
      54-65 years scheduled for elective valve replacement surgeries. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either nitro glycerine or PGI2 groups. Patients of nitro glycerine group&#xD;
      received nebulized nitro glycerine (its starting concentration was 200 mcg/ml); nitro&#xD;
      glycerine was delivered at a rate of 2.5-5 mcg/kg/min (5 mg, 1 mg/ml) over 10 minutes by&#xD;
      ultrasonic nebuliser connected to the inspiratory limb of the breathing circuit. Patients of&#xD;
      PGI2 group received nebulized PGI2 (epoprostenol), 20000 ng/ml (20000 ng/ml in 60 ml syringe&#xD;
      was attached to an intravenous pump which delivers a titrating rate of 8 ml/h to the&#xD;
      nebulizer compartment. The primary outcome was mean pulmonary artery pressure. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (mmHg), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, cardiac index&#xD;
      (CI) (l/min/m2) right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), central venous pressure(CVP)&#xD;
      measured at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass then 30 minutes after start of treatment then 4&#xD;
      hours after start of treatment, 30-day mortality rate and the incidence of complications such&#xD;
      as facial flushing, hypotension and re-exploration for bleeding.&#xD;
