      The FLORIDA (Fractional FLOw Reserve In cardiovascular DiseAses) study sought to investigate&#xD;
      outcomes of FFR-guided versus angiography-guided treatment strategies in a large, real-world&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;

      The objective of the FLORIDA study was to investigate mortality outcomes of FFR-guided versus&#xD;
      angiography-guided treatment strategies in a large, real-world patient cohort, including&#xD;
      patients with different stages of coronary artery disease as well as patients with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (ACS). All patients were followed for a period of 3 years after the index&#xD;
      date. The analysis period extended from the individual index date to the date of death or the&#xD;
      end of the 3-year follow-up period. Patients were matched for sex, presence of acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome, age ± 5 years, and propensity scores estimated with logistic regression based on 72&#xD;
      variables , with each FFR patient matched to the closest angiography-only patient&#xD;

        Out of a dataset of 4,395,540 anonymized age- and sex-stratified people from an anonymized&#xD;
        German health claims database, patients undergoing at least one inpatient coronary&#xD;
        angiography for suspected coronary artery disease between January 2014 and December 2015&#xD;
        were included in the analysis. The discharge date of the first hospital stay involving a&#xD;
        coronary angiography was defined as the patient's individual index date. Patients were&#xD;
        included into the study population regardless of their underlying disease (all-comers&#xD;
        approach), if they were observable for at least four years (one year prior the time of&#xD;
        inclusion and three years after the time of inclusion), or died within follow-up.&#xD;
