  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering that the cause of hemodynamic instability during OPCAB is closely related to&#xD;
      right ventricular dysfunction with pulmonary artery hypertension, the use of inhaled iloprost&#xD;
      (a selective pulmonary vasodilator) in patients undergoing OPCAB maybe beneficial for&#xD;
      hemodynamic management. Previous research has showed that inhaled iloprost reduce pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Therefore, by administering inhaled&#xD;
      iloprost before the graft anastomosis might improve cardiac output, mixed venous blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, and pulmonary oxygenation during the surgery especially during the graft&#xD;
      anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to evaluate the effect of inhaled Iloprost on hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.&#xD;
