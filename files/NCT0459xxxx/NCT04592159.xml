  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nabiximols for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in participants receiving selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial includes&#xD;
      a screening period of up to 28 days, an 8-week treatment period (comprising a 2-week&#xD;
      titration phase and a 6-week maintenance phase), and a 2-week follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening (Visit 1), all participants will receive instructions on how to complete a&#xD;
      writing exercise (Exposure Writing Exercise) related to their traumatic experience. Prior to&#xD;
      the baseline visit (Visit 2), participants must complete an approximate 30-minute writing&#xD;
      exercise outside of the trial site and should have re-read the write up at least once to be&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the screening and treatment periods, the dose of SSRI/SNRI used as background&#xD;
      therapy, if any, should remain unchanged. On Day 1, eligible participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either nabiximols or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to titrate the investigational medicinal product (IMP),&#xD;
      beginning with 1 spray/day, to an optimized dose that relieves their most bothersome symptom&#xD;
      of PTSD or to a maximum of 12 sprays/day over the first 14 days of treatment. Participants&#xD;
      should continue at the same dose level achieved at the end of the titration phase ±1 spray&#xD;
      divided into a morning dose and an evening dose for the remainder of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life, safety, and tolerability will be evaluated during the&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete the trial will participate for a total of approximately 14 weeks&#xD;
      (99 days), including the 28-day Screening period.&#xD;

    <description>Nabiximols is a complex botanical medicine formulated from extracts of the cannabis plant that contains the principal cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) and also contains minor constituents, including other cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid plant components, such as terpenes, sterols, and triglycerides.Each spray delivers 100 microliters (μL) of nabiximols.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Placebo to match nabiximols will be presented as an oromucosal spray containing the excipients ethanol and propylene glycol (50% v/v) with colorings and flavored with peppermint oil (0.05% v/v). Each spray will deliver 100 μL containing no active ingredients. Placebo will be self-administered by participants as an oromucosal spray in the morning and evening, up to a maximum of 12 sprays per day for 8 weeks.</description>
