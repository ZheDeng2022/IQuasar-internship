    <textblock>
      The target population for our study is pregnant women in the first or second trimester with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. If a subject is eligible, written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by person to person contact. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either daily oral iron supplementation or every other day oral iron supplementation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible pregnant women in the first or second trimester who carry a diagnosis of iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia as defined by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology will be&#xD;
      approached, consented, and randomized to receive either daily oral ferrous sulfate (325mg)&#xD;
      supplementation or every other day oral ferrous sulfate (650mg). Participants will undergo a&#xD;
      phone survey 2-4 weeks after starting the study to assess for side effects. Participants will&#xD;
      continue routine care and surveillance of iron deficiency in pregnancy until the end of&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

Higher scores indicate reassuring newborn status.</description>
