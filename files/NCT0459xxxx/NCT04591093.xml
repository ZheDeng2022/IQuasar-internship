      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate on new cochlear implanted patients whether the FineHearing strategy of the MED-EL&#xD;
      cochlear implant gives better results on musical perception if the depth of stimulation&#xD;
      (stimulation or not of the apical areas) is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effect of stimulation depth on vocal audiometric results, results of&#xD;
      differential frequency threshold test and on qualitative sound perception.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional stimulation strategies in cochlear implants (e.g. ACE, CIS) use the place of the&#xD;
      electrode to code the frequency by sending low frequency information on the apical electrodes&#xD;
      and high frequency information on the basal electrodes. The stimulation rate of the&#xD;
      electrodes is constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pitch is only partially transmitted by these conventional strategies which would explain&#xD;
      the poor results of cochlear implants in the perception of music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the FineHearing strategy of the MED-EL implant, the rate of stimulation on the&#xD;
      low-frequency electrodes is related to the frequency of the sound and makes it possible to&#xD;
      code the frequency information temporally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rader &amp; al. 2016 have studied the contribution of adding to the tonotopic coding of the&#xD;
      frequency (classical strategy) a temporal coding of the information by varying the&#xD;
      stimulation rate. The results obtained show that providing this frequency information by time&#xD;
      coding makes it possible to obtain perceived pitch much closer to the expected pitch (of&#xD;
      normal-hearing) and less variability, especially at low frequencies. With fixed stimulation&#xD;
      rate (classical strategy) low frequencies are poorly coded, whereas with the variable&#xD;
      stimulation rate they are better coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Landsberger et al. [2018] studied in six subjects with a MED-EL implant the&#xD;
      perception of a temporal coding according to the position of the electrodes with a long&#xD;
      insertion: middle or apical position. The results seem to show that the temporal coding of&#xD;
      the frequency would be more reliable than the spatial coding (related to the position of the&#xD;
      electrode) at the apex, and the reverse on the electrodes in the middle position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the FineHearing strategy can provide benefits over the classic HDCIS&#xD;
      strategy in tasks involving the fundamental F0 such as speech recognition in noise (after a&#xD;
      certain learning time) [Kleine Punte &amp; al. 2014 ; Vermeire &amp; al. 2010], the perception of&#xD;
      music [Roy &amp; al. 2015 ; Roy &amp; al. 2016] or the perceived quality of pitch [Müller &amp; al.&#xD;
      2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained seem to depend on the position of the electrode: a deep insertion to&#xD;
      reach the apical zone of the cochlea would allow better coding of the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MED-EL's FineHearing coding strategy with stimulation of the apical areas of the cochlea&#xD;
      (long insertion of electrodes) could therefore allow better transmission of musical pitch and&#xD;
      in particular improve the subjective quality of music compared to the same stimulation&#xD;
      strategy without reaching the apical areas (short insertion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study: The objective of the study is to evaluate if the FineHearing strategy&#xD;
      of MED-EL with stimulation of the apical zones allows to better transmit musical pitch and in&#xD;
      particular to improve the subjective quality of the music compared to the same stimulation&#xD;
      strategy without apical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that the FineHearing strategy of MED-EL with stimulation of the apical zones allows to&#xD;
      obtain a better perceptual quality of music in newly implanted cochlear patients than the&#xD;
      same strategy without apical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate differential frequency thresholds and correlation with qualitative perceptions&#xD;
           of music.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of the stimulation of the apical zones on the results of speech&#xD;
           audiometry with the FineHearing strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of the stimulation of the apical zones on the subjective quality of&#xD;
           sounds by questionnaire with the FineHearing strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is a Single-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study&#xD;
