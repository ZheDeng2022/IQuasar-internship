      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To evaluate Smoke-free Teens' change in knowledge on smoking hazards, attitudes towards&#xD;
      smoking, tobacco control and smoking cessation, and practices for promoting smoking&#xD;
      prevention and cessation, ii. To evaluate the process and quality of smoke-free programmes&#xD;
      organized by the Smoke-free Teens in their schools/community, and iii. To measure the number&#xD;
      of people reached in the smoke-free programmes organized by the Smoke-free Teens.&#xD;

      Participants Youth between Form 1 and 4 or aged 14 to 18 in the school academic year&#xD;
      2019-2020 will be nominated by secondary schools, youth centres and uniform groups to&#xD;
      participate in the Smoke-free Teens Programme 2020-2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcomes include the change in (1) knowledge on smoking hazards, (2)&#xD;
      attitudes towards smoking, tobacco control and smoking cessation, (3) practices for promoting&#xD;
      smoking prevention and cessation, and (4) the Smoke-free Teens' satisfaction on the training&#xD;
      camp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are (1) the number of people participated in the school- or&#xD;
      community-based smoke-free programmes organised by the Smoke-free Teens, and (2) the number&#xD;
      of smokers advised and referred to existing smoking cessation services by the Smoke-free&#xD;
      Teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoke-free Teens Programme The Smoke-free teens will join six sessions of online classes via&#xD;
      an e-platform in October 2020 and followed by virtual training day camps through Zoom in two&#xD;
      days in December 2020 organized by Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (COSH). The online&#xD;
      classes will educate students the knowledge on smoking hazards, tobacco control and smoking&#xD;
      cessation.In addition, the teens will be taught how to deliver a brief smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention using the &quot;AWARD&quot; Model: 1) Ask about smoking, 2) Warn the smokers that at least&#xD;
      half will be killed by smoking, 3) Advise to quit (reduce) as soon as possible, 4) Refer to&#xD;
      cessation clinics or hotlines, and 5) Do it again until the smokers quit. By the end of the&#xD;
      training camp, the teens should be confident and competent in delivering the brief smoking&#xD;
      cessation intervention to smokers. After the online classes, the teens will then break down&#xD;
      into groups to organize smoke-free programmes in their schools or in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey instrument A structured questionnaire designed by the smoking cessation team, School&#xD;
      of Nursing, the University of Hong Kong will be used to evaluate the training camp. The&#xD;
      questionnaire covers four areas, including (1) knowledge on smoking hazards, (2) attitudes&#xD;
      towards smoking, tobacco control and smoking cessation, (3) practices for promoting smoking&#xD;
      prevention and cessation, and (4) self-efficacy to deliver smoking cessation advices. The&#xD;
      items of the questionnaire have been adopted and modified from previous studies on smoking&#xD;
      cessation, with well-established psychometric properties. A process evaluation form (Appendix&#xD;
      4) will also be developed by the smoking cessation team to assess how the teens satisfy with&#xD;
      the online classes and training camp, and to determine whether the content of online classes&#xD;
      and training camp meets the learning needs and expectations of the teens. Table 1 shows the&#xD;
      items that will be asked at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the smoke-free programmes organized after the training camp, each group of the&#xD;
      Smoke-free Teens will be required to submit a written proposal to COSH. In addition, a final&#xD;
      report that contains the information about the number of people reached by the programmes,&#xD;
      publicity, and the process and outcomes of the programmes, will be submitted for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data collection will be conducted by COSH. All Smoke-free Teens will be&#xD;
      invited to respond to the structured questionnaire at baseline (T1), immediately after the&#xD;
      online classes (T2), and 3 months later (T4). In addition, they will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      process evaluation form immediately after the training camp (T3). Comments and suggestions&#xD;
      provided by the teens in the process evaluation form will be taken into account for future&#xD;
      improvement of the training camp. In addition, each group of teens will have to submit the&#xD;
      written proposal and final report regarding the smoke-free programme to COSH at 3 months&#xD;
      (T4), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS: Version 23; SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows will be employed to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be used to describe the demographic characteristics of the Smoke-free Teens. Paired&#xD;
      samples t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be conducted to assess the change in&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes and practices of the Smoke-free Teens regarding smoking, tobacco control&#xD;
      and smoking cessation before and after the training camp. To evaluate the smoke-free&#xD;
      programmes organized by the Smoke-free Teens after the training camp, descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be used to report the number of people reached by the programmes, publicity, and the&#xD;
      process and outcomes of the programmes.&#xD;
