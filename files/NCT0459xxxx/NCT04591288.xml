  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to mitigate the typical decline in walking function experienced&#xD;
      by children with cerebral palsy (CP) via a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)-assisted&#xD;
      treadmill training intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators intend to use thier CP FES Gait Training System to assess&#xD;
      the neurotherapeutic effects of an FES-assisted treadmill training intervention on walking&#xD;
      performance in children with CP. The research design consists of a randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      two-treatment study in which the control subjects will cross-over into one of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups. An FES-assisted training group will undergo twelve weeks of FES-assisted&#xD;
      treadmill training using a distributive practice protocol consisting of alternating bouts of&#xD;
      walking with and without FES assistance, followed by over ground walking reinforcement. A&#xD;
      treadmill-only training group will undergo the same training regimen without FES-assistance.&#xD;
      Finally, a non-intervention group will serve as a control. The investigators will analyze&#xD;
      treatment efficacy via functional and biomechanical and measures collected pre-training,&#xD;
      post-training and after a twelve-week follow-up period.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Assess the neurotherapeutic effects of FES-assisted treadmill and treadmill-only&#xD;
      training on walking function relative to each other and to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 The FES-assisted treadmill and treadmill-only groups will demonstrate greater&#xD;
      improvements in walking speed and walking distance than the control group post-training and&#xD;
      at follow-up. The FES-assisted treadmill group will show greater improvements than the&#xD;
      treadmill-only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 The FES-assisted treadmill and treadmill-only groups will demonstrate greater improvement&#xD;
      in walking energy efficiency than the control group post-training and at follow-up. The&#xD;
      FES-assisted treadmill group will show greater improvement than the treadmill-only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 The FES-assisted treadmill and treadmill-only groups will demonstrate greater&#xD;
      improvements in GMFM, perceived functional mobility, quality of life and self-perception&#xD;
      measures than the control group post-training and at follow-up. The FES-assisted treadmill&#xD;
      group will show greater improvements than the treadmill-only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the differential neurotherapeutic effects of FES-assisted treadmill and&#xD;
      treadmill-only training on walking biomechanics. The investigators will measure these effects&#xD;
      using instrumented motion capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 The FES-assisted treadmill group will demonstrate greater improvements in gait kinematics&#xD;
      in stance phase (higher peak hip and knee extension and lower peak ankle dorsiflexion) and&#xD;
      swing phase (higher peak knee extension and larger knee excursion) than the treadmill only&#xD;
      and non-intervention groups 2.2 The FES-assisted treadmill group will demonstrate greater&#xD;
      improvements in lower extremity kinetics (lower hip and knee extensor moments and increased&#xD;
      ankle plantarflexion power) than the treadmill only and non- intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 The FES-assisted treadmill group will demonstrate greater improvements in spatiotemporal&#xD;
      gait parameters (increased step length and gait velocity, decreased step width and double&#xD;
      support time) than the treadmill- only and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify predictive measures of training efficacy. 3.1 Pre-training walking speed and&#xD;
      energy efficiency will correlate with improvements in walking performance measures of Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Increased neuroprosthetic correction of gait biomechanics measures achieved by FES will&#xD;
      be positively correlated with walking performance measures of Aim 1.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>It is a randomized controlled two-treatment group clinical trial. We randomly assign subjects to either an FES-Treadmill group, a Treadmill-Only group, or a Control group. The FES-Treadmill group will undergo an FES-assisted treadmill training protocol. The Treadmill-Only group will undergo the same protocol without FES assistance. The control group will not receive treatment. Additionally, following their &quot;no-treatment&quot; period, we will randomize control group subjects into one of the two treatment groups. This design allows us greater power to identify treatment group differences while accommodating parents who might ordinarily not want their child to participate in a non-treatment group. Initially, each group will consist of 14 subjects. Following crossover, the FES-Treadmill and Treadmill-Only groups will consist of 21 subjects while the control group remains 14 subjects.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>We use the Modified Ashworth Scale to measure resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degree of velocity (Muscle tone/spasticity). Score ranges from 0-4, with 6 choices where score of 0 means no increase in tone and score of 4 means rigid limb with no flexion or extension. Our training approach using repetitive electrical stimulation may also lower spasticity, which can also facilitate improved functional mobility.</description>

    <description>FES-assisted treadmill walking followed by a 12-week follow-up period. Subjects will train three times a week walking at a target speed corresponding to 60-80% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate. Each training session will consist of five six-minute walking bouts, with five-minute rest periods between bouts. Each treadmill bout consists of alternating one- minute intervals of FES on and FES off. For the last walking bout, the first three minutes will be FES-assisted on the treadmill and the last three minutes will be overground walking without FES assistance to promote carryover effects. Total walking time is 30 minutes and the entire training session lasts approximately 50 minutes.</description>

We will also present our findings at national meetings of neurorehabilitation scientists and clinicians and neuroscience and motor control meetings. To have the most impact, it is important that we present our findings to both clinicians and scientists, therefore, in addition to these standard approaches, we will seek out regular opportunities to present both the rationale and results of our work to local and regional clinicians as well as local and regional stroke support groups.&#xD;
