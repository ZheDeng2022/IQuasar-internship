    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of a simultaneous application of high-intensity focused electromagnetic procedure and radiofrequency energy for change in the adipose layer thickness between pre-treatment and post-treatment based on MRI imaging. The changes will be considered statistically significant where p-value &lt;0.05.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess subjects' satisfaction with the treatment using Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-point Likert scale Satisfaction questionnaire will be used to evaluate the participant's satisfaction with the therapy outcome. Subject satisfaction will be assessed after the last therapy visit and during the follow-up visits with 4-therapy related questions with answer &quot;Strongly agree&quot; will be the best possible answer and &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; the worst.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess safety profile by recording of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for &quot;serious adverse events&quot; will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician's assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis, which would include MD, DDS, DMD, PA, Nurse Practitioner or DO), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring during the study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship to study device. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.</description>

    <description>The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a single study group. Subjects will be required to complete four (4) treatment visits and two to three follow-up visits. All of the study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject device.&#xD;
At the baseline visit, MRI imaging will be performed; the subject's weight and hip and thigh circumference will be recorded. Photos of the treated area will be taken.&#xD;
The treatment administration phase will consist of four (4) treatments, delivered once a week. The applicator of the device will be applied over the treatment area. The device will induce visible muscle contractions along with heating of the subcutaneous fat.&#xD;
At the last therapy visit, the subject's weight and hip and thigh circumference will be recorded, and photos of the treated area will be taken. In addition, subjects will receive Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire to fill in.</description>
