  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the change from baseline in mean daily copper balance in healthy&#xD;
      participants with repeat-dose administrations of ALXN1840 over 2 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will also characterize the steady state absorption, distribution, metabolism, and&#xD;
      excretion (mass balance) of total molybdenum, which is a surrogate measure of ALXN1840&#xD;
      disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
