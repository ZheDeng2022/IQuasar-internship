  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the success of physical therapy following surgery has been well-documented and&#xD;
      validated in patients undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) procedures,&#xD;
      more recent studies have demonstrated that patient outcomes are the most favorable when&#xD;
      surgery is delayed approximately 4 weeks until after the patient has completed a preoperative&#xD;
      physical therapy program, or &quot;pre-habilitation.&quot; The ultimate goal of pre-habilitation is to&#xD;
      regain full range of motion in the knee and reach approximately 80% of pre-injury quadricep&#xD;
      strength. However, extra physical therapy can stress both time and resources. Thus, we&#xD;
      propose a home-based, self-guided pre-habilitation program. We hypothesize that patients&#xD;
      participating in self-guided pre-habilitation will experience the same benefits as patients&#xD;
      in a traditional office-based physical therapy program.&#xD;
