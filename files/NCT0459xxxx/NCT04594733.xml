    <intervention_model_description>â€¢ A simple randomization method will be used to assign the initial treatment and then the opposite treatment will ensure for the second treatment period. Patients will be randomized to (i) 8 weeks of placebo, minimum 2 week washout period, and then 8 weeks of a combination minocycline (200 mg daily) and NAC (1200 mg daily) followed by a final 2 week washout or (ii) 8 weeks of a combination minocycline (200 mg daily) and NAC (1200 mg daily), minimum 2 week washout period, and then 8 weeks of placebo followed by a final 2 week washout.</intervention_model_description>
