    <textblock>
      When women are pregnant they are more likely to leak urine which can severely affect their&#xD;
      quality of life. This problem could be fixed by using a pessary. A pessary is a silicone ring&#xD;
      that goes into the vagina which can stop or improve urinary leakage. These devices have been&#xD;
      safely used for hundreds of years. However, pessaries has not been studied for urinary&#xD;
      leakage in pregnancy. The investigators would like to compare severity of urinary leakage&#xD;
      using a number of questionnaires during the last 3 months of pregnancy for women using a&#xD;
      pessary versus women without a pessary.&#xD;

      Specific Aims To determine if an incontinence pessary will improve condition-specific quality&#xD;
      of life for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the third trimester of pregnancy&#xD;
      and collect pilot data to inform sample size and feasibility for a larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/Significance The prevalence of antenatal urinary incontinence (UI) in nulliparous&#xD;
      women is 30-40%; the prevalence increases with multiparity and prior vaginal delivery. Stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (SUI) and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) are reported by 37% and 58%&#xD;
      of gravidas respectively. Fifty percent of all new UI in pregnancy is SUI. As pregnancy&#xD;
      progresses the prevalence of SUI increases from 8.3% to 36.9% in the third trimester. The&#xD;
      frequency, volume and severity of the UI worsens with increasing gestational age, resulting&#xD;
      in increasingly profound effects on women's daily life. These concerns are often&#xD;
      underreported and under recognized by clinicians. SUI in pregnancy is currently managed with&#xD;
      pelvic floor exercises, associated with incomplete symptom relief, suboptimal patient&#xD;
      adherence and limited evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incontinence pessaries can be a ring or a dish with an incontinence knob. These pessaries&#xD;
      decrease UI by providing compression and support to the urethra. Up to 63% of non-pregnant&#xD;
      women fitted with an incontinence pessary are satisfied with the treatment at 3 months; after&#xD;
      one year of use 50-59% of women remain satisfied and one third have &quot;no bothersome SUI&#xD;
      symptoms&quot;. Pessaries are a low risk and effective option to manage UI. The use of&#xD;
      incontinence pessaries is supported for the treatment of SUI in non-pregnant women by the&#xD;
      Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pessaries are safe in pregnancy and have been reported for the management of cervical&#xD;
      insufficiency, pelvic organ prolapse, and incarcerated uterus. While some believe pregnant&#xD;
      women are ideal candidates for incontinence pessaries, supporting evidence is required. There&#xD;
      are currently no obstetrical guidelines supporting pessary use for incontinence in pregnancy&#xD;
      despite pessaries being a low risk treatment option; clinicians are currently limited to&#xD;
      offering pelvic floor exercises for antepartum urinary incontinence. Pessaries are a safe and&#xD;
      effective management option for UI in pregnancy and they can be managed independently by the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress urinary incontinence represents a common concern in pregnancy and lacks evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment options. In this pilot trial, the investigators propose to quantify the effect of&#xD;
      incontinence pessaries on condition-specific quality of life and SUI symptoms in pregnant&#xD;
      women, and to determine rate of successful pessary fitting, treatment acceptability, sexual&#xD;
      function, patterns of adherence, discontinuation rate, adverse events and global impression&#xD;
      of improvement. Our trial will provide important evidence for a much-needed larger clinical&#xD;
      trial aiming to investigate incontinence pessaries as a treatment option for SUI in&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The effect size of a pessary for the treatment of SUI in pregnancy is unknown. A&#xD;
      convenience sample of 60 women will be recruited, with 30 women randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm (incontinence pessary) and 30 to the control arm (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of pilot trial: To evaluate the effect size of an antepartum incontinence&#xD;
      pessary on the condition-specific quality of life of women with SUI in pregnancy, in order to&#xD;
      inform sample size calculations for a larger randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of pilot trial: To evaluate feasibility and methodological barriers for&#xD;
      a future randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled pilot trial of women with&#xD;
      bothersome SUI in the third trimester of a healthy singleton pregnancy. A convenience sample&#xD;
      of 30 women per arm will be recruited from obstetrical clinics. Women between 26- 28weeks&#xD;
      gestational age who answer yes to the screening question &quot;Do you have bothersome urinary&#xD;
      leakage when you cough, sneeze or walk during this pregnancy?&quot; will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in our proposed study by their primary maternity provider. The study coordinator will screen&#xD;
      potential participants by phone to ensure they meet out inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      have a minimal Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) score of 25 for the UDI-6 section,&#xD;
      to ensure bother from SUI. Informed consent will be obtained. Following recruitment, a&#xD;
      baseline assessment (PFDI, Pelvic Floor Inventory Questionnaire (PFIQ), Female Sexual&#xD;
      Function Inventory (FSFI) and a bladder diary) and collection of demographic data will be&#xD;
      completed. These questionnaires will be emailed to participants. Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomized to the control or treatment group. The control group will continue with standard&#xD;
      obstetrical care while an incontinence pessary will be fitted for women in the treatment&#xD;
      group by an experienced nurse incontinence advisor at our pessary clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization all participants will be screened every two weeks from 28 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age with the interim questionnaire. They will receive a biweekly phone call from&#xD;
      either the nurse continence advisor or the urogynecology fellow. For the treatment arm this&#xD;
      call will include their obstetric health, pessary tolerance and any adverse events. Women in&#xD;
      the control group will be asked the interim obstetrical questions only. This will continue&#xD;
      until delivery, pessary discontinuation, or 36 weeks gestational age at which point the&#xD;
      patient will be discharged from the study. An exit interview will be completed and will&#xD;
      consist of a final review of the biweekly questions, the questionnaires (PFDI, PFIQ, FSFI and&#xD;
      a bladder diary), and the acceptability questionnaire for those participants using a pessary.&#xD;
      Participants using a pessary will be asked to remove it at the end of the study. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect data on study feasibility including recruitment rate,&#xD;
      methodological barriers, and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After deemed appropriate for recruitment, participants will be randomized to the control or&#xD;
      intervention arm. Both groups will continue to receive routine antenatal care and will&#xD;
      receive a handout on pelvic floor exercises in pregnancy. Women in the intervention arm will&#xD;
      be fitted with an incontinence ring pessary by an incontinence nurse experienced in pessary&#xD;
      fitting. They will be taught pessary maintenance and encouraged to remove and insert the&#xD;
      pessary independently. Participants will receive a handout on pessary use, risks and&#xD;
      obstetrical indications to remove the pessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics on demographic characteristics will be reported. Condition-specific&#xD;
      quality of life and distress scores will be compared between control and intervention arms&#xD;
      using regression analysis adjusted for baseline score. Depending on the distribution of the&#xD;
      data, linear, generalized linear or quantile regression will be used. The main analysis will&#xD;
      be an intention-to-treat analysis which will include all women followed to the end of study,&#xD;
      with sensitivity analysis being a per protocol analysis which excluded women who discontinued&#xD;
      pessary prematurely. Effect size and variance will be calculated and used for future sample&#xD;
      size calculations. Pessary fitting success rate, discontinuation rates, and adverse events&#xD;
      will be continuously monitored. The investigators aim to recruit 2-3 women per week with a&#xD;
      drop-out rate under 20%.&#xD;
