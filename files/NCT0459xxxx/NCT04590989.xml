  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The over-all aim of this 10-week randomized-controlled study, taking place only in Denmark,&#xD;
      is to examine whether the PREVENTOMICS platform integrated in an e-commerce digital tool&#xD;
      created to deliver personalized meals and dietary advices is able to produce more favorable&#xD;
      health effects than meals based on general dietary recommendations in overweight subjects&#xD;
      with elevated waist circumference.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PREVENTOMICs project (Empowering consumers to PREVENT diet-related diseases through OMICS&#xD;
      sciences), coordinated by Eurecat (Spain), has developed a personalized nutrition platform&#xD;
      with a Decision Support System (DSS) tool that integrates different disease-inducing&#xD;
      metabolic signatures with genotype and other informative information such as the&#xD;
      characteristics of individual's behavioural traits, to correlate health status and provide&#xD;
      personalized nutritional plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the potential for personalization of the platform, PREVENTOMICS will be&#xD;
      validated in three different scenarios through three different organizations carrying out&#xD;
      intervention studies with both healthy volunteers and volunteers with abdominal obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study in Denmark will be a 10-week double-blinded randomized (1:1 randomization),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial carried out with overweight/obese subjects having elevated waist&#xD;
      circumference living in Greater Copenhagen. After the confirmation of the inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      100 individuals will be randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive meals from Simple Feast following the national guidelines of macronutrient&#xD;
      composition. The control group (n=50) will receive meals based on general dietary&#xD;
      recommendations whereas the meals of the second group (n=50) are personalized based on&#xD;
      metabolic biomarkers (PP group). In addition, participants of both groups will receive&#xD;
      electronic push notifications of behavioral change messages for the purpose of general&#xD;
      behavioral change and improving adherence to the nutritional intervention, which will be sent&#xD;
      during the 10-week trial by ONMI. However, subjects in the PP group will receive personally&#xD;
      tailored and actionable behavior change prompts from the predefined ONMI's program while&#xD;
      subjects in the control group will receive it in a non-personalized fashion with standard&#xD;
      messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that delivery of personalized meal/plan through the PREVENTOMICS platform&#xD;
      integrated with e-commerce digital tool, will promote a greater reduction in fat mass and&#xD;
      weight, as well as producing favorable changes in blood metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eurecat will grant Simple feast and ONMI access to users' profile via PREVENTOMICS Platform in order to know which group the subject is assigned to and intervene accordingly. The profile includes the assigned group/cluster along with nutritional recommendations of each subject.&#xD;
100 individuals will be randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups. Both groups will receive meals and recipes from Simple Feast. The control group (50 subjects) will receive meals based on general dietary recommendations whereas the meals of the personalized plan group (50 subjects) are personalized based on an analysis of their metabolic biomarkers, genetics, preferences, health status, and lifestyle habits.&#xD;
In addition, ONMI will deliver a personally tailored and actionable behavior change program (Do-Omics) to the personalized plan group while the control group will receive general advice.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either intervention group (personalized plan) or control group prior to commencement of the trial. The allocation will be computer generated, and stratified by metabolic clusters (oxidative stress; inflammation; carbohydrate metabolism; lipid metabolism; microbiota-generated metabolites) in a 1:1 randomization between control and intervention groups. The person responsible for generating the code will not take part in the inclusion and examination of study participants. Study staff at UCPH and participants will be blinded to the treatment group and analyses of results will be performed in a blinded fashion. Moreover, the statistical analyses of the main outcome variable will be done without breaking the code for the intervention treatment, before the primary analyses are finalized.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body fat mass from baseline to week 10 will be analyzed by means of linear mixed models including sex, age and BMI at baseline as fixed effects as well as the stratification variable (cluster).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (V2) and week 10 (V3).</time_frame>
    <description>Fat mass is evaluated by use of Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. The DXA-scan (iDXA, Lunar Radiation Co., Madison, Wisconsin, USA) is performed at V2 and V3 to calculate the difference between the two measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body composition from baseline to week 10: visceral and subcutaneous fat, body lean mass, weight, body mass index, waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (V2) and week 10 (V3).</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition is evaluated by DXA scans at V2 and V3. Body weight will be measured after the participant has voided their bladder using a calibrated digital scale. weight will be recorded in kg to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by the person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. Waist circumference will be measured with a stretch-resistant tape at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable ribs and the top of the iliac crest. It will be measured twice to the nearest 0.5 cm and thereafter an average will be calculated.</description>

Participants will be asked to keep non-consecutive 3-day food registrations including one weekend day.

    <description>Each subject in the PP group will be allocated to one of five clusters based on their metabolic and genetic health biomarkers from samples of urine, plasma, serum, and saliva. 58 biomarkers will be included to characterize the 5 metabolic clusters/processes in the PREVENTOMICS platform: 1) oxidative stress; 2) inflammation; 3) carbohydrate metabolism; 4) lipid metabolism; 5) microbiota-generated metabolites. Eurecat Nutrition Team has prepared a list of recommended food items to increase and food to exclude/limit from the diet for each cluster. The list will be adopted by Simple Feast in creating five different menus that will encompass the 12 meals/week of breakfasts and dinners for the five different metabolic clusters. Additionally, subjects will receive personalized actionable &quot;Do's&quot; push notifications by ONMI. The messages are personalized based on user reports from the behavioral questionnaire at V2 in addition to inputs from the nutritional recommendations of food to increase.</description>

Subjects in the control group will also be enrolled in the behavioral program by ONMI, but the program will not be personalized nor based on the same behavior change methodology as in the PP group. In other words, the control group will get information more than is triggered to take actual action (i.e. general guidelines that is available from the National Health Service and World Health Organization).</description>
