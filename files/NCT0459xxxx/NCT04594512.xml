  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to investigate the feasibility and the effect of fresh lenticule&#xD;
      implantation as allogenic graft that will be taken from myopic patients to implant in&#xD;
      patients with keratoconus disease using VisuMax Femtosescond laser- Smile module surgery with&#xD;
      primary objective to increase central corneal thickness and secondary to improve visual&#xD;
      acuity and reduces K-values and to show the autologous serum drop improve the recovery of&#xD;
      patients with mild dry eye in keratoconus disease.&#xD;

      A 19-year-old female patient with keratoconus and chronic hydrops cornea referred to the&#xD;
      cornea department of our clinic with thin cornea and hydrops in chronic stage and minimal dry&#xD;
      eye symptoms. Minimum corneal pachymetry in the right eye was 378 µm as measured by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography(AS-OCT-Zeiss). Atlas corneal topography showed steep K-values 82.60&#xD;
      ax.37 and flat K 75.15 D ax 127 with -7.45 corneal astigmatism. Her best corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity was 0.0.5 in right eye and 1.0 in the left eye. Slit lamp examination showed intense&#xD;
      punctate epitheliopathy (Figure 1), tear film break-up time (TBUT) was measured as 7-8 sec&#xD;
      and Schirmer test was 10 mm in right eye, and the other eye examinations were determined&#xD;
      normally.&#xD;

    <description>The present study may suggest that this procedure safely, reliably, and effectively increases corneal thickness and improves visual acuity with no adverse effects. It may even provide new avenues in the treatment of corneal ectasia. Stem cells and live keratocytes are well organized based on cornea transparency and in anterior segment OCT.</description>
