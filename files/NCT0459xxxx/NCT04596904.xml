  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy are invasive procedures that enable the diagnosis,&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment, biopsy, photo and video recording of the gastrointestinal tract. It has&#xD;
      an important place in clinical use for diagnosis and treatment and these procedures are&#xD;
      common. When the studies are examined; while the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease was 8.8% -25.9% in Europe, approximately 20% of the population in the world were&#xD;
      found to have dyspeptic complaints. In the UK, 41,000 new colorectal cancers were diagnosed&#xD;
      in 2014 and 132700 new cases were detected in the United States in 2015. In the European&#xD;
      Union countries, the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer reported in 2012 is 684,000 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During endoscopic interventions in our country; in Turkey; people may experience high levels&#xD;
      of anxiety considering the negative consequences of discomfort and pain.In such cases, nurses&#xD;
      should make attempts to reduce the anxiety of the person by predicting that people may have&#xD;
      anxiety. Non-pharmacological methods that may reduce anxiety include; pre-treatment training,&#xD;
      aromatherapy, acupuncture, hypnosis. Eliminating or reducing anxiety as much as possible will&#xD;
      help increase the comfort of both the patient and the endoscopist in these invasive&#xD;
      procedures. In our study, our aim was to evaluate the effect of non-pharmacological methods&#xD;
      on the preoperative lavender smell.&#xD;

      Type and purpose of the study: This randomized controlled trial was planned to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of volatile lavender oil on the level of instantaneous and sustained anxiety level of&#xD;
      the patients undergoing endoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time and place of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is carried out in Eski≈üehir Osmangazi University Gastroenterology Polyclinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universe and sample: The population of the study was applied to the gastroenterology&#xD;
      outpatient clinic for diagnosis and diagnosis. The sample of the research sample will be&#xD;
      composed of people who meet the sample selection criteria in the specified&#xD;
      universe.Chi-Square Test Power analysis was used to determine the sample number of the study.&#xD;
      The statistical power was calculated as 118 people with 82%, alpha 0.05, beta 0,1741 errors&#xD;
      and 59 persons in group A and 59 persons in group B. In the calculation of the power&#xD;
      analysis, Hu et al. (2010) evaluated the effect of lavender in the management of anxiety&#xD;
      related to colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Within the scope of the study, written consent was obtained after the&#xD;
      individuals were informed by the researchers. Randomization method was randomized to two&#xD;
      groups [(lavender oil group (A), control group (B)]. The registration numbers and the group&#xD;
      numbers of the individuals will be delivered to the researchers in a closed envelope and the&#xD;
      lavender oil / distilled water will be sniffed according to the group of the individual&#xD;
      before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are differences in the level of anxiety related to esophagogastroduodenoscopy and&#xD;
      colonoscopy. For this reason, randomization of the patients to groups will be tried to be&#xD;
      matched with the case of esophageogudroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Patients in the same&#xD;
      group of patients will also be included in group B according to the type of procedure in each&#xD;
      group (esophagogastroduodenoscopy / colonoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of aromatic oils: In the light of the information obtained from the studies&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of lavender oil on anxiety, lavender oil with a sedative effect was&#xD;
      used in one group, while the other group was determined to use jojoba, sunflower, jasmine,&#xD;
      rosemary, grape seed, tea tree oils without sedative effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lavender oil (Lavandula hybrida): The volatile lavender oil to be used for the enterprise&#xD;
      will be taken from a reliable plant product company and the company has got the operation&#xD;
      registration and TS EN ISO 9001: 2008 quality certificates from the Ministry of Food,&#xD;
      Agriculture and Livestock by G06-3231. After 10 days of 3 drops of lavender oil on the cotton&#xD;
      pad, the prepared cotton pad will be placed on the shoulder dress. Application and&#xD;
      evaluation: The data of the study will be collected in the first and second stage in a total&#xD;
      of 2 weeks; First stage:Individual presentation form, State Trait Anxiety Inventory-I, II&#xD;
      will be applied to the individuals who have been given an appointment to perform&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy in the gastroenterology outpatient clinic, then A&#xD;
      and B group individuals will be informed by the healthcare professional about the application&#xD;
      of lavender oil / distilled water at home. For 10 days at home, group A patients receive&#xD;
      lavender oil; Group B patients will smell distilled water every evening between 21.00-21.05&#xD;
      for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage: State Trait Anxiety Inventory-I, II will be filled before sedation in patients&#xD;
      coming to the outpatient clinic for esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, vital signs&#xD;
      (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure arterial) to be evaluated and the sedation&#xD;
      protocol prescribed by the physician. No changes shall be made to the screening, diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of individuals during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual presentation form: Socio-demographic characteristics of patients (age, gender,&#xD;
      educational status, marital status, information to support the patient's care) and&#xD;
      disease-related features (diagnosis, treatment, duration of disease) is a form of questions&#xD;
      about.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State Trait Anxiety Inventory (I, II) is a self-assessment questionnaire consisting of short&#xD;
      expressions. This is a Likert-type scale, a four-degree scale ranging from None &quot;to&quot;&#xD;
      Completely. It includes the description of how an individual feels himself / herself in a&#xD;
      certain moment and under certain conditions and taking into account his / her feelings about&#xD;
      the situation he / she is in. Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficients in reliability&#xD;
      analysis;0.94-0.96 for State Anxiety Inventory, for The Trait Anxiety Inventory is between&#xD;
      0.83 and 0.87. There are two types of expressions in State-Trait Anxiety Inventories. Direct&#xD;
      expressions express negative feelings and reversed expressions express positive feelings. In&#xD;
      the State Anxiety Inventory, the terms reversed are 1,2,5,8,10,11,15,16,19 and 20 items. On&#xD;
      the Trait Anxiety Inventory, the inverse statements constitute 21,26,27,30,33,36 and 39th&#xD;
      items. After the total weight of the direct and inverted expressions are found, the total&#xD;
      weight score of the reverse expressions is subtracted from the total weight score obtained&#xD;
      for the direct expressions. A predetermined and unchanged value is added to this number. This&#xD;
      constant value is 50 for the State Anxiety Inventory and is 35 for the Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory. The recent value is an individual's anxiety score&#xD;
