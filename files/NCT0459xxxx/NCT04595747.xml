      This phase II trial studies the effect of rogaratinib in treating patients with sarcoma with&#xD;
      a change in a group of proteins called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) or&#xD;
      SDH-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Rogaratinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective radiographic response rate to single agent rogaratinib (BAY&#xD;
      1163877) in two cohorts of patients with sarcoma: Cohort A defined as patients with a sarcoma&#xD;
      which harbors an alteration in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 or 4&#xD;
      identified by next-generation sequencing profiling, and Cohort B defined as patients with&#xD;
      advanced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients in&#xD;
      Cohort A and Cohort B treated with rogaratinib (BAY 1163877).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Further assessment for safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate serial measurements of FGFR and FGFR ligand in serial tumor biopsies as&#xD;
      potential pharmacodynamic markers of FGFR pathway inhibition by ribonucleic acid sequencing&#xD;
      (RNA-seq) (pre-treatment biopsy and post-progression biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the pre and post treatment biopsy to help identify&#xD;
      mechanisms of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To bank tumor material, germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and peripheral blood for&#xD;
      potential future research for participating subjects who provide additional consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore rogaratinib exposure with pharmacodynamics effects (i.e., clinical response,&#xD;
      toxicity, and markers of FGFR pathway inhibition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rogaratinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             prior to treatment on day 1. If screening occurs within 7 days of day 1, only one&#xD;
             pregnancy test is required. Postmenopausal is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amenorrhoeic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments&#xD;

                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because kinase inhibitor agents are known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation, and 4 months after completion of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877).&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to rogaratinib (BAY 1163877)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant administration with sensitive substrates/narrow therapeutic index drugs of&#xD;
             CYP3A4, P-gp BCRP, MATE1, and MATE2K, and strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4&#xD;
             should be avoided. Use caution with strong inhibitors and inducers of P-glycoprotein&#xD;
             (gp). Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
             regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with disturbed calcium and/or phosphate metabolism are excluded from this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) is&#xD;
             kinase inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with rogaratinib (BAY 1163877), breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with rogaratinib (BAY 1163877)&#xD;
