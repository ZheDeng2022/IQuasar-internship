  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic tic disorder (CTD) may have a huge impact on life quality. Habit Reversal Training&#xD;
      (HRT) and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) are effective therapeutic modalities. This study&#xD;
      examined the effect of a combined treatment using both HRT and ERP in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with CTD. The treatment outcome was examined as an individual treatment compared&#xD;
      to a group setting. There was no control group. The study examined both acute outcome and&#xD;
      outcome at one year of follow-up. Predictive factors for treatment outcome were evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic tic disorder (CTD) may have a huge impact on life quality. Habit Reversal Training&#xD;
      (HRT) and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) are known to be effective therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities. Little is known about the effect of group therapy, the effect of combining HRT&#xD;
      and ERP training, and of the long-term effect of treatment. This study therefore wanted to&#xD;
      examine the effect of a combined treatment using both HRT and ERP in children and adolescents&#xD;
      with CTD. The participants were randomized to treatment either in groups or in an individual&#xD;
      setting. The parents were included in the training programme. The participants were asked to&#xD;
      fulfill questionnaires concerning anxiety, mood, life quality, their thoughts about tics and&#xD;
      the experienced premonitory urge. Furthermore, they were interviewed with the semistructured&#xD;
      interview Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was obtained from patient files as to examine possible predictors of both acute and&#xD;
      long-term treatment effects. The evaluators were a specialized psychologist and a child and&#xD;
      adolescent psychiatrist with several years of experience in diagnosing, evaluating and&#xD;
      treating tic disorders. A random sample of 10% were audiotaped and evaluated by another rater&#xD;
      with extensive experience and expertise in the use of the YGTSS. The evaluator was not&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment allocation, yet not involved in the treatment of the patient, and&#xD;
      blinded to any previous evaluations&#xD;
