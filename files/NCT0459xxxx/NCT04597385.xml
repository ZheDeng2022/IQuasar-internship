    <textblock>
      RGX-121-5101 is the long-term follow-up study to the RGX-121-101 first in human study where&#xD;
      participants received RGX-121, a gene therapy intended to deliver a functional copy of the&#xD;
      iduronate-2-sulfatase gene (IDS) to the central nervous system. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term safety and efficacy of RGX-121.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective follow-up study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy after a&#xD;
      single administration of RGX-121. Eligible participants are those who previously have&#xD;
      enrolled in clinical study RGX-121-101 and received a single intracisternal (IC) or&#xD;
      intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of RGX-121. Enrollment of each participant will occur&#xD;
      the same day or after the participant has completed the end of study (EOS) visit or early&#xD;
      termination visit (ET) from the previous (parent) study. Participants will be followed in&#xD;
      this study cumulatively for up to 5 years after RGX-121 administration (inclusive of the&#xD;
      parent study) or until RGX-121 is commercially available in the participant's country,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first. No treatment will be directed under this observational protocol. The&#xD;
      total study duration for each participant may vary depending on when they enroll in the&#xD;
      current study following RGX-121 administration in the parent study.&#xD;
