  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the correlation between hs-cTn level as cardiac biomarker for&#xD;
      ischemia and early graft occlusion as assessed by CCT in patients undergoing coronary bypass&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The early diagnosis of the periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) due to the bypass graft&#xD;
      occlusion is an important element, in order to introduce early therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
      Invasive coronary angiography (CA) is the gold standard to evaluate the postoperative&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia due to the graft occlusion. Since this procedure has several important&#xD;
      risks, such as thromboembolic events, dissection, bleeding, and contrast dye-induced&#xD;
      nephropathy, in daily clinical practice, only patients with strong clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      early MI following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergo this invasive procedure.&#xD;
      There is a clinical need for the development of safe and accurate non-invasive diagnostic&#xD;
      approaches to assess the early coronary bypass graft occlusion and to predict the consequent&#xD;
      MI. A new clinical approach for the identification of the early post-procedural graft&#xD;
      occlusion in patients undergoing CABG surgery is the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin&#xD;
      (hs-cTn) cut-off level. The peri-operative bypass occlusion will be assessed by a Coronary&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (CCT) scan which is a widely available non-invasive approach that permits&#xD;
      an accurate evaluation of coronary stenosis. This study is to evaluate the correlation&#xD;
      between hs-cTn level as cardiac biomarker for ischemia and early graft occlusion as assessed&#xD;
      by CCT in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.&#xD;
