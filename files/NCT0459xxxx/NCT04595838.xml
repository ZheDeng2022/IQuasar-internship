  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the use of Chemo Mouthpiece TM along with best oral supportive care&#xD;
      to best oral supportive care only in preventing and easing symptoms of chemotherapy related&#xD;
      oral mucositis. Patients who are receiving protocol specified chemotherapy regimens will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either study device and oral care ingredients or oral care&#xD;
      ingredients only. All patients will complete daily questionnaires for the first 14 days of&#xD;
      Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy. Patients who are assigned to the study device will use the&#xD;
      device during their chemotherapy infusion as well as at least twice a day at home for the&#xD;
      first 7 days of Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy. At the beginning of Cycle 3, patients that&#xD;
      were not assigned to the study device will be given the option to receive study device for&#xD;
      the remainder of their treatment.&#xD;
