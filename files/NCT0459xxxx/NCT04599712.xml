  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this expanded access program (EAP) is to provide amivantamab for the treatment&#xD;
      of participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor exon 20 insertion mutations, and whose disease has progressed during or after&#xD;
      current standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy. This intermediate EAP may be considered&#xD;
      for individuals with serious/life-threatening diseases or conditions, where there are no&#xD;
      alternative treatments or where individuals have progressed following standard of care.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic non-small&#xD;
             cell lung (NSCLC) cancer with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20&#xD;
             insertion (Exon20ins), not amenable to curative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has completed prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. In the case of&#xD;
             platinum ineligible participants, the participant may qualify if previously treated&#xD;
             with an alternative treatment (example, an investigational or approved EGFR Exon 20&#xD;
             targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI], or see guidelines such as those from&#xD;
             national comprehensive cancer network [NCCN] or European society for medical oncology&#xD;
             [ESMO] for alternative non-platinum-based treatments)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy is projected to be greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3 months with&#xD;
             adequate hepatic, renal, pulmonary and cardiac function (physician assessed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including drug-induced ILD or&#xD;
             radiation pneumonitis requiring treatment with prolonged steroids or other immune&#xD;
             suppressive agents within the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has leptomeningeal disease that is active or symptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic, unstable or untreated brain metastases (need to be resolved prior to&#xD;
             participating in the program)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to amivantamab or its excipients or&#xD;
             to other monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
