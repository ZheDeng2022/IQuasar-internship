  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, international, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      225^Ac-PSMA-617 in men with PSMA-positive prostate cancer and extensive skeletal metastases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study schedule for each patient consists of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a&#xD;
      follow up-phase, for an overall individual duration of approximately 18-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 3 patients will be treated in each patient group (A and B) at each dose level&#xD;
      and evaluated for the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 6 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment before consideration will be given to enrolling patients into the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No more than 6 cycles of 225^Ac-PSMA-617 using the dose de-escalation schedule will be&#xD;
      administered. Patients may receive less than 6 cycles if they have disease progression, have&#xD;
      withdrawn consent or if, in the opinion of the investigator, have received maximum benefit&#xD;
      from treatment with 225^Ac-PSMA-617.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may also receive supportive care therapy, as determined by the investigative&#xD;
      physician, however, subjects cannot receive concurrent investigational agents, cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, and hemi-body radiotherapy or novel androgen axis&#xD;
      drugs [NAADs] until completion of treatment with 225^Ac-PSMA-617.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Study-eligible patients with prostate cancer will be assigned to one of two groups, A and B:&#xD;
Group A: Men with castrate levels of testosterone that have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or a novel androgen axis drugs (e.g., abiraterone or enzalutamide), conducted at both clinical centers (i.e., South Africa and Australia).&#xD;
Group B: Men previously treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or orchiectomy and primary anti-androgen therapy that have not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or novel androgen axis drugs (e.g., abiraterone or enzalutamide). Due to geographical differences in disease presentation/aggressiveness and access to treatment of mCRPC, B Group patients will be enrolled only in South Africa, after medical review determines the need for therapy as part of a clinical study.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)</measure>

    <description>The RP2D for each group (Group A and B) is defined as the dose level that is well tolerated (i.e., at or below the MTD) and for which there may be additional findings (e.g., longer term tolerability) effecting the RP2D decision. In the case where an MTD is not identified, even at the highest dose level tested, the RP2D may be determined on the basis of data indicating adequate tolerability and therapeutic effectiveness.</description>

Radiographic disease progression as determined from bone scans and contrast CT/MRI as outlined in Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) and RECIST 1.1&#xD;
Unequivocal clinical progression&#xD;
PSA progression, defined as the date that a â‰¥ 25% increase in PSA and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir is documented and confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained 3 or more weeks later. Rises in PSA within the first 12 weeks will be ignored. Where no decline from baseline is documented, baseline PSA is the nadir. The date of progression is date of first occurrence, not date of confirmation (PCWG3 Guidance).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each Cycle (1 cycle = 8 weeks +/- week), End of Treatment, on average 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each Cycle (1 cycle = 8 weeks +/- week), End of Treatment, on average 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-P assesses symptoms/problems related to prostate carcinoma and its treatment. It is a combination of the FACT- General + the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS). The FACT-General (FACT-G) is a 27 item Quality of Life (QoL) measure that provides a total score as well as subscale scores: Physical (0-28), Functional (0-28), Social (0-28), and Emotional Well-being (0-24). The total score range is between 1-108, higher scores indicates better for total score and subscale scores. PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better). The FACT-P total score is the sum of all 5 subscale scores of the FACT-P questionnaire and ranges from 0-156. Higher scores indicate higher degree of functioning and better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Questionnaire: Pain Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each Cycle (1 cycle = 8 weeks +/- week), End of Treatment, on average 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a publicly available instrument to assess the pain and includes severity and interference scores. BPI-SF is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. Pain severity score is a mean value for BPI-SF questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 (questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]). Pain severity progression is defined as an increase in score of 30% or greater from baseline without decrease in analgesic use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Questionnaire: Pain Interference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each Cycle (1 cycle = 8 weeks +/- week), End of Treatment, on average 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a publicly available instrument to assess the pain and includes severity and interference scores. BPI-SF is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. Pain interference score is mean value for the 7 BPI-SF questions (questions inquiring about the extent of interference with activities by pain) where the extent is ranked from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Pain interference progression is defined as an increase in score of 50% or greater from baseline without decrease in analgesic use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale (XeQOLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each Cycle (1 cycle = 8 weeks +/- 1 week), End of Treatment and every 3 months during the 12-month follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>The XeQOLS is a validated patient reported 15-item assessment scale with 4 domains: physical functioning, pain/discomfort, personal/psychologic functioning, and social functioning. The score is the average of all responses of all domains and can range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating increased xerostomia burden. A negative change from Baseline indicates an improvement of the xerostomia burden.</description>
