  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irreversible pulpitis is an inflammatory condition of the dental pulp, highly painful, and&#xD;
      one of the main reasons for seeking emergency dental treatment. Pain associated with&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis represents more than 45% of emergency patients in dental clinics. A&#xD;
      pulpotomy has been demonstrated as an emergency intervention for effective pain relief by&#xD;
      removing the coronal pulp tissue without penetrating radicular pulpal tissue. Inflammation&#xD;
      and degeneration of the pulp usually progress apically from the point of infection, so&#xD;
      selective removal of this tissue in the form of pulpotomy is usually effective in controlling&#xD;
      pain and patient sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale behind emergency pulpotomy is relieving acute dental pain caused by&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis. However, there is still insufficient evidence to determine whether the&#xD;
      presence, nature and duration of clinical symptoms gives accurate information about the&#xD;
      extent of pulp inflammation, as pulpotomy was found to be an effective emergency treatment&#xD;
      strategy with respect to relieving clinical symptoms, even in cases of irreversible pulpitis&#xD;
      with symptomatic apical periodontitis . Advanced diagnostic strategies are needed to&#xD;
      determine whether there is a correlation between clinical symptoms, actual pulpal&#xD;
      inflammation and achieving adequate pain relief during and after treatment. Thus, we are&#xD;
      conducting this study to assess the effect of emergency pulpotomy versus complete pulp&#xD;
      extirpation on relieving acute dental pain of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in mandibular&#xD;
      molars. The expected benefit for the patients is to decrease pain during and after treatment.&#xD;
      we also are trying to provide an evidence for the clinician in order to provide the best&#xD;
      endodontic treatment without pain.&#xD;
