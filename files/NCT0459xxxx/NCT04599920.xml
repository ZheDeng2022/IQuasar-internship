  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of partial replacement of red meat with&#xD;
      legume-based foods on gut metabolism and markers for colorectal cancer as well as markers for&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes in healthy working age men. The study&#xD;
      participants will be stratified into two groups with different amounts of red meat in diet:&#xD;
      1) a diet containing 760 g of cooked and boneless red meat, supplying 25% of daily protein&#xD;
      intake and 2) a diet supplying 20% of protein intake with legume-based foods and 5% of&#xD;
      protein intake with red meat. The participants will get all meat and and legume-based foods&#xD;
      from the research center; otherwise they will be asked to follow their habitual diet. Blood,&#xD;
      urine, and stool samples will be collected at the baseline and at the end of the 6 week&#xD;
      intervention, as well as BMI, blood pressure and body composition. Nutrient intake and food&#xD;
      consumption will be analyzed from 4-day food records at the baseline and at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A human intervention study with healthy volunteers will be carried out to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of partial replacement of red meat with legume-based foods on gut metabolism and&#xD;
      markers for colorectal cancer as well as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in parallel-design, randomized fashion, with healthy male volunteers&#xD;
      aged 20-65 years. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described elsewhere. Duration of the&#xD;
      intervention will be 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention groups will be as follows (n=50/group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: The habitual diet of participants is supplemented with 760 g of cooked and boneless&#xD;
      red meat per week, representing the average meat consumption of Finnish men and supplying 25%&#xD;
      of protein intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: The habitual diet of participants is supplemented with legume-based foods providing&#xD;
      equal amount of protein as 560 g of red meat and 200 g of red meat per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption of red meat and legumes will be kept stable throughout the intervention and&#xD;
      participants are advised to avoid consuming any red meat or legumes in addition to those&#xD;
      provided from the research center. The investigators also aim to investigate, whether&#xD;
      replacing red meat with legumes induces other changes in diet. This information is be&#xD;
      important if increasing legume consumption is recommended at the population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the intervention, participants will get dietary advice how to follow their&#xD;
      diets. They will get the red meat and legume-based foods for free to help to implement the&#xD;
      diets and to enhance compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine and fecal samples will be collected at the baseline and at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention. Nutrient intake and food consumption during the intervention will be analyzed&#xD;
      from 4-day food records at the baseline and at the end. Nutrient intakes will be calculated&#xD;
      using a new Finnish 'Aromi' software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data collection and analyses will be carried out at the baseline and at the end&#xD;
      of the intervention period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height, weight, waist and hip circumferences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  resting blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fasting lipid profile in the plasma (total cholesterol, LDL and HDL, triglycerides)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1c in the blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high sensitive C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  markers for nutritional status in plasma/serum: hemoglobin, transferrin receptor,&#xD;
           ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urea/nitrogen in the urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total and heme-based N-nitroso compounds in feces, concentrations of bile acids, gut&#xD;
           microbiota&#xD;
