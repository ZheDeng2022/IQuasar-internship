  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the time to confirmed clinical recovery in&#xD;
      participants hospitalized with COVID-19. Candidate agents will be evaluated frequently for&#xD;
      efficacy and safety, with candidate agents being added to and/or removed from the study on an&#xD;
      ongoing basis, depending on the results of their evaluation.&#xD;

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
