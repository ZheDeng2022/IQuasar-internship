    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, randomized, single-dose, open-label, two-treatment,&#xD;
      two-period, two-sequence crossover bioequivalence study to compare the rate and extent of&#xD;
      absorption of WD-1602 granule formulation (WD Pharma) to the reference drug Pradaxa® capsule&#xD;
      (BI, Germany) under fed conditions in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of a medical Screening visit, two 2-night (3-day) Treatment Periods,&#xD;
      2 outpatient visits, and a Follow-up visit. Each Treatment visit will be separated by a&#xD;
      washout of up to 7 days. The Follow-up visit will occur approximately 7 days (±1) following&#xD;
      the last study drug administration. The duration of subject participation, including&#xD;
      screening, will be approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;
