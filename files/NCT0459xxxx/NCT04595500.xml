    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      (GERD) and dental erosion and the alterations in oral tissues. This was a case-control study.&#xD;
      The GERD group consisted of 50 individuals with endoscopic esophagitis who had&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, and the control group consisted of 50 healthy individuals.&#xD;
      The prevalence of teeth wear and caries was evaluated using the Smith and Knight tooth wear&#xD;
      index (TWI) and the decayed, missing, and filled teeth index (DMFT), respectively.&#xD;
      Inflammatory mouth sensitivity, tongue sensitivity, nonspecific itching and burning,&#xD;
      halitosis, dry mouth, teeth sensitivity, and the erythema of the soft and hard palatal mucosa&#xD;
      and uvula were also evaluated. Stimulated saliva samples were collected, and the salivary&#xD;
      flow rate, pH, and buffering capacity values were measured.&#xD;

    <description>Score 0 No loss of enamel surface characteristics. No loss of contour. Score 1 Loss of enamel surface characteristics. Minimal loss of contour. Score 2 Loss of enamel exposing dentine for less than one third of surface. Loss of enamel just exposing dentine. Defect less than 1 mm deep.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva collection was performed between 9:00 and 12:00 in the morning. Stimulation for the collection of saliva samples was provided by sugar-free gum. Saliva flow rate was recorded as ml / min by dividing the amount obtained after 5 minutes of chewing by the time.</description>

    <measure>pH value</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The pH value of saliva samples was measured with a pH meter (Sentron digital pH-meter, Nisan Inc.,Turkey). The calibration procedure of the device was done in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and using standard pH buffers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Buffering capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The buffering capacity of the collected saliva samples was determined according to the Ericsson method.The collected stimulated saliva was taken into another sterile glass tube by drawing 1 ml without waiting. 3ml 0.005 N HCl was added onto it and the vessel was vibrated slightly to remove carbon dioxide and the pH value was measured with a pH meter (Sentron digital pH-meter, Nisan Inc.,Turkey).</description>

    <measure>Oral complaints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Oral complaints of the participants were evaluated according to the answers given to the questions regarding inflammatory mouth sensitivity, tongue sensitivity, nonspecific itching and burning in the mucosa, halitosis, dry mouth, and increased teeth sensitivity. The presence of erythema in the soft/hard palatal mucosa/uvula was determined by oral examination.</description>

        This case-control study was conducted in Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry, Department&#xD;
        of Restorative Dentistry Polyclinics and Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department&#xD;
        of Gastroenterology Polyclinics with a total of 100 participants (49 females and 51 males&#xD;
        between the ages of 16-65) of whom 50 were in the GERD group, and 50 were in the control&#xD;
        group. Among the patients who were admitted to the clinics, those with a diagnosis of GERD&#xD;
        were included in the patient group and those without GERD were included in the control&#xD;
        group. Ethical approval of the study protocol was granted by the Ankara University Faculty&#xD;
        of Dentistry Research Ethics Committee (No:131/2 Date:10.06.2008).&#xD;
