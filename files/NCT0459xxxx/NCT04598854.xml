      Background This research is designed through randomization, control, and double-blind trial&#xD;
      to explore the clinical effectiveness of intravenous laser irradiation of blood for knee&#xD;
      degenerative arthritis; and to explore the changes in body's balance function. Furthermore to&#xD;
      establish a new way of clinical rehabilitation therapy. The research will further study the&#xD;
      special expression of blood cells after the treatment and as well as the molecular mechanism&#xD;
      of low-energy intravenous laser therapy on hematopoietic stem cells. fold of the sun. The&#xD;
      light accelerates blood and cells circulation in the human body, so that protein molecular&#xD;
      structure would promote changes. Pain control is indicated in such treatment, but still&#xD;
      lacking evidence of improving the symptoms of degenerative knee arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose This research is designed through randomization, control, and double-blind trial to&#xD;
      explore the clinical effectiveness of intravenous laser irradiation of blood for knee&#xD;
      degenerative arthritis; and to explore the changes in body's balance function. Furthermore to&#xD;
      establish a new way of clinical rehabilitation therapy. The research will further study the&#xD;
      special biomarker to investigate the mechanism of low-energy intravenous laser therapy for&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The investigators plan to recruit 20 patients who are between the ages of 50 to 75&#xD;
      years old, but younger than 75 years old. The participants are required to have clear&#xD;
      conscious and be able to communicate. Their symptoms of degenerative arthritis could be one&#xD;
      or both knees which last more than six months; with knee pain greater than 4 points when&#xD;
      walking. The treatment group will receive an intravenous helium-neon laser phototherapy. A&#xD;
      vein indwelling needle will be placed in their veins located in the upper elbow, and the&#xD;
      laser fiber catheter will be introduced through the indwelling cannula. The power is set&#xD;
      between 2.5 ~ 3.0Mw, 60 minutes each time, once a day for five consecutive days. The steps&#xD;
      for the control group are the same, except that the output power is adjusted to zero&#xD;
      intensity. This plan will be explained to the patient in detail during the outpatient visit&#xD;
      and patients will sign the consent form upon agreement. Before intravenous laser irradiation,&#xD;
      three days, one month, and three months after the therapy, 20 ml of autologous peripheral&#xD;
      venous blood need to be drawn for basic blood tests and biomarker tests. At the same time,&#xD;
      the clinical functions of patients will be evaluated, including visual analogous scale,&#xD;
      Lequesne 's severity index, WOMAC scale, and balance function test.&#xD;
