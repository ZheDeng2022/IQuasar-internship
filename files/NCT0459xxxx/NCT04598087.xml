      Implementing a multiphasic, multimodal prehabilitation intervention for people undergoing&#xD;
      surgery with free flap reconstruction for the treatment of head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the 7th most common cancer worldwide, and treatment&#xD;
      often involves surgery. HNC surgery is intensive, complications are common, and quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) is negatively impacted. Support must be expanded to not only help patients survive&#xD;
      HNC but to recover faster and live well following surgery. Prehabilitation, or optimizing a&#xD;
      patient's condition before surgery, is a key opportunity to integrate supportive care early&#xD;
      in the clinical care pathway for this underserved patient group. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
      Using a mixed-methods approach, the aims of this hybrid implementation-effectiveness study&#xD;
      are to (i) implement a multiphasic exercise prehabilitation program for HNC patients in a&#xD;
      real-world setting and describe factors influencing implementation across the phases; (ii)&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of a multiphasic exercise prehabilitation program for&#xD;
      HNC patients; (iii) explore the potential benefits of a multiphasic exercise prehabilitation&#xD;
      program for HNC patients, and (iv) build a systematic screening and referral pathway into&#xD;
      exercise oncology resources post-operatively. Outcomes are detailed below and include&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, physical function, mobility (step count) and hospital length of&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
