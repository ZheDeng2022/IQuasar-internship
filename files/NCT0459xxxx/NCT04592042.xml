    <textblock>
      The aim of the present single-centered pre-post study is to assess the feasibility and to&#xD;
      investigate the putative efficacy of an emotion-oriented group intervention for patients with&#xD;
      psychosis. Patients with early psychosis in an inpatient unit receive a manualized group&#xD;
      intervention focussing on emotional stability and emotion regulation (8 weekly sessions).&#xD;
      Assessment will be performed at pre-therapy, post-therapy (after eight sessions and four&#xD;
      weeks) and after a follow-up period of 12 weeks (8 weeks post therapy) and includes personal&#xD;
      therapy goals and their realization, psychopathology, social functioning and emotion&#xD;
      regulation skills as a putative mediator of change.&#xD;

      The aim of the present single-centered pre-post study is to assess the feasibility and to&#xD;
      investigate the putative efficacy of an emotion-oriented cognitive-behavioral group&#xD;
      intervention for patients with psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with psychosis in an inpatient unit are informed on the study and written consent is&#xD;
      obtained. At start of therapy, psychopathological interviews and self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      are performed. Participants are reassessed after the intervention of 8 sessions&#xD;
      (approximately 8 weeks) and after a follow-up period of 8 additional weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled in a manualized group therapy over 8 sessions including 7 modules. In&#xD;
      the first session, group rules are obtained and individual therapy goals are elaborated and&#xD;
      developed for each patient. In the next seven sessions, in each session a new module is&#xD;
      presented to the patient and the skills are trained in training sessions and role plays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Module 1 informs on emotions and their role in mental health, module 2 informs on&#xD;
      techniques/skills in order to cope with negative emotions more generally. In module 3,&#xD;
      mindfulness is presented as a technique to reduce the impact of negative emotions on the&#xD;
      patients' life and practised. In module 4, patients learn skills on how to reduce their&#xD;
      vulnerability for negative emotions in general. In Module 5, patients learn skills on how to&#xD;
      cope with anger, Module 6 teaches skills on how to cope with guilt and shame, Module 7 is&#xD;
      presented in the last session and includes skills on how to improve general emotional&#xD;
      stability and to prevent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training: Therapists are psychologists or psychiatrists that are currently in postgraduate&#xD;
      training of Cognitive Behavior Therapy and received 8 sessions of additional training by the&#xD;
      study PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variables are attainment of the individual therapy goals of the patient (Goal&#xD;
      Attainment Scale) and reduced general psychopathology (PANSS total score) after 8 sessions&#xD;
      therapy. Secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms (Calgary Depression Scale for&#xD;
      Schizophrenia), social functioning (Role functioning scale), self-reported delusions (Peters&#xD;
      et al. delusions inventory), self-reported persecutory delusions (Paranoia checklist),&#xD;
      emotion regulation skills (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire, Emotion regulation&#xD;
      questionnaire, Emotion Regulation Inventory), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-esteem&#xD;
      Questionnaire) and the Beliefs About Stress Scale (BASS). Furthermore, patients are asked to&#xD;
      assess feasibility and acceptance of the group intervention. Emotion regulation skills and&#xD;
      self-esteem are also tested as putative mediators of change.&#xD;
