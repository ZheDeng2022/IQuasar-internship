      background:Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common type of urinary incontinence&#xD;
      in women, as it involves involuntary leakage of urine , the current study was To determine&#xD;
      the neuromodulation effect of Laser Therapy on Neurogenic Acupoints in female with stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (SUI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty women with SUI were randomly divided into two equal groups; the control group received&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training , while the study group received the same pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      training in addition to laser acupuncture on neurogenic acupoints . The outcome measures were&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS) , SUI severity assessed by Severity Index (SI) , and&#xD;
      Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF). The outcome measures were assessed pre- and&#xD;
      post-rehabilitation program.&#xD;
