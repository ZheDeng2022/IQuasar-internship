  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), a reliable and well-validated instrument,&#xD;
      was developed as a multidimensional quantitative measure of neurologic disability in MS.&#xD;
      However, the traditional form of the MSFC has various limitations, including the need for MS&#xD;
      patients to be assessed in a clinical setting by trained technicians, which requires&#xD;
      additional human resources and time in a clinical routine practice setting. Furthermore,&#xD;
      storage of MSFC data for longitudinal comparison is difficult and time consuming. The MS&#xD;
      Performance Test (MSPT) software tool is designed to objectively quantify the major motor,&#xD;
      visual and cognitive function data, and quality of life outcomes, associated with MS and&#xD;
      related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center observational study that will examine the use of the MSPT in a real&#xD;
      world setting. Study enrollment will occur at one center in Switzerland.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participation will be offered to MS patients either on day of clinic visit. Patient&#xD;
      screening, consent discussion and MSPT test completion is estimated to take approximately an&#xD;
      hour prior to the appointment with the treating physician. Participants begin with an&#xD;
      instructional overview, which acquaints them with all elements of the MSPT. The tests will be&#xD;
      performed in the same order and if a study participant elects to discontinue testing or skip&#xD;
      a module, they will be asked to indicate the reasons on the screen. Each module has&#xD;
      accompanying instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of testing at first and last study visit, patients, research&#xD;
      nurse/coordinator and treating physician will be asked to fill in a short satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire related to the functionality of the MSPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCPs will have the ability to view de-identified longitudinal MSPT outcomes for each patient&#xD;
      on the MSPT tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified data abstracted from each site will be stored in a cloud-based data repository.&#xD;
      Access to the MSPT Cloud and data therein is restricted to the healthcare institution using&#xD;
      the registered MSPT tool. The site will periodically send de-identified and encrypted&#xD;
      aggregate data to Biogen.&#xD;
