      Assessment of Gastric Bypass combined with Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy as primary treatment&#xD;
      for patients with severe clinical obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average percentage of total weight loss and percentage excess weight loss will be computed at&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Disease and Obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is one of the most common chronic diseases in America and is strongly associated with&#xD;
      additional metabolic disorders, in particular hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. The combination of obesity with this cluster of metabolic disorders increases&#xD;
      risk for cardiovascular disease and is widely recognized by the term Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2017-2018 the &quot;prevalence of severe obesity&#xD;
      among U.S. adults was 9.2%&quot;, the &quot;age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in adults was 42.4%&quot;,&#xD;
      and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in the obese population is higher than 60%. The&#xD;
      economic impact of metabolic syndrome is significant, with risk factors for MS shown to&#xD;
      increase a person's annual healthcare costs by more than $2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts to treat obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disease currently include medical&#xD;
      management and surgical intervention. Success rates with surgical interventions exceed those&#xD;
      of medical management but are dependent on patients making permanent changes in eating&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly accepted surgical procedures have several mechanisms of action. These include&#xD;
      decreased stomach volume restricting a patient's ability to eat, intestinal bypass resulting&#xD;
      in significant malabsorption, and alterations in hormonal control of appetite and satiety.&#xD;
      Standardized surgical procedures include Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG), Roux-en-Y Gastric&#xD;
      Bypass (GBP), Laparoscopic Gastric Banding (LB) and Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal&#xD;
      Switch (DS). Of these, VSG and GBP are the most commonly performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VSG and GBP have been shown to result in similar weight loss, however, both procedures have a&#xD;
      significant long-term failure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key symptomatic differences between VSG and GBP&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial 6-12 months after surgery, both VSG and GBP patients typically report a&#xD;
      marked decrease in appetite as well as a significant restriction in volume of food that can&#xD;
      be eaten before &quot;feeling full.&quot; This period of decreased appetite and early satiety is&#xD;
      commonly referred to as the &quot;honeymoon period.&quot; After this honeymoon period, every patient's&#xD;
      weight loss success becomes progressively more dependent on changes made in their eating&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As would be expected with anatomically distinct procedures, patient symptoms begin to&#xD;
      significantly differ over time. Patients that have undergone GBP, resulting in a gastric&#xD;
      pouch that is less than 30cc report a more sustained feeling of restriction in the volume of&#xD;
      food that can be eaten at a single meal compared to patients that have undergone VSG with a&#xD;
      100-150cc residual stomach. GBP patients also report a more persistent feeling of early&#xD;
      satiety than do patients after VSG. In contrast, patients that have undergone VSG, with most&#xD;
      of the Ghrelin-producing region of their stomach removed, report a more persistent decrease&#xD;
      in appetite compared to patients after GBP, where the production of Ghrelin appears to&#xD;
      rebound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key hormonal differences between VSG and GBP&#xD;
&#xD;
      VSG results in substantial and permanent decrease in the orexigenic hormone Ghrelin. After&#xD;
      GBP, rebound of Ghrelin is shown to occur within 6 to 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBP causes a significantly greater increase in postprandial GLP-1 and Peptide YY, possibly&#xD;
      contributing to earlier satiety and improved glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key differences in side effects between VSG and GBP&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common side effect of VSG is GERD. When symptoms are severe, conversion to GBP provides&#xD;
      relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dumping syndrome, a side effect of GBP, is often described as an effective negative feedback&#xD;
      mechanism, helping to minimize ingestion of high glycemic index foods. Dumping is not&#xD;
      typically associated with VSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering these differences, it is reasonable to question whether a single-stage procedure&#xD;
      that combines the anatomic changes of both the GBP and VSG would result in;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improved weight loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An improved quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Better glycemic control&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROPOSED STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The S.L.I.M.M.S. Procedure, for Surgically Limit Intake and Manage Metabolic Syndrome, is a&#xD;
      single-stage operation combining Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass with Partial Gastrectomy. The&#xD;
      procedure specifications are listed below,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 20 cc gastric pouch&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 10 mm diameter gastro-jejunal stoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A 40 cm biliopancreatic limb (measured from the Ligament of Treitz)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A 150 cm roux limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Resection of the remaining fundus and body of the stomach, maintaining the majority of&#xD;
           the gastric antrum&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Oversewing the gastric staple lines and buttressing with omentum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most new procedures focus on variations of intestinal reconstruction, or involve implantation&#xD;
      of artificial devices. The proposed procedure does not require implantation of an artificial&#xD;
      device, nor a new method of intestinal reconstruction. It simply combines the two most common&#xD;
      bariatric procedures in the world with the hope of providing cumulative benefits without&#xD;
      increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Technical and Anatomic Precedents&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When VSG results in severe and recalcitrant GERD the standard treatment is conversion to&#xD;
           GBP. The final anatomic result is a patient with a gastric bypass and the majority of&#xD;
           the gastric fundus and body removed. This is similar to the final anatomy of the&#xD;
           procedure proposed in this study, however, the S.L.I.M.M.S. procedure will be done as a&#xD;
           single operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In several centers, resectional gastric bypass, involving a standard gastric bypass&#xD;
           combined with a subtotal or total gastrectomy, is performed routinely [24-28]. Published&#xD;
           reports from these centers do not demonstrate increased complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of this Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently accepted surgical procedures all have significant long-term failure rates or&#xD;
      frequently result in substantial malnutrition. Multiple new and novel surgical procedures are&#xD;
      currently being tried that focus either on simple restriction or on increasing malabsorption.&#xD;
      These new procedures are not designed with the intention of providing increased, permanent&#xD;
      support for the patient's behavioral changes which are so critical in the long-term success&#xD;
      of all bariatric surgery. The S.L.I.M.M.S. procedure is designed with the primary goal of a&#xD;
      more sustained appetite suppression and increased early satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of This Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the S.L.I.M.M.S.&#xD;
      Procedure as a stand-alone, single-stage bariatric operation.&#xD;
