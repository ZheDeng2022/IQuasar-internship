  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, in addition of conventional treatment, the efficacy of the medical device,&#xD;
      Remedee One, in medical care of patients with peripheral osteoarthritis pain is evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis affects 10 millions people in France (17% of the population). It's the second&#xD;
      cause of disability and consultation after the cardiovascular diseases in France. For the&#xD;
      moment, there is no curative treatment for osteoarthritis The main clinical sign of this&#xD;
      disease is pain and care is based on the treatment of pain and on the improvement of&#xD;
      functionnal disability. The proposed treatments are mainly based on the use of oral&#xD;
      analgesics treatments .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, patients report to be insufficiently relieved. New strategies need to be&#xD;
      developed. The hypothesis is that the use of an innovative medical device, Remedee One, can&#xD;
      reduce the pain felt by patients, improve their quality of life and reduce the analgesics&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice is oriented on the peripheral osteoarthritis and excludes spinal osteoarthritis&#xD;
      because it's an osteoarthritis always asymptomatic and painless.&#xD;
