  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate dyspnea improvement and other parameters of efficacy&#xD;
      and safety in acute heart failure (AHF) patients receiving an intravenous (IV) infusion of&#xD;
      clevidipine in comparison to standard of care (SOC) and placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization will occur in two stages. Stage 1 patients will be randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blinded manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clevidipine or placebo IV infusion.&#xD;
      Upon completion of Stage 1, Stage 2 patients will be randomized in an open-label manner in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive either clevidipine or standard of care (SOC) IV infusion. At the time of&#xD;
      randomization, a patient-specific, prespecified systolic blood pressure (SBP) target range&#xD;
      will be determined and recorded prior to study drug treatment. Up to 500 patients may be&#xD;
      enrolled to achieve a total of 100 Stage 1 and 300 Stage 2 patients with confirmed AHF per&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Safety Monitoring Board will be utilized periodically throughout the study to monitor&#xD;
      the safety of patients. Adverse events will be assessed for 7 days post-study randomization&#xD;
      or hospital discharge, whichever occurred sooner. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed&#xD;
      for 30 days following study randomization.&#xD;

    <description>Clevidipine (0.5 mg/mL in 20% lipid emulsion) will be administered in a double-blinded fashion intravenously to all patients randomized to the clevidipine arm in Stage 1. Clevidipine will be initiated at an initial rate of 2 mg/h for the first 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) and titrated thereafter per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clevidipine label, to achieve the target SBP +/- 5 mmHg. If the target SBP is achieved at any of the titration doses, that rate may be continued for up to 24 hours. If the desired BP lowering effect is not attained within 30 minutes or not maintained thereafter, any alternative antihypertensive agent may be used per institutional treatment practice, with or without stopping the study drug infusion.</description>

    <description>Placebo will be administered in a double-blinded fashion intravenously to all patients randomized to the clevidipine arm in Stage 1. Placebo will be initiated at an initial rate of 2 mg/h for the first 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) and titrated thereafter according to the same dosing instructions as for clevidipine to achieve the target SBP +/- 5 mmHg. If the target SBP is achieved at any of the titration doses, that rate may be continued for up to 24 hours. If the desired BP lowering effect is not attained within 30 minutes or not maintained thereafter, any alternative antihypertensive agent may be used per institutional treatment practice, with or without stopping the study drug infusion.</description>

    <description>Clevidipine (0.5 mg/mL in 20% lipid emulsion) will be administered in an open-label fashion intravenously to all patients randomized to the clevidipine arm in Stage 2, following the same dosing instructions as in the clevidipine arm in Stage 1. If the desired BP lowering effect is not attained within 30 minutes or not maintained thereafter, any alternative antihypertensive agent may be used per institutional treatment practice, with or without stopping the study drug infusion.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to SOC, the infusion must be continuous, administered per the institution's treatment practice, and dose titration must be performed to a maximum allowed or maximum tolerated dose to achieve target SBP. If treatment with an alternative IV anti-hypertensive agent is required, the patient will be transitioned to an alternative IV antihypertensive agent according to the institutional standard of care.</description>

    <description>Patients may be transitioned to an oral antihypertensive medication as necessary.

The clevidipine infusion may be down-titrated or terminated at any time following administration of the oral agent, in order to achieve the desired BP level.</description>
