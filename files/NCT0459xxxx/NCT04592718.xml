  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has suggested that stress and anxiety levels are associated with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in endurance athletes (runners, cyclists, triathletes). Yet,&#xD;
      there has been limited attempt to evaluate whether GI symptoms during running can be&#xD;
      mitigated by interventions designed to reduce stress and anxiety. Thus, this study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of four-week slow deep breathing and mindful breath counting&#xD;
      interventions on subjective and objective measures of stress/anxiety and GI symptoms in&#xD;
      runners with mild-to-high anxiety and that are prone to GI symptoms during runs.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gastrointestinal symptom occurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 4 weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms will be collected for a 1-week period before the intervention and during the 4th week of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of training runs that runners experience at least 1 gastrointestinal symptom (&gt;2 on 0-10 scale).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety levels</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 4 weeks. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 will be assessed before the intervention begins, 2 weeks into the intervention, and at the end of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of anxiety will be assessed with the General Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire. Scores on the General Anxiety Disorder-7 range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visceral sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 4 weeks. The Visceral Sensitivity Index will be assessed before the intervention begins, 2 weeks into the intervention, and at the end of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of visceral sensitivity will be assessed via the Visceral Sensitivity Index. Scores on the Visceral Sensitivity Index can range from 0 to 75, with higher scores indicating a higher level of visceral sensitivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 4 weeks. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire will be assessed before the intervention begins, 2 weeks into the intervention, and at the end of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of mindfulness will be assessed via the 15-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Scores on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire can range from 15-75, with higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body vigilance</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 4 weeks. The Body Vigilance Scale will be assessed before the intervention begins, 2 weeks into the intervention, and at the end of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of body vigilance will be assessed via the Body Vigilance Scale. Scores on the Body Vigilance Scale can range from 0-40, with higher levels meaning greater amounts of body vigilance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in heart rate variability (Ln RMSSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 4 weeks. Ln RMSSD will be assessed before the intervention begins, and at the end of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability will be assessed via a portable fingertip monitor (CorSense) and quantified as the Ln root mean square of successive differences (Ln RMSSD) between normal heartbeats.</description>
