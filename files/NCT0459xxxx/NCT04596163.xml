  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sternotomy pain is usually significant after cardiac surgery. Analgesic options for&#xD;
      sternotomy in cardiac surgery are often limited. Poorly controlled acute pain is an important&#xD;
      factor to development of chronic postsurgical pain. The transversus thoracis muscle plane&#xD;
      (TTP) block is a novel technique that provides analgesia to anterior chest wall. A&#xD;
      double-blinded RCT is conducted to assess the efficacy of applying TTP block as an adjunct to&#xD;
      analgesia in cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is defined as the persistence of pain at surgical site or&#xD;
      referred area, at least 3 months following the surgical procedure. CPSP after median&#xD;
      sternotomy is not uncommon after cardiac surgery. The reported incidence ranges from 28% to&#xD;
      56% up to 2 years postoperatively. A number of factors can contribute to the variation in&#xD;
      incidence, including the variations in presentation of chronic post-sternotomy pain and&#xD;
      under-reporting from patients. Given the nature of cardiac surgery and considerable anxiety&#xD;
      of patients at perioperative period, patients would tend to live with the chronic pain and&#xD;
      rationalize it as a normal consequence of the surgery. Patients therefore may not report any&#xD;
      symptoms, resulting in a delay in diagnosis of chronic post-sternotomy pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms for development of CPSP after sternotomy are not fully known. The&#xD;
      up-regulation, activation and neural sensitization during the acute pain phase are important&#xD;
      factors to the development of chronic pain. Causes of pain from sternotomy include neuropathy&#xD;
      from anterior intercostal nerves entrapment or injury during surgical dissection and internal&#xD;
      mammary artery harvesting, musculoskeletal injury from surgical incision and dissection,&#xD;
      sternal fracture or incomplete bone healing, and development of sternal wound infections.&#xD;
      Poorly controlled acute pain in the perioperative period can trigger central sensitization, a&#xD;
      stepwise modification of spinal pain pathways involving protein synthesis and synaptic&#xD;
      strength, which can lead to hyperalgesia and chronic pain. Therefore, good perioperative&#xD;
      acute pain control not only provides postoperative pain relief, but also prevents occurrence&#xD;
      of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most centres, opioids such as fentanyl and morphine are used mainly for the management of&#xD;
      acute pain after cardiac surgery. However, perioperative opioids are known to be associated&#xD;
      with dose-dependent side effects such as nausea and vomiting, pruritis, respiratory&#xD;
      depression, postoperative chronic opioid use and increased risk of chronic pain. Multimodal&#xD;
      approach such as the use of NSAIDs may not be optimal after cardiac surgery due to the risk&#xD;
      of bleeding and renal failure. Regional analgesia has opioid-sparing effect and seems to be a&#xD;
      good choice for perioperative anaglesia. Regional techniques such as thoracic epidural and&#xD;
      paravertebral blocks have been described but they are not ideal due to the potential&#xD;
      complications from systemic heparinization in cardiac surgery. Erector spinae plane (ESP)&#xD;
      block was reported to decrease perioperative morphine consumption and early postoperative&#xD;
      pain score. However, the transverse process tip is not always easy to visualize on&#xD;
      ultrasound, especially in obese patients, resulting in variation in ESP block efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transversus thoracis muscle plane (TTP) block covers the anterior branches of intercostal&#xD;
      nerves T2 to T6. It has been described in cardiac surgical patients that provides analgesia&#xD;
      for sternotomy. TTP block is a superficial block and therefore is relatively safe when&#xD;
      compared with thoracic epidural and paravertebral nerve block during heparinization. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that pre-emptive TTP block can provide effective perioperative&#xD;
      analgesia and prevent the occurrence of CPSP in cardiac surgical patients requiring median&#xD;
      sternotomy. A prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess&#xD;
      the analgesic efficacy of TTP block in open cardiac surgery.&#xD;
