  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: While caesarean sections are increasing, breast-feeding rates are decreasing. It&#xD;
      is important to implement supportive programs to ensure mothers breast feed for the desired&#xD;
      period and infants are fed by only mother's milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: In the research, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of lactation management models on&#xD;
      mothers' breastfeeding process following a caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The research was conducted as a randomized controlled study and experimentally.&#xD;
      Before implementation, Lactation Management Model was developed. Data collection was&#xD;
      performed during gestation, first day after postpartum, pre-discharge, on 9th day in face to&#xD;
      face interview and in the form of monthly phone interviews up to 6 months. While the&#xD;
      experimental group exercised lactation management model, control group received routine&#xD;
      lactation practices in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Among the females in the experimental group, it was found that breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy were higher, and breastfeeding techniques were accurate and successful and&#xD;
      breastfeeding only and continuity rates were higher while breastfeeding related breast&#xD;
      problems developed less frequently. Lactation management model should be used and expanded to&#xD;
      increase breastfeeding rates.&#xD;

      It is a birth right of babies to be breast fed and nursed. However, approximately 7.6 million&#xD;
      babies cannot be fed with breast milk in the world every year. United Nations International&#xD;
      Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) declared in its statement that, breast milk access is&#xD;
      decreased as household income increases and in nations with high income 1 out of every 5&#xD;
      babies and for low or middle income nations 1 of every 25 babies never fed breast milk&#xD;
      (UNICEF, 2018). Worldwide, among the infants under six months old, 40% is fed with breast&#xD;
      milk only (UNICEF, 2017). According to Turkey Demographic and Health Survey data, it is found&#xD;
      that in Turkey; breast milk feeding rate of infants under 6 months is 41% and in average&#xD;
      breast milk feeding period is 1.8 months (TNSA, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many factors affecting whether an infant is breastfed. Delivery method is among one&#xD;
      of them. While in OECD nations and in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 32% of every delivery was&#xD;
      caesarean (Health İndicators, 2018; ACOG, 2019), in Turkey this rate is indicated as 52%&#xD;
      (TNSA, 2018). Caesarean delivery compared to vaginal delivery is negatively affecting the&#xD;
      initial lactation period, milk production and suckling instinct of the infant (Hobbs et al.,&#xD;
      2016). Esencan et al. has determined that 42.4% of women who had spinal-caesarean deliveries&#xD;
      did not breast feed (Esencan et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous factors are in effect for suckling and milk production. Various studies are&#xD;
      performed in the literature it is emphasized that in order to stimulate and increase the milk&#xD;
      production; apart from evidence based applications, breast stimulation and other techniques&#xD;
      to cure nursing problems should be employed (Anderson et al., 2016). Becker et al. In their&#xD;
      systematical compositions; determined that actions such as; resting, music, applying warmth&#xD;
      to breast area, massaging, pump aided stimulations increased milk production clinically in a&#xD;
      significant manner (Becker et al., 2016). Although applying warmth to breast area, massaging&#xD;
      and relaxations techniques for increasing milk production and ensuring long term breast&#xD;
      feeding are evidently lacking in the international manuals; early nursing, skin-to-skin&#xD;
      contact together with education and support is stated to be positively affecting breast&#xD;
      feeding (WHO, 2017; NICE, 2015). Despite all these actions taken national and international&#xD;
      breast feeding data still is not at a favorable level. Because initiation of lactation&#xD;
      contuniuty and increase in the period of breastfeeding depends on many factors. Education of&#xD;
      mother starting from gestational period; care, support and consultancy services should be&#xD;
      provided during pregnancy, birth and postpartum periods. This study has been planned in&#xD;
      consideriation with the need for a model that includes all this service, maintenance and&#xD;
      support, no similar study has been found in the literature that has all these components&#xD;
      together.&#xD;
