  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this clinical trial is to identify the impact of selected package&#xD;
      features, known as the Opioid Package Prototype (OPP), on the safe and effective use of&#xD;
      opioids. Our specific aims are: (Aim 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of OPP on prescribing,&#xD;
      dispensing, and patient use of oxycodone among orthopaedic surgery patients receiving&#xD;
      post-operative outpatient oxycodone for post-surgical pain management, and (Aim 2) to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of OPP for orthopaedic surgery prescribers, pharmacists, and&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgery patients. Such data can be used to further optimize packaging and&#xD;
      labeling design, help patients and caregivers utilize their medication and packaging&#xD;
      correctly, and improve prescribing and dispensing habits. The central hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      OPP will be more effective than the amber vial in efforts to reduce oxycodone prescribing&#xD;
      among patients over 18 receiving short-term management of post orthopedic surgery pain.&#xD;
