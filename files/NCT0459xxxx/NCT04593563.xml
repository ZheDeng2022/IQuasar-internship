  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-center, fixed dose, open label trial to explore the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of a 25mg dose of psilocybin in cancer patients with MDD. The study&#xD;
      population will include adult men and women, 18 years of age or above, with MDD, diagnosed&#xD;
      with a malignant neoplasm. MDD is defined as those who meet DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for a&#xD;
      single or recurrent episode of MDD without psychotic features. A diagnosis of a malignant&#xD;
      neoplasm is defined as having a diagnostic code from C00 to C97 according to the ICD-10.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psilocybin therapy for anxiety and&#xD;
      depression associated with cancer diagnosis showed significant improvement in study endpoints&#xD;
      reflecting psychological distress, as compared to placebo. The effects of a single psilocybin&#xD;
      therapy session endured for up to six months with no specific follow-up care. In this study,&#xD;
      we aim to explore the safety and efficacy of psilocybin therapy in cancer patients, diagnosed&#xD;
      with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;
