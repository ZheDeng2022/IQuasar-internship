  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide impact of obesity suggests an urgent need for solutions to decrease its burden&#xD;
      on modern society. It has been generally understood that obesity is caused by a simple&#xD;
      imbalance in the intake of energy in the form of food compared with the expenditure of energy&#xD;
      by the body the human microbiota consists of a wide variety of microorganisms, including&#xD;
      bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, protozoans and yeast. These organisms colonize both the&#xD;
      exterior and interior of the human body in numbers that are equivalent to those of human&#xD;
      cells of their host. Current research has identified numerous physiological and&#xD;
      psycho-modulatory functions of the gut microbiota, including digesting food, stimulating cell&#xD;
      growth, strengthening the immune system, preventing allergies and diseases, and impacting&#xD;
      emotion. The gut microbiota can contribute to host physiology through metabolite production,&#xD;
      such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can modulate the intestinal barrier and&#xD;
      inflammation 9.Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, defined as a decrease in commensal bacteria&#xD;
      levels and diversity, has been linked to diseases such as stomach/colon/liver cancer 2,&#xD;
      obesity 9,inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and anxiety.&#xD;

      Aim &amp;Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis • Null Hypothesis: There is no difference between the Lean donor Faecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation and no Faecal microbiota transplantation as regards to weight loss in obese&#xD;
      persons with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Alternate hypothesis: Lean donor Faecal microbiota transplantation will lead to greater&#xD;
      weight loss in obese persons with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as compared to no faecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation in obese persons with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  250gm stool sample form the selected donor will be resuspended in 250ml of freezing&#xD;
           media. This will be agitated in a blender 3 times in pluses of 20-30seconds to get a&#xD;
           homogenate. The freezing media will contain 12.5% glycerol and 0.9% N saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The homogenous suspension will then be filtered through sterile gauze pieces, 3-4 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30ml filtrate will be collected in aliquot of 100 ml volume and this will be stored at&#xD;
           -80C till use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For use the aliquot containing 30ml of filtrate will be thawed at 30C in a warm water&#xD;
           bath. 70ml 0.9%N saline will be added to make up the volume to 100ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool Administration Procedure (ILBS FMT Protocol)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The recipient will be kept nil per oral for at least 4 hours prior to the stool&#xD;
           instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100 mL freshly thawed sample will be given once in 15 days for 3 doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-absorbable antibiotics will be avoided in the patient from the time of enrollment&#xD;
           into the study and therapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous antibiotics will be continued as per institutional protocol in the event of&#xD;
           active sepsis based on culture and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be allowed to consume liquid diet two hours after the procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Antibiotics will be given in both the groups when clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIET AND EXERCISE PROGRAMME AND ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high-protein low carbohydrate diet (HPLC) diet would be prescribed to the patients. HPLC&#xD;
      (high-protein low carbohydrate) diet would comprise of energy as 20-25 Kcal/Kg IBW/day&#xD;
      (amounting to 700- 800 Kcal less than the usual dietary intake), Protein as 1.2-1.5 gm/Kg&#xD;
      IBW/day i.e. 30% of the total calories as proteins, 52% of carbohydrates 18% of fats with&#xD;
      dietary fiber as 25 g/day. The protein requirements would be met with modular high protein,&#xD;
      low calorie supplements25,26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise program would consist of brisk walking. Brisk walking is defined as the walking&#xD;
      intensity of 60-70% of their respective age-predicted maximum heart rate (target heart rate)&#xD;
      27,28. Speed of 5- 6 kmph considered as a brisk walking in most of the studies preferably on&#xD;
      a treadmill for a duration of 30-45 minutes30 or brisk walking (walking faster than normal&#xD;
      pace, measure 5000 steps continuously by pedometer). Same amount of physical activity would&#xD;
      be prescribed to both the groups for 5 days a week for 30 -45 min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Intervention: This diet and exercise regimen would be implemented for a period of&#xD;
      6months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Compliance- Following measures would be taken to ensure the compliance of the&#xD;
      patients-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diet Charts: - Individual diet charts (customized to patient's requirements) -&#xD;
           mentioning the total amount of food items, their quantity &amp; house hold measure would be&#xD;
           provided and explained, for a lucid understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Daily diet dairy: - All the patients would record their daily diet in a dairy given to&#xD;
           them, to maximize their adherence and self-motivation to comply with the prescribed&#xD;
           diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Telephonic follow-ups: - Weekly, all the patients would be telephoned to check their&#xD;
           overall compliance with the prescribed diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up in OPD: - Patient would be asked to follow-up in the OPD at 1 month to check&#xD;
           their overall clinical progress and compliance. The diet and symptom diary would be&#xD;
           cross checked and also confirmed with the nearest relative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The overall compliance: - The compliance questionnaire is one of the methods to ensure&#xD;
           compliance (other than diet charts, diet diary, OPD follow-ups and telephonic&#xD;
           follow-ups) and an objective way to quantify the overall dietary compliance of the&#xD;
           patients. In point number 5 the calculation of the Likert scale (3 options) is very&#xD;
           explicitly given, nevertheless the actual questionnaire is a modified version of the one&#xD;
           used in the study of the Abdullah Al Lahiri's paper. This modified questionnaire is&#xD;
           attached in the Performa. Likert scale based questionnaire24, including 10 close-ended&#xD;
           questions. Responses would be rated on a three-point scale, which would be required to&#xD;
           determine whether the patients (always=2, sometimes=1 or never=0) followed dietary&#xD;
           advice. According to the overall score, which would range from 0 to 20, the patient's&#xD;
           adherence would be classified as- i. 'Good adherence' if the score is &gt;15 ii. 'Partial&#xD;
           adherence' if the score is between 10 and 15 iii. 'Non-adherence' if the score is &lt;10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount of food is going to based upon each individual. We will give diet chart to every&#xD;
      individual; we will explain to each individual in details regarding the benefits of protein&#xD;
      low carbohydrate and the importance of the quantification of the diet. Regarding the scale of&#xD;
      compliance, it is validated and used also and I have attached the questionnaires in the&#xD;
      Performa. Exemplary diet chart also attached in the Performa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity compliance: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First Session at study facility: Patient will be asked to complete one session of the&#xD;
           prescribed exercise at the study facility so that they understand the regimen well and&#xD;
           can do the rest at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Activity log book: Patients will be asked to fill the activity log books on daily basis&#xD;
           and bring it every time they visit the OPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It is measured by self-report questionnaires. There are so many self-report&#xD;
           questionnaires like Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ), Previous Week Modifiable&#xD;
           Activity Questionnaire (PWMAQ), Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ),&#xD;
           International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ), Previous Day Physical Activity&#xD;
           Recall (PDPAR), and 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) 31,. International Physical&#xD;
           Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) - Short Form: IPAQ-SF will be used at baseline and at the&#xD;
           end of the intervention period to assess the type of physical activity and sitting time.&#xD;
           Total physical activity is expressed in MET-min/week and time spent in sitting will be&#xD;
           calculated during the last 7 days. According to the MET-min/week physical activity level&#xD;
           of the patients would be categorized as Vigorous, Moderate or Low. Likewise changes in&#xD;
           the MET-min/week would express not only the compliance of the patient but also take into&#xD;
           account the any additional activities done by the patient other than the minimum&#xD;
           prescribed ones Donor diet during FMT The selected donor is a single healthy lean young&#xD;
           person, having a desired body weight. Hence during the study period (i.e. till the donor&#xD;
           is donating the stool sample in the study) the donor would be asked to follow his usual&#xD;
           normal diet and there would not be any specifications for the 'type' of diet he is&#xD;
           supposed to eat. Nevertheless, in order to avoid any eventualities of gastrointestinal&#xD;
           disorders which would necessitate use of antibiotics and other drugs hampering the stool&#xD;
           donation process, this healthy donor would be asked to abstain from eating street foods.&#xD;
           However, he is free to eat at family get-togethers and parties, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS [AT BASELINE, 3 MO, 6 MO AND 12 MO].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life style failure is defined as Dietary therapy should ensure an intake reduced by 500 to&#xD;
      1,000 kcal/day from the current level. Low calorie diets (LCDs) containing 1,000 to 1,200&#xD;
      kcal/day for most women and between 1,200 kcal/day and 1,600 kcal/day for men. Physical&#xD;
      activity (walking, dancing, gardening, household chores and team or individual sports) should&#xD;
      be increased slowly to a level that ensures at least 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity&#xD;
      physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the week for 6 months could not reduce&#xD;
      weight by 5 % labeled as life style failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Weight: - electronic weighing machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist and Hip Measurements :- the waist circumference should be measured at the midpoint&#xD;
      between the lower margin of the last palpable ribs and the top of the iliac crest, using a&#xD;
      stretch-resistant tape that provides a constant 100 g tension. Hip circumference should be&#xD;
      measured around the widest portion of the buttocks, with the tape parallel to the floor. 14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory Assessments. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR): - (Insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR): - fasting insulin (microU/L) x fasting glucose (nmol/L)/22.5.) and insulin is&#xD;
      getting measured by A chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) 15 is commonly used in our&#xD;
      laboratories for measurement of insulin concentration in our samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen TNF-alpha, adiponectin, leptin, Ghrelin.: -&#xD;
      they are measured with the special ELISA kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiome analysis methods: - This technique allows the rapid sequencing of multiple&#xD;
      samples at one time, yielding thousands of sequences reads per sample. Specifically, we&#xD;
      generated a set of 96 emulsion polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fusion primers that contain&#xD;
      the 454 emulsion PCR linkers on the 27F primer (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3=) and 355R'&#xD;
      (5=-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3=) and different 8-base barcode between the A adapter and the 27F&#xD;
      primer.8 Thus, each faecal sample was amplified with unique bar-coded forward 16S ribosomal&#xD;
      RNA primers, and then up to 96 samples were pooled and subjected to emulsion PCR and pyro&#xD;
      sequenced. 16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum transcriptome: - Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an&#xD;
      organism's transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of&#xD;
      an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here,&#xD;
      mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding&#xD;
      RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the&#xD;
      total transcripts present in a cell. The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome&#xD;
      began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made&#xD;
      transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated&#xD;
      technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques&#xD;
      in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA&#xD;
      sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high throughput sequencing to capture all sequences. 17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition analysis method: - common assessments are anthropometric and include weight,&#xD;
      stature, abdominal circumference, and skinfold measurements. 18 Assessment of compliance to&#xD;
      diet and exercise programme: - by the number of questionnaires asked during each visit of&#xD;
      patient in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sample for microbiome analysis will be collected on day 0,7, 90 and 180. All the&#xD;
      adverse effects will be monitored and notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 18- 55 yrs of age with NAFLD and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI ≤ 35 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index (BMI) is ≤30 to 34.9 kg/m2 with at least one treated or untreated&#xD;
           comorbid condition (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, glucose&#xD;
           intolerance, sleep apnoea, NASH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attended hepatology OPD. Study design: Randomized controlled trial Study period: One year&#xD;
      from ethics approval. Sample size: 110 (55 cases in each group) Intervention: The subjects&#xD;
      will be given FMT through UGI endoscopy. They will be administered the processed fecal&#xD;
      microbiota sample collected from lean healthy donor for a period of 0/15/30 days.&#xD;

    <description>A high-protein low carbohydrate diet (HPLC) diet would be prescribed to the patients. HPLC (high-protein low carbohydrate) diet would comprise of energy as 20-25 Kcal/Kg IBW/day (amounting to 700- 800 Kcal less than the usual dietary intake), Protein as 1.2-1.5 gm/Kg IBW/day i.e. 30% of the total calories as proteins, 52% of carbohydrates 18% of fats with dietary fiber as 25 g/day. The protein requirements would be met with modular high protein, low calorie supplements.</description>

    <description>Stool Administration Procedure (ILBS FMT Protocol)&#xD;
500 mL filtrates will be delivered through the UGI Endoscopy into proximal jejunum [(2 to 3 minutes per 50 ml).]&#xD;
The recipient will be kept nil per oral for at least 4 hours prior to the stool instillation.&#xD;
100 mL freshly thawed sample will be given once in 15 days for 3 doses&#xD;
Non-absorbable antibiotics will be avoided in the patient from the time of enrollment into the study and therapy initiation.&#xD;
Intravenous antibiotics will be continued as per institutional protocol in the event of active sepsis based on culture and sensitivity.&#xD;
The patient will be allowed to consume liquid diet two hours after the procedure.</description>

The exercise program would consist of brisk walking. Brisk walking is defined as the walking intensity of 60-70% of their respective age-predicted maximum heart rate (target heart rate) 27,28. Speed of 5- 6 kmph considered as a brisk walking in most of the studies preferably on a treadmill for a duration of 30-45 minutes30 or brisk walking (walking faster than normal pace, measure 5000 steps continuously by pedometer). Same amount of physical activity would be prescribed to both the groups for 5 days a week for 30 -45 min.</description>
