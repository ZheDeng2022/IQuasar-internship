  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of certain white blood cells (called lymphocytes). These cells&#xD;
      are found in lymph nodes. The cancer can cause enlargement of the lymph nodes leading to pain&#xD;
      and discomfort. Swollen lymph nodes can also press on nearby organs such as liver and kidneys&#xD;
      which can affect normal functioning of the organs. Researchers think that a new combination&#xD;
      of drugs may be able to help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if it is safe to give the combination of Magrolimab, Obinutuzumab and Venetoclax&#xD;
      to people with B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older with an indolent B-cell lymphoma whose disease has returned or&#xD;
      progressed after other treatment. Indolent B-cell lymphoma for this protocol is defined as&#xD;
      having either follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 28-day 'cycles' of treatment. They will take Venetoclax by mouth&#xD;
      daily. They will get Obinutuzumab and Magrolimab by intravenous (IV) infusion. Treatment will&#xD;
      last for about 8 months. They may be able to have more cycles of treatment if their cancer is&#xD;
      responding well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have physical exams, medical histories, and medicine reviews. Data about&#xD;
      how they function in their daily activities will be obtained. They will have blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. They may have bone marrow tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have imaging scans. These will include computed tomography (CT) and/or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give a cheek swab or saliva sample. They may give tumor tissue and bone&#xD;
      marrow samples. These samples may be used for gene testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit about 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will&#xD;
      have visits every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and&#xD;
      then yearly after that.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indolent B-cell malignancies are associated with frequent disease relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard frontline therapy includes a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody with or without&#xD;
           chemotherapy; novel targeted therapies have changed the treatment landscape and are&#xD;
           preferred therapy for some patients with high-risk molecular features&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeted therapies given indefinitely add to drug resistance, treatment-emergent&#xD;
           toxicities, and non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD47 is a rational target for indolent B-cell malignancies; CD47 expression is higher in&#xD;
           tumor cells than normal B-cells, and blocking CD47 results in phagocytosis of tumor&#xD;
           cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magrolimab is an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody with activity in refractory indolent&#xD;
           lymphomas when combined with rituximab (a first generation anti-CD20 monoclonal&#xD;
           antibody)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc&#xD;
           receptor that may improve antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and&#xD;
           phagocytosis, when combined with magrolimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We aim to test the safety and efficacy of venetoclax when added to the backbone of&#xD;
           magrolimab and obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell&#xD;
           malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment duration will be response-adapted and time-limited in all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety of the triplet combination of venetoclax, magrolimab and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab in relapsed and refractory indolent B-cell malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL) (grades 1-2, or 3a), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle cell&#xD;
           lymphoma (MCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with greater than or equal to 2&#xD;
           prior therapies, with at least one of those therapies containing an anti-CD20 monoclonal&#xD;
           antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 study with expansion cohorts of up to 76 patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
           FL, MZL, MCL or CLL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety profile of magrolimab, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab will first be determined&#xD;
           in a dose-finding phase of up to 24 patients (6-12 patients with FL and 6-12 patients&#xD;
           with MZL, MCL or CLL). Patients without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will receive an&#xD;
           additional 5 cycles (total 6 cycles) of the triplet combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After dose-finding is completed, expansion cohorts of each histology will first receive&#xD;
           magrolimab and obinutuzumab for 2 cycles in a window for translational research. After&#xD;
           the window, venetoclax will be added and patients will receive 6 cycles (total 8 cycles)&#xD;
           of the triplet combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) (after a total of 6 cycles of the triplet&#xD;
           combination) will stop treatment and initiate active monitoring with radiologic imaging&#xD;
           and assays for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); if these patients relapse, they can be&#xD;
           retreated with an 6 additional cycles. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) after&#xD;
           6 cycles of the triplet will continue for an additional 6 cycles; then, will initiate&#xD;
           active monitoring.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -Adequate tissue from diagnostic biopsy (archival or fresh) must be available for&#xD;
        performance of correlative studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Tumor tissue may be from any previously collected tissue and adequacy is at the&#xD;
        discretion of the Principal Investigator. If prior tissue is not available, patient must be&#xD;
        willing to undergo baseline tissue biopsy (for patients with known or suspected bone marrow&#xD;
        involvement, bone marrow may be acceptable tissue per discretion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients must have at least evaluable disease as assessed by clinical exam (i.e., palpable&#xD;
        lymphadenopathy, measurable skin lesions, etc.), laboratory assessment (i.e., lymphoma&#xD;
        involvement of bone marrow or peripheral blood by morphology, cytology or flow cytometry),&#xD;
        and/or imaging (measurable lymph nodes or masses on CT or MRI and/or evaluable FDG-avid&#xD;
        lesions on PET). Patients may also have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients with known active CNS lymphoma are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of&#xD;

        discretion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -The effects of the study drugs on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
        women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use effective contraception&#xD;
        when sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed&#xD;
        consent form and for the following time frames after the last dose of drug, whichever is&#xD;
        later: 120 days after the last dose of magrolimab, 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
        venetoclax, and 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab for women and 6 months after&#xD;
        the last dose of obinutuzumab for men. Men should refrain also from donating sperm for&#xD;
        these same timeframes, and women must also refrain from donating eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;
        successful surgical sterilization or who is not postmenopausal (i.e., amenorrheic for &gt;12&#xD;
        months without alternative medical cause; post-menopausal status in females under 55 years&#xD;
        of age should be confirmed with a serum follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level within&#xD;
        applicable local laboratory reference range for postmenopausal women). Permanent&#xD;
        sterilization methods include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy&#xD;
        and bilateral oophorectomy. The investigator or a designated associate is requested to&#xD;
        advise the patient how to achieve highly effective birth control (failure rate of less than&#xD;
        1%), e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS),&#xD;
        bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner and sexual abstinence. The use of condoms&#xD;
        by male patients is required unless the female partner is permanently sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of patient to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation are potentially&#xD;
             eligible if transplanted &gt; 6 months ago, and no active graft-vs-host disease requiring&#xD;
             immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of any investigational anti-lymphoma treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known primary or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (e.g., HIV) or known infection&#xD;
             with human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV1). NOTE: HIV-positive patients on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with the study drugs. In addition, these patients are at increased risk&#xD;
             of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. In the future,&#xD;
             appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia in the 3 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Patients with positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) but no evidence of&#xD;
             clinically active hemolysis are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B DNA PCR positive. NOTE: Subjects who are&#xD;
             hepatitis B core antibody positive will need to have a negative HBV DNA PCR result&#xD;
             before enrollment. Those with a positive PCR for hepatitis B are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding patients. NOTE: Pregnant women are excluded in this study&#xD;
             because of the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement to continue on any of the medications that have significant potential for&#xD;
             drug-drug interactions with the study regimen. For example, the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of strong CYP3A inhibitors 7 days prior to or at initiation of venetoclax,&#xD;
                  and during ramp-up phase is contraindicated in patients with MZL, CLL and MCL.&#xD;
                  For FL patients, use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated 7 days prior&#xD;
                  to and during the first two weeks of venetoclax treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Consumption of one or more of the following within 3 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
