  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of Sharing Healthcare Wishes in Primary Care (SHARE), a&#xD;
      two-group randomized trial at 6 primary care practices in which 124 dyads receive a control&#xD;
      protocol of minimally enhanced usual care and 124 dyads receive the SHARE protocol. This&#xD;
      study tests the efficacy of SHARE on quality of communication (primary outcome) and advance&#xD;
      care planning processes (secondary outcomes) at 6 months among primary care patients with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (mild-severe) and family caregiver dyads. For patients who die while&#xD;
      enrolled in the study by 24 months, this study examines the quality of end-of-life care and&#xD;
      bereaved family caregiver experiences with medical decision-making (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SHARE is guided by the patient-provider communication, family caregiving, health services,&#xD;
      and health informatics literatures in acknowledging the multiple pathways by which&#xD;
      interpersonal relationships influence treatment decisions and end-of-life care. Each&#xD;
      component of SHARE has been found to improve a range of communication outcomes in other care&#xD;
      contexts, but have not previously been applied in this combination or examined with regard to&#xD;
      advance care planning in persons with cognitive impairment. SHARE is designed to be broadly&#xD;
      scalable and widely relevant to diverse primary care patients and stakeholders. The study&#xD;
      goal is to engage family members or friends (&quot;family&quot; and/or &quot;caregiver&quot;) in longitudinal&#xD;
      interactions with primary care clinicians and stimulate and support advance care planning&#xD;
      discussions in primary care. SHARE seeks to improve communication for persons with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment by establishing a structured protocol to proactively engage family caregivers in&#xD;
      ongoing interactions with primary care clinicians and stimulate and support advance care&#xD;
      planning in primary care throughout the disease trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHARE evaluates a multicomponent communication intervention to proactively engage family&#xD;
      members or friends and support advance care planning in primary care. SHARE encompasses the&#xD;
      following four therapeutic elements: 1) a letter from the practice introducing the&#xD;
      initiative, 2) access to a designated person (medical assistant, social worker, nurse, or lay&#xD;
      person) trained to lead advance care planning discussions, 3) person-family agenda-setting to&#xD;
      align perspectives about the role of the caregiver and stimulate discussion about goals of&#xD;
      care, and 4) education about communication and available resources, including a 44-page&#xD;
      brochure developed by the National Institute on Aging entitled &quot;A Guide for Older People:&#xD;
      Talking with your Doctor&quot;, a blank easy to complete advance directive, and facilitated&#xD;
      registration to the patient portal (for patient and caregiver) to extend electronic&#xD;
      interactions and information access to family. The control group receives minimally enhanced&#xD;
      usual care with print educational materials that include the 44-page brochure developed by&#xD;
      the National Institute on Aging entitled &quot;A Guide for Older People: Talking with your Doctor&quot;&#xD;
      and a blank easy-to-complete advance directive. Participants in both groups are followed over&#xD;
      a 24-month period. Outcomes are assessed from patient and caregiver enrollment surveys&#xD;
      conducted in-person or by telephone or video conference at enrollment and follow-up telephone&#xD;
      or web surveys at 6, 12, and 24 months; Electronic health record portal activity; information&#xD;
      about advance directive completion from the electronic medical record; burdensome care at the&#xD;
      end of life from family survey and CRISP.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in Family-Reported Quality of Communication at 6-Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome assesses family-reported quality of communication with the primary care team using the 7-item end-of-life subscale of the validated Quality of Communication Scale. The scale for each item is from 0 ('Worst you can imagine') to 10 ('Best you can imagine'), with a range of 0-70 with higher scores indicating higher perceived quality of communication.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in Family-Reported Readiness to Engage in Advance Care Planning at 6-months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey is a validated patient-reported questionnaire that assesses advance care planning process measures on a 5-point Likert scale. The outcome assesses a 4-item subscale of the Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey that includes parallel items for patient and family participants. The scale for each item is from 1 (&quot;I have never thought about it&quot;) to 5 (&quot;I have already done it&quot;), with a range of 4-20 with higher scores indicating higher perceived readiness to engage in advance care planning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in the Proportion of Patients with Documentation of Advance Directive Completion in the Electronic Health Record at 6-months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Documentation of advance directive completion in the electronic health record is defined as having a durable power of attorney or a living will documented in the primary care electronic health record. The Medical Order for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) will not be included for this outcome as the completion of a Maryland MOLST is mandatory in certain situations, such as on transfer between settings of care, and is not indicative of having had an advance care planning discussion or naming a durable power of attorney.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in Bereaved Family-Reported Decisional Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months after patient death</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who die while enrolled in the study by 24 months, this outcome assesses bereaved family-reported Decisional Conflict using a 16-item instrument scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;). The 16 items are summed, divided by 16, then multiplied by 25 to yield scores that range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in Bereaved Family-Reported Decisional Regret</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months after patient death</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who die while enrolled in the study by 24 months, this outcome assesses bereaved family-reported decisional regret using a 5-item instrument that assesses the extent to which decision-makers experience regret about care. Response options are assessed using a 5-item Likert scale in which scores of 1 indicate the least regret and 5 the most regret. Scores are then reduced by 1 point and multiplied by 25 for a scale that ranges in value from 0 to 100. Prior studies have categorized scores of 0 as no regret, 1 to 25 as mild regret, and more than 25 as heightened regret.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in Bereaved Family Symptoms of Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months after patient death</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who die while enrolled in the study by 24 months, this outcome assesses bereaved family symptoms of anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item questionnaire (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a validated instrument that asks about symptoms of anxiety using a two-week recall period with response categories that vary from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Item responses are summed to construct composite scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in Bereaved Family-Reported Satisfaction with Care at the End-of-Life in Dementia</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months after patient death</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who die while enrolled in the study by 24 months, this outcome assesses bereaved family-reported satisfaction with care. The Satisfaction with Care at the End-of-Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD) is a 10-item instrument measured on a 4-point Likert scale that ranges from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) with a summary score ranging from 10-40 in which higher values indicate higher satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Group Differences in Proportion of Patients Who Received Burdensome Care</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months after patient death</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who die while enrolled in the study by 24 months, this outcome assesses the proportion of patients who received burdensome care near the end of life. Burdensome care is defined as any intensive care unit use or life prolonging care (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, dialysis, artificial nutrition, chemotherapy) within 30 days of death using dates and services abstracted from medical records and the Chesapeake Regional Information System (CRISP), Maryland's Health Information Exchange, which includes all hospital encounters.</description>
