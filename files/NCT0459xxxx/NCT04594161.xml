      SUMMARY Rationale If a stone obstructs the ureter and impairs urine-efflux from the kidney&#xD;
      this may cause infection, pain resulting from a renal colic and/or renal impairment. Drainage&#xD;
      of the kidney may be necessary and can be established by placement of either a percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrostomy (PCN) or a retrograde double J catheter (JJ). Considering method of drainage,&#xD;
      setting, room in which drainage procedures takes place and anesthesia method, there are in&#xD;
      fact 16 different approaches for drainage available, each with its own consequences for the&#xD;
      patient and on expenses. Although evidence is poor, both methods of drainage are to be&#xD;
      considered as equal.[1] This is reflected by the differences in preference between different&#xD;
      countries.[2] In 2016 the Dutch association for urology (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Urologie&#xD;
      (NVU)) marked this subject as one of the primary knowledge gaps in urology in The Netherlands&#xD;
      and gave it priority on the national knowledge agenda for urology.[3] From patients' as well&#xD;
      as from societal perspective it is of importance that the decision for placement of either&#xD;
      PCN or JJ will be made based on evidence based arguments and in a uniform way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Percutaneous nephrostomy is non inferior to retrograde double J catheter&#xD;
      regarding time to clinical recovery. Secondly, patient reported outcome measures (PROMS)&#xD;
      comparing treatment room and OR settings of drainage procedures will most likely not be&#xD;
      significantly different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, because percutaneous nephrostomy catheters are more often placed in a (outpatient)&#xD;
      urological or radiological treatment room, this is expected to be less expensive than&#xD;
      placement of a double J catheter (more often placed in the OR). Objective: To investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of percutaneous nephrostomy catheter placement versus retrograde double J&#xD;
      catheter placement in patients with symptoms of obstructive kidney disease (with either&#xD;
      infection and/or pain and/or kidney function deterioration) caused by urolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicenter prospective randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Male and female adult patients with signs of obstructive kidney disease&#xD;
      with kidney or ureteral lithiasis as an underlying cause and with an indication for drainage&#xD;
      based on symptoms of or laboratory tests indicating infection and/or pain and/or kidney&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: One group receives drainage by percutaneous nephrostomy catheter placement as&#xD;
      opposed to the other group which will receive drainage by retrograde double J catheter&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess whether a PCN is non-inferior to double J catheter&#xD;
      regarding time to clinical recovery in patients with obstructive kidney disease resulting&#xD;
      from urolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome parameter is time to clinical recovery. Clinical recovery is defined as&#xD;
      reaching one or more of the following criteria. The mandatory amount of criteria to achieve&#xD;
      clinical recovery is dependent on the indication for placement of a PCN or a JJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If indication for drainage is infection: improvement of infection, indicated by a&#xD;
           decrease of WBC in two executive laboratory results and below 15.000 mm3 and a body&#xD;
           temperature of 36-38.5 C. and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If indication for drainage is untreatable pain: Numeric rating score (NRS) considering&#xD;
           pain resulting from a renal colic is improved and &lt; 3 points and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If indication for drainage is deterioration of kidney function: improvement of&#xD;
           creatinine/ Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in two executive laboratory results It may&#xD;
           occur that the indication for drainage is a combination of the above named indications.&#xD;
           Clinical recovery will then be reached in case all parameters related to the different&#xD;
           indications are within the set range. Secondary outcomes are further clinical data,&#xD;
           PROMS (measured by the EQ-5D-5L, NRS, a satisfaction scale and a catheter questionnaire)&#xD;
           and societal costs (measured by a diseasespecified iMCQ questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The placement of either PCN or double J catheter is standard care. Currently the&#xD;
      choice for PCN or a double J catheter is based on expert opinion and may be driven by&#xD;
      arguments considering logistics or assumptions about the quality of life for a patient after&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the difference in rate of placement of both PCN and double J catheter between&#xD;
      various hospitals and different countries, it is believed experts have no uniform work method&#xD;
      to handle the dilemma of choosing between these two techniques.[2] Furthermore the current&#xD;
      EAU-guideline 2018 states that both methods of drainage are to be considered as equal.[1]&#xD;
      Therefore there is no reason to believe, patients will be affected negatively by being placed&#xD;
      randomly in either the double J group or the PCN group. Questionnaires will be filled in&#xD;
      daily during hospitalization and twice or less afterwards. This is not considered to be a&#xD;
      risk for the patient. The longest questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L and iMCQ) will take approximately&#xD;
      10-20 minutes to fill in, additional to the shorter scales (NRS, satisfaction scale) which&#xD;
      will take approximately 1 minute to fill in. Generally It will take 90 minutes, spread over&#xD;
      the course of three months, to fill in all questionnaires. For frequency and timing of the&#xD;
      questionnaires. Finally, no additional visits to a hospital, withdrawal of blood samples or&#xD;
      exposure to radiation is to be expected when taking part in this study.&#xD;
