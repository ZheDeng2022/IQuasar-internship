  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (TACE) combined with sintilimab and bevacizumab in patients with unresectable intermediate or&#xD;
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TACE combined with sintilimab&#xD;
      and bevacizumab in patients with unresectable intermediate or advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      36-39 subjects with unresectable intermediate or advanced HCC will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes dose escalation and dose expansion stage. 6-9 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in dose escalation stage for the safety evaluation. Then, sintilimab 200mg/kg IV. every three&#xD;
      weeks (q3w) + the select specific dose of bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg (group 1) or 15mg/kg (group2)&#xD;
      IV q3w, expand to 36 patients (18 patients each group) for the further safety and efficacy&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sintilimab and bevacizumab will be started at 3-7 days after the first TACE. TACE will be&#xD;
      repeated if clinically indicated based on the evaluation of follow-up laboratory and imaging&#xD;
      examination. And the study treatment of sintilimab and bevacizumab will last up to 24 months,&#xD;
      or until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of&#xD;
      follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
