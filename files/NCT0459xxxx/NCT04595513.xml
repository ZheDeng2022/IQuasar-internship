    <textblock>
      This trial will use a two stage, phase I/II clinical trial design. The first stage will&#xD;
      employ an open-label clinical trial design to verify dosing for TAVT-18 (sirolimus) powder&#xD;
      for oral solution in TSC infants (N=5). Results will then be carried forward to inform&#xD;
      appropriate initial dosing, dosing frequency, and dosing adjustments for the second stage, a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-site study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of early sirolimus to prevent or delay seizure onset in TSC infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is caused by genetic mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, resulting in&#xD;
      dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Age at time of&#xD;
      seizure onset in TSC infants has been linked to long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in this&#xD;
      high-risk population. TAVT-18 is a novel formulation of sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. This&#xD;
      will be the first study to truly evaluate a targeted, disease-modifying drug therapy for&#xD;
      preventing or delaying seizure onset in TSC using a rational, mechanism-based therapeutic&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;

             neurodevelopmental delay (i.e. HIE, severe neonatal infection, major surgery,&#xD;
             prolonged ventilatory or other life-saving supportive care or procedures)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal laboratory values at baseline (i.e., renal function, liver function, or bone&#xD;
             marrow production) that are in the opinion of the investigator clinically significant&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior, planned or anticipated neurosurgery within 3 months of the baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a TSC-associated condition for which mTOR treatment is clinically indicated (i.e.&#xD;
             SEGA or AML)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study&#xD;
