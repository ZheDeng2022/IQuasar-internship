  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (TACE) combined with sorafenib and tislelizumab in patients with advanced hepatocellullar&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with sorafenib&#xD;
      and tislelizumab in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 subjects with advanced HCC (Barcelona-Clinic- Liver-Cancer [BCLC] stage C, or China liver&#xD;
      cancer staging [CNLC] IIIa and IIIb) will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both sorafenib (400mg P.O. Bid) and tislelizumab (200mg I.V. q3w) will be started at 3-7 days&#xD;
      after the first TACE. TACE will be repeated if clinically indicated based on the evaluation&#xD;
      of follow-up laboratory and imaging examination. Sorafenib will last until disease&#xD;
      progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death,&#xD;
      or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Sorafenib administration will be delayed in cases of grade ≥2 hand-foot syndrome, grade &gt;3&#xD;
      hematologic toxicities or grade ≥3 hypertension. After recovery, sorafenib will be&#xD;
      reintroduced at a reduced dose according the sorafenib dose delay and reduction guidelines.&#xD;
      Treatment of tislelizumab will last up to 24 months, or until disease progresses, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances&#xD;
      that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first. Patients will be allowed to&#xD;
      have sorafenib or tislelizumab as a sigle agent and will be still considered on study when&#xD;
      the other drug cause intolerable toxicity.&#xD;
