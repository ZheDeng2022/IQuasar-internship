      Celiac disease shares many features of other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
      Recently, it was published that higher amounts of gluten intake increased the risk for celiac&#xD;
      disease. Optimal amounts of gluten to be introduced during weaning have not yet been&#xD;
      established. The aim is to investigate if a gluten-restricted diet (e.g. below 3 gram per&#xD;
      day) will reduce the risk of develop CDA and IA in genetically predisposed children by the&#xD;
      age of 5 years. Children who screened positive for HLA DQ2/X (X is neither DQ2 nor DQ8) in&#xD;
      the GPPAD-02 (ASTR1D [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03316261]) screening will be contacted&#xD;
      by a study nurse.&#xD;

      Gluten is a complex mixture of proteins, mainly gliadin and glutenin, rich in proline and&#xD;
      glutamine amino acids which make these proteins resistant to complete degradation by enzymes&#xD;
      in the small intestinal. Intolerance to gluten leads to inflammation of the intestinal&#xD;
      epithelium and villous atrophy, a disorder called celiac disease. Celiac disease shares many&#xD;
      features of other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). First, celiac disease is&#xD;
      associated with certain HLA genotypes of whom 95% of all patients with celiac disease carry&#xD;
      the haplotypes DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 (abbreviated DQ2) and the reminder 5% DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302&#xD;
      (abbreviated DQ8). There is a gene dose effect of HLA-DQ on the risk of develop celiac&#xD;
      disease; 20% of the children homozygous for HLA-DQ2/DQ2 will develop celiac disease by 10&#xD;
      years of age. Second, celiac disease is also strongly associated with the presence of&#xD;
      autoantibodies directed against tissue transglutaminase (tTGA) that occurs in 100% of&#xD;
      children with celiac disease. Timing of gluten introduction and breastfeeding duration have&#xD;
      previously been proposed to influence risk for celiac disease. However, based on the results&#xD;
      from the multinational birth cohort study The Environmental determinants of Diabetes in the&#xD;
      Young (TEDDY) study and other observational studies, timing of gluten introduction seems not&#xD;
      associated with celiac disease in genetically at-risk children. In an RCT, introduction of&#xD;
      small amounts of gluten at the age of 4-6 months did not reduce the risk for celiac disease&#xD;
      by the age of 3 years in genetically at-risk children. Current international infant feeding&#xD;
      recommendations recommend that gluten is introduced into the infant's diet anytime between&#xD;
      4-12 months of age and that consumption of large quantities of gluten should be avoided&#xD;
      during the first month after gluten introduction and during infancy. Recently, the TEDDY&#xD;
      study published that higher amounts of gluten intake increased the risk for celiac disease,&#xD;
      which have been confirmed in two other observational cohort studies. In the TEDDY study,&#xD;
      daily gluten intake was associated with higher increased risk of developing persistently&#xD;
      positive tTGA, a definition coined celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA), as well as with celiac&#xD;
      disease for every 1-g/day increase in gluten intake. Optimal amounts of gluten to be&#xD;
      introduced during weaning have not yet been established. It is well known that an overlap&#xD;
      between celiac disease and T1D exists most likely due to shared genetic risks of HLA-DQ2&#xD;
      and/or DQ8 in both disorders. Prospective studies in infants genetically predisposed to T1D&#xD;
      and celiac disease showed that antibody positivity to both disorders begins in the first 1-3&#xD;
      years of life. The study aim is to investigate if a gluten-restricted diet will reduce the&#xD;
      risk of develop CDA and IA in genetically predisposed children by the age of 5 years.&#xD;
