      This is a single-center observational study on adolescents to determine predictors of the&#xD;
      early steps of the formation of atherosclerosis and to quantify their influence on&#xD;
      Intima-Media-Thickness of the carotid artery and the aorta and on the Pulse-Wave Velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A long-term follow-up by means of record linkage is furthermore planned to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of early atherosclerosis and the cardiovascular risk profile on future morbidity with&#xD;
      a special focus cardio- and cerebrovascular events.&#xD;

      EVA4YOU is a cross-sectional study enrolling 3000 students and apprentices aged between 14&#xD;
      and 19 years. Examinations are conducted at schools and companies throughout Tyrol, Austria&#xD;
      and include laboratory measurements; standardized medical interviews; anthropometry; liver&#xD;
      elastography; ultrasonography of the carotid artery and the aorta, and blood pressure,&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance; visceral abdominal fat-tissue-thickness measurement, pulse-wave&#xD;
      velocity measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the cardiovascular risk factors measured already influence the&#xD;
      formation of atherosclerosis (measured as carotid and aortic Intima-Media Thickness and&#xD;
      Pulse-Wave-Velocity) in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A long-term follow-up by means of record linkage is furthermore planned to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of early atherosclerosis and the cardiovascular risk profile on future morbidity with&#xD;
      a special focus cardio- and cerebrovascular events.&#xD;
