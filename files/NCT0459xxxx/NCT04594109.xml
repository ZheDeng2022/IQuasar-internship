  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbidity and mortality from smoking-related diseases among people living with HIV (PLWH) in&#xD;
      the U.S. surpasses that due to HIV itself. Conventional smoking cessation treatments have not&#xD;
      demonstrated strong efficacy among PLWH. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) to evaluate a tailored smoking cessation intervention based on the minority stress&#xD;
      model, hypothesizing that behavioral counseling through this lens would enhance cessation. We&#xD;
      compared standard of care counseling (SOC) to a tailored intervention (TI) including one&#xD;
      face-to-face counseling session incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy to build&#xD;
      resilience, and 30 days of 2-way text messaging.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm were provided a one-time tailored cognitive-behavioral therapy in-person cessation counseling intervention lasting approximately one hour, a 30-day supply of nicotine replacement therapy (consisting of nicotine patches and nicotine gum; dosage according to current smoking intensity according to manufacturers instructions), and a tailored bi-directional text messaging program delivering two messages per day for four weeks. The TI session was adapted from the clinical practice guidelines to include behavioral elements rooted in the minority stress model. The intervention used addressed issues of stress related to HIV stigma, minority status and socioeconomic condition.</description>
