  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) can be defined as a slowly progressive prostatic adenoma&#xD;
      that cause bladder outlet obstruction. Risk factors for BPH can be classified into modifiable&#xD;
      risk factor including genetic factors and age with prevalence of 50% to 60% for males in&#xD;
      their 60's up to 80% to 90% of those who are over 70 years of age, and non-modifiable risk&#xD;
      factors including sex steroid hormones, the metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, physical&#xD;
      activity, diet, and inflammation. The clinical presentation of BPH can be categorized into&#xD;
      storage and voiding abnormalities. Symptoms include urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia&#xD;
      and dysuria in addition to urinary hesitancy, dribbling and incomplete bladder voiding.&#xD;
      Several hypotheses are postulated to explain the pathophysiology of BPH including the&#xD;
      testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, age related tissue remodelling, prostatic inflammation&#xD;
      and metabolic aberration as obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress has been reported to play a role the pathogenesis of BPH. Oxidative stress&#xD;
      has been considered to be one of the mechanisms that trigger the chain of reactions involved&#xD;
      in the development and progression of prostatic hyperplasia. This is especially true as the&#xD;
      human prostate tissue is vulnerable to oxidative DNA damage due to more rapid cell turnover&#xD;
      and fewer DNA repair enzymes. In a study conducted on prostate tissue, it was observed that&#xD;
      oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage are important in the pathogenesis of BPH. Higher&#xD;
      oxidative stress markers in terms of Malondialdehyde levels was reported in BPH patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, a systematic review revealed that prostatic inflammation can induce free radicals&#xD;
      formation that might play role in carcinogenesis and development of prostate cancer in&#xD;
      patients with BPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Garcinia cambogia is a natural fruit which has been reported to have anti-obesity activity&#xD;
      including reduced food intake and body fat gain by regulating the serotonin levels related to&#xD;
      satiety, increased fat oxidation and decreased de novo lipogenesis. It also exerted&#xD;
      hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anthelmintic, anticholinesterase&#xD;
      and hepatoprotective activities in in vitro and in vivo models . Hydro-citric acid, the main&#xD;
      component of garcinia extract, has been reported to have strong antioxidant property.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An animal study on rats has reported that kolaviron, a bioflavonoid complex from Garcinia&#xD;
      kola had decreased prostate weights (compared with the normal control and reversed the&#xD;
      histoarchitecture of the prostates of the BPH rats.&#xD;
