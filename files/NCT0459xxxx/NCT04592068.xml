  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish deep learning (DL) algorithm to automatically&#xD;
      classify multi-diseases from fundus photography and differentiate major vision-threatening&#xD;
      conditions and other retinal abnormalities. The effectiveness and accuracy of the established&#xD;
      algorithm will be evaluated in community derived dataset.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinal diseases seriously threaten vision and quality of life, but they often develop&#xD;
      insidiously. To date, deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown high prospects in biomedical&#xD;
      science, particularly in the diagnosis of ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy,&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, glaucoma, and papilledema.&#xD;
      However, there is still a lack of a single algorithm that can classify multi-diseases from&#xD;
      fundus photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional study will establish a DL algorithm to automatically classify&#xD;
      multi-diseases from fundus photography and differentiate major vision-threatening conditions&#xD;
      and other retinal abnormalities. We will use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)&#xD;
      curve to examine the ability of recognition and classification of diseases. Taken the results&#xD;
      of the expert panel as the gold standard, we will use the evaluation indexes, such as&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,&#xD;
      etc, to compare the diagnostic capacity between the AI recognition system and human&#xD;
      ophthalmologist.&#xD;
