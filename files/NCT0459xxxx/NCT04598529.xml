  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This aim of this study is to evaluate the acute and mid-term effects of A2 milk versus&#xD;
      conventional milk on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS&#xD;
      and in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. Moreover, the effect of immune and defense&#xD;
      markers will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional bowel disorder in which recurrent&#xD;
      abdominal pain is associated with defecation and altered bowel habits. Although the&#xD;
      pathophysiology is incompletely understood, it is generally regarded as a multifactorial&#xD;
      disorder involving host factors such as low-grade immune activation, altered intestinal&#xD;
      barrier function and defense. Environmental factors, including diet, are also suggested to&#xD;
      play a role. Dairy products such as cow's milk are widely produced and an important component&#xD;
      of the human diet. Cow's milk is composed of various macronutrients, micronutrients and&#xD;
      water. Beta-casein is a major protein component of cow's milk; most cows produce a mixture of&#xD;
      A1 and A2 beta-casein (conventional milk), whereas some cows produce only A2 beta-casein (A2&#xD;
      milk). It has been suggested that specific components in cow's milk, such as A1 beta-casein,&#xD;
      may trigger gastrointestinal symptoms after intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study performed in Maastricht&#xD;
      University Medical Center (MUMC+) is to explore the acute and mid-terms effects of A2 milk&#xD;
      versus conventional milk on gastrointestinal symptoms and immune and defense markers in&#xD;
      separate groups of patient with constipation-predominant IBS and in patients with&#xD;
      diarrhea-predominant IBS.&#xD;
