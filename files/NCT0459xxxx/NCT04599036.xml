  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a medically relevant problem for the aging population. Individuals with stroke&#xD;
      experience a high amount of arm functional deficits despite receiving rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Functional deficits can be improved by combining rehabilitation with innovative&#xD;
      rehabilitative tools that target the brain mechanisms that guide the recovery early after&#xD;
      stroke. This study aims to explore the feasibility of implementing an EMG controlled device&#xD;
      in the acute rehabilitation for stroke survivors with severe arm deficit. This study will&#xD;
      determine if adding such a technology improve the clinical outcomes for subjects with severe&#xD;
      arm impairments beyond the levels achieved by standard care in attempt to increase their&#xD;
      chances to independently perform activities of daily living.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the first weeks after the onset of stroke, the injured brain undergoes several neural&#xD;
      mechanisms, a process known as neuroplasticity, that intend to reorganize the neural&#xD;
      connectivity and repair the damaged tissue around the injury region. Several studies revealed&#xD;
      that rehabilitation during this acute period of injury would enhance the functional outcome&#xD;
      of the paretic arm presumably by modulating the heightened neuroplastic mechanism.&#xD;
      Specifically, it has been suggested that novel interventions that interact with the&#xD;
      neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery are particularly needed for stroke survivors whom initial&#xD;
      arm impairments are severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this study is to explore if an EMG controlled device can be added to the&#xD;
      acute rehabilitation for stroke subjects with severe arm deficit. The study will also&#xD;
      investigate if the application of such a device would lead to an even better enhancement of&#xD;
      clinical outcomes compared to standard care. Because of such neurophysiological changes&#xD;
      during the acute phase, the study aims to correlate the neurophysiological changes with the&#xD;
      enhancement gained as a result of practicing with an EMG controlled device in this&#xD;
      population. Thus, test the premise that adding practice with an EMG controlled device to the&#xD;
      acute rehabilitation of subjects with severe arm impairments acts as novel rehabilitative&#xD;
      tool that interact with the neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery to enhance clinical outcomes&#xD;
      for these subjects.&#xD;
