      The aim of this study is to evaluate the acceptance of pediatric patiens using Er: YAG laser&#xD;
      in comparison with the conventional techniques for caries removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out on 100 children between the ages of 9-12, who had class 1 occlusal&#xD;
      caries in one of their permanent first molars. The patients were divided into two groups;&#xD;
      conventional technical group and laser group. Rotary handpieces was used in conventional&#xD;
      technique group, Er:YAG laser was used in the laser group for caries removal. The heart rate&#xD;
      of each patient was measured during the caries removal procedure at 30 seconds intervals. The&#xD;
      pain during the procedure was determined by VAS. CFSS-DS scale was used to determine the&#xD;
      anxiety level of the patients before and after the procedure. FIS was used to determine how&#xD;
      patients are disturbed from the smell, taste, sound, vibration and sight of the devices after&#xD;
      the procedure. The video segments were collected from the patients during the caries removal&#xD;
      and the procedural pain were evaluated by the FLACC scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based our results, ın the laser group, the patients were found to experience less pain and&#xD;
      discomfort compared to conventional technique according to the VAS and FLACC scores. The rate&#xD;
      of patients with dental anxiety decreased significantly in the laser group compared with the&#xD;
      conventional group according to CFSS-DS performed after the procedure. According to the&#xD;
      sensory survey, the laser group had good acceptability compared to the conventional technique&#xD;
      group in terms of vibration and sight. The laser group showed a lower percentage increase in&#xD;
      heart rate comparsion between beginning and end of procedure. It was observed that the cavity&#xD;
      preparation time was longer in the laser group.&#xD;
