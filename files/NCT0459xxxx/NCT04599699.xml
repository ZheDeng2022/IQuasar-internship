  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of integrated boost to the dominant&#xD;
      intraprostatic nodule based on Ga-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET/MR in&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in localized prostate carcinoma in patients for&#xD;
      whom the standard treatment is the irradiation of the entire prostate gland with or without&#xD;
      seminal vesicles accompanied or not by hormonal therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is considered standard of care treatment for prostate cancer. In light of the&#xD;
      accumulating clinical evidence favoring the use of hypo fractionation, SBRT regimen might&#xD;
      constitute a much more convenient non-invasive and highly efficient outpatient therapy.&#xD;
      Although the proposed extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy approach was expected to provide&#xD;
      excellent local control of the primary prostate cancer, a proportion of patients with&#xD;
      intermediate- or high-risk disease may have recurrences with local recurrence or distant&#xD;
      metastasis in the future, requiring strategies to minimize systemic disease. Ga-68 PSMA&#xD;
      PET/MR has high accuracy in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. In this protocol,&#xD;
      pretreatment Ga-68 PSMA PET/MR and CT scanning were performed in all patients as well as the&#xD;
      imaging fusion before delineating the target. This study would explore the simultaneously&#xD;
      integrated boost or equential integrated boost to the dominant intraprostatic nodule based on&#xD;
      Ga-68 PSMA PET/MR in SBRT.&#xD;
