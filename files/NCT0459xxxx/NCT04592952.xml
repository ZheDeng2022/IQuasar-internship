      This is a single-center, non-randomized, single-arm, open-label study, in which adults with&#xD;
      episodic or chronic migraine will receive intravenous infusion with calcitonin gene-related&#xD;
      peptide and subsequently be treated with erenumab. The study will consist of the following&#xD;
      elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provocation Phase (1 experimental day with intravenous infusion of calcitonin&#xD;
           gene-related peptide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening/Baseline Phase (4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-Label Treatment Phase (24 weeks)&#xD;
