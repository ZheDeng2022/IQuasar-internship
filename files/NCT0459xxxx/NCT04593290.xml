    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the association between listening effort and cognitive&#xD;
      function for both cognitively healthy individuals and for patients with Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI) in mid-to-late stages of life, and furthermore to investigate listening&#xD;
      effort and cognitive function after several weeks of hearing aid use. Listening effort is&#xD;
      measured by the recording of peak pupil dilation during a sentence-final word identification&#xD;
      and recall (SWIR) test, cognitive performance is measured using a battery of pen and paper&#xD;
      cognitive tests, and hearing loss is measured with pure tone audiometry (PTA). A select&#xD;
      number of participants in both the cognitively healthy and MCI group will be administered&#xD;
      hearing aids, and the study will re-test both listening effort and cognitive performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory proof-of-concept study and an exploratory intervention study with&#xD;
      hearing aids in the context of listening effort. With a case (MCI) and control group&#xD;
      (cognitively healthy), investigators will examine the associations between listening effort&#xD;
      and cognitive function and assess the effect of hearing aid use on both listening effort and&#xD;
      cognitive function test scores for those without hearing impairment. There is not sufficient&#xD;
      literature to support a sample size calculation for this association study. Investigators&#xD;
      will recruit approximately 50 participants. Half of these participants (n=25) will be&#xD;
      individuals who have been diagnosed with MCI, according to the Winblad criteria (ICD10), with&#xD;
      a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score â‰¤ 26. The control group of participants (n=25)&#xD;
      will be cognitively healthy individuals. All participants will undergo both listening effort&#xD;
      testing, coupled with pupillometry and cognitive performance testing, based on a battery of&#xD;
      pen-and-paper neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As investigators aim to measure cognitive effort exerted when listening and understanding&#xD;
      speech in noise, is important that all study participants exhibit a normal sensitivity&#xD;
      threshold within the ear canal. This will be assessed using Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment scores for cognitive function will be recorded in a clinical setting, and will be&#xD;
      based on a battery of pen-and-paper neuropsychological cognitive tests. The Stroop Test,&#xD;
      Trail Making Test (part A &amp; B), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Verbal Fluency Tests&#xD;
      (category: animals and lexical), Rey Complex Figure Test and Logical Memory Test (Part A)&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective measure of listening effort, pupil dilation, will be recorded as a measure of&#xD;
      task performance accuracy and pupil dilation will be measured during a SWIR test, which is&#xD;
      used to measure speech identification and recall in varying background noise. Prior to the&#xD;
      SWIR test, participants undergo an adaptive Danish Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), comprising a&#xD;
      list of equally intelligible sentences to be repeated in varying decibel (dB) levels of&#xD;
      background noise to determine the individual's speech reception threshold (SRT) at 80%&#xD;
      correct responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the SWIR test, the participant is fitted with PupilLabs' eye-tracking system, an open&#xD;
      source system consisting of clip-in eye tracking hardware to be placed in a Virtual Reality&#xD;
      (VR) headset. To prevent floor and ceiling effects that are independent to baseline pupil&#xD;
      size, the illumination within the VR display is individually adapted to the individual's&#xD;
      midpoint prior to data collection between dim (~30 lux) and bright (~230 lux), with an&#xD;
      average illuminance of 110 lux. A software suite allows the capture and post-processing of&#xD;
      the data feed, including pupil diameter. For the purpose of this study, the PupilLabs&#xD;
      software is controlled via a MATLAB interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyone who participates in Part 1 (listening effort testing and cognitive testing) will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in Part 2 (hearing aids). It is not a requirement to participate in&#xD;
      the administration, 6-week use, and re-testing procedures involved in Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
      All cognitively healthy participants will be invited to participate, only MCI patients with a&#xD;
      live-in informant will be given this opportunity. After ear measurement and dome and wire&#xD;
      length selection, Oticon Opn S 1 miniRITE hearing aid fitting will occur wirelessly using&#xD;
      Genie software, followed by hearing aid use instructions. The fitting will use Open domes,&#xD;
      the second generation of the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) fitting protocol (NAL-NL2)&#xD;
      and will increase gain seven steps on top of Real Ear Unaided Gain (REUG) from 750 Hz to 6&#xD;
      kHz.&#xD;
