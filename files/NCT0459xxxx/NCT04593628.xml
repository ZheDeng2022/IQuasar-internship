  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to culturally adapt a personalized intervention for&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino caring for a loved one with significant memory problems. The intervention&#xD;
      will be designed to help Hispanics/Latinos caring for a loved one with significant memory&#xD;
      problems in their own unique context to: 1.) understand the importance of social connections&#xD;
      for their own health and well-being, 2.) learn to become aware of their own personal barriers&#xD;
      to social connections, and 3.) increase their knowledge of local resources for promoting&#xD;
      social connections.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scales (BPNSFS) will be used. The BPNSFS consists of 24 items assessing both satisfaction and frustration in the need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as posited by Self-Determination Theory. We will report changes in the three BPNSFS subscales measuring satisfaction in: autonomy, relatedness and competence. Items are scored on a 1-5 Likert scale with each subscale score ranging from 4-20. Higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Mean change in subscale scores (change = post intervention scores - baseline scores) will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities at Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities measure will be used. This scale assesses the perceived ability to perform one's usual social roles and activities. The scale is administered as a computerized adaptive test (CAT) based on a 35 item bank; items are scored on a 1-5 Likert scale. Items are worded negatively in terms of perceived limitations, but responses are reverse-coded. CAT raw scores are converted into T-scores (0-100), with higher scores representing fewer limitations (better abilities). Mean change in T-scores (change = post intervention scores - baseline scores) will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in General Self-Efficacy Score at Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS General Self-Efficacy measure will be used. This scale assesses confidence in one's ability to perform specific tasks or behaviors. The scale is administered as a computerized adaptive test (CAT) based on a 10 item bank; items are scored on a 1-5 Likert scale. CAT raw scores are converted into T-scores (0-100), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy. Mean change in T-scores (change = post intervention scores - baseline scores) will be reported.</description>

    <intervention_name>Connect for Caregivers</intervention_name>
    <description>The STAR Center developed Connect for Caregivers to help improve connectedness among older caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Connect for Caregivers includes three components: (1) psychoeducational materials on the importance of connectedness for health and well-being; (2) a card sort-based 'discussion prioritization tool' that systematizes and routinizes the process of identifying and prioritizing barriers to connectedness; (3) personalized resources to address the identified barriers/targets. We will tailor Connect for Caregivers for Hispanic/Latino and Spanish-speaking caregivers guided by the Selective and Directed Treatment Adaptation Framework. The intervention is given once during the study.</description>
