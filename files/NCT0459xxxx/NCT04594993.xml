    <measure>Measure survivorship of INFINITY™ with ADAPTIS™ Technology Total Ankle System at 10 years</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the 10-year survivorship of 200 patients implanted with the INFINITY™ with ADAPTIS™ Technology Total Ankle System is non-inferior to other, similar devices.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic Evaluation- Physician Reported Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Identify and assess the implant for component loosening and/or subsidence, any radiolucency and/or cyst formation through radiographic evaluation early and throughout the lifetime of the implant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS® Global Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the improvements in self-reported physical, mental, and social health measures from pre-op through 10 years post operatively; assessed by PROMIS® Global HealthThe PROMIS Global-10 is a 10-item patient-reported questionnaire in which the response options are presented as 5-point (as well as a single 11-point) rating scales. The results of the questions are used to calculate two summary scores: a Global Physical Health Score and a Global Mental Health score. These scores are then standardized to the general population, using the &quot;T-Score&quot;. The average &quot;TScore&quot; for the United States population is 50 points, with a standard deviation of 10 points. Higher scores indicate a healthier patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankle Osteoarthritis Score (AOS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare pain and functional improvement in the Ankle Osteoarthritis Score (AOS). AOS is a reliable, validated, visual analog-based,AOS is a reliable, validated, visual analog-based, disease-specific self-administered instrument designed specifically to measure disability and pain from ankle osteoarthritis. Both Pain and Disability components are used to calculate the total score. The score is from zero to one hundred with a lower score indicating more normal function. A minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the Total AOS score reduction from baseline has been established: 12.35 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot &amp; Ankle Observational Score (FAOS) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the improvement in patient/physician reported function scores from pre-op through 10 years post-operatively, assessed by the Foot &amp; Ankle Observational Score (FAOS) questionnaire. The FAOS is a self-report measure that evaluates symptoms and functional limitations in individuals with generalized foot and ankle disorders. Items for the FAOS were adapted from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. The FAOS is composed of the following 5 subscales: pain (9 items), other symptoms (7 items), activities of daily living (7 items), sports and recreational activities (5 items), and foot and ankle-related quality of life (4 items). Each subscale has a potential range from 0 to 100. Where 100 indicates no problems and 0 indicates extreme problems.</description>
