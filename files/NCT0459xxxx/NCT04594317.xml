    <textblock>
      a randomized clinical study to compare the effect of using low level laser therapy versus&#xD;
      calcium hydroxide intra-canal medication on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and intensity of postoperative pain in patients with symptomatic apical&#xD;
           periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intensity of postoperative percussion pain in patients with symptomatic apical&#xD;
           periodontitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total amount of substance P and Interleukin 8 in periapical fluids one week post&#xD;

      Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data including name, address and phone number in addition to medical history&#xD;
      (Appendix II) and dental history (Appendix III) will be collected by the operator from each&#xD;
      patient in specific forms, then history of chief complaint will be recorded. The selected&#xD;
      patients should show symptoms of irreversible pulpitis. The operator will perform extra-oral&#xD;
      and intra-oral clinical examination as the expected tooth to be included in this study should&#xD;
      be examined tentatively using a diagnostic mirror and probe. Radiograph will be taken using&#xD;
      bisecting angle technique with a periapical digital sensor plate1. The radiograph will help&#xD;
      to identify if there is widening of periodontal ligament space, periapical radiolucency, deep&#xD;
      caries near the pulp chamber or recurrent caries under restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis is confirmed through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient history of pain with biting and confirmed with positive percussion test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completing the diagnosis (symptomatic apical periodontitis) and confirming that&#xD;
           the patient fulfills the eligibility criteria, the patient will be enrolled in the&#xD;
           study. The treatment will be done in two visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After diagnosing the case as symptomatic apical periodontitis and confirming that the patient&#xD;
      conforms to all eligibility criteria, patients will be enrolled in in the study. Preoperative&#xD;
      percussion pain level will be recorded using modified VAS. Treatment of all cases will be&#xD;
      completed in two visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anesthetizing the tooth using infiltration technique by local anesthesia of 1.8 ml of 4%&#xD;
           Articiane with 1:100,000 epinephrine (Artinibsa®; Inibsa Dental, Lliçà de Vall,Spain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Caries and/or coronal restorations will be removed completely with sterile bur and&#xD;
           rubber dam will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operative field, including the tooth, the clamp, and rubber dam sheet will be cleaned&#xD;
           with 30% hydrogen peroxide until no further bubbling of the peroxide occurred. All&#xD;
           surfaces will then be disinfected by a sterile cotton swab with a 5.25% sodium&#xD;
           hypochlorite solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Access cavity will be prepared using another sterile round carbide bur size 3 and Endo-z&#xD;
           bur(Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After completing the access, the operative field and the pulp chamber will be cleaned&#xD;
           and disinfected once again in the same way mentioned above. NaOCl will be then&#xD;
           neutralized with 5% sodium thiosulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patency of the root canal will be confirmed using stainless steel handK-files size&#xD;
&#xD;
           #10 and #15(K-Files, MANI, INC., Industrial Park, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan).Working&#xD;
           length will be determined using an electronic apex locator(Root ZX, J. Morita USA,&#xD;
           Irvine, CA)then confirmed radiographically to be 1 mm shorter than radiographic apex.&#xD;
           Then the canal will be enlarged to size #20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Mechanical preparation will be done using M PRO rotary files in an endodontic&#xD;
           motor(X-Smart, Dentsply Maillefer, USA). The first file (18/.09) will be used as an&#xD;
           orifice opener for two thirds of the working length followed by (20/.04) and (25/.06)&#xD;
           for the full working length and finally (35/.06). In-and-out motions will be applied&#xD;
           with stroke lengths not exceeding 3 mm in the cervical, middle, and apical thirds until&#xD;
           attaining the established WL. The first file is used with a continuous rotary motion at&#xD;
           a speed of 500rpm and torque of 3Ncm. The second, third and fourth files are used with a&#xD;
           speed of 300 rpm and torque of 1.5Ncm. The canal will be irrigated and recapitulated&#xD;
           after the use of each instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The canal will be thoroughly irrigated with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite root canal irrigant&#xD;
           (5ml for 1 min) using disposable plastic syringe with side vented needle gauge 30 (Steri&#xD;
           irrigation tips; Diadent, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea) reaching 1 mm short of the working&#xD;
           length. All teeth will receive the same volume of irrigant (5 ml prior to&#xD;
           instrumentation, 5 ml between each file and 5 ml as final flush after root canal&#xD;
           instrumentation to reach a total volume of 25 ml in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The canal will then be dried by using sterile paper points(Meta Biomed Co., Ltd, Korea)&#xD;
           and then flushed with 5 ml of saline to inactivate the NaOCl. The postinstrumentation&#xD;
           periapical sample (PS-1) will be collected after cleaning and shaping by introducing a&#xD;
           fine sterile size 20 paper point 2 mm beyond the canal terminus for 1 min.This procedure&#xD;
           will be performed twice. The paper points will be placed in a sterile&#xD;
           micro-centrifugation tube (Merck) containing 2 mL of sterile physiological saline&#xD;
           solution, and immediately transferred to a -80 °C freezer until further processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The patients will then be assigned into two groups (n = 23), as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LLLT Group: 970 ± 15-nm diode laser (Biolase Epic X, Biolase, Irvine, California,&#xD;
                USA)will be activated at 0.5 W and 10 Hz at a distance of approximately 10 mm to&#xD;
                the tissue around the apex of the root. A circular movement will be performed&#xD;
                during the application. Pulse duration will be 0.5 s, and pulse pause will be 50%.&#xD;
                Total application time will be30 s for the tooth. For this application, a 200-μm&#xD;
                optical tip will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calcium hydroxide Group: calcium hydroxide paste (Metapaste, Meta Biomed Co., Ltd,&#xD;
                Korea) will be inserted in the canal using disposable plastic tip and placed at a&#xD;
                distance 1 or 2 mm less than the working length.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The access cavity will be closed using sterile cotton pellet and temporary filling and&#xD;
           patients will be recalled after 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The patients will record the incidence of pain and the pain level on modified VAS scale&#xD;
           at 6,12, 24 and48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. In the recall appointment after 1 week. Rubber dam will be applied and tooth will be&#xD;
           disinfected as before. The previously sampled canal will be re-entered, flushed with&#xD;
           copious saline irrigation and a second periapical sample (PS-2) will be taken. After the&#xD;
           sampling, final flush with 2.5% NaOCL and 17% EDTA will be done in both groups. Master&#xD;
           cones of (0.40) taper gutta-percha(Meta Biomed Co., Ltd, Korea) will be fitted to the&#xD;
           working length and a radiograph will be taken to ensure proper length. Obturation will&#xD;
           be done by modified single cone technique using epoxy resin sealer(Adseal, Meta Biomed&#xD;
           CO.,LTD, Korea)and 4% taper gutta percha cones together with auxillary cones.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. The access cavity will be restored with composite resin and occlusal contact will be&#xD;
           checked. The details of the endodontic procedure for each patient will be recorded in&#xD;
           the patient's procedure chart&#xD;
