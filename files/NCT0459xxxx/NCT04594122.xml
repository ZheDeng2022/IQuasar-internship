      Safe Food Fair Food for Cambodia (SFFF) is a Feed the Future Innovation Lab project funded by&#xD;
      USAID. This 3-year project aims to improve food safety of animal source food (ASF) in&#xD;
      Cambodia. SFFF was awarded to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), National&#xD;
      Animal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI) and Livestock Development for&#xD;
      Community Livelihood Organization (LDC) and in collaboration with Cambodian Ministry of&#xD;
      Health CDC and NIPH. Based on the findings and consultations with food safety stakeholders in&#xD;
      Cambodia, we have developed a set of interventions to improve hygienic practice and pork&#xD;
      safety at the traditional markets in Cambodia. Those interventions will be introduced and&#xD;
      tested at retail in six selected provinces using Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT). To&#xD;
      ensure compliance of targeted actors (e.g. retailers), participatory methods (e.g. FGD) were&#xD;
      used to validate intervention packages. There are two steps of intervention which contain of&#xD;
      part 1) Retailer formative research for SFFF Cambodia and 2) Interventions for Good Hygiene&#xD;
      Practices for Safer Pork at Traditional Markets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1. Retailer formative research for SFFF Cambodia: We will implement an intervention&#xD;
      package to this trial group and collect biological sampling to determine the hygienic status&#xD;
      before and after the intervention. The intervention packages will be developed for SFFF&#xD;
      Cambodia in consultation with partners and based on findings of SFFF Cambodia project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2. Intervention for Good Hygiene Practices for Safer Pork at Traditional Markets: A&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) intervention will be conducted in 12 markets in 6&#xD;
      provinces. Those provinces were selected based on the prevalence of Salmonella in a market&#xD;
      survey study, namely Kampot, Kampong Cham, Kampong Speu, Takeo, Siem Reap, and Phnom Penh.&#xD;
      Another 12 markets, in the same provinces, will be used as a control group. In total 24&#xD;
      traditional wet markets will be included in the sampling, by selecting the 4 largest&#xD;
      traditional markets in the six provinces with at least 15 pork shops. At each market, 15 pork&#xD;
      shops were selected for sampling. The intervention package includes 5 keys actions (Handbook)&#xD;
      and provision of equipment incentive (e.g. inox tray, easy-clean surface material), and&#xD;
      training on good hygiene practices.&#xD;

      1. Selection of provinces, markets and retailers&#xD;
&#xD;
           Six provinces were selected including Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Takeo, Kampong Cham,&#xD;
           Kampot, Kampong Speu with the following selection criteria: i) The number of markets in&#xD;
           provinces, ii) Salmonella prevalence (above 50%), iii) Population density and risk,&#xD;
           urban - rural, iv) Distance from laboratory, v) Compliance of market board and traders,&#xD;
           local animal health workers. Phnom Penh had a reported Salmonella prevalence of less&#xD;
           than 50% in the recent market study but was included as an urban center with expected&#xD;
           high output of pork sells. In each province, four markets which have at least 15 pork&#xD;
           shops will be selected. Among those markets, two markets will be assigned for control&#xD;
           and trial groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group of retailers will be chosen from selected markets for the intervention based on&#xD;
           their &quot;similarity&quot; (e.g., environment, shop facilities, sells volume) and their&#xD;
           compliance to participate. Intervention package includes providing incentive equipment&#xD;
           and training on good hygiene practice. Equipment provision comprise: (i) equip the shops&#xD;
           with inox trays and advise them to separate raw pork/processed pork and intestines; (ii)&#xD;
           In case the surface of the shop is not made from granite or inox, we will provide them&#xD;
           with feasible surface cover material; (iii) Apron to retailers with the project&#xD;
           logo/brand; (iv)Shop's banner with our logo; (v) Hand washing soap (antibacterial) and&#xD;
           dish detergent; (vi) Disinfectant spray (Anolyte).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Guide retailers to rearrange their shops to suit their own facility and space. Introduce&#xD;
           plastic cutting boards for light cut, check currently used wooden cutting boards at shop&#xD;
           to advice to use properly. Introduce frequent washing and disinfection of sale place and&#xD;
           shop equipment. Washing with dish detergent and disinfection using spray disinfectant&#xD;
           (Electrochemically activated water, pH=7). This shall include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cutting boards. Washing with dish detergent (soap) and water with scrub, then&#xD;
                disinfection using spraying bleach. Leave for five minutes then rinse with water&#xD;
                (can also be a spray) and let it air dry. At least prior to open or after closing&#xD;
                the shop and once in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knives. At least prior to open or after closing the shop and once in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cloth. Guide how to use cloth. Each shop should have 2-3 cloth to wipe separate&#xD;
                surfaces/tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Table surface. Require retailers to wash and disinfect throughout at the end of&#xD;
                selling day; and apply disinfectant spray at the beginning of the selling day. Only&#xD;
                retailers with an easy to clean surface (inox, granite or plastic etc.) shall be&#xD;
                selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Training. Introduce frequent washing of hands, at least once within each selling&#xD;
                hour, with clean water and liquid soap, and dry by tissue paper. Proper disposal of&#xD;
                tissue paper in closed top bin&#xD;
&#xD;
           For control group: No intervention or training activities for this group but collection&#xD;
           of biological samples and observation checklist to determine hygienic status at their&#xD;
           shops over three consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention description&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Procedure to introduce the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Introduce and discuss trial with market authorities and vets (as appropriate)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Identify potential retailers, discuss and make plan with them&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pre- evaluate current knowledge and practice of selected retailers.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Procure suitable (shop size) equipment for &quot;trial&quot; retailers&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Provide training, instructions and guidelines for selected retailers and&#xD;
                     introduce equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Monitoring of hygienic practice, sampling and checking practice of retailer&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Timelines: &quot;Training and equipment&quot; in the 1st week, follow up, and supervise&#xD;
                     in week 2-4, sampling will be conducted in the fourth week.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Summary report, sharing and discussion with trial retailers to re-evaluate&#xD;
                     their knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Procedure for sampling and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  At each market, 15 of pork vendors will be selected for sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  From each vendor, one specimen will be purchased approximately 300 to 400&#xD;
                     grams each.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All pork samples (n=360) from trial and control groups will be tested for&#xD;
                     total bacteria count (TBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  In addition, a sub-set of 60 cut pork samples of trial group will be also&#xD;
                     analyzed for Salmonella Yes/No (qualitative), 30 out of 60 of these samples&#xD;
                     will be quantified for Salmonella concentration using MPN method.&#xD;
