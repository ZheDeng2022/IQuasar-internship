  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is common in patients with co-morbid mental illness and sleeping difficulties is a&#xD;
      frequent complaint in most psychological disorders. Mental illness may cause sleep problems,&#xD;
      however, sleep problems like insomnia, may also cause or exacerbate mental illness. Insomnia&#xD;
      may aggravate symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue, and reduce daily functioning in&#xD;
      patients with co-morbid insomnia and mental illness. This project aims to evaluate a course&#xD;
      offered to patients with insomnia and mental illness at Diakonhjemmet Hospital. The course is&#xD;
      based on cognitive behavioral therapy, a documented treatment for insomnia.&#xD;
