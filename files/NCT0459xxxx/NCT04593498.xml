  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to determine if individuals with excessive supraventricular&#xD;
      ectopic activity (ESVEA) on Holter recording should be subjected to prolonged screening with&#xD;
      Event loop recorder in order to detect previously undiagnosed Atrial fibrillation / flutter.&#xD;
      Other biomarkers such as plasma biomarkers and high-end echocardiography will be studied and&#xD;
      compared in ESVEA and control group as well as progression of atrial cardiomyopathy in ESVEA&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive supraventricular ectopic activities (ESVEA) are a common finding on long-term ECG&#xD;
      recordings and have a connection to atrial cardiomyopathy, incident AF, stroke and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter recording from 2018 preformed at Danderyd hospital will be screened in order to&#xD;
      identify 125 recordings with ESVEA, defined as at least 30 atrial ectopic beats/hour or a&#xD;
      supraventricular run of at least 20 consecutive beats. Participants fulfilling eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be offered prolonged AF screening with continuous event recording (ELR). A&#xD;
      matched control group (125 participants) without ESVEA will also be screened using same&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular data from medical records will also be collected in order to attain&#xD;
      information regarding co-morbidities and being able to assess CHA2DS2-VASC score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of blood will be collected at index time, after 21± 3 months for further analysis&#xD;
      with the aim of identifying biomarkers for atrial fibrillation. During this two time periods&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography will also be preformed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will after 21± 3 months be subjected to renewed screening with ELR in&#xD;
      order to examine the persistence of excessive supraventricular activity they will also&#xD;
      preform a 24 hours ambulatory ECG (Holter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four years after the completion of screening visits, data from patient records and&#xD;
      information thorough telephone interview and/or data from Swedish Patient Register, Swedish&#xD;
      Dispensed Drug Register will be collected&#xD;
