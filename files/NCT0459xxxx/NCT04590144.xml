  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and key electrical performance of&#xD;
      the INVICTA leads equipped with DF4 connector: ACTIVE fixation type models (single and dual&#xD;
      coil: INVICTA 1CR, INVICTA 2CR)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APOLLO study is a pre-market approval (INVICTA leads - devices under investigation - are not&#xD;
      CE marked), interventional, prospective, longitudinal, international (European), multicenter,&#xD;
      single arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices under investigation, the INVICTA defibrillation leads, are new quadripolar leads,&#xD;
      to be used with Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy&#xD;
      Defibrillators (ICD/CRT-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study intends to demonstrate safety and electrical performances of the INVICTA&#xD;
      leads among the different models: active fixation either single coil (model 1CR) or dual coil&#xD;
      (model 2CR)leads models. The clinical data will be used to support the application to CE&#xD;
      marking of INVICTA leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will be evaluated at 3 months post-implantation; secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be evaluated up to 2 years post-implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 445 patients will be enrolled in the study, in up to 60 centers in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up visits are scheduled at hospital discharge, at 1 month, at 3 months, at 6&#xD;
      months, at 12 months, at 18 months and at 24 months, post-implant&#xD;
