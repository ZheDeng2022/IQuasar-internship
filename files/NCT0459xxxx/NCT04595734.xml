  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have recently become available as a new therapy for a variety of&#xD;
      cancers. This drugs function by boosting the anti-cancer immune response, but unfortunately,&#xD;
      may cause off-target, non-specific immune activation, resulting in liver and gut toxicity. In&#xD;
      order to understand the development of liver immune-related adverse events we aim to collect&#xD;
      full clinicopathological data from patients with advanced lung cancer treated with&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors at Blacktown, Westmead and Nepean Hospitals. Patients treated&#xD;
      with standard chemotherapy will be used as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to establish clinical risk factors that can predict the occurrence of liver&#xD;
      immune-related adverse events in patients with advanced lung cancer treated with&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Such predictors may assist in the stratification of patients&#xD;
      based on their risk for development liver toxicity as a result of immunotherapy, allowing&#xD;
      early cessation/modification of treatment prior to the development of severe adverse&#xD;
      reactions. In addition, this retrospective study will aim to determine the significance of&#xD;
      pre-existing liver damage on the development of liver adverse events as well as establish a&#xD;
      timeline defining the development of adverse events in the liver.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This year alone&#xD;
      12,817 new lung cancer cases were registered in Australia, the mortality rate of which being&#xD;
      46% within 5 years. Chemotherapy is still considered the first-line treatment, however recent&#xD;
      clinical trials have established that with treatment monoclonal antibodies known as&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors shows higher efficacy in terms of overall survival and&#xD;
      progression-free survival. Despite higher efficacy, immune-checkpoint inhibitors can cause a&#xD;
      number of immune-related adverse events which may force patients to cease treatment. Among&#xD;
      these side effects, liver toxicity occurs rapidly and is asymptomatic in the early stages.&#xD;
      These facts underscore the necessity of stratifying patients based on their risk of&#xD;
      developing liver toxicity. We aim to predict liver toxicity early on in therapy using data&#xD;
      collected from routine clinical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIMS / OBJECTIVES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study aims to answer following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does pre-existing liver fibrosis/cirrhosis influence the development of liver&#xD;
           immune-related adverse events?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the first time-point and subsequent timeline of liver immune-related adverse&#xD;
           events occurrence and progression?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What clinical markers predict immunotherapy related toxicity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is non-interventional retrospective study that plans to collect data from patients with&#xD;
      stage IV lung cancer treated at Blacktown, Westmead and Nepean Hospitals. The main goal of&#xD;
      this study is to establish statistically significant clinical predictors of liver toxicity in&#xD;
      patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Full clinicopathological data will be&#xD;
      collected from hospital medical electronic databases. We will prioritise the examination of&#xD;
      liver function blood tests in order to establish the first timepoint of liver function&#xD;
      abnormalities and correlate them to pre-treatment blood results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study will be conducted in 3 steps&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection of full clinicopathological data of patients with advanced lung cancer&#xD;
           treated at Blacktown, Westmead and Nepean Hospitals .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood tests results will be collected according to the following scheme: (1) The day&#xD;
           prior to treatment commencement (baseline); (2) every 28th day for patients treated with&#xD;
           tyrosine kinase inhibitors; (3) the last day of each therapeutic cycle for patients&#xD;
           treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors or platinum-doublet chemotherapy or&#xD;
           combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical analysis using SPSS v23 and STATA v16 software.&#xD;
