  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will advance science by providing evidence on the feasibility of a&#xD;
      standardized, rigorously designed and delivered exercise program to improve cognition and&#xD;
      plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels for individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      We will also explore how certain genetic variant may influence exercise-induced cognitive&#xD;
      improvements and plasma BDNF levels. Findings of the proposed study will establish a&#xD;
      comprehensive knowledge base for future research and development of a personalized exercise&#xD;
      program for high-risk individuals who are vulnerable to cognitive dysfunction based on their&#xD;
      genomic profiles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will pilot-test a 3-month supervised exercise program to improve plasma&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and domains of cognition that are mostly&#xD;
      affected in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including memory, processing speed, and&#xD;
      executive function, overall and according to genotypes of the BDNF Val66Met variant. T2DM&#xD;
      impairs the brain, leading to cognitive dysfunction, which carries substantial lifetime&#xD;
      consequences. This highlights an urgent need to find effective therapeutic strategies to&#xD;
      improve cognitive function among those with T2DM. Aerobic exercise enhances cognitive&#xD;
      function among healthy subjects through increased release of BDNF. BDNF supports survival of&#xD;
      existing neurons and promotes growth of new neurons and synapses. Emerging evidence suggests&#xD;
      that reduced BDNF levels may exacerbate cognitive dysfunction associated with T2DM. Compared&#xD;
      to drug delivery of BDNF, aerobic exercise is a low- cost, safe, and easily accessible path&#xD;
      to increasing endogenous BDNF levels. In persons with T2DM, integrity of the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB) is impaired. Although a growing body of evidence supports the protective role&#xD;
      of regular exercise in BBB integrity, very little is known about how resting peripheral BDNF&#xD;
      levels may change in response to regular aerobic exercise training after adjusting for BBB&#xD;
      permeability among individuals with T2DM. One critical genetic variant that affects cognition&#xD;
      in human is the BDNF Val66Met variant. The Met allele interferes with the activity-dependent&#xD;
      secretion of mature BDNF among Met carriers. Despite the strong evidence suggesting aerobic&#xD;
      exercise has a beneficial effect on cognitive function, significant variability in individual&#xD;
      response to exercise training in cognitive outcomes has been reported among Val/Val vs. Met&#xD;
      carriers. However, the evidence on how the BDNF Val66Met variant influences cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes following an aerobic exercise intervention among individuals with T2DM is currently&#xD;
      lacking. A total of 84 participants with T2DM will be randomized 2:1 to receive aerobic&#xD;
      exercise intervention (n=56) or attention control (n=28) for 3 months. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of the intervention. The study will also evaluate preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the supervised exercise program on cognitive function and plasma BDNF levels&#xD;
      after controlling BBB permeability. An exploratory aim is to explore the influence of the&#xD;
      BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on cognitive outcomes and plasma BDNF levels in response to&#xD;
      aerobic exercise intervention. The purpose of this study is well aligned with the National&#xD;
      Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) mission to develop personalized interventions that&#xD;
      address mechanisms underlying symptoms of illness through symptom science research. Based on&#xD;
      the findings of this proposed study, our long-term goal is to develop a personalized exercise&#xD;
      program for high-risk individuals susceptible to cognitive dysfunction based on their genomic&#xD;
      profiles.&#xD;

    <description>Each participant will be provided with an individualized target heart rate zone based on his/her age. Heart rate during exercise will be measured using a finger pulse oximeter. Following baseline measures, participants will receive instructions on how to use a finger pulse oximeter by a student. For participants who are not physically fit or are just engaging in regular exercise, they will be advised to start walking on a treadmill at a comfortable pace for 5 to 10 minutes at one time.46 Exercise duration and intensity will be progressed from week 3 to week 5, until participants will walk at 40-59% of heart rate reserve based on their age, which will be maintained throughout the study.</description>

    <description>Following baseline measures, a student will demonstrate the use of a pulse oximeter and stretching movements to these participants. Starting on week 3, participants will do the prescribed stretching exercise 3 times a week, maintaining heart rate below 40% of heart rate reserve during exercise. Stretching will target all major muscle-tendon groups including shoulder, chest, neck, truck, lower back, hips, and legs. It will also involve a slow and constant motion that accounts for any physical limitations and physician-specified precautions</description>
