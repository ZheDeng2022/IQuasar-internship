    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate the difference in effectiveness of nasal suction between&#xD;
      two different suction devices (NoseFrida and bulb syringe) in infants that have&#xD;
      bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis (a virus infection that goes into the lungs, which subsequently&#xD;
      causes difficulty breathing, difficulty sleeping, and difficulty eating and drinking in&#xD;
      children) is a common infection in young children. The caregiver-participants will supplied&#xD;
      with two suction devices (NoseFrida and bulb syringe suction). The devices should be used to&#xD;
      clear nasal secretions as needed following discharge from the Emergency Center. The&#xD;
      participants will be asked to use either a NoseFrida device or a bulb syringe first, and then&#xD;
      to alternate thereafter. Caregivers will monitor how well their baby is breathing,&#xD;
      eating/drinking, sleeping and how many times the baby has been seen by a medical provider in&#xD;
      the 5 days post discharge from the Emergency Center. Post discharge, caregivers will complete&#xD;
      a REDCAP survey asking questions about how their baby has been doing over the first 5 days&#xD;
      following hospital discharge. This completes study involvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is common infection in the small airways of the lungs in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. It typically affects children under the age of two years during the fall and&#xD;
      winter months.Infants with this condition often have a significant amount of nasal drainage&#xD;
      and congestion. Infants are known to be obligate nasal breathers. When the nasal secretions&#xD;
      block the nasal airway, then breathing, sleeping, and eating/drinking all become very&#xD;
      difficult. For this reason it is very important to have a good method of suctioning out the&#xD;
      nose and clearing out the secretions. Historically a baby's nose was suctioned with a bulb&#xD;
      syringe. These are still commonly used and are given out in the hospital setting, although&#xD;
      there are many other types of devices that have been developed recently that are used for&#xD;
      suctioning. One of these devices that has become very common among parents now is called the&#xD;
      NoseFrida. It is important to evaluate this device and its efficacy compared to the bulb&#xD;
      syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will evaluate the difference in effectiveness of nasal suction between&#xD;
      two different suction devices (NoseFrida and bulb syringe) in infants that have&#xD;
      bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis (a virus infection that goes into the lungs, which subsequently&#xD;
      causes difficulty breathing, difficulty sleeping, and difficulty eating and drinking in&#xD;
      children) is a common infection in young children. Patients will be considered for enrollment&#xD;
      in the study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The patient's caregiver will be supplied&#xD;
      with an information sheet, and any questions will be addressed. Those who verbally consent&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. After parents or guardians (caregivers) provide informed&#xD;
      consent for their child, researchers will review the child's medical record for information&#xD;
      regarding their history of respiratory distress. The caregiver will then be supplied with&#xD;
      both suction devices to be used once they are discharged home: The participants will be asked&#xD;
      to use either a NoseFrida device or a bulb syringe first, and then to alternate thereafter.&#xD;
      The device supplied which is instructed to be used first will be dependent on the week of&#xD;
      enrollment in the study (we will rotate supplying NoseFrida to all patients asking&#xD;
      participants to use NoseFrida first one week, and bulb syringe to all patients first the next&#xD;
      week in order to attain similar size cohorts). Education will be given on how to use their&#xD;
      respective the suction device devices. Along with the device, a form (Home monitoring form)&#xD;
      will be supplied that will outline what should be monitored while using the device,&#xD;
      including: number of days after discharge until respiratory symptoms resolve, number of days&#xD;
      until the infant is eating/drinking well, and the number of days until the infant is sleeping&#xD;
      well. A REDCAP survey will be emailed to participants after 5 days post discharge.&#xD;
