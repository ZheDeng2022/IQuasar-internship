      This study will test the effectiveness of lisdexamfetamine medication as a treatment for&#xD;
      loss-of-control eating and weight following bariatric surgery. This is a controlled test of&#xD;
      whether, amongst non-responders to acute treatments, lisdexamfetamine medication results in&#xD;
      superior outcomes compared with placebo.&#xD;
