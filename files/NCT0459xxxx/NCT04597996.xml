    <textblock>
      Mental health literacy is a concept that aims to improve the skills of individuals to&#xD;
      overcome difficulties in providing the appropriate help they need in this area. It provides&#xD;
      individuals with motivation in this area such as informing and taking responsibility in the&#xD;
      field of mental health, directing their behavior, facilitating access to and obtaining&#xD;
      information, understanding, evaluating, using, and maintaining information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This project aims to examine the effect of the mental health literacy Web-based&#xD;
      education intervention of the school nurse on the knowledge level, help-seeking, and&#xD;
      stigmatization of students and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Randomized Controlled Experimental Research design (pre-test post-test control group&#xD;
      design) will be used in the project. Dependent Variables of the Project Mental Health&#xD;
      Literacy Education (Student and Parent) Independent Variables Adolescent / Adult Mental&#xD;
      Health Literacy knowledge level, Attitudes towards Seeking Psychological Help, Self Stigma in&#xD;
      Seeking Psychological Help score averages The project will be carried out with the students&#xD;
      and their parents of a secondary school and a high school in the district of Balçova, İzmir&#xD;
      province. Sampling calculation Based on the analysis of variance in repeated measurements in&#xD;
      2 groups in the G Power program, Type1 Error 0.05 (alpha 5%) Type2 Error 0.20 (80% power),&#xD;
      the sample size calculated in duplicate measurements with medium effect size is 43 persons&#xD;
      for each group (Experiment-Control) calculated. Considering that there might be losses during&#xD;
      data collection, it is planned to include 50 students and 50 parents for the experiment group&#xD;
      and 50 students and 50 parents for the control group. The data will be collected using the&#xD;
      Mental Health Literacy Scale (Adult), the Mental Health Literacy Scale for Children and&#xD;
      Adolescents, the Attitude Scale for Seeking Psychological Help-K (PHSAS), the Self-Stigma in&#xD;
      Seeking Psychological Help Scale, and the sociodemographic Question Form. Analysis of&#xD;
      variance will be used in the evaluation of data, number, percentage, and descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, and in repeated measures to evaluate the effect of the intervention The training&#xD;
      modules to be prepared within the scope of the project will focus on the mental health&#xD;
      literacy level of the child and the adult, attitudes to seek help, and stigmatization. Among&#xD;
      the teaching materials planned to be prepared for this purpose, there will be short animated&#xD;
      course videos, video course contents, and audio presentations. In the study, where web-based&#xD;
      education is planned, teaching materials will be delivered to students and parents through&#xD;
      the learning management system. Teaching materials and learning management systems will be&#xD;
      designed in accordance with mobile technologies and access will be provided from smartphones,&#xD;
      tablet computers, and similar mobile devices. During the teaching material development phase,&#xD;
      firstly, educational content drafts (storyboards) will be created and presented to field&#xD;
      experts, and their opinions on content, teaching approach, methods and techniques, and visual&#xD;
      design principles will be taken. Pilot studies will be conducted to understand the&#xD;
      educational content during the improvement phase of the developed teaching material designs.&#xD;
      It is planned to finalize the training content in the light of user feedback.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators aim to examine the effect of mental health literacy&#xD;
      Web-based education initiative on the knowledge level, help-seeking, and stigmatization of&#xD;
      students and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled experimental study. The research population consists of&#xD;
      students and their parents will be studying in two schools located in Izmir province in&#xD;
      western Turkey. Fifty people were assigned to the experimental and control groups formed&#xD;
      separately from parents and students for the sampling, and a total of 200 people were planned&#xD;
      to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted between February 2021 and February 2022. Students between the&#xD;
      ages of 12-18 who voluntarily agree to participate in the study and their parents will be&#xD;
      included in this study. Another criterion is that all sampled groups can access and use the&#xD;
      internet Those who have a visual, perceptual, or auditory problem and cannot access or use&#xD;
      the internet will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychometric evaluation of scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Health Literacy Scale for Children and Adolescents (MHLS): This scale, developed by&#xD;
      Rozbruch and Friedberg (2018), consists of 5 items. The Cronbach alpha coefficient calculated&#xD;
      for the internal consistency of the scale is .84. The scale is a three-point Likert-type&#xD;
      scale consisting of two items multiple choice, one item open-ended, two items 8&#xD;
      sub-dimensions (Parents, Friends, Clergyman, Psychologist, Counselor, Psychiatrist, Family&#xD;
      Doctor, Teacher) (not suitable - not sure - suitable) has the option to answer. The lowest&#xD;
      value that can be taken from the scale varies between 0 and the highest value: 6. (question&#xD;
      1: 1 point, question 3: 2 points, question 4: 2 points, question 5: 1 point) Turkish&#xD;
      adaptation of the scale was made by the researchers Parental Mental Health Literacy Scale&#xD;
      (MHLS): It was developed by O'Connor, Casey (2015) et al for the 18-60 age band. Cronbach's&#xD;
      alpha coefficient calculated for the internal consistency of the scale is .87. The scoring of&#xD;
      the MHLS is created as a result of the summation of all items, and there are also items&#xD;
      scored backward. As the scale score increases, the MHL level increases. For the scale with 35&#xD;
      questions in total, 5 and 4 Likert-type gradings were used. For 4-point Likert-grade answers:&#xD;
      absolutely unlikely (1 point), unlikely (2 points), probable (3 points), absolutely probable&#xD;
      (4 points); For 5-point Likert-grade answers: strongly disagree / strongly reluctant (1&#xD;
      point), disagree / unwilling (2 points), indecisive (3 points), agree / willing (4 points),&#xD;
      strongly agree / strongly willing (5 points). Items of the scale to be scored in reverse are&#xD;
      10, 12, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28th items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum score that can be obtained from the scale is 160, the minimum score is 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attitude Scale for Seeking Psychological Help-Short Form (ASPH-S): This tool, which aims to&#xD;
      measure attitudes towards getting psychological help (ASPH-S), is a revised and abbreviated&#xD;
      version of ASPH, developed by Türküm (1997). As a result of the factor analysis performed for&#xD;
      the construct validity of the ASPH-S scale, it was determined that it consists of a&#xD;
      two-factor structure that includes positive (12 items) and negative (6 items) seeking&#xD;
      psychological help, explaining 52.6% of the total variance. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient&#xD;
      calculated for internal consistency of the scale consisting of 18 items is .90. Test-retest&#xD;
      reliability for stability over time. It was found to be 77. The score that can be obtained&#xD;
      from the scale is between 18 and 90, and the low score indicates that there is no need for&#xD;
      help. The scale, which consists of 5 Likert-type categories, is scored as Fully Agree,&#xD;
      Strongly Agree, Undecided, Somewhat Agree, and Never Disagree. (Fully Agree = 5, Strongly&#xD;
      Agree = 4, Undecided = 3 Somewhat Agree = 2, Not at all = 1) 6 items of the scale are&#xD;
      calculated by scoring in reverse. These items are: 2, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Stigma in Seeking Psychological Help Scale (SSSPHS): The scale developed by Vogel et al.&#xD;
      (2006) consists of ten items. The scale is a 5-point Likert type one-dimensional scale. The&#xD;
      scale was adapted to Turkish by Kapıkıranlar (2013). Cronbach alpha value is calculated for&#xD;
      the internal consistency of the scale. Is 71. Confirmatory factor analysis of the&#xD;
      one-dimensional scale was performed. The internal consistency of university students (17-33)&#xD;
      was calculated as .91, and the test-retest reliability with an interval of two months was&#xD;
      calculated as .72. Some items of the scale are scored reversely, and high scores indicate the&#xD;
      high level of self-stigma in asking for help. Some items of the scale are scored inversely,&#xD;
      and a high score indicates a high level of self-stigma in asking for help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Committee approval was obtained from Dokuz Eylül University Health Sciences Institute.&#xD;
      (2019 / 23-23) The permit of the institution will be obtained from İzmir Provincial&#xD;
      Directorate of National Education Strategy Development Unit. Informed consent will be signed&#xD;
      by the parents of the student in conducting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variable: Adolescent/Adult Mental Health Literacy knowledge level, Attitudes&#xD;
      towards Seeking Psychological Help, Self-Stigma in Seeking Psychological Help score averages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variable: Mental Health literacy education (Student and Parent) Primary outcomes:&#xD;
