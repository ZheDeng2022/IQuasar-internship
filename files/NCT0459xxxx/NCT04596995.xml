    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP.</description>

    <description>The ITP-PAQ is a 44-item disease-specific quality of life (QoL) questionnaire developed for use in adults with chronic ITP. It includes 11 scales: Symptoms, Fatigue, Physical Health - Bother, Physical Health - Activity, Emotional Health - Psychological, Emotional Health - Fear, Overall QoL, Social Activity, Women's Reproductive Health - Fertility, Women's Reproductive Health - Menstrual Symptoms, and Work. Each item is rated on a Likert-type scale containing 4 to 7 responses. All item scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 continuum and are weighted equally to derive individual scale scores. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
