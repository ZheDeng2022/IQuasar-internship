  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS, is an uncommon but often very disabling chronic pain&#xD;
      syndrome characterized by, beside pain: sensory disturbances, peripheral autonomic changes&#xD;
      and inflammatory features. The diagnosis is subdivided in CRPS type 1 where no nerve injury&#xD;
      has been identified, and CRPS type 2 when a major nerve injury has been verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of exposure in vivo, a form of behaviour therapy where the patient is gradually&#xD;
      confronted with avoided movements and activities, and interventions directly targeting a&#xD;
      hypothesized cortical reorganisation is an interesting novel approach for treating CRPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study consists of (1) a qualitative interview study with 10-15 subjects that has&#xD;
      received this form of treatment, in order to better understand their experience and effects&#xD;
      of the treatment, and (2) a case series with long-term follow-up of 3-5 subjects that&#xD;
      received the treatment f√∂r 5-8 years ago, in order to study the long term effects of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
