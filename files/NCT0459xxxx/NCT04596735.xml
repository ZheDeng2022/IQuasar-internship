      Perform a prospective observational study to evaluate routine criteria commonly used to&#xD;
      extubate elderly patients in the operating room after non-cardiac and non-thoracic surgery to&#xD;
      ultimately reduce the incidence of near-term reintubation and by extension other respiratory&#xD;
