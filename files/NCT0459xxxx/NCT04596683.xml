  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This novel study will assess the feasibility and outcomes of same-day discharge following&#xD;
      mastectomy with implant-based pre-pectoral reconstruction. This contrasts the current&#xD;
      standard practice of admitting patients to the hospital as an inpatient for at least one&#xD;
      night postoperatively. With the advent of pre-pectoral implant-based reconstructive&#xD;
      techniques as opposed to the historical retro-pectoral breast reconstruction, patients&#xD;
      experience significantly less post-operative pain, shorter recovery time, and improved&#xD;
      mobility all of which support that patients lacking comorbidities are likely to meet&#xD;
      discharge criteria the same day as surgery. Furthermore, advances in opioid sparing&#xD;
      anesthesia and the Enhanced Recovery After Anesthesia protocol, has dramatically reduced pain&#xD;
      scores and narcotic requirements after surgery at our institution. &quot;Same day discharge&quot; may&#xD;
      reduce healthcare costs, decreases the risk of hospital-acquired infections and can increase&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. Potential risks associated with same day discharge include&#xD;
      readmissions, infections, limitations to pain management and other complications. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at MedStar System Hospitals and the population will be patients receiving&#xD;
      pre-pectoral breast reconstruction following mastectomy that consent to the study. The&#xD;
      project will be conducted as a prospective study where a carefully selected group of women&#xD;
      without comorbidities undergoing mastectomy and pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction&#xD;
      will be offered same day discharge, educated about postoperative care preoperatively, be&#xD;
      evaluated in the PACU and if they meet discharge criteria, will go home the same day as&#xD;
      surgery. Those women who do not meet discharge criteria will stay overnight and be followed&#xD;
      for outcomes, as well, as a comparison group. The primary endpoint for this study is patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include pain, complications including infection, hematomas,&#xD;
      return to emergency room or urgent care, opiate equivalent use, and whether a patient would&#xD;
      recommend same day discharge to others. Statistical analysis using means, 95% CI, frequency&#xD;
      counts, descriptive statistics, fisher exact test and independent t-tests will evaluate&#xD;
      differences between the same day discharge and admitted groups. Please see section 6 in the&#xD;
      IRB protocol for more detail. We hypothesize that same day discharge provides acceptable&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, pain control, complication rates with similar opiate equivalent use in&#xD;
      comparison with overnight admission. Overall, we think this group will demonstrate positive&#xD;
      outcomes on its own in these categories. We also believe that this study will demonstrate&#xD;
      patients with same day discharge will recommend it to other women undergoing mastectomy.&#xD;
