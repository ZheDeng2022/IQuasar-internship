  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At menopausal transition, the risk of cardiovascular diseases increases. This is partly due&#xD;
      to aging, but largely also the loss of estrogen, which has many positive effects on the&#xD;
      circulation and protects against cardiovascular diseases. It has been suggested that the loss&#xD;
      of estrogen may have a negative impact on the otherwise well-documented health promoting&#xD;
      effects of exercise training, and that the time after menopause may be crucial for the effect&#xD;
      of exercise training on the vascular function, and therefore also for the risk of thrombosis.&#xD;
      Literature regarding the effect of exercise training on the risk of thrombosis is limited,&#xD;
      and especially in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether the same effects of exercise&#xD;
      training in relation to thrombosis is achieved if the exercise is initiated early compared to&#xD;
      late after menopause. The aim is to provide knowledge-based recommendations regarding&#xD;
      exercise. Teams sports will be used as the training intervention, because team sports&#xD;
      benefits physical health and also includes a social element.&#xD;

      Part of the novelty of this project is to link functional measurements of cardiovascular&#xD;
      health at whole body level to cell studies. Cells will be isolated from muscle samples&#xD;
      obtained from the post-menopausal women before and after the training intervention. This will&#xD;
      enhance the understanding of the changes that occur after prolonged loss of estrogen on&#xD;
      thrombotic risk and vascular function, and whether exercise training can alter these&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
