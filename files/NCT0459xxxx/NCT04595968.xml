      Trial Title A randomized, double blind sham controlled clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), together with a lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program, compared to a sham control with a lifestyle modification program, as a means of&#xD;
      improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of non-invasive electrical vestibular nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (VeNS), together with a lifestyle modification program, as a method of reducing&#xD;
      HbA1c, as compared to a sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation: Randomized to either active device or control device usage. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive the same lifestyle advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint classification: Efficacy Study Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment in 1:1 active&#xD;
      to control allocation Trial Participants: Those who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The aim is to recruit a total of 200 participants. Planned Trial Period: The&#xD;
      study will last 24 weeks in total for each subject. The primary analysis will be conducted at&#xD;
      the 24 weeks timepoint. The study in total is estimated to take about 1.5 years to complete.&#xD;
