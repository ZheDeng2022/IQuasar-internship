    <textblock>
      This study seeks to compare the accuracy and acceptability of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      testing self-sampling kit versus standard clinician-sampled HPV testing for cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening. The primary outcome of this study is the concordance between screening results on&#xD;
      self-sampling kits compared to clinician-collected HPV test and Pap smear results. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include acceptability of self-sampling and barriers to cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening. These endpoints will be analyzed to try to circumvent barriers to the cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening and ascertain whether self-sampling is a viable alternative to clinician&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Cancer Society estimates that 4,170 women in the United States (US) will die&#xD;
      from cervical cancer in 2018. Screening can reduce cancer mortality by (1) detecting&#xD;
      malignancies when they are more treatable and (2) for some tests, identifying precancerous&#xD;
      lesions for removal. Guidelines recommend cytology and/or human papillomavirus (HPV) testing&#xD;
      for cervical cancer screening among women ages 30-65 years, but screening rates are&#xD;
      suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help bridge these gaps in screening, HPV self-sampling would be an alternative to clinical&#xD;
      screening. However, there are concerns about the comparability and acceptability of&#xD;
      self-sampling kits. The impact of the proposed project is to compare HPV self-screening&#xD;
      results with Pap smear results and clinician-collected HPV tests to ultimately improve the&#xD;
      uptake of HPV screening. This study will be conducted in a normal risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have an upcoming well-woman appointment will be identified from Penn State&#xD;
      Health, Department of Family and Community Medicine, clinic schedules. Clinicians who are a&#xD;
      part of the study team will identify these patients two weeks prior to their appointment and&#xD;
      send their information to a study coordinator, who will then call these patients to provide&#xD;
      more information and assess their interest in participating. Patients who schedule within the&#xD;
      two week period or were not contacted by a study team member for any reason will be given a&#xD;
      card with general information about the study at their well-woman visit so that these women&#xD;
      can contact a study team member if they are interested. A total of 197 participants will be&#xD;
      recruited into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants will be screened for eligibility over the phone and sent a&#xD;
      self-sampling kit through the mail with a Summary Explanation of Research form, instructions,&#xD;
      and pre-paid mailer to return the kit. Participants may collect their sample two weeks before&#xD;
      or after their well-woman visit. A study team member will contact the participants at&#xD;
      different time points within the 28 day window to determine whether the sample was collected&#xD;
      and to administer the follow-up survey.&#xD;

Participants will collect the sample at home and mail it back to the Penn State Health clinical laboratory, where the results will be compared to those obtained from the Pap Smear/HPV test at their clinic appointment. Participants will also complete a follow up survey over the phone after their sample is collected.</intervention_model_description>
