      In many cases, the manometric examination is not feasible because of the pharyngeal sinusitis&#xD;
      or pharyngeal torsion. In addition, although previous conventional manometry was used to&#xD;
      estimate pharyngeal swallowing, the bolus flow transmission was still not evaluated, which&#xD;
      still depended on the videofluoscopic swallowing studies. High resolution impedance manometry&#xD;
      could help us to measure the bolus flow according to the impedance changes. However, the&#xD;
      comparison between two approach methods of postoperative recovery of swallowing function is&#xD;
      still inconclusive. The investigator aimed to examine the correlation between high-resolution&#xD;
      manometric and videofluoroscopic measurements of the swallowing function.&#xD;

      Background: In many cases, the manometric examination is not feasible because of the&#xD;
      pharyngeal sinusitis or pharyngeal torsion. In addition, although previous conventional&#xD;
      manometry was used to estimate pharyngeal swallowing, the bolus flow transmission was still&#xD;
      not evaluated, which still depended on the videofluoscopic swallowing studies. High&#xD;
      resolution impedance manometry could help us to measure the bolus flow according to the&#xD;
      impedance changes. However, the comparison between two approach methods of postoperative&#xD;
      recovery of swallowing function is still inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of the current study was to examine the correlation between&#xD;
      high-resolution manometric and videofluoroscopic measurements of the swallowing function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Consecutive patients who will fulfill the criteria of postoperative&#xD;
      cervical spine surgery patients aged &gt;= 20 will be enrolled and the dysphagia questionnaire&#xD;
      score (EAT-10) was higher than 3, including 3. After got the inform consent, these patients&#xD;
      receive the swallowing function by videofluroscopy and HRIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result: The investigator will evaluate the swallowing changes of these postoperative&#xD;
      cervical spine patients with suspected dysphagia. The investigator expected that the highly&#xD;
      correlation between the HRIM and VFSS.&#xD;
