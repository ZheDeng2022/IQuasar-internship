      While central venous pressure measurement is used to guide fluid management in high risk&#xD;
      surgical patients during perioperative period, the relationship between the value of central&#xD;
      venous pressure and organ dysfunction and prognosis of high-risk operating patients is&#xD;
      unknow. In this study, we conducted a retrospective study of the relationship between the&#xD;
      initial levels of CVP with organ dysfunction, the severity of illness, the length of ICU&#xD;
      stay, and prognosis of critically ill patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although less than 15% of high-risk patients (elderly or with limited cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      reserves) undergo surgery, these patients account for 80% of hospital deaths. The&#xD;
      requirements for hemodynamic monitoring to critical patients during perioperative period&#xD;
      reach are of maximal importance, for two major reasons: (i) absolute or relative volume&#xD;
      deficiency often occurs in postoperative patients due to preoperative fasting, intraoperative&#xD;
      bleeding and non-dominant fluid loss caused by vasodilation and fluid redistribution caused&#xD;
      by anesthesia; (ii) insufficient fluid replacement may lead to increased postoperative organ&#xD;
      complications and poor wound healing. Adequate and goal-oriented hemodynamic monitoring&#xD;
      combined with early and appropriate treatment can improve the prognosis of high-risk surgical&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central venous pressure is a localized parameter of the superior vena cava or the right&#xD;
      atrium and is closely related to the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. With volume&#xD;
      overload, CVP levels may be abnormally elevated. Maintaining central venous pressure as low&#xD;
      as possible is conducive to the recovery of internal organs during haemodynamic treatment,&#xD;
      especially for the kidney, intestine, and brain, etc. However, elevated central venous&#xD;
      pressure (CVP) occurs frequently in critical care settings, including postoperative critical&#xD;
      patients. In this study, we conducted a retrospective study of the relationship between the&#xD;
      initial levels of CVP with organ dysfunction, the severity of illness, the length of ICU&#xD;
      stay, and prognosis of critically ill patients.&#xD;
