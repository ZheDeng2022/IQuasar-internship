  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Point-of-care (POC) creatinine devices allow rapid measurement of creatinine levels and&#xD;
      calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which give an indication of renal&#xD;
      function. The focus of this assessment is to validate POC measurements to assess kidney&#xD;
      function before intravascular iodinated contrast administration in patients with severe renal&#xD;
      insufficiency (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2). It will be evaluated whether discrepancies between&#xD;
      POC measurement values and values obtained from standard laboratory assays lie within an&#xD;
      acceptable range using Bland-Altman analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Measurement of creatinine to determine eGFR before intravascular iodinated contrast&#xD;
      administration is indicated to assess whether a patient is at risk of contrast-induced acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI). For patients with reduced eGFR intravenous hydration can be offered&#xD;
      before the scan to reduce the risk of AKI. If no recent eGFR measurement is available,&#xD;
      contrast procedures could be cancelled and rescheduled while a creatinine test is processed&#xD;
      in the laboratory. Using POC creatinine tests before contrast-enhanced procedures could&#xD;
      minimise the risk of kidney injury, and may reduce the number of cancelled scans. The&#xD;
      question is whether POC creatinine assay is accurate and beneficial in this setting compared&#xD;
      to the standard laboratory assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The i-STAT Alinity POC creatinine device is one of three devices which calculate estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) recommended in clinical practice guidelines to assess&#xD;
      kidney function to guide decisions on the use of intravascular iodinated contrast in adults.&#xD;
      In the study, i-STAT Alinity POC measurements of creatinine will be performed using already&#xD;
      available blood samples of patients with estimated eGFR&lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2 and mean difference&#xD;
      between eGFR and serum creatinine measurements using POC and standard laboratory assays will&#xD;
      be calculated. Results will be used to evaluate the agreement between of POC and laboratory&#xD;
      assays on risk stratification (i.e., the percentage of patients with eGFR&lt;30 according to&#xD;
      both laboratory and POC assays) and post-contrast acute kidney injury (AKI; i.e., the&#xD;
      percentage of patients with post-contrast acute kidney injury according to both laboratory&#xD;
      and POC assays). Finally, the number of elective procedures which are delayed (including&#xD;
      delayed planning) or cancelled because a serum creatinine assay is required and unavailable&#xD;
      will be prospectively evaluated for Maastricht UMC+ in this study.&#xD;
