    <textblock>
      An observational study of patients in cardiogenic shock under veno-arterial ECMO is designed&#xD;
      to describe the clinical, ultrasound and hemodynamic parameters of these patients and to&#xD;
      establish a predictive score for right-sided dysfunction in a patient within 48 hours of ECMO&#xD;
      withdrawal after placement of IMPELLA®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic innovations in the field of heart failure are constant and have improved the&#xD;
      prognosis and quality of life of patients. For those suffering from end-stage heart failure,&#xD;
      heart transplantation remains the main therapeutic resource, but on the one hand the number&#xD;
      of available grafts is insufficient compared to the number of transplant candidates, and on&#xD;
      the other hand heart transplantation is accompanied by risks of rejection, infections and&#xD;
      cancers, with a current median survival of 12 years .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, in selected patients, a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) may be a&#xD;
      bridge to transplantation or a way to improve the duration and quality of life of patients&#xD;
      without a transplant project (destination therapy). Currently, about half of all heart&#xD;
      transplants performed internationally are done in patients with left monoventricular assist,&#xD;
      and in 2017 43% of implanted LVAD patients were in destination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, this observational study aims to describe the clinical, ultrasound and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters of these patients and to establish a predictive score for right-sided&#xD;
      dysfunction in a patient during the 30-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More precisely, during this study we will compare the clinical, ultrasound and hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters of these patients in order to establish a predictive score for right-sided&#xD;
      dysfunction during :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48 hours on ECMO and IMPELLA (after IMPELLA® placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48 hours on IMPELLA alone following ECMO withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48 hours under left monoventricular assistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At day 7 of the follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At day30 of the follow-up Patients who develop right heart failure within 48 hours of&#xD;
           ECMO withdrawal after IMPELLA® placement will be compared to patients without right&#xD;
           heart failure on demographic, clinical, history, treatment history, and cardiac echo and&#xD;
           hemodynamic data at admission.&#xD;
