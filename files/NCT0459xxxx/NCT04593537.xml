      Predicting the prognosis and treatment responses in individuals with major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD) is currently based on trial and error, because some treatments work for some&#xD;
      individuals, but not others. Novel predictors of prognosis and treatment response in MDD can&#xD;
      add value to the development of targeted treatments and the stratified approaches to improve&#xD;
      long-term outcomes of individuals with MDD. This study uses a novel virtual-reality-based&#xD;
      measure of blame-related action tendencies and combines this with established predictors of&#xD;
      treatment response and prognosis in individuals with MDD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Developing clinical and psychological markers which characterise the large subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with major depression who do not benefit from serotonergic antidepressants offered&#xD;
      as first line treatment is of utmost clinical importance but has so far not been achieved.&#xD;
      Clinical and psychological indicators would be ideal in predicting non-response to&#xD;
      antidepressant medications, given their wide availability. So far, however, these measures&#xD;
      have failed to provide accurate predictions at the individual level. Novel predictors of&#xD;
      prognosis and treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD) can add value to the&#xD;
      development of targeted treatments and stratified approaches to improve long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      individuals with MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological underpinnings of patients' response to treatment have been an important&#xD;
      direction of research. As proposed by the revised learned helplessness model, one central&#xD;
      cognitive vulnerability to MDD is the tendency to excessively blame oneself for negative&#xD;
      events occurring in one's life. Consistent with the theory, previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the importance of self-blaming bias both as a vulnerability factor and as a&#xD;
      symptom of depression. For example, it has been shown that individuals with remitted MDD had&#xD;
      increased self-contempt biases compared to healthy control participants in a recent study. As&#xD;
      MDD is a life-long diagnosis, understanding the differences between remitted MDD and healthy&#xD;
      controls could help to identify vulnerability traits associated with MDD. Thus, the finding&#xD;
      of self-blaming biases in remitted MDD demonstrate the potential role of self-blame as a&#xD;
      vulnerability trait and a novel cognitive marker for MDD that remain present during remission&#xD;
      and possibly constitute vulnerability for recurrence. However, one limitation in previous&#xD;
      studies is that people might have experienced difficulties distinguishing their moral&#xD;
      emotions such as shame and guilt under certain circumstances. Previous measures assessing&#xD;
      these emotions largely depended on participants' subjective rating and are thus problematic&#xD;
      in terms of differentiating the moral emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, these measures fail to address the adaptive or maladaptive nature of moral&#xD;
      emotions. As proposed by Tangney, moral emotions can be either adaptive and maladaptive, and&#xD;
      this difference is possibly determined by an individual's different action tendencies&#xD;
      associated with their moral emotions. Action tendencies describe an implicit cognitive and&#xD;
      motivational state before an action is taken. It was suggested that adaptive action&#xD;
      tendencies, such as feeling like apologizing, were associated with self-blaming emotions such&#xD;
      as guilt, and maladaptive action tendencies such as feeling like hiding and creating a&#xD;
      distance from oneself were associated with shame. However, an empirical investigation of the&#xD;
      associations between action tendencies and self-blaming emotions is lacking. Further&#xD;
      investigations of this topic are important for understanding the potential role of action&#xD;
      tendencies as a novel measure of self-blame and its association to the vulnerability to MDD.&#xD;
      It is important to develop measures of action tendencies with a high ecological validity. In&#xD;
      previous studies, our research group has developed a computerised task that measures action&#xD;
      tendencies and used it to predict prognosis in MDD. It was found that this task can predict&#xD;
      recurrence risk in people with MDD, showing a large effect size (Cohen's d=.96). However,&#xD;
      there were two major limitations. First, the task used in a verbal format and included&#xD;
      abstract descriptions of scenarios (e.g. &quot;You act stingily towards your friend&quot;), which makes&#xD;
      the task dependent on how well participants can imagine the scenarios. Second, the lack of&#xD;
      immersiveness of the task made it difficult to engage, which may limit the task's ecological&#xD;
      validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR)-based assessment is a new paradigm for cognitive evaluation compared to&#xD;
      the traditional paper-and-pencil or computerized assessment. VR scenarios were suggested to&#xD;
      be promising tools for cognitive assessments and have been demonstrated as safe for the&#xD;
      assessment of anxiety disorders and depression. Importantly, the interactive and immersive&#xD;
      nature of virtual reality makes it possible to develop a cognitive task that is engaging and&#xD;
      has a higher ecologically validity, which would be ideal for identifying novel cognitive&#xD;
      markers of MDD outcomes. Thus, this study will aim to employ a virtual reality task to&#xD;
      measure blame-related action tendencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three major research questions of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is MDD associated with a higher proneness towards maladaptive action tendencies, such as&#xD;
           self-distancing and hiding, compared with a non-MDD control group?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are maladaptive self-blame-related action tendencies associated with a poor prognosis&#xD;
           for current major depressive disorder when treated as usual in primary care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can maladaptive self-blame-related action tendencies be used to predict prognosis in MDD&#xD;
           at the individual level when combined with other predictors using a nested elastic-net&#xD;
           regularised doubly-cross-validated regression model?&#xD;
           (https://github.com/AndrewLawrence/dCVnet). This will use both primary and secondary&#xD;
           predictors in the same model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed primary predictors of prognosis for major depressive disorder are the following&#xD;
      (these will be used in a non-regularised multiple regression model):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage of trials during which hiding was chosen as measured by the VR-task&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percentage of trials during which self-distancing was chosen as measured by the VR-task&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Autonomy total score as measured by the Personal Style Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sociotropy total score as measured by the Personal Style Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Maudsley Staging Model total score&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compliance with treatment as measured on an ordinal scale (how regularly have you taken&#xD;
           your antidepressants over the last month at the prescribed dose? 0=Never, 1=Some of the&#xD;
           time, 2=More than half the time, 3=Most of the time, 4=Almost every day, 5=Every day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Social support received as measured by the Social Support Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Baseline depression score as measured by the Self-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive&#xD;
           Symptomatology (QIDS-SR-16) and the Maudsley-Modified Patient Health Questionnaire -9&#xD;
           (MM-PHQ-9, two separate models will be run for using either QIDS-SR-16 or the MM-PHQ-9&#xD;
           as the outcome variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Baseline anxiety symptoms as measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Optimisation of antidepressant medication during the follow-up period on an ordinal&#xD;
           scale (0=no new antidepressant/stopping current antidepressant or lowering its dose,&#xD;
           1=increase from effective dose to a higher dose, 2=increase from ineffective to&#xD;
           effective dose /or change to another antidepressant at effective dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other potential predictors in secondary analyses for a non-regularised regression model:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Coping mechanism as measured by the Brief COPE&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type of treatment obtained during the four months (e.g. SSRI or Non-SSRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Affective Lability&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Early life trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Physical co-morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Education&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Age of onset&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Number of previous episodes&#xD;
