  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the binocular distance, intermediate, and near visual&#xD;
      acuity of the Alcon Vivity and Bausch &amp; Lomb enVista IOLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the Alcon Vivity and Bausch &amp; Lomb enVista IOLs will have similar&#xD;
      distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the&#xD;
      visual performance of the IOLs may be different.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presbyopia correcting intraocular lens (PC-IOL) technology has been available for decades.&#xD;
      Lens designs have included refractive (e.g. AMO ReZoom), apodized diffractive (e.g. Alcon&#xD;
      Acrysof ReSTOR/PanOptix), accommodating (B&amp;L Crystalens), and extended depth-of-focus (e.g.&#xD;
      J&amp;J Symfony) technology. Spectacle independence is significantly higher with PC-IOLs when&#xD;
      compared with that of monofocal IOLs.1,2 Despite their clear benefits, PC-IOLs are not&#xD;
      without drawbacks. Any IOL that splits light to deliver distinct distance and near foci&#xD;
      creates the potential for photic phenomenon, which patients may perceive as glare, haloes,&#xD;
      and starbursts.3,4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudoaccommodation is defined as an increased depth-of-focus in an emmetropic eye that does&#xD;
      not have the ability to change its refractive power. Spherical aberration, which may come&#xD;
      from the cornea or IOL, plays an important role in pseudoaccommodation.5,6 There is a small&#xD;
      body of literature that IOLs (e.g. Mini WELL, SIFI, Catalina, Italy) with highly-positive&#xD;
      spherical aberration can result in significant pseudoaccommodation and lower unwanted optical&#xD;
      phenomena than current multifocal IOLs.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Alcon Vivity PC-IOL is a hydrophobic acrylic, non-diffractive, extended depth of focus&#xD;
      IOL designed for implantation in the capsular bag following cataract extraction. The&#xD;
      single-piece IOL has a 6.0 mm diameter and has a hyper-prolate profile that extends the depth&#xD;
      of focus to deliver a broader range of sharp vision, with the glare and halo profile&#xD;
      approaching that of a monofocal IOL.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bausch &amp; Lomb enVista MX60E is a posterior chamber hydrophobic acrylic IOL. The&#xD;
      single-piece IOL has a 6.0 mm diameter and has a neural aspheric optical profile. This&#xD;
      neutral aspheric profile, combined with the cornea's natural positive spherical aberration,&#xD;
      may extend the depth of focus relative to other negative aspheric hydrophobic acrylic&#xD;
      monofocal IOLs on the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no existing literature comparing the visual performance and patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes of the two above mentioned lens technologies; namely, one that relies on a&#xD;
      non-diffractive, hyper-prolate profile and another that relies on the cornea's natural&#xD;
      positive spherical aberration to provide pseudoaccommodation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA Summary of Safety and Effectiveness on the Alcon Vivity IOL compares visual and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes of the Alcon Vivity IOL and the Alcon Acrysof SN60WF. While the&#xD;
      Alcon Acrysof SN60WF and Bausch &amp; Lomb enVista lenses are not identical, they are considered&#xD;
      similar. The document reported improved intermediate vision with the Alcon Vivity over the&#xD;
      SN60WF, and rates of reported visual disturbances were similar between the two devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the Alcon Acrysof SN60WF has a negative aspheric optical profile, the Bausch &amp; Lomb&#xD;
      enVista has a neutral aspheric optical profile. Theoretically, the Bausch &amp; Lomb enVista IOL&#xD;
      may provide increased intermediate vision compared with the SN60WF.&#xD;
