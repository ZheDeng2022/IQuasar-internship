      The investigators are testing the efficacy of Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that participants receiving app-CBT will have greater improvement in SIGH-D scores than those&#xD;
      in the waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 8).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to test the efficacy of a Smartphone-based CBT treatment&#xD;
      for adults with MDD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects (N=112) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to 8 weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for MDD either immediately, or after a 8-week long&#xD;
      waiting period (50-50 chance). The investigators hypothesize that Smartphone-delivered CBT&#xD;
      for MDD will be feasible and acceptable to individuals with MDD, and that it will lead to&#xD;
      greater reductions in MDD symptom severity compared to the passage of time (waitlist&#xD;
      control).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SIGH-D) is a clinician-administered interview that assesses depressive symptom severity in the past seven days. It contains 16 items ranging from 0-3, which are summed to generate a total score of depressive symptom severity (range=0-27). **** EDIT</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in functional impairment at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on functional impairment (WSAS). The WSAS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not impaired at all) to 8 (very severely impaired) to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family/friends domains. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life at the end of treatment/waitlist period: Q-LES-Q-SF</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on quality of life, assessed using The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q). The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report measure of subjective quality of life, containing Likert items ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). Total scores are presented as a percentage of the maximum value (i.e., ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life).</description>

    <description>8-week Smartphone-delivered CBT for MDD. In-person cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for MDD. The app-delivered CBT in this project includes modules such as cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, core belief work), behavioral activation, and perceptual retraining/mindfulness skills.</description>
