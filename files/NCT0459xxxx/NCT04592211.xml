  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with&#xD;
      high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD 1) receptor, thus inhibiting&#xD;
      its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand&#xD;
      2 (PD-L2). Olaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor (PARP1, 2, and 3) that is being developed as a&#xD;
      monotherapy as well as for combination with chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, and other&#xD;
      anti-cancer agents including novel agents and immunotherapy. Paclitaxel is widely used in&#xD;
      breast, lung and gastric cancer with every 3-week or weekly cycle. Various targeted&#xD;
      anticancer agents have been investigated with paclitaxel and combination with ramucirumab, a&#xD;
      monoclonal anti-VEGFR2 antibody, was approved as a 2nd line treatment.&#xD;
