  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pedicled jejunal flap can be utilized with various tips for esophageal reconstruction in&#xD;
      patients with a history of gastrectomy, or those who have undergone synchronous&#xD;
      esophagogastrectomy, although the rate of anastomosis leakage is high with this technique.&#xD;
      Therefore, in the current study, we considered the utility of the evaluation of blood flow of&#xD;
      the remnant esophagus with indocyanine green in setting the anastomosis site. We included 50&#xD;
      patients who underwent radical esophagectomy with pedicled jejunal flap between April 2012&#xD;
      and June 2020. From June 2019, the blood flow of not only the pedicled jejunum, but also the&#xD;
      remnant esophagus were evaluated in order to set the anastomosis site of the latter because&#xD;
      the color was not definitive criteria for judging in surgery on the remnant esophagus.&#xD;
      Usually, the second and third jejunal vessels are transected, and if the jejunal flap cannot&#xD;
      reach to the anastomosis point, we actively transect the marginal vessels in order to stretch&#xD;
      the jejunal flap. Microvascular anastomosis between the jejunal branches (the second) and the&#xD;
      internal thoracic vessels is usually made, and the anastomosis site is set at the part of the&#xD;
      esophagus that is well-dyed with indocyanine green. A total of 39 patients underwent the&#xD;
      procedure prior to June 2019 ( Group A), and 11 patients underwent the procedure as of June&#xD;
      2019 (Group B). No significant difference was found in the patients' background, type of&#xD;
      preoperative therapy, and presence or absence of ligation of marginal vessels and two-stage&#xD;
      operation between the two groups. Group A had 16 cases of anastomosis leakage, while Group B&#xD;
      only has one (P &lt; 0.05). There were no cases of significant pedicled jejunum graft necrosis.&#xD;
      Our findings demonstrate that the evaluation of the blood flow of the remnant esophagus&#xD;
      during setting of the anastomosis site may decrease the rate of anastomosis.&#xD;

        Between January 2011 and June 2020, 50 patients underwent esophagectomy with pedicled&#xD;
        jejunum reconstruction at our institute. The patients underwent subtotal esophagectomy via&#xD;
        right thoracotomy with either an endoscopic or open procedure.&#xD;
