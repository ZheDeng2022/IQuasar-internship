  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized controlled trial comparing child welfare business as usual (BAU) with&#xD;
      two levels of supportive housing (SH). To identify eligible families, a screening tool was&#xD;
      developed that helped social workers apply a &quot;housing lens&quot; very early in family child&#xD;
      welfare involvement. The study examined the extent to which implementation was faithful to&#xD;
      the model and how well state and community partners collaborated. The research included a&#xD;
      process evaluation, outcomes study, and economic analysis. Access to either intervention&#xD;
      group was associated with higher family preservation and reunification, with service model&#xD;
      intensity demonstrating minimal impact. An economic evaluation revealed that the intensive&#xD;
      model cost the most, but the existing SH program and routine care incurred equivalent&#xD;
      per-child costs.&#xD;

      Supportive Housing for Families is a care management program that serves families who are&#xD;
      experiencing child welfare needs (risk of losing custody of children or difficulty regaining&#xD;
      custody of children) and severe housing needs. The program has been in operation for over 10&#xD;
      years and has been demonstrating positive outcomes for clients in terms of housing stability&#xD;
      and family environment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A federally funded, five-year demonstration project and evaluation focused on a new and&#xD;
      enhanced version of the program, the Intensive Supportive Housing for Families program&#xD;
      (ISHF). Through a three arm randomized controlled trial, this study compared clients in three&#xD;
      groups: parents who are randomly assigned to (1) enroll in ISHF, (2) participate in the&#xD;
      existing Supportive Housing for Families (SHF) program, and (3) receive Child Welfare&#xD;
      Business as Usual Services. This was the first randomized evaluation of this program, and the&#xD;
      grant required examination of whether those who participate in an enhanced version of the&#xD;
      program, which incorporates prompt access to evidence-based interventions, vocational&#xD;
      services, and trauma services, show superior outcomes than clients randomized to the existing&#xD;
      program. Further, clients in both of these conditions (SHF and ISHF) were compared to those&#xD;
      receiving child welfare services in Connecticut as usual (BAU) without a supportive housing&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has three components: a) a process evaluation, b) a cost/economic analysis, and&#xD;
      c) an impact analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process evaluation and cost analysis were previously completed while the project was&#xD;
      ongoing. Now that the project has ended, the final report on all project activities has been&#xD;
      submitted to the funder, the Administration for Children and Families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This impact analysis addressed the following primary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do clients who receive supportive housing services (SHF and ISHF interventions combined)&#xD;
           demonstrate improved child welfare outcomes compared to those in the Child Welfare (DCF)&#xD;
           Business as Usual (BAU) intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do clients who receive any supportive housing services (those in the SHF and ISHF&#xD;
           interventions combined) demonstrate improved parental well-being compared to those in&#xD;
           the Child Welfare (DCF) Business as Usual (BAU) intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do clients who receive supportive housing services (SHF and ISHF interventions combined)&#xD;
           demonstrate improved parenting skills compared to those in the BAU intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do clients who receive any supportive housing services (those in the SHF and ISHF&#xD;
           interventions combined) demonstrate increased self-sufficiency compared to those in the&#xD;
           BAU intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Do clients who receive any supportive housing services (those in the SHF and ISHF&#xD;
           interventions combined) demonstrate improved child development compared to those in the&#xD;
           Child Welfare Business as Usual intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Do clients who receive any supportive housing services (those in the SHF and ISHF&#xD;
           interventions combined) demonstrate improved child well-being compared to those in the&#xD;
           Child Welfare Business as Usual intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of secondary research questions ask: across each of these outcomes (i.e., child&#xD;
      welfare, parental well-being, parenting skills, self-sufficiency, child development, child&#xD;
      well-being), are there differential effects across the three intervention options, ISHF, SHF,&#xD;
      and BAU [such that those in ISHF show greater improvement than clients in the SHF program who&#xD;
      show greater improvement than those in BAU]?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures were assessed at 12, 18, and 24 months post-randomization. Housing&#xD;
      outcomes included shelter stay and subsidy deployment. Child welfare outcomes included child&#xD;
      removal and reunification, subsequent allegations and substantiations, and case closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Access to either intervention group was associated with higher family preservation&#xD;
      and reunification, with service model intensity demonstrating minimal impact. An economic&#xD;
      evaluation revealed that the intensive model cost the most, but the existing SH program and&#xD;
      routine care incurred equivalent per-child costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI of this research was originally at the University of Connecticut and moved to Chapin&#xD;
      Hall. The research has concluded and the investigators are drafting a manuscript.&#xD;
