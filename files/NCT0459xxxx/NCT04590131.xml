  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent study, where the authors studied the effectiveness of stenting of prolonged lesions&#xD;
      (&gt;200 mm) of the femoral-popliteal segment with nitinol stents (TASC II, D), showed&#xD;
      unsatisfactory primary patency rates (45%) within 2 years follow up (Lin et al, 2015). One of&#xD;
      the possible solutions to the problem of breakage of stents in the femoral-popliteal position&#xD;
      is a modified method of their manufacture by braiding from nitinol wire. Another possible&#xD;
      solution to the problem of stent breakage in the femoral-popliteal position is fasciotomy in&#xD;
      Gunter's canal with dissection of the lamina vasto-adductoria. According to a pilot&#xD;
      randomized study (Karpenko et al, 2019), the primary patency at 24 months was 60% in the&#xD;
      stenting group supplemented with fasciotomy in Gunter's canal, and 28.5% in the stenting&#xD;
      group without fasciotomy. These facts prove the need for a comparative study on a cohort of&#xD;
      patients using a biomimetic interwoven nitinol stent. This is a pilot prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, open-label study. The main objective of the study is to compare the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of two methods of treating prolonged atherosclerotic lesions (TASC II,&#xD;
      type D) of the arteries of the femoropopliteal segment above the knee.&#xD;

      type D) of the arteries of the femoropopliteal segment above the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening It is performed in patients with a verified diagnosed occlusive lesion of the&#xD;
      femoropopliteal segment above the knee (type D by TASC II classification), with chronic limb&#xD;
      ischemia (3-6 categories by Rutherford classification). Assessment of inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, assigning a patient number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study inclusion Collecting baseline information about the patient (anamnesis, including&#xD;
      information about concomitant therapy, data from the initial physical examination, ultrasound&#xD;
      data of the lower limb arteries, CT-angiography data, assessment of the quality of life using&#xD;
      the SF-36 questionnaire). Randomization using the envelope method to one group or another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (n=50): Recanalization of prolonged occlusion of the arteries of the&#xD;
      femoral-popliteal segment above the knee with angioplasty and stenting with a biomimetic&#xD;
      interwoven nitinol stent; Group 2 (n=50): Recanalization of prolonged occlusion of the&#xD;
      arteries of the femoropopliteal segment above the knee with angioplasty and stenting with a&#xD;
      biomimetic interwoven nitinol stent, supplemented by fasciotomy in Gunter's canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: 6, 12, 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triplex ultrasound of one lower limb (restenosis, thrombosis, stent breakage); Radiography of&#xD;
      the operated limb in two projections, for patients in whom a stent breakage is suspected&#xD;
      according to ultrasound; Consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon. For each patient&#xD;
      participating in the study, a CRF is filled out in a form convenient for the Investigator.&#xD;

    <description>Under local anesthesia, a standard endovascular approach is performed. Transluminal or subintimal recanalization of the occluded arterial segment is performed with a hydrophilic guidewire. Next, balloon angioplasty of the recanalized segment is performed. After control angiography, a biomimetic interwoven nitinol stent is placed throughout the lesion. Immediately after the stenting procedure, under local anesthesia, access to the distal part of the SFA at the outlet of Hunter's canal and 1 portion of the popliteal artery is performed. The lamina vastoadductoria is dissected. The wound is sutured in layers. An aseptic bandage is applied. Drug therapy includes pre-procedure clopidogrel (160-300 mg/day), starting at least one day before, and intra-procedure heparin (100 U / kg body weight intravenously). After the procedure, all patients have prescribed double antiplatelet therapy (aspirin+clopidogrel (75 mg per day) within 6 months and then aspirin 75 mg for a long time.</description>
