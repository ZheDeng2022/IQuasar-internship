      1. Research purpose Patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (CT2-4A N-/+ M0)&#xD;
           were selected as study subjects to investigate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of&#xD;
           ICG near-infrared imaging tracing in guiding laparoscopic D2 lymph node dissection for&#xD;
           gastric cancer by comparing injection ICG group and non-injection ICG group&#xD;

        2. Research design prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-control, Parallel&#xD;
           assignment, superiority test 2.1 multicenter This study came from Fujian Medical&#xD;

           2.2 Case group Group A (Study Group): Laparoscopic gastrectomy Group with the use of&#xD;
           near-infrared imaging (ICG group) Group B (Control Group): Laparoscopic gastrectomy&#xD;
           Group without the use of near-infrared imaging (Non-ICG group) 2.3 Estimate Sample Size&#xD;
           3 years disease-free survival (DFS) is the main effectiveness evaluation index in this&#xD;
           study. The study is superiority test, assuming that the team's three years DFS is better&#xD;
           than that of control group,23, according to previous research results of laparoscopic&#xD;
           local advanced gastric cancer surgery ,three years DFS is 65.2%, the control group 3&#xD;
           years DFS is 65.2%, assuming that the experimental group 3 years DFS can be increased by&#xD;
           9%, that is 74.2%, inspection level 0.025 (unilateral), take 0.9 inspection efficiency,&#xD;
           using PASS 11 Logrank tests (Lakatos)[Proportion surviving] Calculated: Sample size&#xD;
           N=428, that is, each group needed 428 people to consider possible exclusion and loss of&#xD;
           follow-up cases (20% drop rate). The final sample size for each group was 535 cases, and&#xD;
           a total of 1070 cases were initially assigned to 66-67 cases in each center 2.4&#xD;
           randomization Stay into the group of cases after laparoscopic exploration, make sure&#xD;
           comply with the standards, can be randomized groups in this study we adopt the central&#xD;
           dynamic layered segment randomized method, considering the control factors are age,&#xD;
           gender tumor site preoperative staging research center of the given seed number and&#xD;
           segment length, application of SAS9.2 programming to produce serial number is 0001 ~&#xD;
           1070 by corresponding treatment allocation, reserved in the data center and research&#xD;
           center has the specialist is responsible for the cases of group information (age, gender&#xD;
           tumor site preoperative staging research center) via email A telephone call or text&#xD;
           message will be sent to the randomization implementation department of the data center,&#xD;
           and the central randomization department will analyze the case information to determine&#xD;
           the case enrollment and inform the research center where the case is located 2.5&#xD;
           Blinding Method: This research adopts an open design. 2.6 Research cycle: Estimated&#xD;
           enrollment cycle: complete enrollment within 2 years. Follow-up period: the enrollment&#xD;
           of the first case and the postoperative pathological report (generally 2 weeks after&#xD;
           surgery) was the end point of follow-up for secondary study purposes other than 3-year&#xD;
           overall survival rate and 3-year recurrence type Estimated time: 2020.10（to complete&#xD;
           enrollment）-2022.09（to complete follow-up）&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Objects All patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not conform to the&#xD;
           exclusion criteria are qualified for this study.&#xD;
