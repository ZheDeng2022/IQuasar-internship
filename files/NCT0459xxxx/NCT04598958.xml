    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes by implementing and&#xD;
      evaluating a multidisciplinary &quot;Integrated Management Team to Improve Maternal-Child Outcomes&#xD;
      (IMPROVE)&quot; intervention to increase MCH, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV services&#xD;
      uptake and retention in Lesotho. The proposed intervention will focus efforts to improve the&#xD;
      effectiveness of existing village health workers (VHW) and HIV support organizations (Lesotho&#xD;
      Network of AIDS Service Organizations [LENASO] and Mothers2Mothers [M2M]) based at the&#xD;
      facility and coordination between the facility and community. The IMPROVE intervention&#xD;
      includes: (1) Multidisciplinary integrated management teams to coordinate patient-focused and&#xD;
      outcome-oriented PMTCT and MCH services; (2) Enhanced Positive Health, Dignity, and&#xD;
      Prevention (PHDP)-focused counseling and skills-building training and job aids; and (3)&#xD;
      Increased early community-based counseling and support for first (antenatal care clinic) ANC&#xD;
      attendees with particular attention to HIV-positive women to minimize loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a cluster randomized design with facilities randomized to receive the&#xD;
      IMPROVE intervention or routine services offering the national standard of care. A cohort of&#xD;
      HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women will be enrolled and prospectively followed&#xD;
      every three months through pregnancy and until the participant's child reaches 24 months of&#xD;
      age. The primary HIV objectives will be to evaluate the effect of the intervention on&#xD;
      retention in HIV care, viral suppression, adherence to ART in HIV-positive women, and HIV&#xD;
      retesting in HIV-negative women. The investigators will also assess the effect of the IMPROVE&#xD;
      intervention on general MCH indices including antenatal care (ANC) attendance, facility&#xD;
      delivery, family planning, and immunization coverage. Secondary objectives include evaluation&#xD;
      of adherence self-efficacy (HIV positive) or prevention self-efficacy (HIV negative),&#xD;
      depression and stigma as well as disclosure, knowledge of partner status, and identification&#xD;
      of discordant couples in intervention versus control facilities. Analysis of the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the IMPROVE intervention will also be conducted. In addition,&#xD;
      qualitative interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted with study women, health&#xD;
      care workers (HCW), LENASO, and VHWs to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      integrating this intervention into routine care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lesotho is among countries with the highest HIV prevalence worldwide, with an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of HIV among pregnant women of 25.8% in 2013. In April 2013, Lesotho transitioned&#xD;
      from the WHO &quot;Option A&quot; strategy to implementation of &quot;Option B+&quot; (lifelong ART for all&#xD;
      HIV-positive women) strategy for PMTCT, in the context of a program that is integrated into&#xD;
      MCH services. Through this study, the investigators propose to evaluate a package of&#xD;
      interventions to provide enhanced individualized counseling and community support within a&#xD;
      coordinated system of training and accountability to optimize the delivery of patient-focused&#xD;
      services using PHDP principles within the routine PMTCT/MCH program in Lesotho.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 12 health facilities in Maseru district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention will focus efforts to improve the effectiveness of existing VHW and&#xD;
      HIV support organizations (LENASO, M2M) based at the facility and coordination between the&#xD;
      facility and community. The package includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MCH staff, counselors, M2M/LENASO and VHWs meeting regularly to coordinate&#xD;
           patient-focused and outcome-oriented PMTCT and MCH services to all women, with immediate&#xD;
           follow-up of defaulters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enhanced Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention (PHDP)-focused counseling and&#xD;
           skills-building training and job aids to improve the quality and consistency of&#xD;
           counseling provided by all IMPROVE team members. Such individualized support will&#xD;
           facilitate self-efficacy, support partner disclosure, provide screening and referral for&#xD;
           depression, and provide linkages to community-based services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased early community-based counseling and support for all ANC attendees that will&#xD;
           include 1 to 2 additional home or community visits at 2-7 days and/or 9-14 days after&#xD;
           first ANC visit, with particular attention to HIV-positive women to minimize immediate&#xD;
           and early loss to follow-up (LTFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and Objectives: The overall aim of this study is to improve maternal and child health&#xD;
      outcomes by implementing and evaluating a multidisciplinary &quot;Integrated Management Team to&#xD;
      Improve Maternal-Child Outcomes (IMPROVE)&quot; intervention to increase overall MCH, ART, and HIV&#xD;
      service uptake and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of the IMPROVE intervention on retention in HIV care, viral&#xD;
           suppression, and adherence to ART at 24 months postpartum in a prospective cohort of&#xD;
           HIV-positive pregnant/postpartum women and their infants compared to a cohort of&#xD;
           HIV-positive women receiving routine care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of the IMPROVE intervention on repeat HIV testing by 24 months&#xD;
           postpartum in a prospective cohort of HIV-negative pregnant/postpartum women compared to&#xD;
           a cohort of HIV-negative women receiving routine care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of the IMPROVE intervention on targeted MCH health seeking&#xD;
           behaviors (e.g., facility delivery, child immunization) in both HIV-positive and&#xD;
           HIV-negative women compared to women receiving routine care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the costs associated with the IMPROVE package of interventions for both&#xD;
           HIV-positive and HIV-negative women compared to HIV-positive and HIV-negative women&#xD;
           receiving routine care without the IMPROVE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess additional MCH outcomes (e.g., ANC attendance, infant mortality, maternal&#xD;
           mortality); other HIV prevention indices (e.g., disclosure, knowledge of partner status,&#xD;
           identification of discordant couples); unintended pregnancy prevention indices (e.g.,&#xD;
           use of modern contraceptives, repeat pregnancy, fertility intentions); and other indices&#xD;
           of HIV care (e.g., timing of infant diagnosis, number of infected infants) among&#xD;
           HIV-positive and HIV-negative women receiving the IMPROVE intervention versus those&#xD;
           receiving routine care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare depression, experienced stigma, and self-efficacy among both HIV-positive&#xD;
           (treatment self-efficacy) and HIV-negative women (HIV prevention self-efficacy) in the&#xD;
           intervention and control facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare pregnant/postpartum women's attitudes toward lifelong ART (HIV-positive&#xD;
           only), acceptability of the IMPROVE intervention (intervention facilities only), and&#xD;
           satisfaction with PMTCT/MCH services among both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in&#xD;
           intervention and control facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess HCW, counselor, and VHW attitudes toward the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
           integrating the IMPROVE package in routine services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the IMPROVE intervention on retention in HIV care,&#xD;
           viral suppression and adherence to ART, HIV retesting, and uptake of family planning and&#xD;
           child immunizations at 24 months postpartum in a prospective cohort of&#xD;
           pregnant/postpartum women and their infants compared to a similar cohort of women and&#xD;
           infants receiving routine care without the IMPROVE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HIV-positive women in facilities with IMPROVE versus routine care will have higher&#xD;
           adherence and retention in HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HIV-negative women in facilities receiving the IMPROVE intervention will have an&#xD;
           increase in HIV re-testing in the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in facilities with IMPROVE versus routine care will&#xD;
           show improvement in health seeking behavior, leading to improved maternal and infant&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The IMPROVE intervention is a cost-effective approach to improve health outcomes among&#xD;
           HIV-positive and HIV -negative pregnant/postpartum women and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data gathering activities: The study will be conducted in Maseru district, which is large and&#xD;
      representative of a variety of settings within Lesotho. Maseru has one of the highest HIV&#xD;
      prevalence rates and the lowest PMTCT and MCH indicator coverage rates in Lesotho. Twelve&#xD;
      health facilities serving between 150-900 pregnant women annually from Maseru district were&#xD;
      purposefully selected to reflect a common range of ANC volumes while allowing for timely&#xD;
      recruitment of the sample size of HIV-positive women needed during the enrollment period.&#xD;
      Pregnant women attending their first ANC visit at a study health facility will be eligible&#xD;
      for enrollment in a prospective cohort and followed until 24 months' post-partum. Because the&#xD;
      study intervention begins at the first ANC visit with enhanced counseling and close follow-up&#xD;
      at home within the next week, the study will only enroll women who are attending ANC for&#xD;
      their first visit. The investigators will enroll ~310 HIV-positive and 200 HIV-negative women&#xD;
      in each arm over 10-15 months, for a total of 1020 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent, pregnant women will be enrolled in the study into&#xD;
      either the IMPROVE intervention arm or control arm depending on the facility the woman&#xD;
      attends. At enrollment, women will undergo an interview to collect demographic, pregnancy,&#xD;
      medical and HIV related information. Clinical and laboratory data will be abstracted from&#xD;
      clinic medical records. After the enrollment visit, women/infants will be seen by study staff&#xD;
      for study specific visits during ANC at the next ANC visit after enrollment or sooner if late&#xD;
      in gestation (timing depends on gestational age at first visit), around the time of delivery,&#xD;
      6 and 14 weeks and 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months postpartum. Study visits will be scheduled to&#xD;
      coincide with routine health service visits to the clinic for the mother or child as much as&#xD;
      possible. At each study visit, a participant interview and abstraction of clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data from medical records will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study nurses will be present in each study facility and will be responsible for the&#xD;
      collection and maintenance of study records and data. Informed consent documents, study&#xD;
      screening/enrollment logs, and participant locator forms that include identifiable&#xD;
      information will be completed at enrollment and stored in a locked secure location in the&#xD;
      health facility with access limited to study staff. Multivariate random-effects 2-stage model&#xD;
      (level-1: individual, level-2: cluster) logistic regression will be used to compare&#xD;
      proportional outcomes between intervention and control groups. Time to event outcomes will be&#xD;
      analyzed using survival analysis approaches. An &quot;intent to treat&quot; analysis will be used.&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses will be used for the assessment of the fidelity to the IMPROVE&#xD;
      intervention implementation over time and secondary outcomes that are likely to be infrequent&#xD;
      and thus with limited power to detect differences (such as mortality, HIV infection rates in&#xD;
      children, seroincidence, repeat pregnancies, etc.) The evaluation results will be presented&#xD;
      as either odds ratios or hazard ratios (for the time-to-event analysis), and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits to Participants: There may or may not be direct benefits to study&#xD;
      participants. However, possible benefits to the participants include close monitoring that&#xD;
      may identify problems sooner, screening and referral for depression, additional viral load&#xD;
      monitoring for HIV-positive women, and potential receipt of improved service delivery for&#xD;
      women in IMPROVE intervention facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study poses minimal safety risks to the study participants. The services are being&#xD;
      conducted in the framework of routine MCH services. The intervention addresses mainly service&#xD;
      delivery changes that do not subject study participants to risks outside of what would be&#xD;
      expected within routine services. Potential risks include the potential for unintended&#xD;
      disclosure of mother and infant's HIV status. All efforts will be made to conduct interviews&#xD;
      in private to protect participant confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women enrolled in the IMPROVE study will be identified by their unique study identifier, and&#xD;
      data collection and forms will be linked to the patient using this unique identifier only.&#xD;
      Study participants will not receive any compensation or incentive for participating in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data collection: A subset of women participating in the study (~ 40 in each arm)&#xD;
      will be asked to undergo semi-structured interviews for a total of about 80 semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews. These will include approximately 20 HIV-positive and 20-HIV negative women in&#xD;
      each of the intervention and control arms. Women attending their 18 or 24 month visit during&#xD;
      the time that the qualitative component is underway will be randomly selected to participate&#xD;
      in a semi-structured interview. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) will be used to gather&#xD;
      information about the HCW and VHW/LENASO/M2M experiences, with separate FGD for the two&#xD;
      cadres. Sources of qualitative data will be the open-ended responses from interviews and&#xD;
      FGDs. All qualitative data will be entered into Microsoft Word as data files and analyzed&#xD;
      using MAXqda or another similar qualitative data analysis program. Prior to beginning study&#xD;
      procedures for this component of the study, verbal informed consent will be documented for&#xD;
      all individuals participating in interviews by study staff trained in protocol and ethical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costing data collection: The cost-effectiveness component of the study will measure the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the IMPROVE intervention in achieving positive health outcomes among&#xD;
      pregnant/postpartum women and their infants. The endpoints of the study relevant to the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis are: 1) retention through 24 months postpartum 2) ART adherence&#xD;
      among HIV-positive women, 3) viral load suppression among HIV-positive women 4) rate of HIV&#xD;
      re-testing among HIV-negative women (5) rate of family planning uptake (6) rate of&#xD;
      immunization uptake. These will be among the inputs used to compute Quality of Life Years&#xD;
      (QALYs) gained per woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be measured in terms of incremental cost per QALY gained per HIV-positive&#xD;
      woman, cost per infection averted per HIV-exposed infant, cost per QALY gained per HIV&#xD;
      exposed infant, cost per adult HIV infection averted, cost per birth averted, and cost per&#xD;
      child death averted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be computed using the OneHealth Tool and data compiled from the primary&#xD;
      endpoints. The cost estimation will include a summation of the IMPROVE intervention package&#xD;
      plus the sum of costs incurred by participants (pregnant and postpartum women and infants)&#xD;
      for service provision less any cost savings achieved through (1) productivity losses averted&#xD;
      and (2) costs averted per treatment (or prevention) of disease.&#xD;
