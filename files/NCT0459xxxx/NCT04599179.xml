  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 20% of patients with gastric cancer have at presentation a stage IV disease.&#xD;
      Advanced adenocarcinoma of the antro-pyloric region often determines a condition of gastric&#xD;
      outlet obstruction syndrome (GOOS), which requires a rapid resolution for the severe&#xD;
      consequences that will occur if the obstruction is not resolved. GOOS causes malnutrition,&#xD;
      fluid and electrolyte imbalances that are difficult to control. Laparoscopic or open&#xD;
      gastroenterostomy has been proposed as the treatment of choice in patients with advanced&#xD;
      unresectable distal stomach tumor presenting with symptoms of GOOS. Noticeably, laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastroenterostomy might be difficult to be performed in a hostile abdomen because of the&#xD;
      involvement of the root of the mesentery, infiltration of the surrounding structures and&#xD;
      peritoneal carcinosis. Furthermore, laparoscopic or open gastroenterostomy provides&#xD;
      suboptimal palliation, because it is associated with postoperative complications ranging from&#xD;
      15% to 50% related to a delayed gastric emptying and a protract postoperative hospital stay.&#xD;
      These results negatively affect the quality of life (QoL), and therefore, the efficacy of&#xD;
      gastroenterostomy for palliation has been questioned. In 1997, Kaminishi et al. introduced a&#xD;
      technique of stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy (SPGJ), which divides the lower part of&#xD;
      the stomach and connects the jejunum to the proximal part of the stomach while maintaining a&#xD;
      tunnel that is 2 to 3 cm in diameter along the lesser curvature. This technique theoretically&#xD;
      provides some benefits: endoscopic evaluation of the tumor response to adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      and the possibility of repeated endoscopic local treatment on the tumor, prevention of&#xD;
      ingested food retention in the distal part of the stomach thus facilitating gastric emptying&#xD;
      and improving patient's QoL. A current alternative to laparoscopic or open surgical approach&#xD;
      to an advanced gastric tumor is the positioning of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) which&#xD;
      offers many potential advantages: the avoidance of general anaesthesia for a laparoscopic or&#xD;
      open approach, a shorter hospital stay and a minor patient postoperative discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to perform a prospective longitudinal cohort trial, comparing the QoL of patients&#xD;
      affected with stage IV antropyloric stomach cancer and symptoms of GOOS who underwent&#xD;
      endoscopic placement of a SEMS or after open SPGJ.&#xD;
