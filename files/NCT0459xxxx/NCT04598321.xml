  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecologic cancer; in the US alone an estimated 22,000&#xD;
      women will be diagnosed in 2019, with over 13,000 dying of the disease. Approximately half of&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) exhibit defective DNA repair through alterations in the&#xD;
      homologous recombination (HR) pathway, with 14% accounted for by germline mutations in BRCA&#xD;
      genes (mBRCA); this goes up to about one in five (20%) women when one includes&#xD;
      tumor-associated (somatic) mBRCA.The approach to women with mBRCA-associated ovarian cancer&#xD;
      has heralded precision treatment in our field with the availability of PARP inhibitors. Now&#xD;
      indicated as treatment for women with documented mBRCA (genomic or somatic), it also has&#xD;
      shown significant benefits for women with recurrent EOC who respond to platinum-based therapy&#xD;
      when administered as maintenance treatment.&#xD;

Volunteers will continue treatment to complete three cycles, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.Volunteers who complete neoadjuvant treatment with talazoparib should undergo surgical cytoreduction within three weeks of their last dose of talazoparib. All volunteers should then undergo standard of care adjuvant therapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel. For volunteers, who agree to continue talazoparib as maintenance therapy, treatment should begin three weeks (+/- 2 weeks) from the end of adjuvant chemotherapy or after cytoreductive surgery alone.</description>
