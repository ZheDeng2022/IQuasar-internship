  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to systematically characterize the clinical course of the&#xD;
      progressive neuropathy and optic atrophy observe in pediatric and adult patients with&#xD;
      biallelic mutations in the solute carrier family 25 member 46 (SLC25A46) gene.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of mitochondria in the cell is dynamic and is regulated by two opposite processes,&#xD;
      namely fission and fusion. Proteins in both the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and the&#xD;
      outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) are involved in mediating these two processes, including&#xD;
      OPA1, MFN2 and SLC25A46. Recent work by the investigators as well as other research groups&#xD;
      has shown that mutations in SLC25A46 cause abnormal mitochondrial fusion, leading to optic&#xD;
      nerve atrophy, axonal peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar degeneration by interfering with&#xD;
      mitochondrial fission. Recently, the investigators have used CRISPR genome editing to&#xD;
      generate a global Slc25a46 KO mouse model with complete loss of SLC25A46 in all tissues&#xD;
      (PMID: 28934388). Similar to patients with biallelic mutations in SLC25A46, these mice&#xD;
      exhibit severe ataxia, optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy related to axonal degeneration,&#xD;
      and demyelination due to mitochondrial hyperfusion and defective energy production. In these&#xD;
      mice, histological staining revealed a hypotrophic cerebellum with a severe loss of Purkinje&#xD;
      cells (PCs) and/or stunted PC dendrites while electron microscopy revealed enlarged&#xD;
      mitochondria with swollen cristae and other abnormal morphologies in PC dendrites and sciatic&#xD;
      nerves. Furthermore, in primary culture, PCs from these mice exhibited abnormal mitochondrial&#xD;
      distribution and movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings provide compelling evidence indicating that SLC25A46 plays an important role&#xD;
      in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics-including fusion/fission, distribution, and&#xD;
      movement, as well as the maintenance of cristae architecture-and that loss of SLC25A46&#xD;
      function has a particularly severe effect on a distinct subset of neuron types with long&#xD;
      axonal processes. More recently, the investigators have shown that AAV-based gene therapy can&#xD;
      produce dramatic improvements in their Slc25a46 mutant mouse model (PMID: 31943007). These&#xD;
      studies in the Slc25a46 mouse model provide the foundation for uncovering the mechanism&#xD;
      whereby these this gene causes disease in humans, as well as lay the groundwork for the&#xD;
      possible use of gene therapy to ameliorate the disease phenotype in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite this progress, there remains only a handful of studies published on Slc25a46&#xD;
      and the consequences of loss of Slc25a46 function in humans. Given that human&#xD;
      SLC25A46-associated phenotypes overlap substantially with DOA and CMT2A, further study of&#xD;
      this rare condition presents an opportunity not only to better understand and treat&#xD;
      SLC25A46-related disease, but also to elucidate the broader mechanistic link between&#xD;
      neurodegeneration and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, in order to better understand&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations of SLC25A46-related disease and to help lay the groundwork for&#xD;
      eventual clinical trials of gene therapy or drug-based treatments, the investigators propose&#xD;
      this natural history study of pediatric as well as adult patients with biallelic mutations in&#xD;
      the SLC25A46 gene.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>SARA is a clinical scale developed by the Ataxia Study Group that is based on a semiquantitative assessment of cerebellar ataxia on an impairment level. SARA measures the following 8 items, which are used to determine the relative severity of the ataxia phenotype: gait, stance, sitting, speech, finger-chase test, nose-finger test, fast alternating movements and heel-shin test. Each item is rated on a numerical scale (as indicated below), with &quot;0&quot; indicating a normal phenotype and higher scores indicating worse outcomes:</description>

    <measure>Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>INAS is an instrument developed by the Ataxia Study Group to provide structured information on non-ataxia signs in ataxia patients. INAS consists of 30 items, each of which is related to one of the following 16 signs or syndromes: areflexia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, spasticity, paresis, amyotrophy, fasciculations, myoclonus, rigidity, chorea, dystonia, resting tremor, sensory symptoms, brainstem oculomotor signs (horizontal and vertical ophthalmoparesis, slowing of saccades), urinary dysfunction and cognitive impairment. For a semiquantitative assessement of non-ataxia signs, the number of non-ataxia signs is counted, yielding the INAS count, a dimensionless value with a range from 0 to 16. A sign is recorded as present if at least one item related to this sign is positive.</description>
