    <textblock>
      A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the GBS-NN/NN2 (Recombinant protein vaccine against Group B Streptococcus)&#xD;
      vaccine in women living with HIV and women without HIV,and their newborn babies from&#xD;
      vaccination up to delivery/birth. Mothers and babies will be followed up for 6 months&#xD;
      post-delivery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      75 women who are pregnant and living with HIV will randomly receive two 0.5 mL (millilitre)&#xD;
      intramuscular injections of GBS-NN/NN2 vaccine (60 women) or placebo (15 women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      75 women who are pregnant and do not have HIV will randomly receive two 0.5 mL intramuscular&#xD;
      injections of GBS-NN/NN2 vaccine (60 women) or placebo (15 women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened at 24 to 28 weeks gestation (Days -14 to Day -1) and the groups&#xD;
      will be dosed in parallel. The first dose of vaccine or placebo will be administered at Day 0&#xD;
      and the second dose will be administered 28±2 days later. Delivery is anticipated to be&#xD;
      approximately 10 to 14 weeks after the first dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the immune response, the placebo groups will be combined. For safety, the&#xD;
      placebo groups will be analysed separately and will be combined for comparison with the&#xD;
      potential vaccine groups.&#xD;
