  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a smartphone app that guides pediatric patients and their&#xD;
      families through colonoscopy prep in an attempt to see if an app could improve the&#xD;
      colonoscopy process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators created a smartphone app designed for pediatric patients and their families&#xD;
      that informs patients about their colonoscopy procedure, alerts them when to take their&#xD;
      medications throughout the hours-long colonoscopy prep process and tells them when to arrive&#xD;
      to the endoscopy suite. The investigators designed a study to determine if this app will&#xD;
      yield improved colonoscopy cleanouts, better patient understanding of the procedure, fewer&#xD;
      calls to the GI service and more punctual arrival times to the endoscopy suite compared to&#xD;
      patients who receive written instructions that do not actively interact with the patient&#xD;
      before, during or after their colonoscopy prep.&#xD;

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subjects were randomly assigned via block randomization to receive either written or software-based prep instructions. To eliminate bias, the four grading gastroenterologists who judged the quality of the subject's cleanout did not know whether subjects had used written or app instructions.</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smartphone application use was associated with increased number of &quot;excellent&quot; colonoscopy preps.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each subject was assessed from the time they were scheduled for their colonoscopy to the day of their procedure, up to three months for subjects. Subjects were scored on their colonoscopies immediately following the procedure once the patient was stable</time_frame>
    <description>Prep quality was measured with the validated Boston Scoring Scale. A score of 0, 1, 2 or 3 is given to the right, transverse and left colon based on the amount and consistency of stool visualized as well as the ease or difficulty of guiding endoscopic instrumentation during a colonoscopy. Higher scores indicate a cleaner colon and as per Lai, a Boston Score of 7 or above indicates an &quot;excellent&quot; prep. To eliminate bias, the four grading gastroenterologists did not know whether subjects had used written or app instructions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in the number of calls to the gastroenterology service between app users and controls.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each subject was assessed from the time they were scheduled for their colonoscopy to the day of their procedure, up to three months for subjects</time_frame>
    <description>Calls to the GI service were recorded by the GI staff.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference between app users and controls regarding patient arrival time.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each subject was assessed from the time they were scheduled for their colonoscopy to the day of their procedure, up to three months for subjects</time_frame>
    <description>Patient arrival time was taken from the patients arrival time in the endoscopy suite.</description>

    <time_frame>Each subject was assessed from the time they were scheduled for their colonoscopy to the day of their procedure, up to three months for subjects</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire with validated questions determined whether subjects improvement their knowledge before and after receiving colonoscopy information.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Users who were assigned to use a smartphone app downloaded a free app from the iOS App or Google Play stores titled &quot;SB Colonoscopy Prep.&quot; The app informed subjects about their colonoscopy procedure, alerts them when to take their medications throughout the hours-long colonoscopy prep process and tells them when to arrive to the endoscopy suite.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control group were given a three-page document that described the procedure and instructed users on how to take the preparation medications. The written instructions had a list of frequently asked questions about colonoscopies and the URL of a website where users could view the animated video that was included in the app. The written instructions also contained the time and date of the procedure. All subjects were instructed to arrive one hour before their scheduled procedure.</description>
