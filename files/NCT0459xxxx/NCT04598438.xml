  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current pilot randomized control trial (RCT) examines whether active music participation&#xD;
      enhances the encoding of speech in the neural auditory system which in turn leads to better&#xD;
      language development in infants and toddlers. Healthy children will be randomized into either&#xD;
      the music intervention treatment group or the arts and crafts active control group. Before&#xD;
      and after treatment period, neural speech encoding and language and communication skills will&#xD;
      be assessed. It is hypothesized that music intervention leads to enhanced neural speech&#xD;
      encoding and language development compared to arts and crafts active control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auditory encoding enables accurate representation of incoming speech signals, and can be&#xD;
      measured by neural phase-locking to the frequencies of the speech stimulus via the frequency&#xD;
      following response (FFR) (e.g., Wong et al., 2007). FFR measures are associated with a range&#xD;
      of language processes including speech (Thompson et al., 2019) and literacy (White-Schwoch et&#xD;
      al., 2015). Music intervention can lead to an enhanced FFR and auditory encoding in older&#xD;
      children with poor language ability (e.g., Kraus et al., 2014). We therefore hypothesize that&#xD;
      music intervention prescribed to young children (infants and toddlers) can also enhance FFR&#xD;
      which will in turn enhance language and communication skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Cantonese-learning children between 8 to 12 months of age and their caregivers&#xD;
      will participate in this research. All should report to be born healthy with gestational age&#xD;
      of at least 37 weeks and birth weight of at least 2500g. We will enroll 48 children who will&#xD;
      be randomized into the treatment or active control group (50% in each group) via blocked&#xD;
      randomized (The Concise Encyclopedia of Statistics, 2008). Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from each family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Procedures: Within 2 weeks before and after treatment, children and families will&#xD;
      undergo assessment (see outcome measures). Treatment will last for 10 weeks in a hybrid&#xD;
      online and in-person delivery mode (see treatment procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Infants will undergo EEG testing using an EEG system to elicit two types of&#xD;
      responses, each lasting up to 10 minutes: 1) auditory encoding while they listen to auditory&#xD;
      stimuli (e.g., Wong et al., 2007) and 2) resting-state EEG (e.g., Wilkinson et al., 2020). We&#xD;
      will follow published procedures to derive neurophysiological metrics from the FFR signals&#xD;
      such as pitch strength for speech encoding, and EEG spectral power analysis for amplitude of&#xD;
      frequency bands at rest. The entire protocol will last under 30 min. Behavioral measures will&#xD;
      include the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MCDI)-Cantonese version&#xD;
      (Tardif &amp; Fletcher, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Procedures: Both treatment (music) and active control (arts and crafts) groups will&#xD;
      consist of 10 weeks of training to take place online and in-person, led by a trained&#xD;
      instructor. In addition, home practice will be assigned. Both will consist of a set of&#xD;
      prescribed activities and materials and songs (for music treatment). For music, parents will&#xD;
      be taught to use songs to implement activities to promote the child's auditory skills. For&#xD;
      arts and crafts, a series of activities will promote visual perception (color, shape) and&#xD;
      motor skills and encourage art making. A teach-model-coach-review approach (Roberts et al.,&#xD;
      2014) will be implemented, with an important goal of teaching parents to implement the play&#xD;
      sessions at home. Each family is required to complete a set of prescribed home practice&#xD;
      activities and provide evidence of completion. These home activities will allow them to&#xD;
      implement what they learn in the child's natural home environment and will encourage them to&#xD;
      continue the activities they learn even after the completion of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: For each outcome measure, we will conduct a group x time ANOVA and expect a&#xD;
      significant interaction. Posthoc analysis will reveal a larger, positive change in outcome&#xD;
      measures for the treatment group relative to the control group.&#xD;

    <description>At each visit to the lab, caregivers and children may be asked to engage in several age-appropriate tasks, during which they may be videotaped. Specifically, there will be semi-structured free play time (i.e. Symbolic and Non-symbolic play), book reading and sharing, and cognitive tasks (e.g., solving puzzles) etc. A parental questionnaire will be used to obtain paternal, maternal, and caregiver socio-demographic data, their health and family history, parenting style, and other relevant information about the caregivers.</description>
