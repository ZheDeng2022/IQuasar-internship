  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the side effects of PIpepTolDC vaccine in treating patients&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes who use insulin and don't have any other diabetes-related health&#xD;
      complications. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means that the immune system,&#xD;
      which usually protects against foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, attacks the body's&#xD;
      insulin-producing betacells in the pancreas (autoimmune response). Overtime, the beta cells&#xD;
      are destroyed by the immune system. To stay alive, people with type 1 diabetes must use&#xD;
      insulin. PIpepTolDC vaccine is a type of immunotherapy (a treatment that uses a person's own&#xD;
      immune system) that works like an allergy shot. The vaccine is made using one's own immune&#xD;
      cells (dendritic cells) and a beta cell protein. The vaccine may teach the immune system to&#xD;
      stop attacking the beta cells, which may help the beta cells recover and make enough insulin&#xD;
      to control blood sugar levels. The vaccine may also help reduce future type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      related complications.&#xD;
