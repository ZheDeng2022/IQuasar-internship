      Background: Our hypothesis was that bilateral ESP block applied from the transverse process&#xD;
      of T9 in women who underwent elective cesarean section with pfannenstiel incision under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia could provide effective postoperative analgesia.The primary outcome in this&#xD;
      study was total opioid consumption for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Method: This randomized prospective study was carried out on 50 pregnant women&#xD;
      who was scheduled for elective cesarean delivery via a Pfannenstiel incision with spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia.Patients were randomly allocated in to two equal groups.Group SA was categorized&#xD;
      as the group which spinal anaesthesia alone (SA) was performed, Group SA+ESP was categorized&#xD;
      as group which SA+ESP block was performed. All groups received 7 mg isobaric bupivacaine +15&#xD;
      µg fentanyl intrathecally through spinal anesthesia. The SA+ESP group, ESP block was&#xD;
      performed at the ninth thoracic transverse process with 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine + 2 mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone immediately after the operation. Total fentanyl consumption in 24 hrs, visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) score for pain, time to the first analgesic request were evaluated&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
