  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to improve medication, symptom, and disease management of&#xD;
      patients with hematological malignancies and multiple chronic conditions (2 or more&#xD;
      conditions in addition to cancer) through care coordination between pharmacists working in&#xD;
      oncology practices and those working in primary care practices (Pharmacists Coordinated care&#xD;
      Oncology Model [PCOM]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study in which the investigators will examine the association between outcome&#xD;
      measures, but the study design and sample size are insufficient to quantify the impact of OAA&#xD;
      initiation or OAA adherence on adherence to chronic medications. This pilot study and data&#xD;
      analyses are being done in preparation for a larger, controlled study.&#xD;

    <measure>Dose-adjusted proportion of days covered (PDC) for oral anti-cancer agent (OAA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months following OAA initiation</time_frame>
    <description>PDC is a common way to assess a patient's adherence to a medication regimen. PDC is the ratio of number of days the patient is supplied with OAA medication, from the time of OAA initiation until 6 months later, to the total number of days during that period. For OAAs, data from the electronic medical record (EMR) for dose changes will be aligned with the refill data to calculate a dose-adjusted PDC.</description>

    <measure>PDC for chronic condition medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months following OAA initiation</time_frame>
    <description>PDC is the ratio of the number of days the patient is supplied with chronic condition medications, from the time of OAA initiation until 6 months later, to the total number of days during that period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of patients with two completed Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 42 (+/-3) after OAA initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium (MOQC) OAA PROM, Patient Assessment Tool for Oral Chemotherapy is to be completed at 2 and 6 weeks after OAA initiation. This measure assesses the percent of patients who complete this PROM at both time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of patients with completed Comprehensive Medication Reviews (CMRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 50 (+/-3) after OAA initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Completed CMR includes initial and follow-up CMR with primary care pharmacist.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of patients with scheduled Comprehensive Medication Review (CMR) within one week of first PROM result</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22 (+/-3) after OAA initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The PROM is scored within one day after it is completed by the patient. The primary care pharmacist sets a date and time for the initial CMR after receiving the first scored PROM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of patients where oncology pharmacist reviewed PROM within 1 day of receiving scored PROM</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 44 (+/-3) after OAA initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The PROM is scored within one day after it is completed by the patient and is routed to the oncology pharmacist to review the results. The number of PROMs that are reviewed within 1 day of receipt will be assessed at 2 weeks and at 6 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of CMRs where note was routed to oncology pharmacist</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 43 (+/-3) after OAA initiation</time_frame>
