  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of Visudyne (liposomal&#xD;
      verteporfin) and to see how well it works in treating patients with high grade EGFR-mutated&#xD;
      glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visudyne is FDA approved in combination with light to treat eye diseases. In this study we&#xD;
      use Visudyne by itself like chemotherapy to kill tumor cells which may be sensitive to&#xD;
      verteporfin.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of successively higher doses of verteporfin&#xD;
      (Visudyne [liposomal verteporfin]) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in study&#xD;
      participants with recurrent EGFR positive (+) glioblastoma (GBM). (Phase I) II. To evaluate&#xD;
      the anti-tumor activity of Visudyne by assessing progression-free survival (PFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS). (Phase II) III. To describe the response rate of EGFR+ GBM in study&#xD;
      participants treated with Visudyne. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of Visudyne by assessing progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase I) II. To describe the response rate of EGFR+ GBM in&#xD;
      study participants treated with Visudyne. (Phase I) III. To describe pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      Visudyne administered on a weekly schedule. (Phase I) IV. To evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of successively higher doses of Visudyne in study participants with recurrent&#xD;
      EGFR+ GBM. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive verteporfin intravenously (IV) over 83 minutes weekly for 6 weeks in cycle&#xD;
      1, then weekly for 5 weeks in subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 6 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with recurrent or progressive grade 4 glioma (glioblastoma) are eligible for&#xD;
             this study. Participants should have received standard first line therapy including&#xD;
             radiation and temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants have tumors that show mutant or amplified EGFR. This&#xD;
             determination can be made using standard of care mutation analysis panels (e.g.&#xD;
             Snapshot). It is often assessed at diagnosis as part of standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants must have evidence on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of&#xD;
             progression. This may be as new or increased enhancement, or growth / increase in&#xD;
             nonenhancing abnormality. Care should be taken to distinguish those with true&#xD;
             progression from those with radiation related changes. Persons with changes in&#xD;
             enhancement possibly due in part or in whole to late radiation effect should receive&#xD;
             bevacizumab as standard of care, and defer study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may be receiving bevacizumab, and show progression while on bevacizumab.&#xD;
             These participants may continue bevacizumab while on study. Persons not on bevacizumab&#xD;
             but who would benefit from the anti-edema effect of bevacizumab should not enroll on&#xD;
             this study but should proceed with bevacizumab alone, and defer enrollment until such&#xD;
             time as they progress&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visudyne is a vesicant. Participants will likely have poor veins, and will require&#xD;
             repeated intravenous treatments. Participants must be willing to have placed a central&#xD;
             venous access, such as a portacath&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-3. Participants&#xD;
             who are ECOG 2 or 3 should ideally have been in that situation for some time, and not&#xD;
             be in the midst of rapid clinical decline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical comorbidities (excepting neurological) must be grade 2 or less if graded as&#xD;
             toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants may have grade 3 neurologic comorbidities (for example aphasia,&#xD;
             ataxia) arising as a consequence of brain pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should be reasonably expected to be able to complete 6 weeks (1 cycle) of&#xD;
             treatment on study before death or worsening of PS to 4 or 5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other anti-cancer medical treatments. Treatments in this category include chemotherapy&#xD;
             and non-bevacizumab therapies. 7 days must have elapsed since discontinuation of prior&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic treatments for glioma and study treatment. Participants may have had&#xD;
             any number of prior treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants on this study must have had prior radiation to the brain. Radiation&#xD;
             must have been completed 90 days prior to first study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  21 days must have elapsed since prior major surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants already using a Novo-tumor treating fields therapy (TTF) (Optune) device&#xD;
             and who wish to continue may do so&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must sign a written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of study drugs used in this study on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason, female of child-bearing potential (FCBP) must have a&#xD;
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FCBP and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of&#xD;
             birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation and 8 weeks after. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature woman&#xD;
             who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been&#xD;
             naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at&#xD;
             any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons who are deemed to have progression on clinical grounds only (new symptoms,&#xD;
             declining PS) are ineligible. In the absence of MRI change one cannot be confident&#xD;
             that clinical deterioration is a direct result of tumor progression, and could be due&#xD;
             to intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with edema which might be due to late radiation effect, not true progression,&#xD;
             should receive bevacizumab as standard of care, and defer study participation. If&#xD;
             (short-term) followup imaging shows reduction of edema and also progression of tumor,&#xD;
             these persons are eligible (and should continue bevacizumab)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not have any baseline comorbidities or laboratory abnormalities which&#xD;
             would be of grade 3 or worse if graded as toxicities by Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
             for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (excepting alopecia). An exception is made for neurologic&#xD;
             comorbidities (e.g. ataxia, aphasia) arising as a consequence of the brain tumor;&#xD;
             symptoms severe enough to warrant medical treatment as is offered on this study are by&#xD;
             definition grade III&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Illness or any other circumstances (as defined by the investigator), which would&#xD;
             preclude safe performance of study procedures or compromise the ability of the patient&#xD;
             to consent to study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with hereditary porphyria are ineligible&#xD;
