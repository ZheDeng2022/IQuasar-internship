    <textblock>
      Background- Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common indication for major surgery&#xD;
      in adolescents. The current standard of care for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with a&#xD;
      curve magnitude of over 40-50˚ in skeletally immature patients, is posterior spinal fusion&#xD;
      with pedicle screws. Vertebral body tethering using screws connected by a tether in the&#xD;
      anterior vertebral body, has the potential to initially correct the still flexible deformity,&#xD;
      but most importantly modulate growth and ultimately result in scoliosis correction with a&#xD;
      mobile spine. A high-quality comparative prospective study is missing to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of vertebral body tethering compared to posterior spinal fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design- An international, randomized clinical trial on posterior spinal fusion with&#xD;
      pedicle screws vs. Anterior vertebral body tethering in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims- To demonstrate non-inferiority of VBT compared to posterior fusion in terms of main&#xD;
      curve correction of AIS at the 2 year follow up, to demonstrate comparable outcomes for&#xD;
      SRS-22/24 at the 2 year follow up. Aim is also to compare complication and revision rates and&#xD;
      to compare spinal mobility including flexion and side bending between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria- Lenke type I A,B or C, age 10-16 years, skeletally immature, Cobb angle&#xD;
      40-60˚, 50% flexibility on supine bending films, selective thoracic fusion feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria- Any other than idiopathic scoliosis, less than 50% curve flexibility,&#xD;
      skeletal maturity, patients who have evidence of neurological disorders, patients who have&#xD;
      undergone intrathoracic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parametres- Cobb angle correction of instrumented curve at 2 year follow up, total&#xD;
      score of SRS questionnaire at 2 year follow up; secondary outcomes: Complication and revision&#xD;
      rates, pulmonary function at 2-year follow-up, spinal mobility at 2-year follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects- Each institution in each country is responsible for obtaining either&#xD;
      institutional review board approval or approval from a national ethics committee as&#xD;
      appropriate. An informed consent will be obtained from all children and their parents.&#xD;

      Background- Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common indication for major surgery&#xD;
      in adolescents (between 10 and 18 years of age). The current standard of care for adolescent&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with a curve magnitude of over 40-50˚ in skeletally immature&#xD;
      patients, is posterior spinal fusion with pedicle screws. The aim of spinal fusion is to&#xD;
      prevent further curve progression but also to correct the spinal deformity and achieve a&#xD;
      cosmetically pleasing result by reducing the rib hump and balancing the trunk and shoulders.&#xD;
      While this procedure has been very successful, it has inherent downsides such as the&#xD;
      decreased range of motion and loss of spinal mobility in addition to the inhibition of growth&#xD;
      along the instrumentation. To prevent distal adding on (continued curve below&#xD;
      instrumentation) due to continued anterior spinal growth, it is often necessary to fuse the&#xD;
      spine into stable vertebra resulting into even longer spinal fusion levels in the lumbar&#xD;
      spine (Sponseller et al. JPO 2016; Oksanen et al. SJS 2018). Spinal fusion increases loading&#xD;
      of the remaining mobile segments (Parsch et al. JBJS Br 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a five-year follow-up study spinal fusion resulted into better health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL) as compared with untreated AIS (Helenius et al. JBJS 2019). However, the&#xD;
      function domain of HRQoL was significantly less after spinal fusion as compared with healthy&#xD;
      controls. In contrast, vertebral body tethering using screws connected by a tether in the&#xD;
      anterior vertebral body, has the potential to initially correct the still flexible deformity,&#xD;
      but most importantly modulate growth and ultimately result in scoliosis correction with a&#xD;
      mobile spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently a paucity of literature on the effectiveness of vertebral body tethering&#xD;
      (VBT) with only retrospective case series published and reported in conference proceedings,&#xD;
      and a comparative study is completely lacking. Initial complication rates with the implants&#xD;
      for tethering have also sparked caution amongst surgeons and payers whether or not to adopt&#xD;
      this technique despite its theoretical advantages. Thus, a high-quality comparative&#xD;
      prospective study is missing to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of vertebral body&#xD;
      tethering compared to posterior spinal fusion. If this can be shown in a well-designed study,&#xD;
      it is likely to result in a paradigm shift in the treatment of AIS similar to the impact&#xD;
      earlier technical novelties and achievements had.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised controlled trials are rare in paediatric orthopaedic research. It would be&#xD;
      unprecedented that evidence from an RCT is driving a change in practice in scoliosis surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypothesis- To compare posterior fusion to VBT for the treatment of AIS. Aim is to&#xD;
      demonstrate non-inferiority of VBT compared to posterior fusion in terms of main curve&#xD;
      correction of AIS at the 2 year follow up, to demonstrate comparable outcomes for SRS-22/24&#xD;
      at the 2 year follow up. Aim is also to compare complication and revision rates and to&#xD;
      compare spinal mobility including flexion and side bending between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria- The inclusion criteria would aim to restrict the study to paediatric&#xD;
      patients with AIS and the following criteria: Lenke type I A,B or C, age 10-16 years,&#xD;
      skeletally immature (Sanders classification between 2 and 5), Cobb angle 40-60˚, 50%&#xD;
      flexibility on supine bending films, selective thoracic fusion feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria- Any other than idiopathic scoliosis, less than 50% curve flexibility,&#xD;
      skeletal maturity (Sanders &gt;5), patients who have evidence of neurological disorders,&#xD;
      patients who have undergone intrathoracic surgery Outcome parametres- Cobb angle correction&#xD;
      of instrumented curve at 2 year follow up, total score of SRS questionnaire at 2 year follow&#xD;
      up; secondary outcomes: Complication and revision rates, pulmonary function at 2-year&#xD;
      follow-up, spinal mobility at 2-year follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: AVBT from end to end vertebra. PSF levels using the Lenke criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects- Each institution in each country is responsible for obtaining either&#xD;
      institutional review board approval or approval from a national ethics committee as&#xD;
      appropriate. An informed consent will be obtained from all children and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule and budget- The study will be started on beginning of 2021. Patient enrollment&#xD;
      is expected to last to the end of 2023. There will be no extra costs as all information&#xD;
      gathered will be part of normal surgical treatment of AIS. A part-time research nurse has&#xD;
      been hired to take care of data collection into the database.&#xD;
