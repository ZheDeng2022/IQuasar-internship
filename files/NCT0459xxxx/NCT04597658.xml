    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise on body&#xD;
      weight-supported treadmill in stroke patients on gait parameters, activity, body functions&#xD;
      and quality of life, and to determine whether it has an effect on balance when applied in&#xD;
      addition to conventional therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned as an open, prospective, randomized, single-blind study, and it was&#xD;
      planned by the researchers to include 30 patients with stroke who applied to the Neurology&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of&#xD;
      Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation. It was planned that the &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot; prepared&#xD;
      before the study would be signed by the patient before being included in the study, and&#xD;
      patient evaluation and follow-up forms would be filled in before and after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria at the beginning of the study will be numbered&#xD;
      according to the order of application and randomly divided into two groups with the computer&#xD;
      program. Group number 1 Treadmill with Weight Support; Group number 2 will be determined as&#xD;
      the Conventional Rehabilitation group. In addition to the traditional rehabilitation program&#xD;
      and rehabilitation program to both groups, one group will be given body weight support and&#xD;
      treadmill therapy. The treatment will be applied as 15 sessions 5 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A traditional rehabilitation program will be applied to both groups. Posture and breathing&#xD;
      exercises, lower extremity stretching, active auxiliary range of motion, and strengthening&#xD;
      exercises will be applied. Electrical stimulation will not be delivered to the lower limb.&#xD;
      Balance coordination exercises - sitting in a chair (individually shaped according to the&#xD;
      patient's balance), holding it in a safe place if necessary; standing without support,&#xD;
      standing quietly, heel tip, standing on one leg, and holding onto a chair). Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to walk on a smooth surface in the company with a physiotherapist, using an assistive&#xD;
      device, if any. The rehabilitation program is planned to last 30 minutes in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group where the bodyweight supported treadmill will be applied, patients will be asked&#xD;
      to walk on the treadmill as fast as possible without exceeding the medium intensity according&#xD;
      to the Borg scale. - Perceived fatigue on the Borg scale is quite mild 10-12. (40-50% of the&#xD;
      maximum heart rate). Care should be taken that the patient wears appropriate shoes and&#xD;
      clothing during walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the beginning, 30% of the whole body weight will not be loaded. Bodyweight support will be&#xD;
      reduced to 15% according to the tolerance of the patient. Later, when the patients can&#xD;
      tolerate the speed of 2km / hour, they will not take more than two breaks during the&#xD;
      30-minute session, and 0% support will be applied when they are able to perform optimal&#xD;
      walking without the need for at least 5 minutes of surveillance support. In the treatment to&#xD;
      be performed under the guidance of a physiotherapist, manual intervention to the pelvis,&#xD;
      trunk, and/or paretic extremity will correct the gait pattern. At the same time, verbal&#xD;
      stimulation will ensure that temporal characteristics of the gait such as step length and&#xD;
      walking speed are appropriate and at the same time the patient is motivated.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before intervention), immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti Assessment Tool is a simple, easily administered test that measures a resident's gait and balance. The test is scored on the resident's ability to perform specific tasks. Scoring of the Tinetti Assessment Tool is done on a three point ordinal scale with a range of 0 to 2. A score of 0 represents the most impairment, while a score of 2 represents independence. The individual scores are then combined to form three measures; an overall gait assessment score, and overall balance assessment score, ad a combined gait and balance score. The maximum score for the gait component is 12 points. The maximum score for the balance component is 16 points. The maximum total score is 28 points. IN general, residents who score below 19 are at a high risk for falls. Residents who score in the range of 19 - 24 points indicate that the resident has a risk for falls.</description>

    <measure>Change in Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before intervention), immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale is one of the most comprehensive scales which measures quality of life in patients with stroke. It consists of 49 questions (each question is scored on a five points scale, 1-5) covering 12 domains (mobility, upper limb functions, social role, energy, self-care, family role, work-productivity, language, mood, personality, thinking, and vision). Each domain score is calculated by taking the unweighted means of associated questions while the unweighted mean of all the domains is used to calculate the total score.</description>
