  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality data are important in low and middle-income countries to assess the population&#xD;
      health status and trends. Mortality statistics in the populations of Bangladesh, Myanmar and&#xD;
      Lao PDR are considered as generally limited and a recent assessment of vital registration&#xD;
      systems of those countries reported a poor performance of the death registration system.&#xD;
      Majority of deaths occur at home in rural area of those countries without cause of death&#xD;
      assigned. To address this problem, the investigators will use verbal autopsy (VA) method&#xD;
      developed by WHO to ascertain the cause of a death based on an interview with a family member&#xD;
      or caregiver of deceased person to obtain information about causes of death in study rural&#xD;
      communities. Death related to a specific cause will be defined by ICD-10 codes and described&#xD;
      as primary, secondary or underlying COD. The study is planned to conduct in approximately 390&#xD;
      rural village communities covered by Southeast Asia clinical trial network (SEACTN) network&#xD;
      in proposed 3 countries. The study findings will help establish a better understanding in&#xD;
      signs, symptoms, medical history and circumstances preceding death; prioritize future&#xD;
      interventions for early and effective diagnostics and treatment for diseases and how to keep&#xD;
      mortality surveillance ongoing in study rural settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SEACTN (South and Southeast Asian Community-based Trials Network) is a part of a&#xD;
      portfolio of programmes under the Wellcome Innovations Flagship 'Innovations for Impact in&#xD;
      Resource-limited Settings'. The flagship plan is to build the SEACTN infrastructure in&#xD;
      approximately 520 villages across three South and Southeast Asian countries (Bangladesh, Lao&#xD;
      PDR and Myanmar) to capture over 100,000 episodes and outcomes of rural febrile illness in&#xD;
      these remote and underserved communities. Mortality statistics in the populations covered by&#xD;
      SEACTN are considered as generally limited and unreliable and a recent assessment of vital&#xD;
      registration systems of these 3 countries showed a poor performance of the death registration&#xD;
      system. To support the goal of the flagship SEACTN program in defining the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality burden of febrile illness and to strengthen the mortality data (causes of deaths&#xD;
      information) in study areas, the VA component is integrated as a part of project activities.&#xD;
      It will identify not only potential causes of deaths with a history of febrile illnesses, but&#xD;
      also all other CODs which occur in SEACTN network communities. The findings will also uncover&#xD;
      large gaps and challenges that impede delivery of primary health services in rural area of&#xD;
      the countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational multicountry study aims to conduct verbal autopsies in approximately 390&#xD;
      rural village communities in the SEACTN network in 3 countries; Bangladesh (in Cox's Bazar&#xD;
      and Bandarban districts), Lao PDR (in Phalanxay, Phin and Atsaphanthong districts in the&#xD;
      Province of Savannakhet) and Myanmar (in Putao, Machanbaw and Naungmun townships of Northern&#xD;
      Kachin state. The study populations are restricted to varying degrees from accessing adequate&#xD;
      health services due to geographical and financial factors. Since VA interviews will be&#xD;
      carried out for all deaths, the study will be able to point out capacity gaps in providing&#xD;
      essential health services at different levels of the health system as well as barriers in&#xD;
      receiving healthcare services. About 2,000 deaths or VA interviews are expected to be carried&#xD;
      out over a 2-year study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure: The death cases in villages will be notified by village health workers&#xD;
      (VHWs) or community health workers (CHWs) and also be checked through health facilities&#xD;
      records. The study respondent should be a close family member or a caregiver or a person who&#xD;
      closely attended to the deceased during the illness. VA instrument Questionnaires WHO 2016&#xD;
      version of validated electronic VA questionnaires will be used and there are three separate&#xD;
      VA forms for specific age groups: perinatal and neonatal mortality (death of a child under 4&#xD;
      weeks), child mortality (aged 4 weeks to 11 years), adult mortality (aged 12 years and over)&#xD;
      including maternal mortality. VA cause of death list The WHO VA cause of death list is used&#xD;
      to classify disease. The COD list is based on the international classification of diseases&#xD;
      (ICD-10) coding system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training of interviewers will be via online and face to face training sessions. The&#xD;
      training materials from research collaborators (University of Toronto, Canada) will be used&#xD;
      and adapted in local context. There will also be web based intensive courses for physicians&#xD;
      for coding and CoD certification. A VA needs an optimum recall period for high quality of&#xD;
      information. To keep the recall period as short as possible and to get reliable information,&#xD;
      field team will aim to visit the villages at 3-6 months intervals and conduct interviews with&#xD;
      the respondents of deceased persons to collect the information. The interview will take&#xD;
      approximately 30 to 45 minutes to complete using electronic format of questionnaires&#xD;
      installed in CommCare apps of SEACTN tablets after getting informed consent. Audio recordings&#xD;
      will be done to make sure for accurate records of the interviews and to complete the&#xD;
      narrative text section of the form. The investigators will also record the location of the&#xD;
      villages by GPS in order to define causes of deaths with a map.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quality control of the interview process, 10 percent of interviews will be observed and&#xD;
      checked by field supervisors while conducting interviews. For quality control of coding and,&#xD;
      assessing the COD, two physicians will independently review the outcome of an interview, will&#xD;
      provide coding and formulate a COD. The COD identified by each physician will be recorded in&#xD;
      the database and if there is any disagreement, a third senior physician would be brought in&#xD;
      to adjudicate the result and sought for a solution.&#xD;
