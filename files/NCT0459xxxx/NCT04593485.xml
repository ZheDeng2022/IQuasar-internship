    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm phase II clinical study to exploratory&#xD;
      observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody (Camrelizumab for&#xD;
      Injection) in patients with malignant melanoma of the female genital tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were to have a safety visit 3 days prior to dosing in each treatment cycle after the&#xD;
      study. Imaging was performed every 8 weeks to assess efficacy until radiographic progression,&#xD;
      initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, withdrawal of consent, or subject lost to&#xD;
      follow-up/death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, an end-of-treatment visit and a post-treatment safety visit will&#xD;
      also be performed. After the end of treatment, subjects will also be followed up for survival&#xD;
      (every 3 months for years 1 to 2, every 4 months for years 3, every 6 months for years 4 to&#xD;
      5, and annually from year 6) to collect and record the survival status of subjects and&#xD;
      subsequent anti-tumor treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm phase II clinical study to exploratory&#xD;
      observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody (Camrelizumab for&#xD;
      Injection) in patients with malignant melanoma of the female genital tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were divided into two cohorts according to their conditions: Cohort 1: patients&#xD;
      with postoperative recurrence of malignant melanoma of the female genital tract requiring&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy；Cohort 2: patients with metastatic or unresectable malignant melanoma of the&#xD;
      female genital tract who were screened eligible and received study treatment after being&#xD;
      fully informed and signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camrelizumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg intravenously (iv) on D1 in a&#xD;
      14-day cycle. All subjects will be administered until they reach the end of treatment&#xD;
      standard specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were to have a safety visit 3 days prior to dosing in each treatment cycle after the&#xD;
      study. Imaging was performed every 8 weeks to assess efficacy until radiographic progression,&#xD;
      initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, withdrawal of consent, or subject lost to&#xD;
      follow-up/death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, an end-of-treatment visit and a post-treatment safety visit will&#xD;
      also be performed. Subjects who have concluded the study treatment for reasons other than&#xD;
      disease progression will receive imaging assessment at the end of treatment (if imaging&#xD;
      evaluation is not performed at 4 months) and imaging assessment every 3 months after the end&#xD;
      of treatment to assess the time to disease progression. After the end of treatment, subjects&#xD;
      will also be followed up for survival (every 3 months for years 1 to 2, every 4 months for&#xD;
      years 3, every 6 months for years 4 to 5, and annually from year 6) to collect and record the&#xD;
      survival status of subjects and subsequent anti-tumor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue samples, sections, paraffin blocks or biopsy blocks, and biomarkers, including&#xD;
      but not limited to PD-L1 expression level and the proportion of positive cells, TMB level and&#xD;
      MMR status, will be collected from subjects during the screening period after the most recent&#xD;
      previous treatment.&#xD;
