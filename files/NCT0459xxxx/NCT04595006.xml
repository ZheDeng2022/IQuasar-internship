  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our body fat (adipose tissue) is largely made up of white adipose tissue (WAT) that stores&#xD;
      surplus energy as white fat depots. In addition, adult humans have another type of fat&#xD;
      similar to the brown fat in babies that burns up fat to generate heat for maintenance of body&#xD;
      temperature during cold exposure. Adults have much lesser amounts of such brown adipose&#xD;
      tissue (BAT), most of which are located within the sides of the neck and under the skin above&#xD;
      the collar bones as well as along the sides of the spine. BAT consists of both classical&#xD;
      brown fat identical to that found in babies as well as beige fat (composed of brown-in-white&#xD;
      or 'brite' fat cells) found mainly in adults. Both types of BAT burn fat upon activation by&#xD;
      various stimuli such as cold or by substances like curcumin found in turmeric ginger rhizome&#xD;
      root.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is carried out to find out the effects of cold stimulation and/or a known&#xD;
      BAT-activating nutraceutical among those overweight/obese people suffering from metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 60 participants that are overweight/obese people suffering from&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. The participants will be asked to come to the Clinical Nutrition Research&#xD;
      Centre (CNRC) for a screening session (1st visit) and given plenty of time to read this&#xD;
      information sheet and the opportunity to ask questions. Once the participants are fully&#xD;
      informed regarding the study and all their questions have been satisfactorily answered, the&#xD;
      participants will be given a consent form to complete and sign in the presence of the&#xD;
      researcher. Following this, in order to gauge their suitability for taking part in the study,&#xD;
      an assessment will be carried out. This assessment needs to be carried out in a fasted state&#xD;
      and participants would therefore have to come one morning following an overnight fast. The&#xD;
      screening will include anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurement and blood&#xD;
      sampling. Anthropometric measurements taken will be height, weight, waist circumference and&#xD;
      hip circumference. Body composition will be measured using an electrical impedance analyser&#xD;
      (BIA). Blood pressure will be measured using an automatic blood pressure monitor. The&#xD;
      participants will also undergo a blood sampling from their vein (6 mL or approximately 1.5&#xD;
      teaspoons) to be tested for thyroid function, glucose and lipid profile. Pre-menopausal&#xD;
      females will also undergo a urine pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy prior to participation&#xD;
      at study entry. The participants who have been accepted into the study will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the 3 parallel intervention groups below (20 subjects per group) via an&#xD;
      online randomizer (www.randomizer.org). Randomization means assigning them to one of the&#xD;
      three groups by chance, like tossing a coin or rolling a dice. The 3 parallel intervention&#xD;
      groups (Week 0 to 12) are Group 1 (CS): Cold stimulation using cooling vest x 60 min once&#xD;
      daily over 3 months, Group 2 (BN): Browning nutraceutical (2000mg curcumin) to be taken once&#xD;
      daily over 3 months, Group 3 (CSBN): Cold stimulation using cooling vest x 60 min once daily&#xD;
      and Browning nutraceutical (2000mg curcumin) to be taken once daily over 3 months. The&#xD;
      participants will then be expected to come to the centre for a total of six separate test&#xD;
      sessions, over a span of 6 months (2 test sessions each at week 0, 12 and 24 approximately&#xD;
      +/-2 weeks). For each of the six test sessions,the participants will be required to fast&#xD;
      overnight and avoid caffeine and alcohol for 8-10 hours, only plain water can be consumed&#xD;
      during the fast before reporting at the CNRC in the morning between 8 to 9 am. The&#xD;
      participants are to avoid any physical activity/exercise and alcohol on the day prior to the&#xD;
      visit. The test sessions will be as follows: On the 2nd visit (first test session) at week 0,&#xD;
      the participants will need come to CNRC in the morning and a fasting blood sample (40 mL or&#xD;
      approximately 8 teaspoons) and urine sample will be collected before they undergo metabolic&#xD;
      rate measurement with IRT focusing on their neck and area above the collar bone in a whole&#xD;
      body room calorimeter for the next 45 minutes. The participants will then undergo a mild cold&#xD;
      stimulation of about 14 degree Celsius by wearing a cooling vest for the next 45 minutes, in&#xD;
      which metabolic rate measurement and IRT in the whole body calorimeter will be performed&#xD;
      during this period. Please note that wearing the cooling vest may lead to some shivering, but&#xD;
      it is generally considered safe. Upon exiting the whole body calorimeter, the participants&#xD;
      will remove the cooling vest and then proceed to Clinical Imaging Research Centre (CIRC)&#xD;
      located at the basement level of the same building, where an intravenous indwelling cannula&#xD;
      will be inserted into an arm vein and 20 mL (approximately 4 teaspoons) of blood and another&#xD;
      urine sample will be collected again. The participants will then wear the cooling vest again&#xD;
      for approximately another 60 min and in between they will receive an intravenous injection of&#xD;
      a radioactive labeled glucose called 18-FDG through the intravenous cannula. The cooling vest&#xD;
      will be removed just prior to the start of the PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and MRI/MRS&#xD;
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) that will take place over the&#xD;
      next 1 hour to quantify BAT (Brown Adipose Tissue) and abdominal white fat including liver&#xD;
      and muscle fat. The participants will also need to undergo a body composition evaluation&#xD;
      using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (approximately 20 mins duration) which allows&#xD;
      quantification of fat, lean and bone mass. However, the participants will be given the option&#xD;
      to do the DXA scan on their next/3rd visit according to their preference. After which, the&#xD;
      participants will be free to leave. On the 3rd visit (second test session) at week 0, the&#xD;
      participants will need come to CNRC in the morning for an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements taken will be height, weight, waist circumference and hip&#xD;
      circumference. Body composition will be measured using an electrical impedance analyser&#xD;
      (BIA). Blood pressure will be measured using an automatic blood pressure monitor. A fasting&#xD;
      blood sample (4 mL or less than 1 teaspoon) will be collected and participants will then be&#xD;
      required to consume a glucose drink (75g of glucose) within 5 minutes. Subsequently after 120&#xD;
      min, another blood sample (4 mL or less than 1 teaspoon) will be collected. During the entire&#xD;
      test session, the participants will have to stay rested and in the laboratory. Television and&#xD;
      a workspace will be provided for the participants use if required. At the end of 2 hours of&#xD;
      testing, for participants who have not undergone for the DXA scan on the 2nd visit, they will&#xD;
      then proceed to complete the DXA scan (approximately 20 mins duration). After which,&#xD;
      participants will be free to leave.The above 2 test sessions may be scheduled in any&#xD;
      order,but to be completed no more than 2 weeks apart. The participants will now start the&#xD;
      study intervention procedures as per the intervention group randomly assigned to them for the&#xD;
      next 12 weeks or 3 months. Participants who are assigned to group 1 / cold stimulation (CS),&#xD;
      will be expected to undergo a mild cold stimulation of about 14 degree Celsius by wearing a&#xD;
      cooling vest for approximately an hour daily for the next 12 weeks or 3 months. Participants&#xD;
      who are assigned to group 2 / browning nutraceutical (BN), will be expected to consume 2000mg&#xD;
      of curcumin (in forms of capsules) daily for the next 12 weeks or 3 months. Curcumin is a&#xD;
      naturally-occurring polyphenol antioxidant that is found in turmeric ginger rhizome root and&#xD;
      has been widely known in Asia to have health benefits. Since both substances are commonly&#xD;
      consumed among Asians, it is relevant to study their combined chronic clinical effects on&#xD;
      BAT. Use of curcumin to stimulate BAT is essentially safe as both are naturally occurring&#xD;
      plant derived substances from Curcuma longa rhizome. It is generally recognised as safe for&#xD;
      human consumption. The US FDA has approved curcumin as 'Generally Recognised as Safe' (GRAS)&#xD;
      status and allows these to be taken as foods ingredients. Participants who are assigned to&#xD;
      group 3 / cold stimulation and browning nutraceutical (CSBN), will be expected to undergo a&#xD;
      mild cold stimulation of about 14 degree Celsius by wearing a cooling vest for approximately&#xD;
      an hour and, consume 2000mg of curcumin (in forms of capsules) daily for the next 12 weeks or&#xD;
      3 months. The participants will then be required to come for the 4th visit (third test&#xD;
      session) and 5th visit (fourth test session) at week 12 (after completing the 3 months of&#xD;
      intervention), as per follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 4th visit (third test session) at week 12, participants will repeat the same&#xD;
      procedures as per that of the 2nd visit (first test session). For the 5th visit (fourth test&#xD;
      session) at week 12, participants will need to come to CNRC in the morning in a fasted state&#xD;
      and proceed first to CIRC for a 30 min MRI/ MRS only scan of BAT/WAT to study the fat&#xD;
      composition. Subsequent procedures will be same as that of the 3rd visit (second test&#xD;
      session). After which, there will be no more intervention and participants will continue with&#xD;
      their usual lifestyle and diet for the next 3 months (week 12 to 24).The participants will&#xD;
      lastly be required to come for the 6th visit (fifth test session) and 7th visit (sixth test&#xD;
      session) at week 24 (6 months from start of study), and repeat the same procedures as per&#xD;
      that of the 2nd visit (first test session) and the 3rd visit (second test session)&#xD;
      respectively. Notes: *The 2 test sessions each at week 0, 12 and 24 may be scheduled within 4&#xD;
      weeks from each time point. *The following test sessions will be scheduled no more than 4&#xD;
      weeks apart: o First and second test sessions for Week 0 (in any order) o Third and fourth&#xD;
      test sessions for Week 12 (in any order) o Fifth and sixth test sessions for Week 24 (in any&#xD;
      order)&#xD;
