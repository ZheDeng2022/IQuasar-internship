    <textblock>
      This study aimed to identify the potential circulating biomarkers of protein, mRNAs, and long&#xD;
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to diﬀerentiate the papillary thyroid cancers from benign thyroid&#xD;
      tumors. Methods: The study population of 100 patients was classified into identification (10&#xD;
      patients with papillary thyroid cancers and 10 patients with benign thyroid tumors) and&#xD;
      validation groups (45 patients with papillary thyroid cancers and 35 patients with benign&#xD;
      thyroid tumors). The Sengenics Immunome Protein Array combined data mining approach using the&#xD;
      Open Targets Platform was used to identify the putative protein biomarkers, and their&#xD;
      expression validated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      by Illumina HiSeq was used for the detection of dysregulated mRNAs and lncRNAs. The website&#xD;
      Timer v2.0 helped identify the putative mRNA biomarkers, which were significantly&#xD;
      over-expressed in papillary thyroid cancers than in adjacent normal thyroid tissue. The mRNA&#xD;
      and lncRNAs biomarker expression was validated by a real-time polymerase chain reaction.&#xD;

      Novel biomarkers identification from liquid biopsy samples is in great demand for the&#xD;
      diagnosis for malignant diseases. Generally, blood sampling is less invasive and could be&#xD;
      carried out repeatedly. In addition to protein markers, circulating nucleic acids are&#xD;
      promising sources of cancer biomarkers , since circulating nucleic acids provide information&#xD;
      on the genome or gene expression , and harbor wealth of health and disease status&#xD;
      information. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the transcripts longer than 200&#xD;
      nucleotides in length and act as prominent regulators of gene expression. Accumulating&#xD;
      evidence demonstrated the involvement of lncRNA dysregulation in a variety of cancers, and&#xD;
      their expression is associated with cancer development and metastasis. This study was&#xD;
      designed to identify the potential protein and RNA biomarkers in the blood for diﬀerentiating&#xD;
      a malignant thyroid tumor from a benign thyroid nodule. In this study, only patients with&#xD;
      papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, were chosen for&#xD;
      comparison with those with benign thyroid tumors to simplify the comparison.&#xD;

        The study population was assigned to identification (10 patients with papillary thyroid&#xD;
        cancers and 10 patients with benign thyroid tumors) and validation groups (45 patients with&#xD;
        papillary thyroid cancers and 35 patients with benign thyroid tumors). Before surgery, 2 mL&#xD;
        blood samples were drawn from an elbow vein of patients into EDTA tubes (BD Vacutainer) for&#xD;
        RNA analysis, and 8 mL into SST™II advance tubes (BD Vacutainer) for protein analysis.&#xD;
