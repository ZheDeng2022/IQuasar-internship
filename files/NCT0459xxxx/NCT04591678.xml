    <textblock>
      This is a single center, 22-month observational study of nusinersen treatment in adult&#xD;
      patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). There will be a total of seven visits.&#xD;
      Nusinersen is provided as standard of care and not considered research in this study.&#xD;
      Information will be collected regarding the general health, and function including muscle&#xD;
      strength of, as well as any positive and/or adverse events experienced by the study&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, 22-month observational study of nusinersen treatment in adult&#xD;
      patients with SMA. There will be a total of five visits. All subjects will be evaluated at a&#xD;
      screening visit no more than four weeks before starting their standard of care nusinersen&#xD;
      treatment to determine their eligibility for participation. Eligible patients will complete&#xD;
      their standard induction intrathecal nusinersen treatment on day 1, 15, 29 and 60 followed by&#xD;
      maintenance doses every four months. Subjects will be reevaluated after completing the&#xD;
      loading doses at 2 months followed by every four-month evaluations for the total duration of&#xD;
      the treatment of 22 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no data published on patients receiving this treatment over the age of&#xD;
      18. Without published data collected from research, it is difficult for adult patients to get&#xD;
      approval from their insurance companies to receive this treatment. This study hopes to&#xD;
      collect data, in order to make this treatment option easier for patients with SMA to access&#xD;
      and in general learn how well nusinersen is working in adult patients with SMA overtime.&#xD;

    <description>The nusinersen treatment will be given as standard of care. The treatment (which is NOT research, but the standard care) will be given by an injection into the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid in your spine) through a needle inserted into your lower back. Participants will receive a 12 mg (5 mL) dose during each administration/injection, which will occur on the following days: 1 (baseline), 15, 29, and 60. Following the 60 day treatment, participants will receive treatment every 4 months (6, 10, 14 etc.).&#xD;
After the 60 day, 6 month, 10 month, 14 month, 18 month and 22 month treatments the study team will see each participant afterwards to collect information to evaluate your general health, function and response to the treatment for the study.</description>
