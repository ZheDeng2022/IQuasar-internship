    <textblock>
      There are no investigational agents being used in this trial, and all doses, schedules, and&#xD;
      modifications are based on established standards of care. The research components of this&#xD;
      study will be the use of the two evaluation timepoints for assessment of efficacy of&#xD;
      pre-resection chemotherapy (including the evaluation criteria defined within this protocol),&#xD;
      and the collection of correlative blood and tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy will begin with FOLFIRINOX - a standard regimen used in pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      treatment, consisting of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. At the first planned&#xD;
      analysis, if a switch is indicated based on prespecified criteria (see Section 8.2 for the&#xD;
      specific adaptive decision criteria), gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel - another standard&#xD;
      regimen in this setting - will be used. Radiation therapy may be used prior to surgery, based&#xD;
      on findings on the final pre-operative scan per standard of care.&#xD;

    <measure>Measuring the proportion of patients undergoing surgical resection using historical data compared to 32 patients in current study.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using historical data from prospective trials and meta-analysis of multiple smaller studies, the expected proportion of patients undergoing resection in a mixed population of resectable and borderline resectable cancers is approximately 60%. We ambitiously aim to increase this to 80% or higher. With a one-sided of 0.05 and power of 80%, we will need 32 patients to demonstrate this difference.</description>

    <measure>Measuring the Pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy as Complete Response, Partial Response, Progressive Disease, or Stable Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm (&lt;1 cm).&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).&#xD;
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
