    <description>Osimertinib is an oral, potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR-TKI sensitising and resistance mutations in NSCLC with a significant selectivity margin over wild-type EGFR. Osimertinib will be administered orally as one 80 mg tablet once a day (1 cycle is 28 days). Cycles are repeated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until 1 year after the initiation of osimertinib administration.</description>
