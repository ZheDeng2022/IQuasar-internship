  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mumps is an acute infectious respiratory disease caused by the mumps virus (MuV), which&#xD;
      occurs mainly in children and adolescents. Its main clinical symptoms were parotid gland&#xD;
      suppurative swelling and pain with fever. The pathological changes and harm caused by mumps&#xD;
      was not only confined to the parotid gland, on the contrary, the social harm caused by&#xD;
      serious complications cannot be ignored. As mumps is a vaccine-preventable infectious&#xD;
      disease, vaccination is a fundamental strategy for controlling mumps. So far, there are 13&#xD;
      genotypes of MuV. Based on the analysis of molecular epidemiology, the main epidemic strain&#xD;
      of MuV in China was the F genotype. The commonly used vaccine strains represented only a&#xD;
      small number of known genotypes, e.g. Jeryl-Lynn (JL) and Rubini strains, which belong to&#xD;
      type A, Urabe strain belongs to type B, and L-Zagreb strains belongs to type D. Virus seed of&#xD;
      Live Attenuated Mumps Vaccine (Human diploid cell) developed by the institute was SP-A&#xD;
      strain, which was the first separation and preparation of the attenuated mumps viruses in&#xD;
      China. SP-A belongs to F genotype, which was the domestic epidemic genotype. In addition, the&#xD;
      cell substrate prepared for vaccine was human diploid cell (KMB-17 strain), which is much&#xD;
      safer to use. The results of phase I and II clinical trials showed that the vaccine possessed&#xD;
      good immunogenicity and good antigenic cross-reactivity in infants (8-24 months old).&#xD;

      This study will recruit 12,000 subjects and be divided into two stages. The first stage will&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of F-genotype mumps live attenuated vaccine (human&#xD;
      diploid cells) after vaccination in 720 healthy children aged 5-11 years, and explore the&#xD;
      detoxification in 144 subjects, who randomly selected from these 720 subjects. The second&#xD;
      stage will evaluate the clinical protective efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of F-genotype&#xD;
      mumps live attenuated vaccine (human diploid cells) after vaccination in 11280 healthy&#xD;
      children aged 5-11 years.&#xD;
