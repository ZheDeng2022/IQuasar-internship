  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initially developed in Japan for the treatment of endemic superficial gastric cancers,&#xD;
      endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) allows resection of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic&#xD;
      lesions of the digestive tract into a single fragment. It allows a perfect pathological&#xD;
      analysis, and decreases the rate of recurrence of the adenoma to less than 2%. However, this&#xD;
      procedure, which is technically more challenging, is also more risky (perforation rate at 4%&#xD;
      vs. 1% for WF-EMR) and longer. Submucosal dissection is also more expensive in terms of&#xD;
      equipment, but this difference can be offset by the cost of the high number of iterative&#xD;
      colonoscopies required in patients who have had endoscopic resection by WF-EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific debate is agitating the Western world1,2 and Japanese experts do not perform&#xD;
      WF-EMR anymore, whereas no comparative prospective study has compared these two procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of centers in France performed colorectal ESD even for benign lesions and nationwide&#xD;
      data about safety and efficiency is required to confirm the place of ESD for treatment of&#xD;
      large superficial colorectal lesions.&#xD;
