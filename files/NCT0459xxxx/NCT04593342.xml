  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation following rotator cuff surgery is characterized with high levels of pain,&#xD;
      limited range of motion, and decreased quality of life. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the B-Cure laser photobiomodulation home-use device in addition to standard care,&#xD;
      for the reduction of pain, increase in functionality, and improvement of life quality during&#xD;
      rehabilitation following rotator cuff arthroscopic surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients planned to undergo rotator cuff arthroscopy will be randomized to receive active or&#xD;
      sham devices for self-application at home in addition to standard care. Patients will be&#xD;
      invited to up to 5 visits at the clinic: baseline (before surgery), post-operative day 1, and&#xD;
      1, 3, and optionally 6 months after surgery. Evaluations will include physical examination,&#xD;
      physical activity tests, range of motion measurements, Constant score, thermal imaging, and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes including subjective pain level by visual analogue scale,&#xD;
      functional and quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that B-Cure laser treatments, applied, at home, by the patient, can&#xD;
      reduce pain and accelerate healing over standard care thereby improving the rehabilitation&#xD;
      process following rotator cuff arthroscopic surgery.&#xD;
