  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a globally prevalent condition that causes enormous social costs; largely due&#xD;
      to sickness absence. A common intervention for patients with chronic pain problems is&#xD;
      interdisciplinary treatment (IDT), which consists of a combination of physical exercise,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy and work training coordinated in an interdisciplinary team.&#xD;
      Based on data from Swedish National Registers, this study evaluates the effects of IDT on&#xD;
      sickness absence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a completely register-based observational cohort study. The study population is&#xD;
      defined from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation (SQRP), which routinely&#xD;
      aggregates data from specialist IDT pain management clinics across Sweden. SQRP contains&#xD;
      information on the exposure/intervention: whether a patient that visited a SQRP-affiliated&#xD;
      clinic was allocated to an IDT program (test) or not (control); t0 defined as the day of the&#xD;
      IDT assessment. Microdata from SQRP is linked to other Swedish registers via the unique&#xD;
      personal identification number held by all Swedish residents. Outcome data is obtained from&#xD;
      the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. Registers managed by the National Board of Health and&#xD;
      Welfare include data on dispensed prescription pharmaceuticals and specialist health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markov multistate survival-based methods will be used to compare the sickness absence between&#xD;
      groups. Specifically, length of stay per sickness absence state (no sickness absence, sick&#xD;
      leave, and disability pension) will be compared over five years from t0. Both crude and&#xD;
      adjusted estimates will be presented. Adjustment will be made based on our hypothesis about&#xD;
      causal relationships and include: history of sickness absence, sociodemographics (age, sex,&#xD;
      sociodemographic status), patient disability (emotional distress, everyday interference, and&#xD;
      confidence in future improvement), and governmental policy (IDT assessment year and&#xD;
      geographical region of IDT clinic).&#xD;

    <description>Interdisciplinary treatment (IDT) distinguishes itself as an interdisciplinary-coordinated (e.g., physician, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, and psychologist) intervention using a bio-psycho-social view of chronic pain. The MMR continues over a lengthy period with a common goal and generally includes patient education, supervised physical activity, simulated work training, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The exact composition of these MMR components depends on initial evaluations of the patients health status and furhter follow-up testing. The MMR interventional components can act independently and interdependently, resulting in combined effects due to known and unknown mechanisms; the effects are intended to be greater than the sum of its components.</description>
