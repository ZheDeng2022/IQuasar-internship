             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Subjects must be&#xD;
             able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  anthracycline-containing regimen in the past. Patients with Richter's&#xD;
                  transformation will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Composite and discordant lymphomas containing both indolent and large cell&#xD;
                  features will be included&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  A course of cyclophosphamide or vincristine with or without steroids given for&#xD;
                  lymphoma related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One cycle of anthracycline containing chemotherapy such as R-CHOP or R-miniCHOP&#xD;
                  given urgently for aggressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is not felt to be a candidate for standard dose R-CHOP due to age or comorbidities,&#xD;
        per the site investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ejection fraction of ≥ 45% on echocardiogram or MUGA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a platelet count of ≥75,000/μL within 14 days before enrollment unless&#xD;
             inadequate function is due to bone marrow infiltration with aggressive B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an absolute neutrophil count of ≥1,500/ μL within 14 days before&#xD;
             enrollment unless inadequate function is due to bone marrow infiltration with&#xD;
             aggressive B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a calculated or measured creatinine clearance of &gt;30 mL/minute within 14&#xD;
             days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin must be less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless the&#xD;
             elevation is known to be due to Gilbert syndrome or hepatic involvement with&#xD;
             aggressive B-cell lymphoma in which case it can be ≤ 3.0 times the ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT or AST must be ≤ 2.5 times the ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men&#xD;
                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at&#xD;
                  least 5 months after the last dose of polatuzumab vedotin to avoid exposing the&#xD;
                  embryo or fetus for the duration of the pregnancy. Men must refrain from donating&#xD;
                  sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing&#xD;
                  drug exposure. Male patients considering preservation of fertility should bank&#xD;
                  sperm before study treatment.&#xD;

             lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has concomitant active malignancy that the treating physician or PI feels may&#xD;
             interfere with the ability to measure the primary or secondary outcomes&#xD;

             of hepatitis B virus should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of&#xD;
             active HBV infection and for signs of hepatitis throughout study participation&#xD;
             according to national and local guidelines. Those at high risk of reactivation should&#xD;
             be placed on appropriate antiviral therapy as per national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of solid organ transplantation, or post-transplant lymphoproliferative&#xD;
             disorder&#xD;

          -  Patient has history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant abnormality in screening blood chemistry, hematology, or&#xD;
