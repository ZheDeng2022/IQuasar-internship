  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pomegranate fruits and products, including juice, tea, wine and extracts are widely consumed&#xD;
      and recognized for their health benefits. Pomegranate fruit possesses strong antioxidant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties. The effects of pomegranate on type 2&#xD;
      diabetic (T2DM) conditions have previously been reported. Although 8 oz. of Pom juice (PJ)&#xD;
      contains 36.9 g of sugar, 12-week PomJ supplementation did not change plasma advanced&#xD;
      glycated end-products, fasting glucose and HbA1C, but reduced lipid peroxidation in T2D&#xD;
      subjects. Additionally, acute PJ consumption has been shown to lower postprandial glycemic&#xD;
      response of a meal with high glycemic index (GI) and lower fasting blood glucose, and&#xD;
      long-term PomJ consumption did not worsen diabetic markers. However, a large knowledge gap&#xD;
      still exists regarding the form of sugars in PJ and the hormonal responses to PJ consumption&#xD;
      in different physiological conditions. Therefore currently the consumption of PJ is not&#xD;
      recommended for individuals with T2DM. This clinical study will focus on the short-term&#xD;
      effects of PJ consumption on different diabetic variables to further evaluate the health&#xD;
      benefits of PJ for T2DM.&#xD;

      This study aims to measure the effects of PJ vs. sugar on glucose and insulin levels in&#xD;
      apparently healthy normal weight and prediabetic overweight and obese subjects. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to consume one serving of PJ, sugar mix and water separated by one week of&#xD;
      beige diet without PJ consumption (crossover design). The PJ will be provided by&#xD;
      POMWonderful. Timed blood collections over a three-hour period following the&#xD;
      juice/sugar/water consumption will be used to measure how PJ vs. sugar mix vs. water affects&#xD;
      glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity in human subjects.&#xD;
