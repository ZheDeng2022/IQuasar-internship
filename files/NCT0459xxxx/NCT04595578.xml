    <description>rTMS was delivered on the scalp for over 2 cm under the inion, which is the scalp over the cerebellum area, using a double-cone coil connected to a Magstim Rapid2® stimulator with two Booster Modules (Magstim, Spring Gardens, Wales, UK) in accordance with safety recommendations. Stimulation was delivered to the cerebellum at 10 Hz with 90% of the mean resting motor threshold intensity for 5 seconds at 55 second intervals to deliver 1000 pulses in 20 minutes. Immediately after rTMS, the combination treatment group received balance and gait training by a physical therapist for 30 minutes/day and underwent aerobic exercise using a stationary bicycle at moderate intensity (12 to 14 rating of perceived exertion) for 30 minutes/day and 5 days/week for two weeks. In the control group, no participants received physical therapy or rTMS for two weeks.</description>
