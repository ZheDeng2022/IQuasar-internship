  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the home-use device&#xD;
      ToothWave (Model H7001) for calculus reduction and the prevention of calculus accumulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, single-blind, randomized, and controlled prospective study aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ToothWave in calculus reduction and prevention of&#xD;
      calculus accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo a dental prophylaxis, and will enter a two-month run-in phase.&#xD;
      A Volpe-Manhold Index (V-MI) calculus examination will be per-formed at the end of the run-in&#xD;
      phase. A minimum of 90 qualified subjects (completers) who will form at least 9 mm of&#xD;
      calculus on the lingual surface of the mandibular anterior teeth and will qualify to continue&#xD;
      participation ac-cording to the eligibility criteria and will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the ToothWave or the control brush (ADA-accepted powered TB) group. Subjects will be&#xD;
      stratified according to calculus levels (which indicates the calculus growth rate).&#xD;
      Stratification will also be conducted according to age, gender, and ethnic group. Subjects&#xD;
      will brush twice daily, unsupervised, during a three-month test period, returning at Weeks 3,&#xD;
      6 and 12 for safety and V-MI examinations. An additional visit will be conducted at week 9,&#xD;
      during which a supervised brushing will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study test phase will include a total of 168 treatment sessions and 5 clinic visits over&#xD;
      a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, assessment data will be collected at baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 weeks of&#xD;
      the test phase. The average data sets will be calculated for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is defined as a timed 2 minutes of teeth brushing in a regular manner, twice a day&#xD;
      (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken using the ToothWave and standard fluoride&#xD;
      toothpaste. The control group will use a regular powered toothbrush and standard fluoride&#xD;
      toothpaste.&#xD;
