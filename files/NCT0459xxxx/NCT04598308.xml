      Rationale: coronary microvascular disease is a relatively 'new' entity within the field of&#xD;
      cardiology. The investigators are able to investigate the microcirculation by measurements&#xD;
      performed in the catheterization laboratory. But even though measurements are performed on a&#xD;
      daily basis, a lot of questions regarding microvascular disease remain. The rationale of this&#xD;
      registry is to get an overview of patients and measurement values in daily routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and main endpoint: No previous registries have been set-up where coronary blood&#xD;
      flow and resistance was systematically stored. Therefore the analyses will be mainly&#xD;
      descriptive. The objective is to acquire a better insight in the indications and use of this&#xD;
      technique in everyday practice , its consequences for clinical decision making, and to enable&#xD;
      interventionalists to exchange mutual knowledge about this specific methodology and about the&#xD;
      coronary microcirculation in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients who underwent coronary angiography with or without coronary&#xD;
      intervention for any reason and if an indication for the foreseen intracoronary physiologic&#xD;
      measurements is present according to the discretion of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): none, only usage of measurement data. The only 'intervention'&#xD;
      for all patients is a questionnaire.&#xD;

      This registry only collects all measurement data from normal/routine physiologic assessment&#xD;
      in the cathlab. These measurements are performed on a daily basis. The following paragraph&#xD;
      will explain these routine measurements briefly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short description of the procedure Coronary angiography, PCI (if indicated), and physiologic&#xD;
      measurements are performed completely according to normal routine. Physiologic measurements&#xD;
      may include FFR, NHPR, IMR, CFR, absolute flow (Q) and microcirculatory resistance (Rmicro or&#xD;
      MRR) measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to measure Q and Rmicro are mandatory to be included in this registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is failure to measure Q and/or Rmicro , it should be carefully noted including the&#xD;
      reason for failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary physiologic measurements may be performed either prior or after PCI, if applicable.&#xD;
      If they are performed before PCI, it is recommended (according to Good Clinical Practice) but&#xD;
      not absolutely mandatory to repeat these measurements also after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As said, the invasive procedure itself, including all measurements, should be performed&#xD;
      completely according to clinical routine. Use of drugs either during or after the procedure&#xD;
      should also exactly identical to normal routine.&#xD;
