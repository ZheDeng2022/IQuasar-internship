  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of ciraparantag for reversal of anticoagulation induced by different anticoagulant&#xD;
      drugs (apixaban or rivaroxaban) in generally healthy adults. Throughout the study,&#xD;
      coagulation status will be determined by whole blood clotting time (WBCT), which will be&#xD;
      measured primarily by the Perosphere Technologies' PoC Coagulometer and at selected&#xD;
      timepoints using a manual testing method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in separate cohorts; each cohort will evaluate the reversal of a&#xD;
      different anticoagulant drug. Within each cohort, an initial group of subjects (Group 1) will&#xD;
      be enrolled for evaluation of a target dose of ciraparantag. Depending on the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety results from Group 1, a second group (Group 2) may be enrolled to evaluate a different&#xD;
      dose of ciraparantag for that cohort.&#xD;
