  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to customize privacy protected facial expression and body motion&#xD;
      tracking for use in the home environment by stroke survivor-informal caregiver dyads by&#xD;
      investigating within a simulated home environment, background variability,possible&#xD;
      occlusions, privacy considerations, and the motor weaknesses, gait impairments, and facial&#xD;
      expressions of stroke survivors and to determine the acceptability of the customized facial&#xD;
      expression and body motion technology in stroke survivors and their informal caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of disability. Most stroke survivors are discharged home after&#xD;
      hospitalization and receive care from informal caregivers (e.g., unpaid spouses) who are&#xD;
      often unprepared for the role. Stroke survivorship is an exemplar of a chronic condition that&#xD;
      detracts from the affected individual and caregiver's capacity to live well within the home&#xD;
      (e.g., psychosocial distress). Early identification of psychosocial distress is likely to&#xD;
      lead to timely interventions and, subsequently, decreases in associated morbidity, mortality,&#xD;
      and disability. Yet, only a minority of survivors are properly identified and treated for&#xD;
      psychosocial distress, and caregivers are primarily forgotten. In-home, objective measures to&#xD;
      identify psychosocial distress are lacking. Using facial expression and body motion&#xD;
      technology by extracting facial characteristics and body joints (skeletal graph) known to be&#xD;
      associated with psychosocial distress (e.g., frowning) provides new opportunities to support&#xD;
      in-home telemonitoring. To accommodate real-world, post-stroke home environments, the&#xD;
      technology needs to be customized to an in-home environment. Toward this end, the&#xD;
      investigators must consider background variability, possible occlusions, privacy concerns,&#xD;
      and stroke survivor motor weaknesses, gait impairments, and facial paralysis. Objectives: The&#xD;
      primary objectives are to customize facial expression and body motion technology and examine&#xD;
      the acceptability of the technology through a study of 6 stroke survivor-informal caregiver&#xD;
      dyads within a simulated home environment. The project will serve as a necessary step to&#xD;
      amass critical information to design future trials using facial expression and body motion&#xD;
      technology. The ultimate goal is to improve psychosocial well-being for those aging at home.&#xD;
