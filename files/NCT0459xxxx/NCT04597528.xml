  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse events are considered to increase in pregnancies extending beyond 39 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For multiparous patients, especially those with a favourable cervix, it is perhaps easy to&#xD;
      justify an elective induction at 39 weeks given the low risk of caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, for nulliparous patients the current evidence, derived mainly from retrospective&#xD;
      observational studies, does not allow a clear recommendation with the exception perhaps of&#xD;
      the recent A Randomized Trial of Induction Versus Expectant Management (ARRIVE) trial. Given&#xD;
      the reported increased risks of adverse events in pregnancies extending beyond 39 weeks it&#xD;
      has been hypothesized that a policy of planned elective induction at 39 weeks could improve&#xD;
      outcomes for the infant and the mother. There is a trend towards an increased rate of&#xD;
      elective labour induction in pregnancies at 39 weeks, indicating that practitioners are more&#xD;
      commonly using elective induction at this gestational age. The practice in India varies&#xD;
      slightly from institute to institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator intend to study the maternal and perinatal outcome, after elective induction&#xD;
      of labour, at thirty nine weeks and zero days upto thirty nine and six days, amongst&#xD;
      nulliparous singleton pregnancies followed up for the duration of their hospital stay, in&#xD;
      Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute (JMMC and RI).&#xD;
