  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to document the effect cataract surgery has on the pseudoexfoliation and&#xD;
      pseudoexfoliation glaucoma eye. Details such has patient history, history of possible&#xD;
      glaucoma, intraocular pressure, status of the eye, operation parameters and postoperative&#xD;
      effect will be documented. The study is prospective and randomised . Patients will be divided&#xD;
      in to two groups: in one standard phacoemulsification cataract surgery will be preformed. In&#xD;
      the second group the anterior chamber angel will be aspirated an extra minute at the end of&#xD;
      the case with the IA probe. The aim is to determine weather this extra aspiration will have&#xD;
      an effect on postoperative intraocular pressure and other parameters.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will be performed at the Helsinki University Central Hospital.&#xD;
      Patients that are eligible for cataract surgery will be recruited. A history of&#xD;
      pseudoexfoliation or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative data such as age, sex, ethnicity, history of diabetes and history of high blood&#xD;
      are recorded. If the participant has pseudoexfoliation glaucoma the following data will be&#xD;
      recorded: number of years elapsed since the diagnosis; number of glaucoma medications; number&#xD;
      of active agents; possible bilateral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual acuity is attained during every visit (preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years postoperatively) using the Snellen chart. Both&#xD;
      uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity are attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure (IOP) is also attained during every visit using the Goldmann applanation&#xD;
      tonometer (measured twice during each visit). The measurements will be taken between 8 a.m&#xD;
      and 12 p.m to minimize the effect of diurnal fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomicroscopy will be done preoperatively to assess the following: conjunctival hyperemia;&#xD;
      possible pseudoxfoliation material on the endothelium, iris border and lens capsule; anterior&#xD;
      chamber angle opening (grade 0-4 using the Shaffer system); existence of the Sampaolesi line;&#xD;
      iris dilatation in millimeters (20 minutes after instilling 1 drop of tropicamid 5mg/ml and 1&#xD;
      drop of 2,5% phenylephrine; nuclear sclerosis (grades 0-4); presence of phacodonesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively the anterior chamber is assessed for inflammation using the SUN nomenclature&#xD;
      at 1 day, 1 week, 1 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens thickness (LT) are&#xD;
      obtained using the Haag-Streit LensStar optical biometer. Lens calculations are done using&#xD;
      the SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Holladay II and Barrett formulas and the best suited IOL determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior chamber OCT (Tomey Casia 2) is attained preoperatively and at at 1 months, 6 months&#xD;
      and 1 year postoperatively. The following parameters are recorded: angle opening distance&#xD;
      (AOD) and trabecular iris surface area (TISA). Both at 500 and 750 micrometers. Nasal and&#xD;
      temporal (0 and 180 degrees) sites will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specular microscopy will be performed preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively using the&#xD;
      Konan CellChek device. Cell density (cells per mm2) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macular OCT using the Heidelber Spectralis device is attained preoperatively and one month&#xD;
      postoperatively. The central retinal thickness (CRT) will be documented. The vitreoretinal&#xD;
      surface and Bruch's membrane are used as measuring points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ocular nerve head OCT obtained using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT. The global nerve&#xD;
      fiber layer thickness is documented preoperatively, and possible progression is assessed by a&#xD;
      glaucoma specialist (NL) at 1 month, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kona FM-600 cell flare meter is also used to assess inflammation preoperatively and at 1&#xD;
      day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual field will be analyzed using the Haag-Streit Octopus static perimeter with the G&#xD;
      program. Perimetry is performed at 1 month ,1 year, 2 years and 3 years postoperatively. Mean&#xD;
      defect (MD), square root of loss variance (sLV) and reliability factor will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation is done before the cataract surgery after the preoperative evaluation.&#xD;
      Stratified block randomization is used to ensure that intraocular pressure and participant&#xD;
      age do not vary too much between the groups. The participants are randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      in the first group standard phacoemulsification is performed and an intraocular lens (IOL) is&#xD;
      implanted. In the second group an extra one-minute anterior chamber angle aspiration is&#xD;
      preformed using the IA tip after all the viscoelastic is aspirated from the anterior chamber.&#xD;
      The aim is not to touch the chamber angle with the IA tip but rather make continuous sweeping&#xD;
      motions under visual control during that minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three surgeons (KK; ML; PK) from the Department of Corneal and Anterior Segment Surgery are&#xD;
      designated to perform the surgeries. Preoperative drops include one drop of tropicamide 5&#xD;
      mg/ml, 2,5% phenylephrine and apraclonidine 10 gm/ml. The eye is disinfected with either&#xD;
      iodine or chlorhexidine drops, and the lids swiped with alcohol swabs. XylocainⓇ 2% gel is&#xD;
      used for anesthetic after rinsing the surface of the globe. The main incision is 2,4 mm and&#xD;
      the side port 1 mm wide. Intracameral lidocaine and phenylephrine are used after making the&#xD;
      side port incision. DiscoViscⓇ and ViscoatⓇ can be used as viscoelastic agents during&#xD;
      surgery. The use of a Malyugin ring Ⓡ , iris hooks, capsular support hooks and a capsular&#xD;
      tension ring is permitted. The need for these instruments will be determined by the surgeon&#xD;
      during the procedure. Phacoemulsification is performed using the stop &amp; chop or direct chop&#xD;
      technique. The Alcon CenturionⓇ device is used in all surgeries with the same predetermined&#xD;
      settings. Johnson &amp; Johnson TecnisⓇ monofocal 1-piece IOL (ZCB00) is used in all cases. The&#xD;
      following data is recorded during surgery: surgeons initials; surgery time in minutes (form&#xD;
      the time the first incision is made to the time the wounds are sealed); surgery technique;&#xD;
      the use of a Malyugin Ⓡ ring or capsular tension ring; the use of iris hooks or capsular&#xD;
      support hooks; cumulative dissipated energy (CDE); ultrasound total time; total aspiration&#xD;
      time; estimated fluid aspirated; fluid used ( calculated by subtracting the amount of fluid&#xD;
      left at the end of the case form the amount left after priming the phaco device); possible&#xD;
      extra anterior chamber angle aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively a drop of apraclonidine 10 mg/ml is instilled after a 30 to 60-minute period&#xD;
      of monitoring the patient in the recovery room. If the intraocular pressure pressure is under&#xD;
      5 or over 25 (measured with the iCareⓇ rebound tonometer by a nurse) the surgeon is asked to&#xD;
      assess the situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications such as posterior capsule rupture and suprachoroidal hemorrhage are grounds for&#xD;
      discontinuation of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative visits take place at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and&#xD;
      3 years. The types of examinations preformed are described in detail above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the change in intraocular pressure&#xD;
      postoperatively. The study also aims to determine the factors effecting the change in IOP.&#xD;
      For this reason, patient history, glaucoma history, the status of the eye and data form the&#xD;
      surgery are recorded and numerous tests will be performed. These are described in detail&#xD;
      above. This study is aimed to aid clinicians in everyday work, for that and safety reasons a&#xD;
      wash-out period will not be included. Adding additional glaucoma medication is permitted&#xD;
      during the course of the study and the number of medications and active agents is documented&#xD;
      during the postoperative exams. The need for additional glaucoma medication will be assessed&#xD;
      during follow-up examinations with the aid of IOP measurement, ONH-OCT and perimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to determine the rate of macular edema at 1 month postoperatively, for&#xD;
      that reason the central retinal thickness is recorded preoperatively and at 1 month&#xD;
      postoperatively using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also determine the rate of endothelial cell loss at 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
