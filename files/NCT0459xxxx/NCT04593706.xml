      Comparison of the Efficacy of Different Steroids in the Treatment of Abnormal Scars (Keloids&#xD;
      and hypertrophic Scars)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On a yearly basis, millions develop different skin scarring. These scars are a public&#xD;
      reminder of the traumatic incident, past or present disease or a surgery which caused them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scarring is a common consequence of wound healing process, and it is one of the most complex&#xD;
      biological processes in human. This healing process is affected by numerous factors and thus&#xD;
      can be disrupted, leading to pathological scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological scarring is common in people with genetic predisposition, those undergone&#xD;
      complex and massive surgeries, burns or those wounded in unsanitary environments. Apart from&#xD;
      being aesthetically unpleasant, scars are associated with functional and psychosocial&#xD;
      morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite clinical, pathologic and pathogenic differences between keloids and hypertrophic&#xD;
      scars, treatments are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scars have a negative external impact causing social distress and impaired self-image, and as&#xD;
      a consequence, low satisfaction rates following surgical and cosmetic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line treatment is monthly intralesional corticosteroid injections with a response&#xD;
      rate of 50-100% and recurrence of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few steroids available and used for abnormal scars treatment, including Celestone&#xD;
      chronodose (Betamethasone acetate + Betamethasone sodium phosphate), Dexamethasone sodium&#xD;
      phosphate, Methylprednisolone acetate, Methylprednisolone sodium succinate,&#xD;
      Methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, Triamcinolone acetonide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroids are different by their hydrophilic properties, potency and half-life, although the&#xD;
      half-life of intralesional injections is not known. Inspite of being widely used, there have&#xD;
      never been a comparative study of the different steroid treatments.&#xD;

    <description>For the Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS), the investigators score the following parameters of each part of the scar on a scale ranging from 1 (normal skin) to 10 (worst scar imagin¬able): 'vascularization', 'pigmentation', 'thickness', 'relief', and 'pliability'. The total score on the OSAS is the sum of the scores of each item, yielding a total score ranging from 6 (best) to 60 (worst). For the patient scar assessment scale (PSAS), the participants used a scale of 1 to 10 to answer questions relating to pain, itching, color, stiffness, irregularity and thickness. The total score on the PSAS was the sum of the scores of each item, yielding a total score ranging from 6 (best) to 60 (worst)</description>
