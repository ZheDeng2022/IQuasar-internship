      Phase III, prospective, multi-center, randomized, open label, parallel group, study in&#xD;
      patients with HER2-negative breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy with 1:1 allocation to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Sacituzumab govitecan (days 1, 8 q3w for eight cycles);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: treatment of physician´s choice (TPC, defined as capecitabine or platinum-based&#xD;
           chemotherapy for eight cycles or observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in either arm will be given for eight cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with HR-positive breast cancer, endocrine-based therapy will be administered&#xD;
      according to local guidelines. The start of endocrine therapy will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator; however, it will be encouraged to start after surgery/radiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients without additional cytotoxic agents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) allows monitoring of tumor response to treatment and a&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) is associated with superior survival. This association&#xD;
      is strongest in the most aggressive subtype, i.e. in patients with triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer (TNBC). Patients with TNBC not achieving a pCR have a 5-year event free survival rate&#xD;
      of about 50%. , , The association between pCR and prognosis is less pronounced in&#xD;
      HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. However, the CPS+EG scoring system for prognosis after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, taking into account clinical stage, post treatment pathological&#xD;
      stage, estrogen receptor status and grade, leads to an improved estimate of prognosis&#xD;
      allowing to select patients at high risk of relapse for post-neoadjuvant therapy. Patients&#xD;
      with TNBC not achieving a pCR as well as those with HR-positive/HER2-negative tumors and a&#xD;
      CPS+EG score of 3 or 2/ypN+ are at high risk of relapse, warranting additional experimental&#xD;
      therapies after NACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is proof of concept, that post-neoadjuvant therapy can significantly improve survival.&#xD;
      First data was provided by the CREATE X trial, randomizing patients with residual tumor after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy to either capecitabine or observation. CREATE X included&#xD;
      HER2-negative patients and demonstrated a significant improvement in disease-free survival&#xD;
      (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the overall population, which was confined to the TNBC&#xD;
      subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the randomized post-neoadjuvant phase III KATHERINE study demonstrated an improved&#xD;
      invasive disease-free survival in HER2-positive patients without pCR after trastuzumab +/-&#xD;
      pertuzumab treated postoperatively with T-DM1, an antibody-drug-conjugate compared to&#xD;
      trastuzumab.&#xD;
