    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, placebo controlled single and multiple dose escalation&#xD;
      study of an anti-IL-15 mAb (CALY-002). The study initiates as placebo controlled, randomized&#xD;
      trial with a single ascending dosing part in healthy subjects and commences with a multiple&#xD;
      ascending dosing part in participants with Celiac Disease undergoing a gluten challenge and&#xD;
      includes an open label multiple dose expansion cohort in participants with Eosinophilic&#xD;
      Esophagitis.&#xD;
