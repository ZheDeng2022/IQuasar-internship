      The purpose of this implementation study is - primarily - to investigate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, tolerability of a new virtual reality application in stroke patients, and&#xD;
      -secondarily - to gain initial insights in the preliminary clinical effects of this&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although immersive technologies have great potential in healthcare, they are still relatively&#xD;
      unknown and underutilized in this field. In this study a new virtual reality (VR) application&#xD;
      will be implemented and tested in two groups of stroke patients (10 acute phase/10 chronic&#xD;
      phase). In an attempt to reactivate the affected upper limb in stroke patients, therapists&#xD;
      often use mirror therapy. Using a mirror, the movement of a paralyzed limb is feigned in&#xD;
      order to reprogram the brain. A patient performs exercises with the healthy limb, but through&#xD;
      the mirror the patient seems to use the affected limb. A high number of repetitions is&#xD;
      essential to stimulate the so-called neuroplasticity of the brain, but this makes mirror&#xD;
      therapy monotonous. In addition, the therapy also has its limitations. Activities are limited&#xD;
      by the physical boundaries of the modality, with exercises largely limited to distal&#xD;
      movements and simple functional activities. Larger, free-standing mirrors provide a wider&#xD;
      range of motion for therapeutic activities, but offer less protection against environmental&#xD;
      distraction. With VR, these obstacles can be overcome. By focusing on virtual mirror therapy&#xD;
      using a VR headset, therapists hope to create a more pleasant and realistic experience for&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
