      This study is a single-site, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial designed to elucidate&#xD;
      mechanism(s) of action for symptomatic benefits observed in Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Patients treating twice daily using a non-invasive brainstem modulation device. Study&#xD;
      participants will self-administer treatments in the home setting over a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Changes in cerebral blood flow perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity and functional&#xD;
      connectivity between the pre-treatment baseline and the end of the treatment period will be&#xD;
      monitored and compared to changes in validated standardized clinical measures of motor and&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms in PD.&#xD;
