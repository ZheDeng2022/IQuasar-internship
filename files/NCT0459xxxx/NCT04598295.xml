  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that&#xD;
      generates a significant health care burden and is the most commonly diagnosed&#xD;
      gastrointestinal condition. Nearly 12% of all patients in the United States seek medical care&#xD;
      in primary care practice for IBS and it accounts for 3.1 million ambulatory care visits and&#xD;
      5.9 million prescriptions annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of IBS is distinctly broad compared to other gastrointestinal conditions&#xD;
      and includes abnormalities involving motility, visceral sensation, brain-gut interaction, and&#xD;
      distress. Though patients with IBS often have a heterogeneous symptom profile, the&#xD;
      predominant theme is the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort that is usually relieved by&#xD;
      defecation. Host factors such as genetics, immune function, and psychological status, as well&#xD;
      as environmental factors such as stress, recent infection, or treatment with antibiotics,&#xD;
      could predispose to the development of chronic IBS symptoms. Due to a myriad of contributing&#xD;
      factors, a single cause of IBS remains enigmatic. Despite the urgent need to develop better&#xD;
      therapies, the high range of placebo response has made clinical trials challenging, ranging&#xD;
      from 16.0 to 71.4% with a population-weighted average of 40.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have also shown alterations in gut immune response, and a disrupted intestinal&#xD;
      and colonic microbiome in association with IBS. The current working hypothesis is that&#xD;
      abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses, which increase epithelial&#xD;
      permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways, and dysregulate the enteric nervous&#xD;
      system. Targeting the microbiota and gastrointestinal tract with live organisms is a&#xD;
      promising approach, yet previous trials have yielded limited success due to empiric strain&#xD;
      selection, small population size, and inadequate trial design to control for a high placebo&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol aims to assess the impact of a multi-strain consortia of 24 commensal organisms&#xD;
      across 12 species with extensive strain-specific in vivo data, assessing a range of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms without negatively altering the naive gut microbiota.&#xD;
      High-throughput shotgun DNA sequencing will provide opportunity for '-omics'-based analyses&#xD;
      of the gut microbiota, which can be augmented by the metabolite profiles resulting from total&#xD;
      microbial activity in the gut. Since many of these metabolites are bioeffector molecules&#xD;
      acting upon the host, such analysis can provide a direct measure of the consequences of&#xD;
      microbial activity in the gut and provide a novel integrated data set for patients with IBS.&#xD;
      Recruited subjects will also use a smart-phone application to report day to day&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, a patient-centric hallmark of this chronic gut condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are live microorganisms with a vast array of therapeutic potential for&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disease. Several probiotics strains have shown beneficial outcomes in&#xD;
      constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) patients, especially as an adjunct to conventional&#xD;
      treatment. However, a number of controversial issues regarding the roles of probiotics in&#xD;
      pathogenesis of IBS-C remain to be clarified, including precise mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol aims to assess the impact of a mix of 24-beneficial strains on individual&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms specifically in a cohort of subjects with IBS-C or IBS-M.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double blind, 12-week comparison of the efficacy and safety of DS-01&#xD;
      versus placebo in a cohort of 100 men or women with IBS with constipation. 50 IBS-C or IBS-M&#xD;
      patients will receive DS-01 (Daily Synbiotic, once daily) for 12 weeks, while 50 IBS-C or&#xD;
      IBS-M patients will receive the placebo (once daily). Safety is a paramount concern in the&#xD;
      study design and will be monitored carefully throughout the study. Study subjects will also&#xD;
      receive extensive education on use of the synbiotic.&#xD;
