  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of 8-weeks cranberry supplementation on the antibody&#xD;
      response to influenza vaccination and ex-vivo anti-viral activity. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      8-weeks ingestion of cranberry supplement relative to placebo will improve the antibody&#xD;
      response to influenza vaccination and ex-vivo anti-viral defense.&#xD;

      Participants (n=90, ages 40-80 y) will be randomized to cranberry or placebo groups (with&#xD;
      groups balanced for age, BMI, sex). Participants will provide blood and urine samples (lab&#xD;
      visit #1), ingest cranberry or placebo supplements for 4-weeks, provide blood and urine&#xD;
      samples and be vaccinated for influenza (lab visit #2), and provide two additional blood and&#xD;
      urine samples after 1- (lab visit #3) and 4- additional weeks of supplementation (lab visit&#xD;
      #4). Blood samples will be tested for seroconversion rates and haemagglutination inhibition&#xD;
      [HI] titres, and anti-viral activity against viral infected Hela cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Visit #1, Pre-Study: Orientation and review of the consent form (with next morning&#xD;
      follow-up visit to turn in the 24-h urine sample). 10-15 minutes The informed consent form,&#xD;
      Medical Health Questionnaire (MHQ), and 1-week retrospective symptom log (SYMPLOG) will be&#xD;
      sent to the subject via email prior to Lab Visit #1. The research staff under the direction&#xD;
      of the Research Manager will call each participant, review research procedures and the&#xD;
      consent form, and set up appointment times for Lab Visit #1. Participants will be told that&#xD;
      they will sign the consent form during Lab Visit #1. Participants will report to the NCRC&#xD;
      Human Performance Lab in Kannapolis in an overnight fasted state (no food or beverages other&#xD;
      the water for 8 or more hours). The study manager will make a final review of the consent&#xD;
      form with the study participant prior to obtaining voluntary consent. Once voluntary consent&#xD;
      has been provided by the study participant, the completed Medical Health Questionnaire (MHQ)&#xD;
      and 1-week retrospective symptom log (SYMPLOG) will be turned in. The MHQ includes questions&#xD;
      on lifestyle and medical histories. The SYMPLOG includes questions on digestive health&#xD;
      (constipation, heartburn, bloating, diarrhea, and nausea), hunger levels (morning, afternoon,&#xD;
      and evening), energy levels (morning, afternoon, and evening), sickness (fever, cough, sore&#xD;
      throat, stuffy nose, runny nose, and headache), pain (joint, muscle, and back), allergies,&#xD;
      stress level, focus/concentration, and overall well-being. Participants will indicate&#xD;
      responses using a 12-point Likert scale with 1 relating to &quot;none at all&quot;, 6 &quot;moderate&quot;, and&#xD;
      12 &quot;very high&quot;. Height, weight, and body composition will be obtained (in a screened off area&#xD;
      of the lab to ensure privacy) using the seca Medical Body Composition Analyzer 514&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance scale (Hanover, MD). Blood samples will be taken from an antecubital&#xD;
      vein with subjects in the seated position. Supplements for the first 4 weeks of the study&#xD;
      will be provided. During visit #1, participants will be given a 3-day food record with&#xD;
      thorough written and oral instructions on recording procedures (with food models). The 3-day&#xD;
      food record will be completed on a Thursday, Friday, and Saturday sequence prior to visit #2.&#xD;
      During visit #1, participants will be given two 24-h urine collection kits with thorough&#xD;
      written and oral instruction on collection procedures. The first 24-h urine collection&#xD;
      bottles will be collected during the 24-h period immediately after lab visit #1 and turned in&#xD;
      the next morning. (To minimize contact, participants will stay in their cars and hand urine&#xD;
      samples to a research staff member). Supplementation will start the day after lab visit #1.&#xD;
      The second 24-h urine collection bottle will be collected during the 24-h period immediately&#xD;
      prior to lab visit #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Visit #2, 4-Week Time Point: Provide blood and urine samples and be vaccinated for&#xD;
      influenza (10 to 15 min) Participants will report to the NCRC Human Performance Lab in&#xD;
      Kannapolis after 4-weeks supplementation in an overnight fasted state (no food or beverages&#xD;
      other the water for 8 or more hours). Participants will turn in the 3-day food record and the&#xD;
      24-h urine sample. Compliance to the supplementation regimen will be reviewed and subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to return all unused supplements. Participants will fill in the 1-week&#xD;
      retrospective symptom log (SYMPLOG) before coming to the lab and turn in. Height, weight, and&#xD;
      body composition will be obtained (in a screened off area of the lab to ensure privacy) using&#xD;
      the seca Medical Body Composition Analyzer 514 bioelectrical impedance scale (Hanover, MD).&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken from an antecubital vein with subjects in the seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the influenza vaccination for the 2020-21 season (in accordance&#xD;
      with the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices regarding the use of seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccines in the United States). The influenza vaccination will not be administered&#xD;
      by this study. The vaccinations will be provided by Walgreens personnel at the NCRC using&#xD;
      standard procedures. Participants will receive the flu shot as clinically indicated by their&#xD;
      physician or personnel administering the vaccine. The determination that the flu shot is not&#xD;
      clinically indicated will also be determined by the participant's physician or personnel&#xD;
      administering the vaccine. The high-dose vaccine will be used for study participants aged 65&#xD;
      years and older. (Note: Walgreens has provided influenza vaccinations at the NCRC for several&#xD;
      years and have consented to provide them for our study participants. Participants will&#xD;
      complete standard forms and present their insurance cards to cover the fee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements for the final 4 weeks of the study (weeks 5 through 8) will be provided.&#xD;
      Participants will be given two 24-h urine collection bottles for Lab Visits #3 and #4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Visit #3, 5-Week Time Point: Provide blood and urine samples (10 min) Participants will&#xD;
      report to the NCRC Human Performance Lab in Kannapolis at the 5-week time point in an&#xD;
      overnight fasted state (no food or beverages other the water for 8 or more hours).&#xD;
      Participants will turn in the 24-h urine sample. Compliance to the supplementation regimen&#xD;
      will be reviewed and subjects will be asked to return all unused cranberry/placebo&#xD;
      supplements. Participants will fill in the 1-week retrospective symptom log (SYMPLOG) before&#xD;
      coming to the lab and turn in. Height, weight, and body composition will be obtained (in a&#xD;
      screened off area of the lab to ensure privacy) using the seca Medical Body Composition&#xD;
      Analyzer 514 bioelectrical impedance scale (Hanover, MD). Participants will remove their&#xD;
      shoes and socks for the seca BIA measurement while holding the side rails. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken from an antecubital vein with subjects in the seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Visit #4, 8-Week Time Point (end of study): Provide final blood and urine samples (10&#xD;
      min) Participants will report to the NCRC Human Performance Lab in Kannapolis at the 8-week&#xD;
      time point in an overnight fasted state (no food or beverages other the water for 8 or more&#xD;
      hours). Participants will turn in the 24-h urine sample. Compliance to the supplementation&#xD;
      regimen will be reviewed. Participants will fill in the 1-week retrospective symptom log&#xD;
      (SYMPLOG) before coming to the lab and turn in. Height, weight, and body composition will be&#xD;
      obtained (in a screened off area of the lab to ensure privacy) using the seca Medical Body&#xD;
      Composition Analyzer 514 bioelectrical impedance scale (Hanover, MD). Blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken from an antecubital vein with subjects in the seated position.&#xD;
