  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot, eight week, open-label, within-subject cross over trial of four weeks of standard&#xD;
      clinical care (SCC) in an outpatient substance abuse treatment program and four weeks of SCC&#xD;
      and varenicline among current and former tobacco smokers with frequent cannabis use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treating co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use disorders might reduce the health burdens&#xD;
      associated with both substances. However, few studies have evaluated pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions, in combination with behavioral treatment, to address co-occurring cannabis and&#xD;
      tobacco use; these are limited by high participant attrition, poor adherence to&#xD;
      interventions, and lack of control. Participants were recruited from an urban, outpatient&#xD;
      substance abuse treatment program that offers both intensive behavioral counseling and&#xD;
      medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder. The investigators selected these&#xD;
      clinical sites because the investigators have successfully recruited and retained&#xD;
      participants from these sites in prior clinical trials, and anticipated that they would find&#xD;
      a high prevalence of persons with frequent cannabis use.&#xD;

    <description>To address psychiatric symptoms, the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) was used. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by psychiatrists and clinicians in the United States and Europe, for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders.</description>

    <measure>Cannabis craving as measured by the marijuana craving questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.</time_frame>
    <description>The Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ) is a valid and reliable, self-report instrument with 47 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The 47 items are grouped by certain characteristics and the score of each of resulting groups correlates to the intensity of the four craving dimensions (compulsivity, emotionality, expectancy, and purposefulness). Total possible scores range from 47- 329.</description>

    <measure>Cannabis withdrawal as measured by the marijuana withdrawal checklist.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.</time_frame>
    <description>Cannabis withdrawal is measured by the 15-item version of the marijuana withdrawal checklist. In the marijuana withdrawal checklist, respondents rate each symptom experienced during their most recent period of marijuana abstinence, based on a 4-point scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. A total MWC score is obtained by summing the severity ratings. Total scores range from 0 - 45, with 0 as the least severe score and 45 as the highest score.</description>
