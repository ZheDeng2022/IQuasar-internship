  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current state of knowledge reveals that the development of the brain of preterm infants&#xD;
      is influenced by specific neonatal experiences during hospitalization, such as environmental&#xD;
      sensory stimulation (light and noise), as well as physical and emotional proximity to&#xD;
      mothers. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the benefits that could be associated&#xD;
      with the combination of care interventions to improve the health outcomes of preterm infants&#xD;
      and their mothers, and in particular the development of the brain of infants during their&#xD;
      hospitalization in the neonatal unit. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a developmental care intervention including periods of&#xD;
      nurturing between mothers and their infant (skin-to-skin contact and auditory stimulation) to&#xD;
      promote physical and emotional proximity and a quiet period (controlled light and noise&#xD;
      levels and olfactory stimulation in incubators) and to estimate the effect of this&#xD;
      intervention on infants' neurodevelopment as well as on maternal stress and anxiety.&#xD;
