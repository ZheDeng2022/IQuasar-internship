      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTELLiVENT-ASV, an automated closed-loop mode of mechanical ventilation, available on&#xD;
      Hamilton ventilators for clinical use, uses mainstream end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) monitoring to&#xD;
      adjust minute ventilation. However, sensors for mainstream etCO2 monitoring are expensive and&#xD;
      fragile. The less expensive and more robust sensors for sidestream etCO2 monitoring could&#xD;
      serve as a good alternative to sensors for mainstream etCO2 monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this randomized noninferiority trial is to determine whether INTELLiVENT-&#xD;
      ASV with sidestream capnography is noninferior to INTELLiVENT-ASV with mainstream capnography&#xD;
      with regard to the percentage of breaths in a broadly accepted predefined 'optimal' zone of&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that INTELLiVENT-ASV with sidestream capnography is noninferior&#xD;
      to INTELLiVENT-ASV with mainstream capnography with respect to the percentage of breaths a&#xD;
      patient spends within the 'optimal' zone of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTELLiSTREAM is a randomized noninferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of consecutive elective cardiac surgery patients who are&#xD;
      expected to need at least 2 hours of postoperative ventilation in the ICU of Amsterdam&#xD;
      Medical University Centers, location 'AMC'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortly after arrival at the ICU, patients will be randomized to receive either ventilation&#xD;
      with INTELLiVENT-ASV with mainstream capnography or sidestream capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is the percentage of breaths a patient spends inside the 'optimal'&#xD;
      zone of ventilation, as defined before (i.e. tidal volume &lt; 10 ml/kg PBW, maximum airway&#xD;
      pressure &lt; 30cm H2O, etCO2 between 30-46 mmHg and pulse oximetry between 93-98%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of time spent in other ventilation zones, as defined in the protocol. Time to&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing, duration of weaning, loss of etCO2 signal, duration of postoperative&#xD;
      ventilation and ventilator parameters as well as results of clinically indicated arterial&#xD;
      blood gas analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness Hamilton ventilators can use mainstream and sidestream etCO2 sensors.&#xD;
      INTELLiVENT-ASV is a safe mode of ventilation, also in patients who receive postoperative&#xD;
      ventilation. Furthermore, as all patients are sedated as part of standard care during&#xD;
      postoperative ventilation, the burden for the patient is minimal&#xD;
