    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program in improving&#xD;
      fatigue, negative emotions , sleep quality, circadian rhythms and quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The fatigue in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 1st,&#xD;
           2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The negative emotions in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group&#xD;
           at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The sleep quality in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at&#xD;
           1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The quality of life in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at&#xD;
           1st, 2nd,3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.&#xD;

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 :This scale is measured by the respondent self-assessed the frequency of various problems in the past week. The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of three subscales with 30 questions. The EORTC QLQ-C30 have three subscales in the scale include functioning scales (15 questions), symptom scales (13 questions), and global health status (2 questions). The reliability and validity of Cronbach'α was 0.81-0.94. The functional scale and the global health status , the higher the total score, the better the quality of life; the lower the score in the symptom scale, the better the quality of life.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by the bed partner or roommate (if one is available). Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. Actigraph is the gold standard for evaluating sleep disorders. As the name suggests, it is an electrophysiological recording of multiple parameters, including total sleep time(TST), sleep efficiency(SE), and sleep onset latency(SOL) which help to score various sleep stages.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by the bed partner or roommate (if one is available). Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. Actigraph is the gold standard for evaluating sleep disorders. As the name suggests, it is an electrophysiological recording of multiple parameters, including total sleep time(TST), sleep efficiency(SE), and sleep onset latency(SOL) which help to score various sleep stages.</description>

    <description>exercise education: A 12-week regimen of homebased walking exercises, include moderate intensity for 40 min, three times a week.&#xD;
We explained the participants how to perform the exercises, according to an instruction manual for the exercise regimen. Participants were instructed that the exercises would be effective only if they reached 40%-60% of the heart rate reserve, as determined by the Karvonen method, or 13-14 on the RPE.&#xD;
Exercise education:&#xD;
Weekly telephone or mobile application &quot;LINE&quot; consultations concerning exercise.we discussed whether participants' exercise fulfilled the prescribed intensity, duration, frequency and whether the participants experienced any adverse effects.</description>
