      The study will be completed in the following timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max testing. Visit 2-3: Trial 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit specific information is described below, however, specific data collection protocols&#xD;
      for dependent variables and procedures are included below the description of the study&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for a baseline and VO2max&#xD;
      testing day. Upon arrival to the lab, subjects will provide a urine sample in a clean urine&#xD;
      cup. Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will be also be&#xD;
      recorded. Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by&#xD;
      taking measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door,&#xD;
      and the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted&#xD;
      to continue to the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG)&#xD;
      &lt;1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. Height will be&#xD;
      measured with a tape measure on Visit 1. Percent body fat will be calculated using a 3-site&#xD;
      evaluation of skin fold thickness using skin fold calipers. A researcher will use appropriate&#xD;
      grasping technique to measure skin fold thickness on the chest, tricep, and abdomen. This&#xD;
      will take less than 5 minutes to complete. This information will be used to describe the&#xD;
      subject demographics. Participants will also be asked to complete a maximal oxygen uptake&#xD;
      (VO2max) test on a treadmill in a thermoneutral environment. This test will provide aerobic&#xD;
      fitness levels of the participants. This visit will take approximately 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2-3: Trials 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant numbers will be randomly assigned, and trials will be ordered with a random&#xD;
      number generator and assigned to a participant number. These orders will be counterbalanced&#xD;
      between participants to ensure that there is not an order effect, and each participant will&#xD;
      complete two trials as part of the study. Participants will be allowed to make-up trial&#xD;
      visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do not meet hydration requirements. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked if they have a current illness or taking medications to determine whether they&#xD;
      can complete the exercise trial. The participant's visit will be rescheduled if they have a&#xD;
      fever, current illness or taking medications that influence body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete two trials on two separate days in a randomized counter balanced&#xD;
      order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Cooling Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Passive Cooling&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Forearm Immersion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol, cooling intervention, and performance battery portions of this study&#xD;
      will be conducted in a climatic chamber with ambient temperature approximately 30-40C and&#xD;
      relative humidity at approximately 40-60%. Participants will drink approximately 1.4L of&#xD;
      water throughout the exercise trial. Upon arrival to the lab, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      indicate if they have consumed alcohol or caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours,&#xD;
      respectively. They will not be asked to specify exactly what they have consumed, but if they&#xD;
      provide a positive indication, their trial will be rescheduled for another day. Participants&#xD;
      will provide a small urine sample in a clean urine cup, and a nude body mass will be&#xD;
      measured. Upon arrival to the lab, hydration status will be assessed by urine specific&#xD;
      gravity, nude body mass and urine color. Participants will only be permitted to continue to&#xD;
      the exercise trial if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) &lt;1.025 is&#xD;
      met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked&#xD;
      to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. Participants will be given&#xD;
      instructions at the prior visit about how to obtain desired hydration status for the upcoming&#xD;
      trial. Participants will insert a rectal probe and wear a heart rate monitor strap.&#xD;
      Researchers will insert the esophageal probe. Additionally, participants will wear 4-site&#xD;
      skin temperature sensors. Researchers will apply the skin temperature sensors with medical&#xD;
      tape to the participants' chest, upper arm, thigh, and calf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enter the environmental chamber and sit for 10 minutes to become&#xD;
      equilibrated. Participants will wear a metabolic mask during this time to assess baseline&#xD;
      metabolic heat production. The environmental chamber will be set to 35C ambient temperature,&#xD;
      50% relative humidity. After baseline measures of heart rate, rectal temperature, and&#xD;
      metabolic heat production, participants will complete the perceptual indices. Participants&#xD;
      will also complete an environmental symptoms questionnaire (ESQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of three, 20-minute exercise bouts consisting of walking, running, and&#xD;
      sprinting at varying speeds ranging approximately 20-90% of their VO2max. Followed by a&#xD;
      12-minute &quot;half-time&quot; consisting of passive rest. Participants will then complete three more&#xD;
      20-minute exercise bouts consisting of walking, running, and sprinting at varying speeds&#xD;
      ranging approximately 20-90% of their VO2max, for a total of six 20-minute bouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each 20-minute exercise bout with be followed by a 3-minute break where cooling will occur.&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to drink 750mL of water throughout each exercise half for a&#xD;
      total of 1.4L. The participant will be cooled for approximately 3 minutes after each&#xD;
      20-minute exercise bout with their assigned cooling modality. Rectal temperature, esophageal&#xD;
      temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, perceptual measures, and metabolic heat production&#xD;
      will be collected at various time points before, during, and after exercise and cooling.&#xD;
      Following the completion of the six 20-minute exercise bouts, participants will perform the&#xD;
      performance battery. The performance battery will consist of an agility test, grip strength&#xD;
      test, broad-jump test, sprint test, and 1-mile time trial test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive Cooling: Participants will be asked to sit in a chair in the climate chamber for&#xD;
      passive cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forearm immersion: The participant will place both of their forearms in approximately 15C&#xD;
      water during forearm immersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each trial will be approximately 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devices will be properly cleaned according to manufacturer's instruction prior to use by&#xD;
      other participants.&#xD;
