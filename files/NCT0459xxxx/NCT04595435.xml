  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative Breast Radiation Therapy (IORT-Breast) utilizing the Xoft Axxent Electronic&#xD;
      Brachytherapy System (Xoft) has been recently introduced as a treatment option for women 50&#xD;
      years of age and older who have early stage, low risk Invasive Breast Cancer (IBC). Clinical&#xD;
      trials have shown IORT to be non-inferior to whole breast radiation, however some concern&#xD;
      continues with rates of recurrence and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the recent introduction and continued debate it is an excellent opportunity to observe&#xD;
      and monitor outcomes in the patients that are treated at Navicent Health through this&#xD;
      prospective, observational registry. The opportunity also permits examination of the&#xD;
      participant's thoughts and feeling on Quality of Life and Cosmetic Appearance&#xD;

      Objectives: (primary and important secondary objectives) The primary objective is to&#xD;
      determine rates of recurrence at 5, and 10 years following IORT-Breast at Navicent Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include determination of acute and late effects of IORT-Breast at the&#xD;
      treatment site, cosmetic outcomes and satisfaction over 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will determine why patients who were scheduled for IORT-Breast did not&#xD;
      receive it after lumpectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, observational registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting/Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study focuses on outpatients/short stay surgery performed at the Medical Center, Navicent&#xD;
      Health, Macon, GA only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have been deemed eligible for IORT-Breast or have received IORT-Breast within&#xD;
      the last 6 months. Key eligibility criteria for IORT- Breast includes women, aged 55 years&#xD;
      old or greater, diagnosed with clinically node negative, grade 1 or 2 Invasive Breast Cancer&#xD;
      with no lymphovascular invasion, that is 20mm or less in greatest dimension, Estrogen&#xD;
      Receptor (ER) positive, HER 2 Neu Negative, and with a depth greater than 10mm from skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions and Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be eligible for IORT-Breast or have received IORT-Breast in the previous 6&#xD;
      months. Participants who were scheduled for IORT-Breast and do not receive IORT-Breast will&#xD;
      have reasons for not receiving IORT-Breast recorded and will not be followed further.&#xD;
      Participants receiving IORT-Breast will have treatment parameters recorded and will be&#xD;
      followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually until up to 10 years following&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
