  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, exploratory two-arm trial to assess the effects&#xD;
      of CBD on driving ability along with changes in psychological status (i.e. mood, drowsiness,&#xD;
      sedation) and cognitive function. Forty healthy West Virginia University (WVU) students will&#xD;
      be allocated and randomized to receive: (1) 300 mg of pure CBD oil or (N=20) (2) placebo&#xD;
      matched in appearance and taste (N=20). After consuming the study drug, each individual will&#xD;
      participate in a 25-35-minute driving simulation and their driving performance measured. To&#xD;
      assess changes in psychological status (i.e. mood, drowsiness, sedation) and drug&#xD;
      impairment-related cognitive function, the Visual Analog Mood Scale, Stanford Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scale , Digital Symbol Substitution Test, Trail Making Test Part A and B, Psychomotor&#xD;
      Vigilance Test, and Simple Reaction Time test will also be administered to participants at&#xD;
      baseline (prior to study drug consumption) and following completion of the driving simulation&#xD;
      test. The entire protocol will be completed in one day and should take 4-4.5 hours to&#xD;
      complete for each participant.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 hours after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS). Mental sedation: sum of scores from questions 1, 4, 11, 13 on VAMS - higher scores indicate more mental sedation. Physical sedation: sum of scores from questions 3, 5, 6, 16 on VAMS - higher scores indicate more physical sedation. Each question is rated from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in baseline SSS</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS). Self-reported sleepiness, The SSS is a Likert-type scale which assess mental and physical sedation and sleepiness, respectively, at that moment and time. SSS only consists of 1 question that is scaled from 1 to 7, with 7 being a higher or worse score (i.e. more sleepy and sedated)</description>

    <measure>Change in baseline TMT</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT). Time to accurately complete Part A and Part B. The TMT measures executive function and consists of two parts; the first part requires participants to connect numbers in ascending order, while the second part requires individuals to connect numbers and letters in sequence. The test is scored by the time it takes to accurately complete each test. Increases in time correlate with greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in baseline DSST</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Number of symbols completed within 60 seconds. Number of correct symbols completed within 60 seconds. The test is scored by the degree of completion and accuracy over a timed 60 second period. More accurate completion (i.e. higher the score) indicates better cognitive functioning.</description>

    <description>Participant will either be given a 300mg dosage of CBD oil. After consumption of the study drug, the participant will wait for 120 minutes to allow for digestion and for CBD to begin taking effect. Next, individuals will undergo a driving simulation and all participants will drive the same course. The simulator presents the individual with real life driving scenarios and is equipped with screens, a steering wheel, signals, and pedals. The participant will be instructed to drive the course for 25-35 minutes. They will be instructed to follow normal driving rules. The simulation will include highway, suburban, rural, and urban driving scenarios which will incorporate turns, changes in speed, and avoidance of cars/pedestrians.</description>
