  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial in Phase I is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine in combination with devimistat in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      Clear Cell Sarcomas of the Soft Tissue and to describe the full toxicity profile. In Phase&#xD;
      II, the goal is to evaluate the response rate [Complete Rate (CR) + Partial Rate (PR)] of the&#xD;
      combination of devimistat and hydroxychloroquine in patients with relapse or refractory Clear&#xD;
      Cell Sarcoma of the Soft Tissue and to evaluate the PK and PK/PD profiles for efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the combination of devimistat and hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
