      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of vestibular dysfunction in&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury patients admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation. This study also&#xD;
      seeks to validate the AbilityLab Vestibular Screening Tool (AVeST) and the AVeST+, tools&#xD;
      designed to quickly screen individuals for vestibular dysfunction following traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 2.5 million hospital visits in the US each year for traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury. Vestibular dysfunction is a common sequela of traumatic brain injury (TBI) affecting&#xD;
      up to 50% of TBI patients at 5 years after injury. It is one of the most distressing problems&#xD;
      for caregivers following TBI. Further complicating this issue is the fact that many&#xD;
      individuals with TBI underestimate the severity of their balance deficits, which may further&#xD;
      increase the risk of falls and subsequent injury. Sitting balance on admission to inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation following TBI has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of&#xD;
      functional status at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Due to the multifaceted&#xD;
      presentation of vestibular dysfunction, evaluation is challenging, and there is currently no&#xD;
      standardized approach to screening. While the incidence of vestibular dysfunction has been&#xD;
      studied in mild TBI (mTBI) and sports related concussions, there is a gap in the literature&#xD;
      regarding the incidence of vestibular dysfunction in moderate to severe TBI patients in acute&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of having an established vestibular dysfunction screening and rehabilitation&#xD;
      program are multifold. Vestibular rehabilitation following TBI has demonstrated improvements&#xD;
      in cognitive function, ability to return to activities of daily living, ability to return to&#xD;
      work, and the need for assistance. While one prior single blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured vestibular rehabilitation program in TBI&#xD;
      individuals, there is a need for a large-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      screening for vestibular dysfunction in order to create a systematic approach. Many TBI&#xD;
      patients are not diagnosed with vestibular dysfunction until much later in their hospital&#xD;
      course which impedes participation in therapy and likely has a detrimental effect on their&#xD;
      rate of recovery. Identifying these patients earlier in their rehabilitation course will&#xD;
      allow interventions that will improve and accelerate patient outcomes. An additional benefit&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the incidence of vestibular dysfunction in moderate to severe&#xD;
      TBI patients to outline the necessary resources to care for patients with this problem. Data&#xD;
      collected will be utilized to validate the AVeST and the AVeST+. Additionally, this study&#xD;
      will fill a gap in the literature in delineating the incidence of vestibular impairment in&#xD;
      individuals with moderate to severe brain injury, a population heretofore not previously&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
