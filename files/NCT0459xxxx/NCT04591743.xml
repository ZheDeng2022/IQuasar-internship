  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco control is a Public Health priority. Tobacco is directly responsible for 75,000&#xD;
      deaths per year in France. Without help, less than 5% of smokers are still abstinent within&#xD;
      12 months of quitting. The use of nicotine substitutes only increases the chances of success&#xD;
      in smoking cessation by 2 to 3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain imaging research shows that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in&#xD;
      tobacco addiction. Disorders induced in the CPFDL cause an irrepressible desire to smoke&#xD;
      (craving) and explain a large part of the relapse at the time of smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could be promising in smoking cessation. This&#xD;
      technique allows direct stimulation of the DLPFC via a magnetic coil, so as to reduce the&#xD;
      cortical activity of the DLPFC, and thus reduce tobacco craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first randomized controlled study was conducted at the Dijon University Hospital in Dijon&#xD;
      in smokers who were heavily addicted and who had failed with the usual withdrawal strategies.&#xD;
      In this study, it was found that the combination of nicotine substitutes (to reduce the&#xD;
      physical symptoms of withdrawal) with 10 sessions of TCS (to reduce craving) made it possible&#xD;
      to maintain abstinence from tobacco during the first 2 weeks of withdrawal (% abstinence =&#xD;
      88.8% active TCS group vs. 50% placebo TCS group; p=0.027).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in this study, the therapeutic effect of the nicotine-TCS combination was not&#xD;
      prolonged once the stimuli stopped. At 6 and 12 weeks from the start of withdrawal,&#xD;
      abstinence rates in the active SMT and placebo SMT groups were no longer significantly&#xD;
      different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore proposed to renew the protocol by adding maintenance brain stimulation to the&#xD;
      initial protocol. Used in the treatment of depression, the maintenance brain stimuli could&#xD;
      increase the chances of smoking cessation.&#xD;
