  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare, benign inflammatory breast disease that&#xD;
      mimics malignancy owing to its features of appearance.In our research, we intended to compare&#xD;
      the efficiency of local (intralesional) steroid administration with systemic (peroral)&#xD;
      steroid. A total of 36 patients who had been histopathologically diagnosed with IGM and whose&#xD;
      other factors had been microbiologically excluded were included in the study. The patients&#xD;
      were randomized into two sub-groups that would be treated with systemic and local steroids.&#xD;
      Of the patients, 19 were administered with 0.5-1 mg/kg/day peroral systemic steroid, and 17&#xD;
      were administered with 40-200 mg/ml intralesional local steroid regarding the severity of the&#xD;
      lesion. All patients were evaluated through physical examination one week after the&#xD;
      completion of the treatment. Subsequently, the follow-up of the patients was performed&#xD;
      thorough physical examination and ultrasonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging at the&#xD;
      1st, 3rd, and 6th months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research was designed as a prospective randomized-controlled study.Prior to the study,&#xD;
      approval was obtained from the local ethics committee of our hospital (reg.:162)The diagnosis&#xD;
      of all patients was carried out through physical examination, imaging, and histopathology.&#xD;
      Prior to the treatment, microbiological analysis was conducted concurrently with the&#xD;
      biopsy.Patients who had contraindications with the use of steroids, those with active&#xD;
      infections, as well as patients who were pregnant, and who had been diagnosed with breast&#xD;
      cancer, were not included in the study. The patients were sub-divided into two groups as&#xD;
      Group S (systemic-peroral steroid) and Group L (local-intralesional steroid) by using the&#xD;
      sealed envelope randomization method. Group S: Medication of oral methylprednisolonewas&#xD;
      administered to the patients following the adjustment based on the severity of the lesion and&#xD;
      regarding the clinic. The prednisolone dose was 0.5 mg/kg/day in patients with painful, small&#xD;
      (&lt;5.0 cm) unilateral lesions whereas in multiple, bilateral lesions with the diameter of ≥5&#xD;
      cm or for those who had significant cutaneous ulceration, the prednisolone dose was specified&#xD;
      as 1 mg/kg/day. Patients were informed about potential adverse effects. The medication was&#xD;
      completed by reducing the dose. Patients in the systemic steroid group were advised to&#xD;
      receive the medication after eating, to restrict salt and sugar consumption throughout the&#xD;
      treatment, to quit smoking if they are using, and a proton pump inhibitor was started.Group&#xD;
      L: Triamcinolone acetonidewas administered to the patients through injecting inside the&#xD;
      lesion.The occurrence of systemic adverse effects in the course of the treatment was&#xD;
      considered as the reason to discontinue the medication in all groups. Follow-up examinations&#xD;
      of all patients at the 6th month were regarded as the endpoint of the treatment. As a&#xD;
      consequence, it can be stated that the local (intralesional) steroid administration is also a&#xD;
      treatment method, which is comparable to systemic steroid administration and had similar side&#xD;
      effects. Nonetheless, it will be appropriate to promote this method by performing studies,&#xD;
      which involve a larger population with more patients, and which is also long termed.&#xD;

The practice was based on the dose of TCA administered in acute and chronic inflammatory skin lesions. If the lesion is single-focused and small (&lt;5.0 cm), 20mg / mL TCA was injected and if the lesion is multifocal or large (&gt;5.0 cm) then 40mg / mL TCA was injected into the lesion with the guidance of ultrasonography</description>
