  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to help patients improve their health through screening and treatment of&#xD;
      risky alcohol and tobacco use. Previous studies show the best approach to reduce substance&#xD;
      use includes routine screening, short discussions with a clinician, and tailored resources.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, primary care providers (PCPs) do not often screen or provide evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions. PCPs report lack of confidence, lack of awareness, and competing priorities as&#xD;
      barriers to screening and providing evidence-based care. However, digital solutions can&#xD;
      enable patient-initiated screening and overcome barriers in a manner that has the potential&#xD;
      to be both efficient and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will test the feasibility of digital patient-initiated screening at the&#xD;
      WCH Family Practice (WCH FP) for alcohol and tobacco use, building on work from the first&#xD;
      iteration of Screen While You Wait (SWYW). The research team will email patients a secure&#xD;
      link to a survey with screening questions assessing substance use and important contextual&#xD;
      factors. The results will be summarized in the patient's chart with an automatic notification&#xD;
      to the PCP. If the survey reveals risky behaviours, both the PCP and patient will receive a&#xD;
      package of tailored resources for further care delivered through a customized website.&#xD;

      Burden of Alcohol and Tobacco: According to the World Health Organization (WHO),&#xD;
      approximately 5.9% of total global deaths are attributable to alcohol consumption. It is&#xD;
      estimated that tobacco kills more than 7 million people each year globally. In Ontario alone,&#xD;
      approximately 9,800 new cases of cancer diagnosed in a single year could be attributed to&#xD;
      tobacco, while 1,000 cases a year could be attributed to alcohol consumption. Despite this&#xD;
      evidence, 15.2% of Canadian adults reported drinking more alcohol than the low-risk&#xD;
      guidelines, while 15% reported using a tobacco product in the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addressing Alcohol and Tobacco Together: The health issues associated with tobacco and&#xD;
      alcohol use are diverse and pervasive. Many of the health concerns associated with each&#xD;
      substance are exacerbated by use of the other (i.e. smokers who also drink alcohol are at an&#xD;
      increased risk for cancers of the oral cavity). Further, it has been found that Ontarians who&#xD;
      drink alcohol above the recommended safe guidelines are more likely to be smokers. It thus&#xD;
      follows that any widespread screening program should target identification of both&#xD;
      behaviours. This is supported by recent work that found that alcohol and tobacco use are&#xD;
      &quot;often treated separately despite concurrent treatment potentially leading to better outcomes&#xD;
      for each&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCPs are uniquely positioned to impact health behaviours of their patients. Strong evidence&#xD;
      and relevant guidelines encourage PCPs to consistently ask about tobacco and alcohol use as a&#xD;
      crucial first step to identifying and treating risky behaviours. However, current clinical&#xD;
      practice does not live up to these guidelines. A recent report showed that only 23% of&#xD;
      patients in Canada had spoken with their providers about alcohol use in the past two years.&#xD;
      Furthermore, screening is often limited to periodic health exam visits (i.e. 'complete&#xD;
      physicals'), leading to missed opportunities to screen at visit types which may provide key&#xD;
      teachable moments, as well as missing patients who may not be coming in for preventative&#xD;
      health visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital, patient-initiated screening is increasingly being recognised as a promising method&#xD;
      to improve screening rates by overcoming commonly identified screening barriers. Several&#xD;
      small-scale studies have shown that digital, patient-initiated screening can be an efficient&#xD;
      method of systematic screening in primary care with high acceptance and usability by&#xD;
      patients. These methods may also empower patients to become more engaged in their own health&#xD;
      care, particularly those who are both most likely to have risky behaviours and least likely&#xD;
      to book preventative care visits.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention arm will receive a personalized eToolkit with community and electronic supports upon survey completion, and their PCP will receive automatic supports in the EMR to assess and treat the patient's alcohol and/or tobacco use. In cases where a patient does not have risky alcohol and tobacco use, a personalized eToolkit based on their physical activity levels will be administered, and their PCP will receive automatic supports in the EMR to facilitate physical activity discussions. Intervention arm patient participants will be asked to complete a baseline e-survey before their scheduled appointment, a process evaluation e-survey 3 days following their appointment, and a 3 months follow-up e-survey following their appointment. Resources will be automatically produced for the patient and PCP following completion of the baseline e-survey.</description>

    <description>A baseline e-survey will be sent to participants prior to their scheduled appointment to collect baseline alcohol/tobacco use levels as well as a series of questions evaluating precursors to behaviour change. If randomized into the intervention group, patients will be sent a link to a tailored toolkit based on their behaviours, motivation to change and other pertinent factors. Patients who identify as non-smokers and meet the low-risk drinking guideline, will complete a third screening survey for physical activity. The cumulative patient profile (CPP) status for the patient for alcohol/smoking will be automatically updated post-baseline survey, and the PCP will receive a notification via EMR about the status update. For patients identifying with risky behaviours, the PCP will receive a prompt to update the CPP for the patient and will receive a link, embedded in the EMR, to a PCP-facing toolkit that facilitates evidence-based intervention.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients aged &gt;18 who are rostered at WCH FP and have a clinical appointment&#xD;
             booked with their PCP in the next 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an email address in their EMR chart, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are under-screened for alcohol or tobacco use defined as either a) missing a tobacco&#xD;
             or alcohol use status documented in the appropriate section of the cumulative patient&#xD;
             profile (CPP) in their EMR or b) having an alcohol or tobacco use status that is&#xD;
             positive (defined as any status but: ex-smoker, non-smoker, &quot;rare&quot;-drinker or&#xD;
             non-drinker) and no CPX in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients booked for an urgent care appointment (noted in the EMR), as it would not be&#xD;
             appropriate to ask patients with acute issues (i.e., short-term severe injury or&#xD;
             illness requiring relatively urgent medical attention) to spend extended time&#xD;
             receiving alcohol and tobacco use counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active risky alcohol or tobacco use who are already undergoing&#xD;
             pharmacologic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant patients will be excluded as pathways for diagnosing, counselling&#xD;
             and treating substance use is different among this population. They will be identified&#xD;
             through a question before the informed consent form appears asking for the patient's&#xD;
             gender. If the patient identifies as a woman, a second question will appear that asks&#xD;
             if they are currently pregnant. If yes, the survey will end and the participant will&#xD;
             not be asked to complete the consent and survey.&#xD;
