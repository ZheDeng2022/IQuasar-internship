  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A constant load exercise during 10 minutes will be performed in a group of Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients, in a basal condition (spontaneous breathing); under&#xD;
      noninvasive mask ventilation and with high flow nasal cannula. With the aim of reducing&#xD;
      dyspnea, increasing exercise tolerance, and unload respiratory muscles, three exercises will&#xD;
      be compared in terms of use of respiratory muscles and neural drive measured with&#xD;
      paraesternal electromyography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is limited by dynamic hyperinflation and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle overloadleading to severe dyspnea. During exercise, the increase in neural&#xD;
      respiratory drive is notable to match ventilatory demand, correlated with breathlessness.&#xD;
      Non-Invasive Ventilation may improve neural respiratory drive uncoupling and exercise&#xD;
      tolerance. The aim of this study will be prove if Non-Invasive Ventilation and High flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula during exercise reduces neural respiratory drive and improves dyspnea, measured&#xD;
      with paraesternal electromyography&#xD;

    <description>the peak value (on the baseline) of the maximum muscle activity ( Root mean square EMG value in mV), both diaphragmatic (EMGDimax) and parasternal (EMGparamax) in the m√°ximum intentional ventilation and maximum inspiratory peak (MIP) will be taken. This value will be consider 100% and based on this mean EMG will be calculate for a normalized EMGdi (RMS) and paraesternal in each ventilatory situation (spontaneous ventilation or under NIV). At each effort point (in each minute of the exercise protocol), the relationship between the normalized EMG value (parasternal and Diaphragmatic) and the tidal volume (obtained by integral of flow signal by means of a pneumotachograph connected to the VM -in NIV- or oronasal hermetic mask -in Vesp). To facilitate the interpretation of the expired TV, the mask without leakage will be used with the intentional leak connected in the circuit, before the pneumotachograph.</description>
