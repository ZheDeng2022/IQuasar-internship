  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute radiodermatitis (ARD) is a distressing and painful skin reaction that occurs in 95% of&#xD;
      the patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). To date, there is still no general approved&#xD;
      guideline for the prevention and management of acute radiodermatitis. The 3M™ Cavilon™&#xD;
      Advanced Skin Protectant is a novel skin barrier protectant that acts as a physical barrier&#xD;
      against abrasion, moisture, and irritants. Moreover, it enables an environment for wound&#xD;
      healing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced Skin&#xD;
      Protectant in the prevention and management of ARD in patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant forms a film barrier intended to protect intact or damaged skin. It is effective in conditions where skin is frequently or continuously exposed to moisture and caustic irritants such as feces, digestive fluids, wound drainage and urine. Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant also can be used in areas exposed to friction and shear from bedding, clothing, shoes or any other material that would rub against the skin.&#xD;
The skin barrier protectant will be applied on the irradiated skin from the third week of radiotherapy until 1 week after the final radiotherapy session.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant</intervention_name>
    <description>3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced Skin Protectant is a polymeric-cyanoacrylate solution intended for the protection of intact or damaged skin. Upon application to skin, the liquid dries rapidly to form a primary long-lasting waterproof, highly durable film barrier. It is elastomeric, adhering to the contours of the skin and providing a uniform film. The film is transparent and possesses good oxygen and moisture vapor permeability.&#xD;
The polymer-cyanoacrylate is dispersed in a non-stinging solvent. The film is colorless, non-cytotoxic and has a low dermatitis potential. The film adheres to dry, moist or wet skin surfaces and remains intact during conditions of continuous or repeated exposure to moisture or caustic irritants. It will wear off the skin and does not require removal.</description>
