    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of each individual dose of esketamine&#xD;
      nasal spray, 56 milligram (mg) and 84 mg, compared with placebo nasal spray in improving&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in participants with treatment resistant depression (TRD), as assessed by&#xD;
      the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score&#xD;
      from Day 1 (prerandomization) to the end of the 4 week double-blind treatment phase (Day 28).&#xD;

    <description>MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th&#xD;
             edition) (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for single-episode MDD or recurrent MDD, without&#xD;
             psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the MINI.&#xD;
             Participants 65 years of age or older must have had the first onset of depression&#xD;
             prior to 55 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have had nonresponse (&lt;=25% improvement) to &gt;=2 oral antidepressant&#xD;
             treatments in the current episode of depression, assessed using the MGH-ATRQ, and&#xD;
             confirmed by documented records (example, medical/pharmacy/prescription records or a&#xD;
             letter from a treating physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have an Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician rated,&#xD;
             30-item (IDS-C30) total score of &gt;=34&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant's current major depressive episode, depression symptom severity, and&#xD;
             antidepressant treatment response in the current depressive episode, must be confirmed&#xD;
             by the State vs. Trait, Assessibility, Face Validity, Ecological Validity, Rule of&#xD;
             Three P's (SAFER) Interview&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical&#xD;
             history, vital signs (including blood pressure), and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
             performed in the screening phase. If there are any abnormalities that are not&#xD;
             specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the determination of their clinical&#xD;
             significance must be determined by the investigator and recorded in the participant's&#xD;
             source documents and initiated by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
             performed in the screening phase. If the results of the serum chemistry panel,&#xD;
             hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may&#xD;
             be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from&#xD;
             normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the&#xD;
             population under study. This determination must be recorded in the participant's&#xD;
             source documents and initialed by the investigator: (a) Participants with a&#xD;
             pre-existing history of thyroid disease/disorder who are treated with thyroid hormones&#xD;
             must be on a stable dosage for 3 months prior to the start of the screening phase; (b)&#xD;
             For any participant (regardless of thyroid history), if the thyroid-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone (TSH) value is out of range, a free thyroxine (FT4) will be conducted. If the&#xD;
             FT4 value is abnormal and considered to be clinically significant (after discussion&#xD;
             with the medical monitor), the participant is not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be comfortable with self-administration of nasal spray medication and&#xD;
             be able to follow the nasal spray administration instructions provided&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has used ketamine/esketamine (lifetime)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant's depressive symptoms have previously demonstrated nonresponse to an&#xD;
             adequate course of treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the current major&#xD;
             depressive episode, defined as at least 7 treatments with unilateral/bilateral ECT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) or has received deep brain&#xD;
             stimulation (DBS) in the current episode of depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a current or history of seizures (uncomplicated childhood febrile&#xD;
             seizures with no sequelae are not exclusionary)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has any anatomical or medical condition that, per the investigator's&#xD;
             clinical judgment based on assessment, may impede delivery or absorption of nasal&#xD;
             spray study drug&#xD;
