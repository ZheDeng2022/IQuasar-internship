          3. Diagnosed with cervical cancer by histology/cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with relapsed or metastatic cervical cancer who have had progressed or&#xD;
             relapsed after receiving at least first-line of platinum-based chemotherapy (if a&#xD;
             patient has progressed or relapsed during or within 6 months after receiving&#xD;
             platinum-based neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, she will be deemed to have&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. The subject's previous systemic treatment must have ended ≥4 weeks before the first&#xD;
             study administration, and the treatment-related AEs have recovered to Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0 grade ≤1 (except for alopecia and&#xD;
             fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of other malignant tumors within 5 years before the first administration,&#xD;
             excluding radically cured skin basal cell carcinoma, skin squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             radically resected carcinoma in situ and/or thyroid papillary carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusion with clinical symptoms or&#xD;
             requiring drainage (patients with effusion that does not require drainage or patients&#xD;
             with no significant increase in the effusion within 3 days after stopping drainage can&#xD;
             be selected).&#xD;

          3. Patients who are planning to undergo or have previously received organ or bone marrow&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;

          4. Patients with acute or chronic active hepatitis B or C infection, hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             (HBV) DNA&gt; 200 IU/ml or 10^3 copies/ml; hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive and&#xD;
             HCV-RNA level higher than the lower limit of detection. Patients with acute or chronic&#xD;
             active hepatitis B or C infection who have received nucleotide antiviral therapy and&#xD;
             are below the above standards can be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Meningeal metastases or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients&#xD;
             with asymptomatic brain metastases who do not need treatment with glucocorticoids,&#xD;
             anticonvulsants or mannitol after radiotherapy can be enrolled.&#xD;
