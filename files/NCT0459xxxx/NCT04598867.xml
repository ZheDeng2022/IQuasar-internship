      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of CD-008-0045 in patients with generalized anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (GAD). Each patient will participate in the study for the period of approximately 37 weeks:&#xD;
      Screening and Run-in period: 1 week; Study Treatment period: 32 weeks; Follow-up period: 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study drug CD-008-0045 has a multi-targeted activity, i.e., able to inhibit adrenergic,&#xD;
      dopamine, serotonin, and histamine receptors, thus allowing to assume its wide therapeutic&#xD;
      potential. At Screening, the patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      included into one-week single-blind Placebo Run-in period. At Week 0 the patients will be&#xD;
      start double-blind Placebo and active comparator treatment period. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive CD-008-0045 40 mg daily or Placebo or Afobazol (fabomotizole) for 8&#xD;
      weeks. After that, there will be an open-label treatment period for 26 weeks. The potential&#xD;
      withdrawal syndrome will be assessed during four-week Follow-up Period.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of CD-008-0045 in patients with GAD. The primary study objective is To assess the efficacy of CD-008-0045 at a dose 20 mg BID vs Placebo and Afobazol based on the change of the total score of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) structured interview at Week 8 from baseline. Treatment response is considered the difference between group CD-008-0045 and Placebo is 5.5 points decrease of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) total score from baseline.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Double (Participant, Investigator) Dose blinding will be performed using Placebo. Patient will receive 2 vials labeled for study drug administration as follows: 1 capsule in the morning, and evening.&#xD;
Package numbers were assigned via IWRS. Thus, during the Study Treatment period, neither the patient nor the Investigator knew the group to which the patient was allocated. Single blinding was performed during the Placebo Run-in and Follow-up periods.</masking_description>
