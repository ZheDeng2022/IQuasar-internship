  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label study evaluating the safety, clinical pharmacology and clinical&#xD;
      activity of TNB-486, a CD19 x CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, in subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) who have received 2 or more prior&#xD;
      lines of therapy. The study consists of 3 parts, a monotherapy dose escalation (Arm A), a&#xD;
      monotherapy dose expansion in subjects with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or&#xD;
      high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) (Arm B), and a monotherapy dose expansion in subjects with&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma (FL) (Arm C). Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase&#xD;
      2 dose (RP2D) is identified in Arm A, Arm B and Arm C will be initiated to further&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the MTD/RP2D dose&#xD;
      of TNB-486 monotherapy in subsets of subjects with DLBCL/HGBL or FL.&#xD;

    <description>The incidence, timing, seriousness, and relationship to study treatments of adverse events will be evaluated. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
