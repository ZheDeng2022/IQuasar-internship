  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 patients were recruited by two hospitals (AOUP and AOUC) in Italy from January 2015 to&#xD;
      January 2018. The participants have been addressed to two different groups: the ones&#xD;
      recruited by the AOUP were submitted to an experimental protocol of rehabilitation with FES&#xD;
      Cycling, the ones recruited by the AOUC were submitted to a standard protocol of manual&#xD;
      mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the thigh circumferences measured at 4 different levels (5-10-15-20&#xD;
      cm) from the superior margin of the patella, while the secondary outcomes were the muscle&#xD;
      tone evaluated with Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the sensation of pain registered with&#xD;
      International Spinal Cord Injury - Pain Basic Data Set (ISCI-P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these outcomes the Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) was obtained. The costs of the&#xD;
      two treatments were calculated through a consultation process with the Competent Offices of&#xD;
      the two hospitals. The QALYs and the costs were used to calculate the Incremental&#xD;
      Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) in order to verify the cost-effectiveness ratio of the two&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
