  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of Prokera Slim in adults with primary or&#xD;
      recurrent herpetic epithelial keratitis in terms of visual function, corneal opacity, time to&#xD;
      resolution, cost of care, number of patient visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cryopreserved amniotic membrane (AM) contains anti-inflammatory, anti-scarring and&#xD;
      antiangiogenic effects known in treating many ocular surface diseases. This notion is further&#xD;
      strengthened by many studies showing that amniotic membrane can effectively control&#xD;
      inflammation in HSV stromal keratitis in a murine model of HSV necrotizing keratitis and&#xD;
      surgical application in ~7 human studies of epithelial and stromal HSV keratitis with or&#xD;
      without an adjuvant antiviral therapy. More importantly, PROKERA SLIM in conjunction with&#xD;
      oral acyclovir has been shown to facilitate the ease of early intervention to accelerate&#xD;
      restoration in herpetic keratitis in 2 case series of 5 eyes. However, a formal prospective&#xD;
      study has not been performed.&#xD;
