  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the requirements for the sulphur amino acids in adults over the&#xD;
      age of 60 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the total sulphur amino acid requirement as methionine only. Methionine is an essential&#xD;
           amino acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the minimum methionine requirement as methionine in the presence of excess dietary&#xD;
           cysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that protein and amino acid metabolism may be altered with age and methionine and&#xD;
      cysteine, in particular, may be important in the diet of older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 7 different levels of methionine intake as methionine only (no dietary cysteine) and up&#xD;
      to 7 different levels of methionine intake in the presence of excess dietary cysteine will be&#xD;
      tested in each subject in random order. Each level of intake will involve a 3-day maintenance&#xD;
      diet, with measures being collected on the third.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sulphur amino acids (SAA) are methionine and cysteine. Methionine is essential and must&#xD;
      be obtained from the diet whereas cysteine is considered non-essential and is synthesized&#xD;
      from methionine. They have many other important roles that are secondary to their role in&#xD;
      protein building. For example, they are needed to make the antioxidant glutathione (GSH),&#xD;
      which protects the body's cells from damage. However, protein and GSH metabolism have been&#xD;
      shown to change with age and hence, the SAA requirements may also be changed. Despite this,&#xD;
      current SAA requirements are based on studies conducted in young adults. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      need to determine the SAA requirements directly in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to apply the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation&#xD;
      (IAAO) protocol to determine the SAA requirements in healthy adults over 60 years of age. The&#xD;
      requirements will be determined as (1) the total sulphur amino acid requirement as methionine&#xD;
      only and (2) the minimum methionine requirement by providing methionine in the presence of&#xD;
      excess dietary cysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-study assessment will be conducted to assess health status using: medical history and a&#xD;
      physical exam; and a blood draw (10mL) for fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c to test&#xD;
      for diabetes, vitamin B and folate concentrations, and urea and creatinine to test renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the requirements, each participant will be studied at up to 7 varying&#xD;
      intakes levels of methionine in random order. Each intake level will be studied over 3-days:&#xD;
      two adaptation days (day 1 and 2) and one study day (day 3). On the adaptation days,&#xD;
      participants will be provided with a milkshake diet providing all the protein and nutrients&#xD;
      they need. Participants will consume 4 meals/day in their usual home environment. On the 3rd&#xD;
      day participants will come to the Clinical Research Centre at SickKids where they will be&#xD;
      given hourly meals and breath and urine samples at specified times.A blood sample will also&#xD;
      be collected for analysis of serum insulin, glucose and secondary parameters (i.e.&#xD;
      concentrations of amino acids, glutathione, homocysteine and CRP). The mean (estimate average&#xD;
      requirement) total sulphur amino acid requirement and minimum methionine requirement will be&#xD;
      calculated with breakpoint analysis using a two-phase linear regression crossover analysis.&#xD;
