      The investigators will seek to determine the safety and efficacy of high-dose amiodarone&#xD;
      (2000mg), given as a single uniform oral dose, for the treatment of acute atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      in both a hospital inpatient and ambulatory outpatient setting. The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a placebo-controlled randomized trial, with outcome ascertainment at 48h.&#xD;

      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is estimated to affect over 33 million people worldwide&#xD;
      and is often associated with significant co-morbidities such as myocardial infarction, heart&#xD;
      failure, dementia, and embolic stroke. Consequently, AF poses a significant burden to the&#xD;
      healthcare system, in both direct and indirect costs of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of AF in the acute setting is complex, especially for patients who suffer from&#xD;
      persistent AF, defined as sustained AF for &gt; 7 days. While one possible treatment strategy&#xD;
      involves allowing AF to continue whilst controlling the ventricular rate (i.e. rate control),&#xD;
      in certain cases, it is preferable to terminate the AF and restore normal sinus rhythm (i.e.&#xD;
      rhythm control) for relief of intolerable symptoms associated with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several methods currently in use for rhythm control, including observation without&#xD;
      intervention, use of oral and/or intravenous anti-arrhythmic drugs for pharmacological&#xD;
      cardioversion, and electrical cardioversion. However, each of these strategies come with&#xD;
      significant limitations. Amiodarone was originally developed for treatment of angina, but is&#xD;
      now widely recognized for its anti-arrhythmic properties. Current American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend the&#xD;
      use of amiodarone as a cardioversion agent in both intravenous and oral administration.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the use of oral amiodarone is considered the standard of care for rhythm&#xD;
      management in AF. Prior studies have demonstrated that the administration of a single, oral&#xD;
      converting dose of amiodarone has similar rates of sinus rhythm conversion at 24 hours&#xD;
      post-intervention compared to Vaughan-Williams Class 1C anti-arrhythmic medications. The use&#xD;
      of amiodarone as a first-line therapy for AF is appealing when considering its safety&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the safety and efficacy of high-dose amiodarone, given as a single&#xD;
      uniform oral dose, for the treatment of acute AF in a hospital inpatient setting and acute&#xD;
      persistent AF in an outpatient ambulatory clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will be a double-blind randomized controlled trial in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic AF. Amiodarone and placebo capsules will be prepared in single dose packs. A&#xD;
      single dose pack will consist of either 2000 mg of amiodarone hydrochloride crushed and&#xD;
      placed in 10 gel capsules of 200 mg each, or 10 gel capsules of crushed placebo. Individual&#xD;
      dose packs will then be randomly assigned to participants with a unique research number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate inpatients will be identified through emergency room presentation, outpatient&#xD;
      clinic admissions, or inpatient consultation. Once participants have been consented and&#xD;
      allocated a study number, they will be randomly assigned a dose pack. Participants will be&#xD;
      required to ingest the entire 10 capsule dose pack in one sitting with food witnessed by one&#xD;
      of the study investigators or a designated study nurse. Following drug administration,&#xD;
      participants will have cardiac monitoring and regular vital sign measurements for up to 48&#xD;
      hours. The investigators will provide the participants with a diary to record any potential&#xD;
      adverse side effect symptoms, and the participant will be given the phone number of a study&#xD;
      team member to contact if they are concerned about any adverse effects. After the 48 hour&#xD;
      period, a study team member will contact the participant and ask specifically about potential&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate outpatients will be identified through emergency room presentation or outpatient&#xD;
      clinics not requiring hospital admission. Once participants have been consented and allocated&#xD;
      a study number, they will be assigned a dose pack. Participants will be required to ingest&#xD;
      the entire 10 capsule dose pack in one sitting with food. The time of capsule ingestion will&#xD;
      be recorded. Following drug administration, participants will be provided with a portable&#xD;
      cardiac monitor to wear for 48 hours. History taking of potential adverse side effect&#xD;
      symptoms will be performed on a daily basis, or more frequently if required. After the 48&#xD;
      hour period, a 12-lead electrocardiogram with be performed to confirm of successful reversion&#xD;
      to sinus rhythm, continuing AF, or other heart rhythm. The portable cardiac monitor will be&#xD;
      retrieved and analyzed for evidence of time to successful reversion to sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enrol 42 AF patients, with 21 patients randomized to oral&#xD;
      amiodarone and 21 patients randomized to placebo.&#xD;
