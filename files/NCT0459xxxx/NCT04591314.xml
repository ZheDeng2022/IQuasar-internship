      Neurofeedback is a cognitive remediation technique that allows a subject to learn to regulate&#xD;
      their cognitive and brain activity through information provided in real time about their&#xD;
      brain activity, in particular electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity. Neurofeedback&#xD;
      could, through its impact on the degree of neuronal synchronization, help to reduce the&#xD;
      impact of sleep deprivation on wakefulness and cognitive performance. The main objective is&#xD;
      to study the effect of a program of 8 sessions of neurofeedback targeting EEG theta / beta&#xD;
      activities, to modify the degree of neuronal synchronization, on the ability to maintain&#xD;
      objective wakefulness measured by a maintenance wakefulness test (MWT) in healthy subjects&#xD;
      presenting objective excessive daytime sleepiness after a full night of sleep deprivation&#xD;
      under controlled experimental conditions. The objective of this study will also provide a&#xD;

      Neurofeedback is a cognitive remediation technique that allows a subject to learn to regulate&#xD;
      their cognitive and brain activity through information provided in real time about their&#xD;
      brain activity, in particular electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity. Neurofeedback has&#xD;
      been used to regulate EEG amplitude in certain spectral bands, which correlate with the&#xD;
      degree of neural synchronization. Neurofeedback makes it possible in particular to reduce the&#xD;
      amplitude of the EEG theta spectral band (4-8 Hz) and to increase the EEG beta spectral band&#xD;
      (&gt; 12Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of protocol has been used successfully to reduce the degree of neural&#xD;
      synchronization and to stimulate arousal systems and sustained attention skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on healthy subjects submitted to controlled sleep deprivation have shown that&#xD;
      inducing a full night of sleep deprivation is a good model for studying the brain mechanisms&#xD;
      of arousal and the links with cognitive functions, but also to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      counter measures reducing the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance. These&#xD;
      experimental models provide a better understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of the&#xD;
      complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). EDS is indeed a frequent symptom affecting&#xD;
      between 5% and 8% of the population. The consequence of EDS is a decrease in quality of life.&#xD;
      In addition, the EDS entails a high medico-economic cost because of the accidental risk of&#xD;
      the public and professional roads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofeedback could, through its impact on the degree of neuronal synchronization, help to&#xD;
      reduce the impact of sleep deprivation on wakefulness and cognitive performance. Thus, it&#xD;
      appears relevant to assess the effectiveness of neurofeedback, targeting activities in the&#xD;
      theta / beta EEG spectral band, on wakefulness and cognitive performance in healthy subjects&#xD;
      with EDS due to sleep deprivation. Targeting the degree of neuronal EEG synchronization would&#xD;
      then be an innovative avenue for improving the physiological mobilization of arousal systems&#xD;
      and wakefulness and cognitive performance in the event of EDS. This cognitive remediation&#xD;
      technique could in particular be proposed as a complement to pharmacological treatment in&#xD;
      treated patients suffering from hypersomnolence disorder presenting a residual EDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the effect of a program of 8 sessions of neurofeedback&#xD;
      targeting EEG theta / beta activities, to modify the degree of neuronal synchronization, on&#xD;
      the ability to maintain objective wakefulness measured by a maintenance wakefulness test&#xD;
      (MWT) in healthy subjects presenting objective excessive daytime sleepiness after a full&#xD;
      night of sleep deprivation under controlled experimental conditions. The objective of this&#xD;
      study will also provide a better understanding of the learning modulation mechanisms of&#xD;
      arousal systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the effect of a program of 8 sessions of neurofeedback targeting theta / beta&#xD;
           EEG activities, in healthy subjects after a full night of sleep deprivation presenting&#xD;
           objective excessive daytime sleepiness, on the instantaneous subjective arousal level in&#xD;
           a situation controlled (MWT and neurofeedback session) by the Karolinska sleepiness&#xD;
           scale (KSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the effect of a program of 8 sessions of neurofeedback targeting theta / beta&#xD;
           EEG activities, in healthy subjects after a full night of sleep deprivation presenting&#xD;
           objective excessive daytime sleepiness, on the cognitive performance, before and after&#xD;
           neurofeedback sessions, assessed by the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and by the Test&#xD;
           of Attentional Performance (TAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the functional reorganization of the EEG activities of the brain, in particular&#xD;
           the degree of neuronal synchronization between the different regions of the scalp, in&#xD;
           subjects presenting objective excessive daytime sleepiness after a full night of sleep&#xD;
           deprivation and following a program of 8 neurofeedback sessions targeting EEG theta /&#xD;
           beta activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study a learning effect during the 8 neurofeedback sessions evaluated by measuring&#xD;
           the evolution of the modulation of the spectral power in the theta / beta band during&#xD;
           each neurofeedback session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To study the prognostic learning factors during the 8 neurofeedback sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To study the prognostic factors for clinical improvement of MWT, subjective EDS and&#xD;
           cognitive performance.&#xD;
