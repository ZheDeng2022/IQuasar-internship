  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study is a randomized, double-blind study that seeks to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      effects and safety of fucoidan in the treatment of cancer patients with stage III/IV head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Fucoidan or placebo&#xD;
      (potato starch) Eligible subjects will receive fucoidan twice daily (BID) in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy over a 24-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical effects and safety parameters for all subjects who complete the treatment period&#xD;
      will be followed for an additional 72 weeks after the treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>Fucoidan refers to a class of fucose-enriched sulfated polysaccharides with an average molecular weight of 20,000 Daltons (Da), which can be found in many varieties of edible brown seaweeds and algae . In cell culture studies and animal studies, fucoidan has been shown to possess a range of biological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory effects . A recent in vitro study conducted in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines (H103, FaDu, and KB) showed that fucoidan could induce cell cycle arrest and possibly apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, while also enhancing response to cisplatin treatment . In addition, fucoidan has also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and MC3 human mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) cells .</description>
