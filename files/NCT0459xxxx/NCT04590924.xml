      Patients with femoroacetabular impingement will be investigated 5 years after surgery. We&#xD;
      will used the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Score to evaluate pain, activities of daily living,&#xD;
      sport, participation in sport and hip-related quality of life. Furthermore, degree of hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis will be evaluated using standing x-rays. Last, we will investigate number of&#xD;
      re-operations and conversions to total hip replacement.&#xD;
