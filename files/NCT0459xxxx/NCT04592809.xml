  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a double-blind, randomized, active-control trial of adolescents (ages&#xD;
      13-18 years) with recent suicidal behaviors (suicide attempt or increased suicidal ideation).&#xD;
      All participants will be treated through a suicide prevention IOP (typically 6-8 weeks), as&#xD;
      well as clinically indicated psychosocial and/or psychopharmacological treatments.&#xD;
      Ketamine/midazolam treatment will occur twice weekly during the first two weeks of the study,&#xD;
      followed by weekly assessments through week 12.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth patients (ages 13-18) who have recent suicidality (defined as suicidal ideation or&#xD;
      behavior), and who are enrolled or expected to be enrolled in an intensive outpatient program&#xD;
      (IOP) will be recruited for participation in the study. Upon informed consent/assent,&#xD;
      baseline data will be collected regarding mood symptoms, suicidal ideation and behavior,&#xD;
      associated comorbidities, and treatment history. Youth participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      ketamine or midazolam, which will be provided twice weekly for two weeks. Participants will&#xD;
      then have follow-up assessments visits through week 12 to continue to monitor outcomes.&#xD;
      Participants may be recruited directly from the IOP or from the ED or inpatient psychiatric&#xD;
      unit, provided they have undergone evaluation and are confirmed to begin IOP treatment. The&#xD;
      baseline visit and first infusion must be +/- 10 days of IOP enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of 264 subjects is expected to take place over a period of approximately 36&#xD;
      months. Enrolled participants will be involved in the study for approximately 14 weeks&#xD;
      (screening plus 12 weeks of study follow-up visits). Visits include a Screening Visit, a&#xD;
      Baseline, 4 Study Intervention Visits, and 10 Follow-Up Visits. Multiple streams of outcome&#xD;
      measures will be utilized for this protocol, including self-report measures, research&#xD;
      assessor-completed measures, clinic level measures, and behavioral measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Evaluate reduction in frequency of suicidal events associated with two-week&#xD;
      twice-weekly course of ketamine treatment versus midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate reduction in implicit suicidal cognition with ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Evaluate reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidality with ketamine.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The investigator, patient, and study staff will be blinded. Packaging and labeling of the study drugs will be performed by the research pharmacy in a way to ensure blinding throughout the study.&#xD;
No members of the study team will have access to the randomization scheme during the conduct of the study. The Research Pharmacist and the CDRC (Center for Depression Research and Clinical Care) Program Manager will have access to the treatment assignment in the event of an emergency. The treatment code must not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the patient necessitates knowledge of the treatment randomization. The investigator retains the right to break the code for serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to a study drug and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.</masking_description>

    <description>Concise Health Risk Tracking Clinician-Rated Behavior Module (CHRT-C) will be used to identify suicidal events.

At the initial administration, this instrument captures lifetime information; at subsequent administrations, it will capture information since the last visit.</description>

             abstinence, or sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Study participants must not:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have lifetime schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, or&#xD;
             mental retardation;&#xD;

             (based on MINI-KID). If there is a positive urine drug screen at screening, the urine&#xD;
             drug screen will be repeated at each infusion visit. Positive urine drug screen will&#xD;
             be reviewed by study physician and infusion will proceed as long as no safety risk was&#xD;
             identified;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If female, be pregnant, lactating, or nursing. Women of childbearing potential must&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Have unstable medical conditions or with clinically significant laboratory values or&#xD;
             an electrocardiogram (ECG) that would pose significant risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be at serious suicidal risk that cannot be managed in the outpatient setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have prior treatment for depression with or contraindications to ketamine, esketamine,&#xD;

             dextromethorphan and opioids will be asked to discontinue for at least 1 week or 5&#xD;
             half-lives whichever is longer. This applies to the screening period. During this&#xD;
             2-week period, these medications will be avoided, and their use permitted to manage&#xD;
             any new side effects as long as their use does not increase the risk of study-drug&#xD;
             infusion. ADHD stimulant medications will be permitted with last dose at least 24&#xD;
             hours prior to infusion. All concomitant medications will be evaluated by the study&#xD;
             physician to determine if the type and dose of concomitant medication requires&#xD;
             discontinuation and will be excluded if the concomitant medication could substantially&#xD;
             increase the risk of study infusion.&#xD;
