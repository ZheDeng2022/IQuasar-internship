      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of single injection of it-hMSC in patients with ischemic stroke in a multicenter, blind,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo controlled trial&#xD;

      Stroke is a leading cause of disability. According to the comprehensive standardized&#xD;
      prevalence estimation in 2016, 12.42 million people older than 40 years in China are&#xD;
      currently suffering from stroke or have ever suffered from stroke. The overall prevalence&#xD;
      rate of stroke in China was 1,596 per 100,000 people in 2016, 4.6 times higher than the rate&#xD;
      of 345.1 per 100,000 people in 2013 and 70% of the survivors have disabilities in varying&#xD;
      degrees. In addition to rehabilitation therapy, there is no therapeutic drugs of remarkable&#xD;
      curative effect for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. The latest data show that the&#xD;
      annual recurrence rate of ischemic stroke in China is as high as 17.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in many clinical studies for different&#xD;
      diseases. In addition to differentiating into multiple cell types and promoting the recovery&#xD;
      and repair of the brain by replacing damaged cells, mesenchymal stem cells also secrete&#xD;
      cytokines and neurotrophic factors to support and stimulate the growth of other endogenous&#xD;
      cells. Meanwhile, mesenchymal stem cells also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory&#xD;
      functions. These characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells provide a new therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of stroke.&#xD;
