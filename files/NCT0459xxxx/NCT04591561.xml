  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients often develop endocrine and metabolic changes, particularly&#xD;
      disruptions of glucose homeostasis that result in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.Stress&#xD;
      hyperglycemia commonly occurs in children with critical illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress hyperglycemia results from increased gluconeogenesis relative to the clearance of&#xD;
      glucose as well as from the development of insulin resistance affecting glucose uptake. These&#xD;
      mechanisms are mediated through increased production of counteracting hormones (i.e.,&#xD;
      epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon, and growth hormone). Furthermore, stress&#xD;
      hyperglycemia is associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions. Those factors in turn inhibit the secretion of insulin by&#xD;
      pancreatic β cells through α-adrenergic receptor stimulation, interfere with insulin receptor&#xD;
      signaling and/or insulin-regulated glucose channels, and directly interfere with proper&#xD;
      glucose transport and utilization in peripheral cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated the association of stress hyperglycemia in critically ill&#xD;
      children with mortality. Specifically, peak and duration of stress hyperglycemia appear to be&#xD;
      associated with mortality. Peak blood glucose concentrations tend to be much higher in non&#xD;
      survivors compared with survivors. Similarly, non survivors tend to have exposure to longer&#xD;
      duration of stress hyperglycemia compared with survivors. This association of stress&#xD;
      hyperglycemia with mortality appears across different pediatric disease states, including&#xD;
      septic shock, burns, traumatic brain injury, post cardiac surgery, and trauma. Additionally,&#xD;
      stress hyperglycemia is associated with longer periods of ICU and hospital stay and more&#xD;
      frequent nosocomial infections, including surgical site infections in critically ill&#xD;
      children. While all these studies demonstrate strong associations between stress&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes, they do not necessarily demonstrate a cause and&#xD;
      effect relationship.&#xD;

        Children with blood glucose above 200 mg/dl on admission to the emergency department will&#xD;
        be considered to have hyperglycemia. Data will be collected . The blood sugar values will&#xD;
        be followed up in these children until restoration of normoglycemia. All the children will&#xD;
        be followed up till discharge or death in case of mortality&#xD;
