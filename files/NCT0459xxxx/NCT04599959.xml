Two samples were taken by medical staff from each participant on the test day, one using a swab (oropharyngeal swab) and the other through saliva collected with Salivette® Cortisol. The collected samples were then shipped and analyzed in Germany.&#xD;
Additional up to two samples (swab and/or saliva) were taken for each participant on the test day and analyzed in Mexico.</description>
