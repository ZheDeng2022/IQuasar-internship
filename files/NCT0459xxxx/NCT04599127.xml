    <textblock>
      This study conducted to see the effect of adding mobilization with movement to conventional&#xD;
      physical therapy to the subject with shoulder impingement syndrome. The shoulder impingement&#xD;
      syndrome is often described as anterior lateral shoulder pain that provoked during shoulder&#xD;
      elevation. The pain occurs during shoulder elevation and causes limited range of motion.&#xD;
      Moreover, the patients with shoulder impingement syndrome commonly had a forward head posture&#xD;
      and slouching shoulder. There is a theory that illustrates the mechanical factors lead to the&#xD;
      injury of the bursa or rotator cuff tendons below the subacromial space which is highly&#xD;
      related to the posture and scapular movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various treatments for shoulder impingement syndrome including medical treatments such as&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, subacromial decompression, and acromion resection surgery.&#xD;
      Conventional physical therapy treatments for shoulder impingement syndrome included&#xD;
      modalities, exercises and manual therapy. Exercise has been showed to give a significant&#xD;
      effect to decrease the pain intensity, increasing the range of motion and shoulder function.&#xD;
      There is evidence that supports the use of manual therapy on shoulder impingement, the recent&#xD;
      technique introduced by Brian Mulligan is mobilization with movement. Mobilization with&#xD;
      movement is a manual therapy technique that uses the active movement while the physical&#xD;
      therapist applies an accessory force to align the positional fault of the joint. A previous&#xD;
      study investigated the effect of mobilization with movement that uses the mobilization with&#xD;
      movement in shoulder impingement syndrome showed different outcomes in the measurement of&#xD;
      pain intensity and shoulder range of motion. As the posture may be related to shoulder&#xD;
      impingement syndrome, this research will measure the cervical posture, shoulder posture, and&#xD;
      muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purposes of this study will be to compare the effects of conventional physical&#xD;
      therapy treatments and the conventional therapy treatments plus the mobilization with&#xD;
      movement on pain intensity, shoulder range of motion, cervical and shoulder posture, shoulder&#xD;
      muscle strength and shoulder function. The study hypothesis was that mobilization with&#xD;
      movement is more effective in improving the investigated outcomes in individuals with&#xD;
      shoulder impingement syndrome than the conventional physical therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement syndrome causes positional fault of the subacromial and soft tissues&#xD;
      below the subacromial space. This condition leads to the wrong biomechanics of precise ball&#xD;
      and socket kinematics creating maximum concavity compression for shoulder stability. This&#xD;
      wrong biomechanics is resulting in the injury of tissue below the subacromial space, such as&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendinitis, tears of rotator cuff tendons, and subacromial bursitis. The space&#xD;
      between the acromion and humeral was small varying between nine to 14 mm. However, the&#xD;
      subacromial space will be decreased during the arm elevation or in the abduction and external&#xD;
      rotation position. Some of the researchers defined the shoulder impingement syndrome as the&#xD;
      mechanical entrapment of the rotator cuff or the subacromial bursa in the subacromial space.&#xD;
      The highest compression of the structures below the subacromial space occurs when people&#xD;
      elevate the arm, especially during the shoulder flexion, abduction, and rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of shoulder impingement syndrome is multifactorial, although a few common causes&#xD;
      of the shoulder impingement syndrome were narrowing of the subacromial space and enlargement&#xD;
      of the subacromial bursa or rotator cuff tendons. The mechanical factor is believed as the&#xD;
      main cause of shoulder impingement syndrome. The postural misalignment and the movement&#xD;
      control that makes the improper muscle activation and cause false movement times between&#xD;
      acromion and glenoid were shown to associated with the etiology of shoulder impingement&#xD;
      syndrome. Individu with the protracted shoulder is frequently associated with the anteriorly&#xD;
      tilted and internally rotated of the scapula. The protracted shoulder or forward displacement&#xD;
      of the acromion can be measured by the shoulder angle to the seventh cervical spinous&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The humeral head position depends on the soft tissues surrounding the subacromial region.&#xD;
      During arm elevation, the humeral head position should be at the center and adjust anterior&#xD;
      translation along with the acromion movement to anterior and lateral. When the humeral head&#xD;
      position is faulty or not in the center, because of the anterior inferior glenohumeral&#xD;
      ligament cannot restrain the abnormal humeral head translation. This condition leads to&#xD;
      decreased subacromial space and irritation to the soft tissue below the acromion which causes&#xD;
      the impingement syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol This study will recruit shoulder patients around Jakarta city, the age between&#xD;
      20 and 60 years. The patients with shoulder impingement syndrome will be recruited by online&#xD;
      brochures and leaflets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will receive a clear explanation of the purposes, procedures,&#xD;
      advantages, and possible risks of this study. Each participant will be asked to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent after they understand and accept to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the assessment form, the participant will be assessed by the examiner and&#xD;
      researcher. The participants' age will be used to grouping the participants into the&#xD;
      conventional or mobilization with the movement group. The participant will be asked to rate&#xD;
      their pain intensity using the visual analog scale during the maximum shoulder abduction.&#xD;
      Shoulder range of motion will be assessed using the bubble inclinometer during shoulder&#xD;
      abduction in the standing position, internal and external rotation in the supine position&#xD;
      with 90° shoulder abduction and 90° elbow flexion. Cervical and shoulder with the instruction&#xD;
      to the participants to stand in their relaxed posture will be recorded by photogrammetry.&#xD;
      Muscle strength of shoulder abductors, external rotators, and internal rotators will be&#xD;
      assessed using the handheld dynamometer. The shoulder function will be recorded by the&#xD;
      shoulder pain and disability index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional physical therapy For the conventional group, PT (E), who has had certified level&#xD;
      1 sports physical therapy from the Australian Physiotherapy Association and has had 5 years&#xD;
      of working experience, will treat the participants with the conventional and postural&#xD;
      correction exercise. This therapist will be blinded by unknowing the group allocation. The&#xD;
      participants will receive the conventional intervention, the postural correction exercise,&#xD;
      and 10 minutes rest. Then the outcome measures will be reassessed thereafter. The&#xD;
      participants in the conventional group will receive conventional physical therapy including&#xD;
      stretching, modality, ice, therapeutic exercise, passive mobilization, and postural&#xD;
      correction exercise. The conventional physical therapy is adjustable or tailor-made depending&#xD;
      on the patient's specific conditions. Therapeutic exercise has a wide variety of types and&#xD;
      modes of exercise. The postural correction exercises consist of rotator cuff muscle&#xD;
      strengthening with eccentric-concentric, scapular stabilization exercise, and postural&#xD;
      awareness. In addition, these exercises include motor control therapeutic exercise for the&#xD;
      relearn process and motor control of the correct posture to change the participant's&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilization with movement For the mobilization with movement group, PT (S) will know the&#xD;
      code to treat the participants using the conventional or mobilization with movement protocol.&#xD;
      Moreover, this therapist will apply the mobilization with movement technique. The&#xD;
      participants will receive the conventional intervention, the postural correction exercise,&#xD;
      and the mobilization with movement. Then the outcome measures will be reassessed thereafter.&#xD;
      The directions of mobilization with movement are a posterolateral glide when the participants&#xD;
      raise their arm to perform shoulder abduction until the overhead movement. The therapist will&#xD;
      place one hand on the participant's scapula to stabilize movement while placing the thenar&#xD;
      eminence of the other hand on the medial of the humeral head. The treatment belt will be&#xD;
      placed on the participant's shoulder on top of the PT (S)'s hand. The therapist will provide&#xD;
      sustained posterolateral and inferior glide while the participants will be asked to move the&#xD;
      shoulder freely in the pain-free angle. PT (S)'s hands will move along with the movement to&#xD;
      sustain the glide along the treatment plane with upward rotation of the scapula. The&#xD;
      mobilization with movement dose will be 3 sets of 10 repetitions with rest interval 30&#xD;
      seconds between sets, twice a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation will be performed using the formula for the test of the difference&#xD;
      between 2 independent means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the G*power 3.1.9.2 program calculation, the total of this study equals 20&#xD;
      subjects. Based on the previous study using the shoulder pain and disability index to measure&#xD;
      the shoulder function, in the study of comparing the immediate effects of mobilization with&#xD;
      movement and sham techniques. The mean (standard deviation) between group post-intervention&#xD;
      for the mobilization with movement group was 4.6 (5.0) and that for the sham group was 0.4&#xD;
      (1.1). In this proposed study, the investigators need an equal number of participants per&#xD;
      group; therefore, the drop out the calculation of 20% of the total participants (n =&#xD;
      1/1-20%). Therefore, after the ethical approval, the researcher will collect data from 24&#xD;
      shoulder impingement syndrome patients (12 subjects on the conventional group and 12 subjects&#xD;
      on the mobilization with movement group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 23. The statistical&#xD;
      significance level is set at a p-value &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shapiro-Wilk will be used to examine the distribution of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics for demographic data, mean and standard deviation for continuous,&#xD;
           cumulative frequency for categorical, and median for ordinal variables, will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two-way mixed-design ANOVA (two group x four-time) for parametric data. If the data are&#xD;
           significant the post hoc analysis will be performed using Bonferroni.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Friedman tests if the data are not normally distributed.&#xD;
