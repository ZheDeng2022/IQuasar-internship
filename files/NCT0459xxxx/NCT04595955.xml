  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A controlled before-after study is performed in order to gain insights into the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the CMyLife platform in terms of medication compliance, guideline adherence, quality of&#xD;
      life, information provision and patient empowerment. Participants who agreed to use the&#xD;
      CMyLife platform for at least 6 months, were enrolled in the treatment group and participants&#xD;
      who did not agree to use the platform were enrolled in the control group. After signing&#xD;
      informed consent, participants received a baseline questionnaire by mail. Upon completion of&#xD;
      the baseline questionnaire, participants used (intervention group) or did not use (control&#xD;
      group) the CMyLife platform for at least 6 months, after which they were asked to complete&#xD;
      the post-intervention questionnaire.&#xD;
