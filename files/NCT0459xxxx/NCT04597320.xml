  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1970s, ketamine has been used in clinical anesthesia treatment. Compared with&#xD;
      ketamine, esketamine has a higher clearance rate, so it has a shorter recovery time after&#xD;
      anesthesia. This feature also makes ketamine more suitable for pediatric dental patients.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of esketamine sedation and&#xD;
      fentanyl sedation in pediatric dental patients&#xD;
