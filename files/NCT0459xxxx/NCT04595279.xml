  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granted the FDA the authority to&#xD;
      regulate and restrict tobacco advertising tactics that inaccurately convey reduced product&#xD;
      risk, yet there is a dearth of up-to-date regulatory science to inform such regulations.&#xD;
      Although the FDA has restricted use of descriptors such as &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;additive-free,&quot;&#xD;
      research shows that the tobacco industry quickly pivoted to increase use of alternative,&#xD;
      unregulated tactics. Greenwashing is one increasingly common tobacco marketing strategy in&#xD;
      which products are portrayed as eco-friendly and/or natural. The investigators' preliminary&#xD;
      research indicates that greenwashing tactics may inaccurately convey modified product risk to&#xD;
      consumers. The overarching objective of this project is to test the effect of greenwashing&#xD;
      methods used by cigarette companies to market products on actual smoking behavior in a&#xD;
      controlled laboratory study. The investigators' proposed research focuses on young adults&#xD;
      (age 18-29), because this is a key age for smoking initiation and escalation, and research&#xD;
      has found that young adults may be more susceptible than older adults to greenwashing in&#xD;
      cigarette ads. This study will test the effect of greenwashing on behavioral economic demand&#xD;
      and smoking topography in a laboratory-controlled cigarette self-administration study. These&#xD;
      data will clearly connect tobacco advertising features to product risk perceptions and actual&#xD;
      smoking behavior. This work will provide FDA with an integrated set of evidence that&#xD;
      identifies misleading greenwashing tactics that inaccurately convey modified product risk&#xD;
      which can be used to inform regulatory action regarding restrictions of this type of&#xD;
      advertising.&#xD;
