    <textblock>
      Purpose and rationale: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a&#xD;
      dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis and septic shock are major public health&#xD;
      problems killing one in every three patients. Microcirculatory dysfunction is frequent in&#xD;
      septic shock. The duration and severity of this dysfunction have a prognostic impact by being&#xD;
      associated with organ failure and mortality. Our study purposes to demonstrate the&#xD;
      feasibility of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to improve assessment of&#xD;
      microcirculatory dysfunction by showing that retinal and choroidal microcirculatory changes&#xD;
      with prognostic impact are present during septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To characterize the alterations of retinal and choroidal microcirculation&#xD;
      in septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that retinal and/or choroidal microcirculation shows&#xD;
      dysfunctional changes (lower vascular density, lower percentage of perfused small vessel,&#xD;
      lower blood flow index and higher vascular heterogeneity) in septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To test the prognostic value of retinal and choroidal microcirculatory&#xD;
      dysfunction in septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that higher magnitude and persistence of retinal and/or choroidal&#xD;
      microcirculatory dysfunction beyond the successful macro-hemodynamic resuscitation are&#xD;
      independent predictors of organ failure and mortality in septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type: Two sequential observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cross-sectional case-control study followed by a prospective cohort study&#xD;
      with a 90-days longitudinal follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 165 septic shock patients and 30 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 90 days from enrolment to final follow-up assessment. One to two years of&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;

      septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective (specific aim 1): To characterize the alterations of retinal and choroidal&#xD;
      microcirculation in septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that retinal and/or choroidal microcirculation shows&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study design: A cross-sectional case-control study followed by a prospective cohort study&#xD;
      with a 90-days longitudinal follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 165 septic shock patients and 30 healthy controls. Power and sample size&#xD;
      calculations: Based on sublingual percentage of perfused small vessel (PPV) difference&#xD;
      previously reported between septic shock patients and healthy controls (60% vs. 95%), we&#xD;
      estimate that we will need to enrol 27 patients and 27 controls to demonstrate the same&#xD;
      difference at the retina and choroid. To show a PPV difference between survivors and&#xD;
      non-survivors (70% vs. 46%) in the septic shock group, also based on previous reports at the&#xD;
      sublingual microcirculatory level, we estimate that we will need to enrol 150 septic shock&#xD;
      patients. These calculations assumed an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Our&#xD;
      Department admits about 200 septic shock patients annually, so to account for drop-outs and&#xD;
      limitations with enrolment (10-20% refusal to participate) we decided to increase our&#xD;
      enrolment goal by 10% to 165 septic shock patients and 30 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and inform consent: Recruitment will take place at the Intensive Care Medicine&#xD;
      Department of Hospital da Luz Lisboa. Patients admitted to the Department with the diagnosis&#xD;
      of septic shock will be screened for eligibility. If the patients are eligible to&#xD;
      participate, they will be invited to enrol in the study by the principal investigator or&#xD;
      other ICU medical team member. The study objectives and procedures will be explained to them.&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to participate in the study, a written informed consent will be sign&#xD;
      before enrolment. If the patient is unable to give informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study, it will be asked to the reference next of kin using the same procedures as described&#xD;
      before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 90 days from enrolment to final follow-up assessment. One to two years of&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: After confirmation of eligibility and enrolment in the studies,&#xD;
      demographic data (age, gender), type of admission (urgent/elective, medical/surgical/trauma),&#xD;
      patient origin (emergency department, ward, operation room), source of infection (lung,&#xD;
      urinary tract, intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissues, others), prognostic scores (APACHE II,&#xD;
      SAPS II) and organic dysfunction scores (SOFA, quick SOFA) will be collected at baseline for&#xD;
      septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCTA: OCTA examination will be performed daily to septic shock patients from day 1 (less than&#xD;
      24 hours after diagnosis) until successful shock resolution (weaning from vasopressors) or&#xD;
      until a maximum of 7 days. The healthy controls will be submitted to a single OCTA&#xD;
      evaluation. We will use the Spectralis® OCTA system (Heidelberg, Germany) and the&#xD;
      interpretation of OCTA images will be performed by two independent specialized&#xD;
      ophthalmologists blinded to the clinical condition of patients. Images will be stored at the&#xD;
      device working station.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic assessment: Every septic shock patient will have a central venous catheter and an&#xD;
      arterial line in place according to the standard of care. Daily, during or within a maximum&#xD;
      of 1 hour of OCTA examination, we will record the values of temperature, heart rate, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure, capillary refill time, central venous pressure, cardiac index, pH, PaCO2,&#xD;
      PaO2, PvCO2, SaO2, SvO2, haemoglobin, serum lactate, fluid balance, oxygen delivery, oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and oxygen extraction ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasoactive and sedo-analgesic drugs: Daily we will record the vasoactive and sedo-analgesic&#xD;
      drugs administered to septic shock patients and its total daily dose until complete weaning&#xD;
      (defined as 24 hours free of vasopressors). Daily vasopressor score will also be calculated&#xD;
      as suggested by Póvoa, P. et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilatory and renal replacement therapy support: Daily we will record the type of&#xD;
      ventilatory support (oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation,&#xD;
      invasive ventilation) and of renal replacement therapy (continuous, sustained low-efficiency,&#xD;
      intermittent) used, if needed, until complete weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: In both studies, we will perform a descriptive statistical analysis of studied&#xD;
      variables. Comparisons between healthy controls (single OCTA) and septic shock patients&#xD;
      (first OCTA) to address endpoints related to specific aim 1 will be performed using t-Student&#xD;
      test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. To address endpoints related to specific aim 2, we&#xD;
      will compare survivors to non-survivors by doing a survival analysis using Kaplan-Meyer&#xD;
      curves and Cox proportional hazards multivariable regression with microcirculatory measures&#xD;
      as predictors. Additional comparisons will be performed using χ2 test, t-Student test,&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression as appropriate. We will assess confounding by&#xD;
      adding significant variables in the regression models. We intend to perform a prespecified&#xD;
      subgroup analysis of septic shock patients by serum lactate &lt;4mmol/L vs. ≥4mmol/L and&#xD;
      &lt;2mmol/L vs. ≥2mmol/L. The correlation between retinal and choroidal microcirculation&#xD;
      variables and macrohemodynamic variables will be assessed by the Spearman rank correlation&#xD;
      coefficient. Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of OCTA for prognostic&#xD;
      outcomes will be calculated. A p-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed with STATA® 15 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
