    <textblock>
      An open label study to evaluate immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of Rotavac® (live&#xD;
      attenuated oral rotavirus vaccine) as a 3-dose series in healthy infants aged between 6 weeks&#xD;
      and 8 weeks in Vietnam&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The study is an open labeled, clinical trial in infants 6-8 weeks of age will be&#xD;
           assigned to receive 3 doses of Rotavac® to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active surveillance will be conducted for all participants for 14 &amp; 28 days after each&#xD;
           dose of vaccine to obtain information on adverse events. (&quot;Reactogenicity&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Childhood vaccines including pentavalent (Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hib, Hepatitis&#xD;
           B) and oral polio vaccine as well as injectable polio vaccine will be administered along&#xD;
           with the study vaccines as per Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety assessments will include observation in the study clinic for 30 minutes after&#xD;
           each vaccine administration to record immediate adverse events. A subject diary card and&#xD;
           personal contact with the subjects will be made to record adverse events during the&#xD;
           14-day period following vaccine administration.&#xD;
