  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' Orbitopathy (GO) is a disabling and disfiguring condition associated with Graves'&#xD;
      Disease, due to autoimmunity against antigens expressed by the thyroid and orbital tissues,&#xD;
      and resulting in orbital fibroblast proliferation and release of glycosaminoglycans. The&#xD;
      current treatments available, especially glucocorticoids, are not effective in all patients.&#xD;
      Two cases of patients with GO treated with Sirolimus have been reported with an excellent&#xD;
      response to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the use of Sirolimus lies in its mechanisms of action. Sirolimus is able to&#xD;
      inhibit T-cell activation as well as fibroblast proliferation. In addition, acts indirectly&#xD;
      on the Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway, and recent clinical trials have shown&#xD;
      that a monoclonal antibody against the IGF-1 receptor (Teprotumumab) is effective in patients&#xD;
      with GO. Thus, Sirolimus could be used in GO as monotherapy in patients with GO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present drug vs placebo, double-blind, randomized clinical trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of Sirolimus in patients with moderately severe, active GO. 54 patients&#xD;
      (27 per group) will be randomized into two groups, A and B. Patients in group A will receive&#xD;
      Sirolimus for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week wash-out period, and by a 12-week follow-up&#xD;
      period. Patients in group B will receive placebo for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week wash-out&#xD;
      period, and by a 12-week treatment with Sirolimus. The primary objective of the study is the&#xD;
      reduction of proptosis after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary objectives are: 1)&#xD;
      reduction of proptosis at 24 and 36 weeks; 2) overall response of GO at 12, 24 and 36 weeks:&#xD;
      3) reduction of the GO clinical activity score (CAS) at 12, 24 and 36 weeks, and 4)&#xD;
      Improvement in the quality of life at 12, 24 and 36 weeks.&#xD;
