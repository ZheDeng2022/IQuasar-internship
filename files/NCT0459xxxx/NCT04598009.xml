    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well binimetinib and imatinib work in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage III-IV KIT-mutant melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable).&#xD;
      Binimetinib and imatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving binimetinib and imatinib may help treat patients with&#xD;
      KIT-mutant melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of binimetinib plus imatinib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced KIT-mutant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of binimetinib plus imatinib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced KIT-mutant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate efficacy and survival parameters in patients with advanced KIT-mutant&#xD;
      melanoma treated with binimetinib plus imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate efficacy in patients with advanced KIT-mutant melanoma treated with&#xD;
      binimetinib plus imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate association between changes in drug phosphorylated end products (p-KIT,&#xD;
      p-MEK, p-ERK) and clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate association between clinical response and baseline Neurofibromatosis 1&#xD;
      (NF1) and SPRED1 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate pathologic correlates of acquired resistance. IV. To investigate whether&#xD;
      NF1 and SPRED1 loss contribute to acquired resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To generate patient-derived xenograft models. VI. To determine the relationship between&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and clinicopathologic features including KIT exon mutated, melanoma&#xD;
      subtype, melanoma primary site, race/ethnicity, prior treatment history including immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-experienced versus (vs) - naive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and imatinib PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and 100, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months.&#xD;

             molecule inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with binimetinib and/or imatinib, breastfeeding&#xD;

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             treatment administration or that may interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
             results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient an&#xD;
             inappropriate candidate for the study&#xD;
