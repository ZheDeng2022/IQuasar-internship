  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a multicenter prospective trial of BTPNA for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      peripheral pulmonary lesions in the real world. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of BTPNA and to explore the factors of diagnosis rate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at no less than 10 clinical centers. Patients will be first&#xD;
      screened, and only after meeting all the selection criteria, not meeting any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and signing the informed consent, could they be enrolled in the group to receive&#xD;
      BTPNA to sample the target lesions. The primary endpoint is the diagnostic yield of BTPNA.&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include the success rate of navigation, the operation time of the&#xD;
      bronchoscope and so on.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Bronchoscopic Transparenchymal Nodule Access</intervention_name>
    <description>Bronchoscopic Transparenchymal Nodule Access (BTPNA) is locating the lesion in the lung tissue guided by the bronchoscope navigation system (LungPro) in the natural lumen (bronchus), and automatically calculates the best point of entry (POE) and the best route to avoid blood vessels. An opening is made from the POE under the endoscope, and is extended with a balloon dilator. Combined with X-ray fluoroscopy, a sheath with a blunt-tip core is used in the lung parenchyma to reach the lesion site, and then biopsy diagnosis or treatment.</description>

          1. Patients older than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Chest CT shows patients with peripheral pulmonary lesions that have bronchus signs but&#xD;
             are difficult to reach through the intrabronchial path, or are adjacent to the airway,&#xD;
             or have no bronchus sign, and are highly suspected of malignancy which need&#xD;
             pathological confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Peripheral pulmonary lesions have the following situations where transthoracic needle&#xD;
             aspiration (TTNA) is difficult to obtain a diagnosis or the operation is relatively&#xD;
             risky, or have not been diagnosed by TTNA in the past, and the lesions can be reached&#xD;
             by BTPNA technology in preoperative assessment.&#xD;
