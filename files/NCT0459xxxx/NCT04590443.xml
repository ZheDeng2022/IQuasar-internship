  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (LBP) is one of the most familiar musculoskeletal pains and alone has&#xD;
      been the main origin of years lived with disability for the past three decades. LBP is&#xD;
      identified as a nonspecific, painful or mechanical situation in the lower back, buttocks, or&#xD;
      hips. Although an underlying origin in chronic LBP has been proposed to be due to a multitude&#xD;
      of factors, a muscle hip disbalance has been recognized5. A limited hip internal rotation&#xD;
      range of motion (IR-ROM) and hip abductor weakness were found in patients with LBP symptoms7&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of Physiotherapy, ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (PNM) is&#xD;
      defined as the application through a needle with ultrasound guidance of an electrical current&#xD;
      at low or medium frequency, seeking a sensitive and / or motor response of a peripheral nerve&#xD;
      in some point of its trajectory, or of a muscle in a motor point, with a therapeutic&#xD;
      objective. However, authors hypothesize that neuromodulation (especially the US-guided PNM&#xD;
      technique) may be used to obtain more therapeutic effects, including pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hip muscle strengthening by a&#xD;
      simple single-shot procedure with the US-guided PNM technique in people with LBP. A second&#xD;
      purpose was to discover if the stimulation point in the sciatic nerve territory may influence&#xD;
      the change of strength in these patients Sixty subjects will be recruited, which will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups: group 1 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve in the&#xD;
      gluteus region; group 2 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve in the middle of&#xD;
      the thigh; and group 3 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve before popliteus&#xD;
      region. The PNM intervention with NMP will consist in the single application of an asymmetric&#xD;
      rectangular biphasic current (250 microseconds, 3 Hz) during 90 seconds&#xD;

    <description>Participants received the percutaneous electrical stimulation intervention. Specifically, this consisted of the application of a square wave biphasic electrical current, with 3 Hz frequency and a 250Âµs pulse width, at the maximal tolerable intensity, to cause an tolerable muscle contraction. The application was 10 stimulations of 10 seconds, with 10 seconds at rest between stimulations. A trained physiotherapist performed the PNM intervention.</description>
