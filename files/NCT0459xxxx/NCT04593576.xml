  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The word Autism is derived from the Latin word &quot;Autos'' which means &quot;self&quot; - immersion in&#xD;
      one's own world. Autism is a disorder that manifests itself in early childhood, is disabling&#xD;
      in many cases and is characterized by severe deficits in communication, social interaction,&#xD;
      speech/language delays, sensory issues, repetitive and stereotyped behavior, limited&#xD;
      interests. Autism was first described as a disease, by an American physician; Autism later&#xD;
      came to be known as ASD (Autism spectrum Disorder) due to numerous disorders, various&#xD;
      combinations of disorders, multiple unknown etiologies, subtypes and dynamics of the evolving&#xD;
      disease. Autism is on the rise with a prevalence rate of 1-2% of infant population. In 2014,&#xD;
      the 67th World Health assembly passed a resolution for &quot;Comprehensive and Co-ordinated&#xD;
      efforts for the management of the Autism Spectrum Disorders &quot;which was supported by 60&#xD;
      countries, showing the relevance of the pathology. Research on Autism has increased recently,&#xD;
      and publications have nearly doubled in the last 5 years, as this spectrum of disorders&#xD;
      continues to baffle doctors and scientists and has no cure till now, but can only be managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of physical exercises/sports have been researched, discussed and documented in great&#xD;
      detail in the past. But the purpose of this research study is to explore the (Pragmatic&#xD;
      communication and social interaction) benefits of specific sports/physical exercises for&#xD;
      children aged 5-7 years who are on the spectrum, children with ASD diagnosis. Psychiatrists&#xD;
      maintain that certain brain connections develop in ASD children if they regularly indulge /&#xD;
      participate in particular sports like athletics (running, jogging, other track events),&#xD;
      hiking (exposure to nature), swimming, cycling, horse- back riding, team sports like;&#xD;
      basketball, soccer etc. The co-ordination between right and left sides of the body is more&#xD;
      important in these sports. Team sports are also a great way of involving ASD children in a&#xD;
      social situation where they are more receptive to learning communication skills while opening&#xD;
      up with peers, in a relaxed and happy environment. Endorphin; a neurotransmitter, is released&#xD;
      in our body during exercise, which triggers a positive/happy feeling, making ASD children&#xD;
      more receptive to learning / acquiring new skills through this mode of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all ASD children are unique, it is important to find the right choice of physical&#xD;
      exercise/sport that fits their particular profile/symptoms, biomechanics for this mode of&#xD;
      intervention to be effective in improving their pragmatic communication skills and social&#xD;
      interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to research the positive effects of outdoor sports activities on pragmatic&#xD;
      language skills development amongst the Autistic children aged 5-7 years in Pakistani&#xD;
      population. It will help establish a great mode of therapeutic intervention for developing&#xD;
      Pragmatic language skills amongst children with Autism. Once established, this mode of&#xD;
      intervention will also assist in creating a platform for much needed community based&#xD;
      recreational activities for the Autism families in Pakistan.&#xD;
