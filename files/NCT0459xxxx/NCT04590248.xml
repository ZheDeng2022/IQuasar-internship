  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2b study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adavosertib, an inhibitor of&#xD;
      the tyrosine kinase WEE1, in subjects with recurrent or persistent uterine serous carcinoma&#xD;
      (USC) who have previously received at least 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
      the management of USC.&#xD;

      This Phase 2b, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study will assess the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of adavosertib in eligible subjects with histologically confirmed recurrent or persistent&#xD;
      USC, evidence of measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors.(RECIST) v1.1, and who have received at least 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen for the management of USC. Subjects with carcinosarcomas are not eligible.&#xD;
