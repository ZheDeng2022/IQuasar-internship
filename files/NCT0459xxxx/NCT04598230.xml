  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric onset anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, social anxiety, separation anxiety)&#xD;
      are highly prevalent, and if untreated, are impairing into adolescence and adulthood. In the&#xD;
      largest comparative efficacy study remission occurred in about 65% of children and&#xD;
      adolescents treated with a combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)&#xD;
      and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In contrast, CBT without an SSRI achieved remission&#xD;
      in 35% of children at 3 months and 45% at 6 months-a 30% and 20% difference, respectively.&#xD;
      Despite the difference in remission rates, CBT alone is the preferred treatment of most&#xD;
      patients and families. Lack of awareness of the significant difference in remission rates and&#xD;
      concerns about medication side effects may drive patient and family preference even though&#xD;
      SSRIs have a positive safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critiques of CBT in the above study suggest that CBT was not as effective as it could be due&#xD;
      to short treatment duration, restricted family involvement and limited exposure sessions.&#xD;
      Would the combination of CBT and an SSRI still be superior to CBT only, if CBT was of longer&#xD;
      duration, and included more family involvement and exposure sessions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Partners in Care for Anxious Youth (PCAY) study, children and adolescents with an&#xD;
      anxiety disorder ages 7-17 years followed in pediatric primary care clinics affiliated with&#xD;
      three institution: Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, University of California Los Angeles&#xD;
      and University of Cincinnati will be randomized to one of two treatment arms; either CBT only&#xD;
      or CBT combined with an SSRI (either fluoxetine, sertraline, or escitalopram). CBT in PCAY&#xD;
      will be 6 months in duration and include more family involvement, and more exposure&#xD;
      opportunities than past trials. The 6-month acute treatment phase will be followed by 6&#xD;
      months of followup. The primary outcome will be anxiety symptom remission and reduction in&#xD;
      impairment over 6 and 12-months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders begin during childhood and adolescents, are extremely common, but are often&#xD;
      under-diagnosed and under-treated. If untreated, pediatric anxiety disorders can be chronic&#xD;
      and impairing into adulthood. The good news is that evidence-based treatments can be highly&#xD;
      effective in reducing symptoms, and for a good number of children and adolescents, treatment&#xD;
      can reduce anxiety symptoms to a minimum with marked improvement in function. In the largest&#xD;
      comparative efficacy study, remission (minimal or no symptoms of anxiety), occurred in about&#xD;
      65% of children and adolescents treated with a combination of a selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor (SSRI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In contrast, CBT without an SSRI&#xD;
      achieved remission in 35% of children at 3 months and 45% at 6 months-a 30% and 20%&#xD;
      difference, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, CBT alone is the preferred treatment of most patients and families. Lack of&#xD;
      awareness of the significant difference in remission rates and concerns about medication side&#xD;
      effects may drive patient and family preference, even though SSRIs have a positive safety&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study described above, CBT was limited in ways that might account for why it was less&#xD;
      effective. CBT was shorter in duration, had fewer sessions, and less exposure opportunities&#xD;
      than it was originally designed to have and had less family involvement than more current&#xD;
      approaches. Given that patients and families prefer CBT, it is important to know if&#xD;
      combination of CBT and an SSRI is truly superior to CBT only or whether fully implemented CBT&#xD;
      can close the gap in remission rates with the combination of CBT and an SSRI. The study will&#xD;
      also provide information about which children and adolescents achieve remission with CBT or&#xD;
      CBT and an SSRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Partners in Caring for Anxious Youth (PCAY) study will screen children and adolescents&#xD;
      ages 7-17 years in pediatric primary care clinics affiliated with three institution: Lurie&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Chicago, University of California Los Angeles and University of&#xD;
      Cincinnati. If a child screens positive with symptoms of an anxiety disorder, the patient and&#xD;
      family will be offered an opportunity to learn about PCAY. If the family is interested in&#xD;
      PCAY, a study staff person will provide information and answer any questions. If the patient&#xD;
      and family want to enroll they will sign a consent form, complete an evaluation, and if&#xD;
      eligible and willing to move forward, be randomized to either CBT or CBT plus an SSRI. The&#xD;
      study team will work with the patient and family to connect to a therapist in the community&#xD;
      to start CBT and if medication is part of treatment, work with the patient's pediatrician to&#xD;
      begin medication. CBT will include up to 20 session of therapy and medication treatment will&#xD;
      be a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (either fluoxetine, sertraline or escitalopram).&#xD;
      The goal of treatment is for the child or adolescent with an anxiety disorder to reach&#xD;
      remission and have a marked improvement in functioning. The first part of treatment lasts 6&#xD;
      months and there is then ongoing follow-up for an additional 6 months (12 months total). When&#xD;
      the study is finished, the investigators hope to know if CBT and an SSRI is really superior&#xD;
      to fully implemented CBT or not. The results of this study will inform patients, families,&#xD;
      providers, payors and policy makers on the value of medication when combined with CBT.&#xD;
