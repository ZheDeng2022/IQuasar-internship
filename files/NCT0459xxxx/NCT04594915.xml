    <textblock>
      This is a national, multi-center, prospective study to evaluate the safety of Edoxaban in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with AF who are currently using Edoxaban for stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety of Edoxaban treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on&#xD;
           Edoxaban therapy in routine clinical practice in Turkey.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Edoxaban was recently approved by The Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency for the&#xD;
      prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with Nonvalvular Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Treatment&#xD;
      of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of recurrent DVT and&#xD;
      PE in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the safety of Edoxaban in patients diagnosed with AF who are&#xD;
      currently on Edoxaban therapy for prevention of stroke in routine clinical practice in Turkey&#xD;
      for stroke prevention up to 1 year following treatment by specialized as well as&#xD;
      non-specialized physicians in hospital centers.&#xD;
