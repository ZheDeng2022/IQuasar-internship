  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The visceral adiposity index (VAI) has been developed, an indicator for the metabolic&#xD;
      function of VAT. Previous studies have confirmed the association between the VAI and CKD&#xD;
      prevalence. In this study, we attempted to investigate the association between estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and visceral adiposity.&#xD;

      Data were collected from patients with stage 2-5 CKD aged 18 and 80 years and were not on&#xD;
      dialysis. These patients were followed up in the Nephrology Department of the Usak University&#xD;
      Research and Training Hospital for at least 1 year between December 2017 and November 2018.&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Usak University School of Medicine. Of 218&#xD;
      patients with stage 2-5 CKD, only 129 were eligible for the study. The exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were as follows: missing data, patients older than 80 years, patients taking cholesterol and&#xD;
      lipid lowering drugs and steroids. Demographic data (age, gender, and medical history such as&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and hypertension, medications) were collected from the electronic records&#xD;
      of the patients, and physical examinations such as blood pressure measurement after 5 minutes&#xD;
      of rest, height, weight, waist circumference (WC) measured at the level midway from the lower&#xD;
      rib margin and the iliac crest in the midaxillary line while the patients were standing with&#xD;
      their feet 25-30 cm apart were performed. Laboratory samples were collected from the&#xD;
      patients, transported to the laboratory, and stored at -80°C until analysis. HbA1c levels&#xD;
      were measured using the cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography system&#xD;
      (Variant II Turbo HbA1c analyzer, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). TG, HDL, uric&#xD;
      acid, calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate, urine protein, and creatinine levels were analyzed&#xD;
      with the spectrophotometric method using Architect c8000 automated analyzer and original&#xD;
      Abbott kits (Abbott Diagnostics Inc, Park City, IL, USA). Two milliliters of blood was added&#xD;
      to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (1 mg/ml blood) and mixed thoroughly to perform&#xD;
      complete blood count by Mindray BC 6800 (Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., Ltd, Shenzhen,&#xD;
      China). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was analyzed with the electrochemiluminescence method using&#xD;
      the ADVIA Centaur analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Munich, Germany). Serum&#xD;
      creatinine levels were measured over a 1-year interval. The eGFR was calculated using the&#xD;
      Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. The stages of CKD were&#xD;
      defined according to eGFR as stage 2 mild CKD (eGFR = 89-60 mL/min/1.73m2), stage 3a moderate&#xD;
      CKD (eGFR = 45-59 mL/min/1.73m2), stage 3b moderate CKD (eGFR = 30-44 mL/min/1.73m2), stage 4&#xD;
      severe CKD (eGFR = 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2), and stage 5 end-stage CKD (eGFR = &lt;15&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m2). The eGFR change was calculated as the percentage of change in eGFR in 1 year&#xD;
      to baseline eGFR. VAI was calculated using the formula&#xD;
      (WC/36.8+(1.89xBMI))x(TG/0.81)x(1.52/HDL) for women and&#xD;
      (WC/39.68+(1.88xBMI))x(TG/1.03)x(1.31/HDL) for men. BMI was calculated by dividing weight to&#xD;
      square of height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed with the IBM SPSS 22 statistical program. Descriptive statistics were used&#xD;
      to define the main characteristics of the patients. Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnoff&#xD;
      statistical tests were used to assess the normality of the data. All parameters except&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone levels were normally distributed. The correlation between the eGFR&#xD;
      difference, VAI values, and other parameters was tested with the Pearson correlation test.&#xD;
      The difference between the patients with different CKD stages according to the eGFR change&#xD;
      and VAI values were tested by the one-way ANOVA test. The independent samples t-test was used&#xD;
      to investigate the difference between patients with and without DM and hypertension according&#xD;
      to VAI values and eGFR change. Partial Correlation is used for to investigate the correlation&#xD;
      between the two variables, where the effect of other variables is kept constant and&#xD;
      controlled for both variables. A p value of less than 0.05 was defined as significant.&#xD;
