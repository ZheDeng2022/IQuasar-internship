  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a &quot;serious game&quot; intervention called &quot;Who Would You Choose:&#xD;
      Serious Fun&quot; (WWYC) to help people consider the key qualities healthcare spokespersons should&#xD;
      have. The intervention uses a spinner, cards, and dice, along with a smart-phone App to&#xD;
      prompt players (using scenarios and metaphors) to choose a spokesperson whose qualities are&#xD;
      best suited to the role. Friendly competition is encouraged by having players receive points&#xD;
      for correct answers, and additional points for good explanations of their choices. At the end&#xD;
      of the game, players identify a real-life spokesperson based on the qualities considered&#xD;
      during game-play. Then, using an associated smart-phone App, the intervention will help spark&#xD;
      communication between the player and their chosen spokesperson.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of thinking through and articulating in advance&#xD;
      one's preferences for future medical care. It has long been promoted as a way for people to&#xD;
      receive medical treatment consistent with their values, goals, and preferences. While ACP&#xD;
      typically involves decision-making about specific life-sustaining treatments, choosing who&#xD;
      will make medical decisions when the patient cannot is considered by many to be the single&#xD;
      most important ACP action a person can take. When patients fail to designate a healthcare&#xD;
      spokesperson (henceforth spokesperson), it leads to uncertainty about who will make medical&#xD;
      decisions, what treatments are to be accepted or declined, and on what basis-which can lead&#xD;
      to familial conflict, unwanted and costly medical care, and avoidable patient suffering. So,&#xD;
      too, when patients choose the &quot;wrong&quot; person to represent them, the patient's wishes are less&#xD;
      likely to be known or respected. The investigation team's own research suggests that when&#xD;
      patients prefer fewer aggressive medical treatments, there is significantly lower concordance&#xD;
      between spokespersons' decisions and patients' wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, families, and ACP experts have identified several qualities as being especially&#xD;
      important for spokespersons to have. Ideally, spokespersons should know the patient's values,&#xD;
      be available when needed, be trustworthy and caring, have good judgment, and be able to stand&#xD;
      up under pressure. That said, many individuals (and state laws) assign spokespersons on the&#xD;
      basis of relationship (spouse, parent, etc.) rather than personal qualities. Surprisingly, no&#xD;
      interventions (to the team's knowledge) are explicitly designed to help people consider the&#xD;
      actual qualities of the person chosen as spokesperson, much less engage this individual to&#xD;
      confirm that this person can fully represent the patient's wishes should the need arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these gaps, the investigative team has developed a novel intervention that&#xD;
      includes a &quot;serious game&quot; to help people consider the qualities desired in a spokesperson,&#xD;
      then engage the person they choose for this role. Combining a serious topic with an enjoyable&#xD;
      activity (&quot;gamification&quot;) has been effective at changing health-related behaviors in multiple&#xD;
      settings with the target population (&quot;sandwich generation&quot; and older adults). The game&#xD;
      element of the intervention, &quot;Who Would You Choose: Serious Fun&quot; (WWYC), prompts players&#xD;
      (using scenarios and metaphors) to choose a spokesperson whose qualities are best suited to&#xD;
      the role. At the end of the game, players identify a real-life spokesperson based on the&#xD;
      qualities considered during gameplay. Then, using an online interface, WWYC will spark&#xD;
      communication between the player and their chosen spokesperson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to help people make more thoughtful and informed&#xD;
      choices when selecting a spokesperson, and to help these spokespersons be better prepared for&#xD;
      the role of surrogate decision-maker. The current mixed methods study proposed here is&#xD;
      designed to learn whether and how WWYC helps individuals select an appropriate spokesperson&#xD;
      for healthcare decisions, as assessed via three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To explore how playing the novel game Who Would You Choose affects people's choice of&#xD;
      a spokesperson. Using qualitative methods including focus groups and one-on-one interviews,&#xD;
      the investigative team will explore how WWYC affects individual players' thought process for&#xD;
      choosing a spokesperson, and whether the player's choice changes as a result of game-play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To establish that WWYC is a feasible way to help individuals choose and engage a&#xD;
      spokesperson. The investigative team will judge it feasible if: 1) 100 individuals are&#xD;
      recruited to play the game; 2) &gt;75% of game players report that playing the game is helpful&#xD;
      for choosing a spokesperson; 3) &gt;75% of game players endorse the game; 4) &gt;75% of&#xD;
      spokespersons engage with WWYC (using its online interface) following player request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To integrate qualitative and quantitative data to explain how the experience of&#xD;
      playing the game relates to their spokesperson's willingness to engage. The investigative&#xD;
      team hypothesizes that a positive player experience with WWYC will be associated with&#xD;
      successful engagement with their spokesperson.&#xD;
