      BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to understand the role of therapeutic dietary&#xD;
      interventions on the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although nutritional&#xD;
      observational studies have examined associations between diet and the development of IBD, the&#xD;
      relationship between dietary components and disease relapse is lacking. Despite the lack of a&#xD;
      well-defined relationship between dietary determinants and disease relapse, patients with IBD&#xD;
      frequently have a strong belief that diet has a key role in controlling the course of their&#xD;
      disease, and maybe a trigger of disease relapse. This proposed randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) explores the efficacy of a Crohn's Disease (CD) Therapeutic Dietary Intervention (TDI)&#xD;
      compared to conventional management (CM) to induce steroid-free clinical remission at week 13&#xD;
      in patients with active, mild-to-moderate luminal CD. For asymptomatic patients with active&#xD;
      disease, efficacy of the diet will be explored by using fecal calprotectin and sonographic&#xD;
      findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Our team of investigators recently compared a representative healthy population to&#xD;
      patients with CD and identified CD patients have: lower intakes of polyunsaturated and&#xD;
      monounsaturated fats and multiple micronutrients (vitamins C, D, thiamine magnesium,&#xD;
      phosphorus, zinc, potassium), and; few patients with CD met criteria for an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      dietary pattern. Since the diet is a modifiable potential risk factor for disease recurrence&#xD;
      in IBD, there is a strong rationale for the investigation of diet on disease course.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients have expressed strong interest in identifying the relationships&#xD;
      between diet and disease, therefore assigning priority to this theme is an opportunity to&#xD;
      advance patient-oriented care.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Symptomatic patients at the time of recruitment: Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) &gt;5 to &lt;16&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the proportion of patients in each study group at week 13 who are in&#xD;
           corticosteroid-free (CF) clinical remission as measured by a Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI)&#xD;
           of &lt;5 (primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the proportion of patients in each study group at week 13 who are in&#xD;
           biochemical remission as measured by a fecal calprotectin (FCP) of &lt;250ug/g (primary&#xD;
           endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Asymptomatic patients with active disease at the time of recruitment: Harvey Bradshaw&#xD;
      Index (HBI) &lt;5&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the proportion of patients in each study group at week 13 who are in&#xD;
           biochemical remission as measured by a fecal calprotectin (FCP) of &lt;250ug/g (primary&#xD;
           endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the proportion of patients in each study group at week 13 who are in clinical&#xD;
           remission as measured by sonographic findings of inflammation (Bowel Wall thickening â‰¤&#xD;
           3mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: The aim of the secondary objectives are to examine whether the dietary&#xD;
      intervention has a significant effect on the gut microbiota and SCFAs in patients and whether&#xD;
      this is associated with the intervention and disease recurrence at or before 13 weeks. The&#xD;
      aim is also to examine whether the intervention has a significant effect on health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the presence of within and between-group differences in microbial diversity,&#xD;
           microbial composition, and abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and&#xD;
           SCFA-producing bacteria at baseline and 13weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the presence of within and between-group differences in fecal SCFA&#xD;
           concentrations at baseline and 13 weeks. To compare the proportion of patients in each&#xD;
           study group at week14 that achieve clinical response (decrease in HBI&gt;3points)&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial design: This 3-year study, investigator-blinded, RCT (N=102) at&#xD;
      the University of Calgary (UoC). Eligible participants will be randomly allocated in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio to either the intervention group (CD-TDI) or conventional management (CM) alone (i.e.,&#xD;
      control group) for 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Management (Control) Group: CM patients will meet with the RD at baseline, week&#xD;
      7 and week 13 to complete their 24 hour food recall twice on different days of the week,&#xD;
      followed by a phone few days after the visit to complete the second part of the recall. They&#xD;
      will be advised to follow their habitual diet and will be offered the dietary intervention at&#xD;
      14 weeks if they are still experiencing a disease flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic diet Intervention ( CD-TDI )Group : Patients receiving CD-TDI will be offered&#xD;
      patient-centered counseling for 12 weeks by a Registered Dietitian (RD) trained in the CD-TDI&#xD;
      protocol with the goals of (a) identification and treatment of malnutrition if present, (b)&#xD;
      targeted treatment of macro- and micronutrient deficiencies using whole foods;(c) increasing&#xD;
      adherence to CD-TDI (d) multivitamin adherence and (e) reduced exposure to dietary antigens&#xD;
      (e.g., maltodextrin, carrageenan, other food additives). They will receive a5 face-to-face&#xD;
      appointment every 3 weeks with the study RD, and all other weekly appointments, which are 8&#xD;
      in number will be completed by phone.&#xD;

    <description>HBI is a validated, non-invasive measure of disease activity captured through a symptom questionnaire and is a surrogate to endoscopic assessment to determine disease severity. HBI minimum value is &quot;0&quot; and maximum no limit. HBI &lt; 5 is used in this study to indicate clinical remission. HBI&gt; 16 means severe disease activity. Higher scores means worse outcomes. Based on experience with past recruitment for clinical trials, endoscopic assessment is not feasible due to access and patient acceptance.</description>

Patient compliance will be measured in three ways: 1) Mediterranean diet score checklists completed every 3 weeks at the face-to-face visits; 2) goal attainment scores captured weekly to identify the goals set, and the goals attained 47; and 3) fatty acids profiled from red blood cells to identify if fat intake reflects CD-TDI fat recommendations: 35% total calories from fat, 15% from MUFA, 13% from SFA and 6% from PUFA with a 8 n6:n:3 ratio of 8:1</description>
