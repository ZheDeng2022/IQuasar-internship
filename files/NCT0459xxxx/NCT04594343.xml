    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and biomarker levels of FDA-approved drug&#xD;
      disulfiram in the treatment of adult subjects hospitalized with moderate COVID-19. Disulfiram&#xD;
      may limit the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19 and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      progression to severe illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened and randomized to receive either daily administration of oral&#xD;
      disulfiram or placebo for 14 days. Subjects will be followed up on Day 28.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and mortality. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 or&#xD;
      infection with SARS-CoV-2 or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. The ongoing COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic has demonstrated increased risk to those with an aging immune system. The elderly&#xD;
      and those with comorbidities are reported as being the most susceptible to COVID-19, which&#xD;
      may be due to a higher basal state of inflammation (&quot;inflammaging&quot;) and a primed inflammasome&#xD;
      pathway. Disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence, has a&#xD;
      potential for limiting the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19. Specifically,&#xD;
      the drug inhibits gasdermin D pore formation, reducing pyroptosis and netosis and could&#xD;
      target the root cause of hyperinflammation, weakening the cytokine storm and therefore&#xD;
      reducing the risk of progression to severe illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of disulfiram in&#xD;
      hospitalized subjects over the age of 50 diagnosed with moderate COVID-19. Up to 200 subjects&#xD;
      are planned to be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to either receive 500 mg of disulfiram&#xD;
      (active product) or placebo, orally (po) or enterally (only in patients that require&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation) once daily for fourteen (14) days in addition to standard of care.&#xD;
      Stratification will be done at randomization based on age and comorbidities.&#xD;
