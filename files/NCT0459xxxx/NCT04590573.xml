  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding depression from a relational perspective maybe more meaningful in Chinese&#xD;
      culture due to the different values and beliefs among Chinese comparing to those of the&#xD;
      Western cultures. The PI and his associates developed a Cognitive Behavioural Couple Therapy&#xD;
      model for Chinese couples with a depressed partner receiving mental health services in a&#xD;
      community mental health centre in Hong Kong between 2018 and 2019. With consideration of the&#xD;
      limitations in a pilot study conducted by the PI, modifications are made in the current&#xD;
      study. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural couple&#xD;
      therapy model for Chinese couples with a depressed partner in Hong Kong. A comparison&#xD;
      approach involving cognitive behavioural couple therapy (CBCT), emotional focused couple&#xD;
      therapy (EFCT) and a wait-list control group on their short-term and long-term effects, as&#xD;
      well as differential benefits will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of questionnaires will be filled out by the 135 participants (45 in each arm) before&#xD;
      the intervention (T0), after the intervention (T1), and 6-month after the intervention (T2).&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that comparing to the control group, participants in CBCT and EFCT&#xD;
      conditions will have greater improvements in outcomes at T1 and T2. There will be&#xD;
      differential therapeutic effects of CBCT and EFCT on the various outcomes. Different&#xD;
      mediating effects behind the changes in the outcomes in the two conditions will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will contribute to the current literature by evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      culturally-attuned CBCT and EFCT. New insights will be added to the current therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches for couples with a depressed partner.&#xD;

    <description>To assess the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress in the participants. The 21 items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (not applicable) to 3 (very applicable). Sum scores are computed by adding up the scores of each item and then multiplying by 2. The range of the scale is from 0 to 120. Higher scores indicated higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress.</description>

    <description>To evaluate 4 dimensions of marital quality of the participants (Consensus, Cohesion, Satisfaction and Affectional Expression). The range of the scale is 0 to 151. Lower total scores indicate greater distress in marital relationships.&#xD;
The 15 items of Consensus are rated on a 6-point scale from 0 (totally agree) to 5 (totally disagree). Two of the 6 items of Cohesion are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (daily/all) to 4 (never) while the remaining 4 items on a 6-point scale from 0 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 9 items of Satisfaction are rated on a 6-point scale from 0 (anytime) to 5 (never) while one of the remaining items asked the participants to describe their marriage from 7 choices from &quot;extremely unhappy&quot; to &quot;perfect&quot;. The last item included 6 sentences about views on the marital relationships and the participants are asked to choose the best one describing their thoughts. The 2 items of Affectional Expression are answered by &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</description>
