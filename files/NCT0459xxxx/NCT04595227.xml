    <textblock>
      To explore an effective diagnostic tool of glaucoma through the dynamic analysis of&#xD;
      computerized pupillary light reflex assessment device (CPLRAD) pupillography based on iris&#xD;
      recognition techniques and investigate its feasibility in glaucoma screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, which is characterized by&#xD;
      progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their optic nerve axons. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment can effectively prevent the progression of the disease and avoid&#xD;
      blindness. The damage of RGCs appears in the early stage of glaucoma, and the asymmetry of&#xD;
      the eyes has also been observed clinically. CPLRAD may serve as an effective screening tool&#xD;
      for glaucomatous optic neuropathy, since they can dynamically detect abnormal pupillary&#xD;
      responses from a novel sequence of light stimuli and functionally-shaped stimuli. The current&#xD;
      theoretical evidence of relative afferent pupillary defect/pupillary light reflex (RAPD/PLR)&#xD;
      as a functional test for predicting nerve damage is insufficient, and pupil detection&#xD;
      technology is not yet mature. Therefore, the investigators want to complete these tasks: 1)&#xD;
      collect the clinical examination data and objectively measure the pupil dynamic parameters&#xD;
      monocularly and/or binocularly as indicators from the retina and optic nerve in glaucoma&#xD;
      patients 2) design RAPD/PLR detection technology and develop dynamic analysis system; 3)&#xD;
      verify the feasibility of RAPD/PLR applied to early glaucoma screening through clinical&#xD;
      trials. The pupil image dynamic analysis and iris recognition system will provide a simple,&#xD;
      inexpensive and non-invasive screen tool, and is highly reliable and cost-effective.&#xD;
