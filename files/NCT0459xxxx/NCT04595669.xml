  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Improving dietary behaviours in view of optimising risk factors of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome requires behaviour change strategies. Tailored dietary advice, i.e. recommendations&#xD;
      offered as a guide to action, can support behaviour change. In the current study we aim to&#xD;
      learn how to better help consumers in their daily life to make lifestyle choices that better&#xD;
      match their personal health target than their usual choices by providing personalised advice&#xD;
      and feedback. In this study we target consumers at risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) that are&#xD;
      highly motivated to change their dietary behaviour in view of improving health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to investigate the potential of personalised dietary&#xD;
      advice and feedback for initiating and maintaining dietary changes by consumers at risk of&#xD;
      MetS. In addition we want to evaluate understanding, applicability and personal benefit of&#xD;
      personalised dietary advice and feedback by the target population to be able to further&#xD;
      optimize the personalisation in future studies. The secondary objective is to explore&#xD;
      potential effects of personalised dietary advice and feedback on subjective health and&#xD;
      metabolic health parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study follows a one group pre-test post-test design with a duration of 16&#xD;
      weeks after the first advice is provided to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: In total 40 adult men and women at risk of metabolic syndrome will be&#xD;
      recruited from the consumer databases of Wageningen Food &amp; Biobased Research. Consumers are&#xD;
      eligible for study participation when they are highly motivated to change dietary behaviour,&#xD;
      willing to use technology, willing to share food purchase data as registered on a customer&#xD;
      card of the supermarket, and in possession of a smart-phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention consists of personalised dietary advice and feedback on actual&#xD;
      behaviour and health status that will be provided to study participants at set time points&#xD;
      throughout the study period. The content of the advice will be generated partly automated&#xD;
      based on dietary intake and parameters of metabolic health using knowledge rules that are&#xD;
      developed for this study. During a consultation with the dietician, the advice is then&#xD;
      translated in a dietary behaviour change strategy by taking into account individual&#xD;
      preferences through motivational interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcomes of the study are the adequacy of intake of&#xD;
      fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, dairy, fish, fats &amp; oils, red meat, processed meat,&#xD;
      and sweetened beverages &amp; fruit juices as estimated by the online tool Eetscore. Furthermore&#xD;
      consumer experiences and individual benefits of the provided personalised dietary advice are&#xD;
      monitored on a weekly basis throughout the intervention period.&#xD;
