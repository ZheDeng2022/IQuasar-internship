  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study to assess the safety and tolerability of an orally administered natural product&#xD;
      derived from hops, called xanthohumol, in humans with Crohn's Disease, in order to identify a&#xD;
      biological signature of xanthohumol exposure, and to characterize the role of xanthohumol&#xD;
      metabolism by intestinal microorganisms in that signature within adults with Crohn's Disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-masked, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial of xanthohumol, which&#xD;
      is a constituent of hops (Humulus lupulus). Hops and its constituents have a long history of&#xD;
      use for a variety of conditions. However, knowledge is limited regarding the measurable&#xD;
      biological markers of human exposure, and the role of xanthohumol metabolism by&#xD;
      microorganisms present in the gut, particularly in individuals with gut pathologies such as&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease. This information is necessary for the development of xanthohumol as a&#xD;
      potential therapeutic intervention in such conditions.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization will occur in up to 8 blocks of 4 based on biological sex. Initial randomization series will be generated using readily available random sequence generators designed to do so. A series of sequential envelopes will be generated, each containing the allocation for one participant. Envelopes will be opaque and signed across the seal. The randomization &quot;code&quot; will be kept in a sealed envelope with a signature across the label and dated the day of creation. Study product and comparator (placebo) will be compounded and placed in identical opaque capsules outside the institution.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline: Composite Symptoms: Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index or CDAI is frequently used to assess disease severity. It gives a score ranging from 0 to over 600, based on a diary of symptoms kept by the patient for 7 days, and other measurements such as the patient's weight and haematocrit. A CDAI score of less than 150 is considered to be remission, a score greater than 220 is considered to define moderate to severe disease, and a score greater than 300 is considered to be severe disease. Most major research studies on medications in Crohn's disease define response as a fall of the CDAI of greater than 70 points.</description>
