  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will create a video-based app that empowers home healthcare workers to&#xD;
      communicate with clients and their families about managing health and safety hazards in&#xD;
      client homes. Using a participatory approach, home healthcare workers will 1) review and&#xD;
      revise video scripts and recordings that demonstrate effective and less effective&#xD;
      communication strategies when talking to clients, families, and other stakeholders about&#xD;
      health and safety hazards and 2) contribute to the creation and review of an interactive app&#xD;
      that they perceive to be useful, usable, and desirable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project includes two of three original aims. The first aim (Aim 1), already completed,&#xD;
      created scripts based on real-world scenarios regarding speaking with clients and families&#xD;
      about health and safety hazards in their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data from Aim 1, the research team has prepared scripts describing each&#xD;
      scenario. Each scenario includes two to three different approaches that represent successful,&#xD;
      less successful, and/or unsuccessful examples of communicating about solving difficult or&#xD;
      complex health and safety challenges. Each scenario includes a short introductory statement&#xD;
      about the context of the scenario and two to three subsequent scripts and/or recordings that&#xD;
      demonstrate the different communication approaches. Scenarios with successful communication&#xD;
      strategies present the approach and outcomes that are consistent with best practices for&#xD;
      HHW's in a given situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aims 2 and 3, participants will participate in either an individual or group interview&#xD;
      using Zoom, Teams, or similar. They will review scripted scenarios and, as they are&#xD;
      developed, video recordings based on the scripted scenarios. They will answer questions about&#xD;
      the relevance of the information, how realistic the dialogue is, the usefulness of the&#xD;
      information, and changes/improvements they would make. In addition, participants will review&#xD;
      an app designed to allow users to select the videos they wish to view, and view successful,&#xD;
      less successful, and unsuccessful communication approaches and outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Video and App Review</intervention_name>
    <description>Scenario Review: The scripts and/or videos will be iteratively reviewed by individual and small groups of home healthcare personnel using Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or similar. The participants will review scripts and/or recordings of the scripts and discuss how well each situation has been represented, how to improve it, and whether it is applicable in their agency.&#xD;
App Review: Following review of the scenarios, participants will review the smartphone app currently under development, including the control buttons, their placements, and other features of the screen interface. The first 9-12 participants (approximately) will be asked to provide feedback on the app's layout, control locations, and overall appearance. Once suggested changes have been made, the app will then be reviewed by the remaining participants for final review and usability assessment.</description>
