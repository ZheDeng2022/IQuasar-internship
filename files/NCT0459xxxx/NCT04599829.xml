  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decathlon has developed Ankle STRONG products which are medical devices that must be&#xD;
      positioned around the ankle to limit ankle sprain occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ankle STRONG devices cover a range of 3 products (Ankle STRONG 100/500/900). The&#xD;
      differences between the devices is based on the strength of compression and the ankle&#xD;
      maintain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this multicentre study is to collect data on the related clinical&#xD;
      complications and clinical outcomes of market-approved Decathlon Ankle STRONG products to&#xD;
      demonstrate safety and performance of these devices in a real-world setting.&#xD;
