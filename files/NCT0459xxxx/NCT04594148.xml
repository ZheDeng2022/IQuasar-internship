  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older people show deficits in dynamic weight-shifting, as the investigators found that more&#xD;
      time is needed to perform weight-shifts and the movements became less fluent and accurate in&#xD;
      older versus younger adults. Deficits with weight-shifting in the mediolateral (left-right)&#xD;
      direction have been linked to balance and falls in ageing. Balance control can be improved&#xD;
      with training. Virtual reality (VR) based training programs for improving balance are gaining&#xD;
      ground, as it can provide both fun and challenging balance tasks, enhancing motivation. The&#xD;
      investigators demonstrated earlier that older adults show an overloaded neural activation&#xD;
      pattern compared to young adults when performing the same VR-based mediolateral&#xD;
      weight-shifting task (wasp game). What is yet unclear, is whether improved balance capacity&#xD;
      can be gained with training and whether such an intervention impacts the underlying neural&#xD;
      mechanisms. Using a combination of behavioral assessments and functional Near-Infrared&#xD;
      Spectrocopy (fNIRS), the primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a&#xD;
      VR-based weight-shift training and its underlying neural imprint in older adults. Next to the&#xD;
      wasp game, a mediolateral tracking task will be used to standardize weight-shifting speed to&#xD;
      allow a comparison of fNIRS data during stable weight-shifting performance. Furthermore, as a&#xD;
      previous study done by the investigators also showed that adding an extra cognitive task in a&#xD;
      so-called dual-task (DT) negatively affects weight-shifting performance, a secondary aim will&#xD;
      be to test whether weight-shift training will enhance performance during such DT conditions.&#xD;
      The results of this study may contribute to the future design of technology-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, 40 healthy older adults will be included. A previous fNIRS study done by the&#xD;
      investigators (unpublished) revealed that our primary outcome, weight-shifting speed,&#xD;
      improved from 0,0668 ± 0,0255 m/s to 0,0916 ± 0,0350 m/s. Based on Caljouw et al. (2016), the&#xD;
      investigators expect a training effect size of 20%, resulting in a weight-shifting speed of&#xD;
      0.1094 ± 0,0418 m/s. Applying a power of 80% and alpha of 0.05 for a repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      with a within-between interaction design (within: pre vs post; between: training vs control)&#xD;
      the investigators calculated a total sample size of 40 participants (20 per group).&#xD;
      Considering possible data exclusion due to fNIRS measurements, the collected fNIRS data will&#xD;
      be monitored during recruitment, and more participants will be recruited if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to training on day 1, participants will be screened for inclusion based on the Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Other cognitive assessments include the Flanker (inhibition),&#xD;
      Set-Shifting (shifting attention), and Benton Judgement of Line Orientation (visuospatial&#xD;
      ability) test, which will be administered on day 2. The Falls Efficacy Scale International&#xD;
      (FES-I), a sarcopenia questionnaire (SARC-F), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)&#xD;
      will also be administered on day 2 to assess fear of falling, sarcopenia, and the quality of&#xD;
      sleep of the night between day 1 and day 2 of the experiment, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both weight-shifting assessment and training, the VR-based Wasp Game will be used. Before&#xD;
      starting the Wasp Game, functional limits of stability (fLOS) will be assessed by asking the&#xD;
      participant to move the Centre of Mass (CoM) as far as possible over its base of support in&#xD;
      eight different directions by pushing a virtual bar away from the center position. Maximum&#xD;
      CoM shifts will be calculated and used for personalized scaling of the Wasp Game. The Wasp&#xD;
      Game was developed and piloted to meet the requirements for balance training for older people&#xD;
      and can capture weight-shifting speed and accuracy as learning outcomes. In the Wasp Game,&#xD;
      the player is in the middle of an area infested by wasps. By moving the CoM towards a&#xD;
      pre-defined 80% of the fLOS, a water stream will come on to hit the wasp. The Wasp Game&#xD;
      single-task (WASP-ST) involves hitting wasps in the mediolateral (ML) direction only. During&#xD;
      the Wasp Game dual-task (WASP-DT), a serial subtraction task is added as the secondary task,&#xD;
      whereby the red ball (representing the CoM) will change color from red to white and white to&#xD;
      red within a random interval between 2-5 seconds. A starting number will appear on the screen&#xD;
      for 1.5 seconds at the beginning of each trial. Every time the ball changes its color,&#xD;
      subtractions have to be made in threes. Subjects will indicate the correct number afterward,&#xD;
      so as not to disturb the fNIRS recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During training on day 1, participants will perform 10 blocks of 2.5 min weight-shifting&#xD;
      within the WASP-ST. Before, after, and 24h after training, balance performance will be&#xD;
      assessed with the Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (MiniBEST), and weight-shifting&#xD;
      ability with the fLOS, the WASP-ST, and WASP-DT. During the WASP-ST and WASP-DT, oxygenated&#xD;
      (HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) will be assessed simultaneously by means of&#xD;
      functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). To be able to compare HbO2 and HHb levels&#xD;
      relative to a baseline, both the WASP-ST and WASP-DT will be offered in a block design of 20&#xD;
      sec standing still and looking at a screen capture of the Wasp Game and 20 sec of&#xD;
      weight-shifting within the Wasp Game, alternating in 10 trials. In addition, weight-shifting&#xD;
      speed will be standardized by implementing a white ball that participants have to track in&#xD;
      the ML direction, to be able to compare fNIRS data on similar behavioral performance. The&#xD;
      same block design will be implemented for this task. Cortical regions assessed with fNIRS&#xD;
      include the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF), premotor cortex (PMC),&#xD;
      supplementary motor area (SMA), and supplementary sensory cortex (SSC). To ensure similar&#xD;
      fNIRS recording on all test moments, only the optodes will be removed between pre and&#xD;
      post-testing while the cap stays in place. Between post and retention testing, certain spots&#xD;
      on the head (i.e. Cz) will be marked to guide cap placement on day 2. In a recent study,&#xD;
      fNIRS was found to have adequate test-retest reliability.&#xD;
