  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of resuscitative endovascular balloon&#xD;
      occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) as an adjunct treatment to advanced cardiovascular life&#xD;
      support (ACLS) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) carries a high mortality rate. The treatment of&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is ACLS as stated in the guidelines from the Norwegian&#xD;
      Resuscitation Council and the European Resuscitation Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, REBOA has been proposed as an adjunct treatment in management of non-traumatic&#xD;
      cardiac arrest patients, because thoracic aortic occlusion provides a redistribution of the&#xD;
      cardiac output to organs proximal to the occlusion. Preclinical studies demonstrate that&#xD;
      REBOA during CPR provide both increased coronary artery blood flow and perfusion pressure and&#xD;
      increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first prospective trial in the world to assess the efficacy of REBOA in&#xD;
      non-traumatic cardiac arrest. The intervention is shown feasible in the pre-hospital setting.&#xD;
      If this trial provides a signal of benefit in patients, this study could initiate further&#xD;
      clinical research which could change current resuscitation practice world-wide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, parallel group, multi-centre, phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to be included to the control group or the&#xD;
      intervention group. The control group receives ACLS according to national guidelines, while&#xD;
      the intervention group receives ACLS according to national guidelines and the REBOA procedure&#xD;
      as an adjunct treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REBOA procedure is performed by a team consisting of a physician (anesteshiologist) and a&#xD;
      paramedic, working at a helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) base. All operators will&#xD;
      be properly educated and tested before they can include patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients in the intervention group achieves ROSC, the balloon will be deflated and&#xD;
      post-ROSC treatment will be continued as per routine.&#xD;

    <description>In the intervention group, intra-aortic blood pressure measurements from the REBOA catheter are recorded. This applies only to the catheters with CE/FDA approval for invasive blood pressure measurements and will therefore be assessed in a sub-group of the participants.
