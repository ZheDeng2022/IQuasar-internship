      This study will evaluate the ability of a new High Velocity Nasal Insufflation [HVNI] device&#xD;
      design to effect ventilation and related physiological responses relative to the current HVNI&#xD;
      device design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of a new HVNI device to improve&#xD;
      ventilation, dyspnea, and related physiological responses relative to the conventional&#xD;
      Precision Flow device design, with which there are published clinical outcomes data. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the new HVNI device design (V2.0) will be comparable at relieving patient&#xD;
      dyspnea when compared to the conventional HVNI device design (Precision Flow).&#xD;
