  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in pediatric,&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors (hereafter referred to as PAYA-CS).&#xD;
      Exercise is a cornerstone of CVD prevention and treatment; yet, exercise has not been adopted&#xD;
      as a standard of care in PAYA-CS at high CVD risk. The HIMALAYAS trial is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and preliminary impact of an exercise-based CR on cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) and psychosocial health, as well as CVD risk, in PAYA-CS with mild heart dysfunction&#xD;
      (stage B heart failure (SBHF)). The primary objective of the HIMALAYAS pilot study is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of a two-arm randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate impact&#xD;
      of a 'CR-like' cardio-oncology rehabilitation (CORE) intervention on CV, psychosocial, and&#xD;
      behavioural outcomes at 6 and 24 months, compared to behavioural support only (Support) in&#xD;
      PAYA-CS. Screened PAYA-CS without SBHF and those with SBHF who do not participate in the RCT&#xD;
      will be enrolled in an passive behavioural support (PBS) group. The primary outcome is study&#xD;
      feasibility, defined according to three primary criteria (i.e., participant recruitment,&#xD;
      safety, and adherence). Secondary outcomes include additional feasibility metrics (e.g.,&#xD;
      intervention safety and tolerability) and exploratory efficacy outcomes including peak&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), cardiac function (e.g., global longitudinal strain&#xD;
      (GLS)), CVD risk factor control (e.g. insulin resistance), and patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g. anxiety). Our central hypothesis is that the conduct of a larger phase II RCT comparing&#xD;
      the impact of CORE versus Support will be feasible indicated by the achievement of our&#xD;
      primary feasibility criteria. Our exploratory hypothesis is that we will generate preliminary&#xD;
      evidence that CORE can improve VO2peak, cardiac function, CVD risk factor, and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes over 6- and 24-month timepoints, relative to Support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 90,000 North Americans are diagnosed with cancer before the age of 40. Improved cancer&#xD;
      therapies have led to an exponential growth in the number of pediatric, adolescent, and young&#xD;
      adult cancer survivors (PAYA-CS) who are expected to live 50-60 years beyond diagnosis.&#xD;
      However, PAYA-CS are at increased risk of developing multiple cancer- and treatment-related&#xD;
      morbidities including poor fitness (e.g., low VO2peak), hypertension (HTN), diabetes, and&#xD;
      poor mental health, which all contribute to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). The&#xD;
      prevalence of CVD events (e.g. heart failure, heart attack, stroke) is up to 23.8% in adult&#xD;
      survivors of pediatric cancers with long term follow-up after treatment. The incidence of&#xD;
      subclinical CVD, which is a precursor to CVD events, is even higher in PAYA-CS; up to 40%,&#xD;
      11%, and 5% experience subclinical cardiomyopathy measured by abnormal global longitudinal&#xD;
      strain (GLS), diastolic dysfunction (DD) or mild reduction in left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction (LVEF), respectively, and 18% experience reduced aerobic fitness. The treatment of&#xD;
      modifiable CVD risk factors must be considered a fundamental target for improving CVD&#xD;
      health-related outcomes in PAYA-CS. To this end, exercise and best-practices for CVD risk&#xD;
      factor modification are integral to a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) model. Traditional cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation models for patients with CVD (consisting of exercise, CVD risk factor&#xD;
      treatment, and patient education) are safe and effective in improving HRQoL, morbidity, and&#xD;
      mortality risk. However, by virtue of their age and low short-term CVD risk, PAYA-CS do not&#xD;
      meet traditional criteria for initiating CR and are less likely to receive treatments to&#xD;
      reduce CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAYA-CS with stage B heart failure (SB¬HF): (1) are at high risk for subsequent HF/CVD death;&#xD;
      (2) have lower cardiopulmonary fitness; and (3) are more likely to benefit from CVD risk&#xD;
      factor management. Considering that PAYA-CS have an estimated 33% prevalence of SBHF, this&#xD;
      vulnerable cohort of cancer survivors represent an opportunity for intervention that is&#xD;
      highly feasible and potentially impactful. Exercise is a preferred method for optimizing&#xD;
      health and survival in PAYA-CS. However, we need models that safely and effectively deliver&#xD;
      exercise interventions that meet the unique needs of this population. The cardio-oncology&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CORE) model is an intervention that would provide PAYA-CS with SBHF a&#xD;
      supervised and home-based exercise therapy, CVD risk factor modification, and behavioural&#xD;
      support to reduce the risk of CVD. Nevertheless, due to the ambitious nature of the study, it&#xD;
      is vital that we conduct a pilot version of the study to determine the feasibility and needed&#xD;
      changes to achieve the best possible results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the HIMALAYAS pilot study is to assess the feasibility, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of a (1) two-arm RCT-based comparison of the CORE and Support interventions in&#xD;
      PAYA-CS with SBHF, and (2) parallel passive behavioural support (PBS) cohort of PAYA-CS at&#xD;
      high-risk of cancer-related CVD. The exploratory objectives of the study include (1) to&#xD;
      compare the changes in primary exploratory outcome (VO2peak) and secondary exploratory&#xD;
      outcomes (markers of cardiac function, CVD risk factor management, and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes) between a CORE and Support intervention for PAYA-CS from baseline (T0) to 6-month&#xD;
      (T1) follow-up and (2) to compare the changes in the primary and secondary exploratory&#xD;
      outcomes between (1) CORE and Support from T0 to 12-month (T2) and 24-month (T3) follow-up,&#xD;
      and (2) CORE, Support, and PBS from T0 to T3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardio-oncology Rehabilitation (CORE) Group: CORE consists of exercise therapy, CVD risk&#xD;
      factor management for the first 6 months (as per current standards in CR models) and&#xD;
      behavioural support for the entire 2-year intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support Group: The Support group will receive the behavioural support only. The timing and&#xD;
      nature of all education, information, and peer support provided to Support participants will&#xD;
      be identical to what is provided to CORE participants. The key difference in the long-term&#xD;
      behavioural support strategy between CORE and Support participants is how weekly exercise&#xD;
      goals are defined. Unlike the CORE participants who will be encouraged to use the personal&#xD;
      activity intelligence (PAI) Score, Support participants will be given the challenge of&#xD;
      meeting and maintaining the updated physical activity (PA) guidelines for cancer survivors&#xD;
      (i.e., 90 to 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity PA per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive Behavioural Support (PBS) Groups: All PBS cohort participants will receive the same&#xD;
      wrist-worn heart rate monitor and PA tracker as the CORE and Support participants. However,&#xD;
      PBS participants will be blindly randomized to one of two passive behavioural support&#xD;
      interventions (PBS1 and PBS2). PBS1 participants will be asked to download the same PAI&#xD;
      Health application as CORE participants and will similarly be given the challenge of meeting&#xD;
      and maintaining a weekly PAI Score ≥100 throughout the 18-month follow-up period. PBS2&#xD;
      participants will be asked to download and use the Map My Walk (Under Armour, Baltimore)&#xD;
      application and will be challenged to meet and maintain the updated PA guidelines for cancer&#xD;
      survivors (i.e., 90 to 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity PA per week).&#xD;
