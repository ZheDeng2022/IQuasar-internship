  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine 30 patients between ages 50-80, newly diagnosed with early-stage&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease. Patients will be randomized to receive either Citalopram or&#xD;
      Carbidopa-levodopa. The investigators' primary outcome measure will be change in quality of&#xD;
      life over a prospective period of 6 months. Secondary outcome measures will include change in&#xD;
      mood state and motor symptoms, as well as comparison of improvement between two treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary investigators would also like to collect quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG)&#xD;
      recordings, which is a reading of brain activity as an additional interest of this study.&#xD;
      Primary investigators will assess the qEEG recordings for electrophysiological findings&#xD;
      before and after interventions.&#xD;

    <measure>Difference between two arms in change of Short Form-36 (SF-36) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a 6-month Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) intervention study, assess whether Citalopram can improve Quality Of Life (QOL) significantly more than carbidopa-levodopa in early stage Parkinson's disease. This will be measured as a change in SF-36 scores, where the lower scores are associated with more disability. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a 6-months RCT intervention study, assess whether citalopram can improve motor function in early stage Parkinson's disease. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor examination indicates higher scores to be associated with more disability. Score ranges from 0 to 132.</description>

    <description>Using a 6-months RCT intervention study, assess whether citalopram can improve mood symptoms equally or significantly more than carbidopa-levodopa in early stage Parkinson's disease.
