  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the safety and short-term performance between&#xD;
      THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF-5D QDOT system used with fast ablation mode and the standard&#xD;
      Thermocool Smartouch SF in treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The very high power-short duration (vHPSD) catheter, is a novel CF catheter optimized for&#xD;
      temperature-controlled ablation with microelectrodes and 6 thermocouples for real-time&#xD;
      temperature monitoring during ablation. The associated vHPSD algorithm modulates power to&#xD;
      maintain target temperature during these vHPSD lesions (90 W, 4 s). In preclinical models,&#xD;
      vHPSD ablation with this novel catheter has improved atrial linear lesion contiguity,&#xD;
      transmurality, and durability and has substantially reduced radiofrequency ablation times,&#xD;
      but with a safety profile similar to those of standard irrigated radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QDOT -FAST study demonstrated the clinical feasibility and safety of vHPSD ablation.&#xD;
      Procedure and fluoroscopy times were substantially lower than historical standard ablation&#xD;
      with point-by-point catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to compare the safety and short-term performance between&#xD;
      THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF-5D QDOT system used with fast ablation mode and the standard&#xD;
      Thermocool Smartouch SF in treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;

    <description>Prospective, single-center, non-randomized, open label, two arm study. After informed consent, 60 consecutive subjects who are scheduled to undergo AF ablation will be enrolled in the study in two equally sized groups of 30 subjects each. One group will undergo the procedure with assistance THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF-5D QDOT system and the other with the standard Thermocool Smartouch SF system. Data will be collected from all subjects during the ablation procedure and post procedure for a period of 12 months. Data will be anonymized by removing patient protected health information, only initials will be used.</description>
