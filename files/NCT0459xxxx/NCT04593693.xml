  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if use of the Medela Invia Motion NPWT system&#xD;
      supports acceptable progress towards the goal of therapy when treating patients with a&#xD;
      variety of wound types during the evaluation period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether clinical opinion of product performance results&#xD;
      in expected wound response and outcomes when using the Medela Invia Motion Endure NPWT system&#xD;
      during 4-week study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Goal of therapy will be defined by the physician according to initial assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints (dependent on goal of therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in wound volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in size of the tunneling area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in size of undermining&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in amount of slough&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in granulation tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in edema/periwound swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The wound bed is progressing acceptably towards a transition to another treatment&#xD;
           modality such as Moist Wound Healing (MWH), surgical closure, or a flap or graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Study endpoint will be determined by physician at the time of enrollment, when the goal of&#xD;
      therapy is documented**&#xD;
