  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the circumstances of onset and management of exertional heatstroke have been&#xD;
      identified for several years, its pathophysiology remains imperfectly understood. Exertional&#xD;
      heatstroke is the result of both extrinsic (i.e. environmental) and intrinsic (i.e.&#xD;
      individual) contributing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extrinsic factors are well known (high ambient temperature and hygrometry, poorly&#xD;
      &quot;breathable&quot; clothing, intense and prolonged physical effort) but some of them may be&#xD;
      observed in milder conditions. In the French Armed Forces, 25% of the exertional heatstrokes&#xD;
      that have been reported between 2005 and 2011 occurred below 17°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrinsic factors, on the other hand, are numerous and less consensual, partly because of the&#xD;
      imperfect knowledge of exertional heatstroke physiopathology. Potential factors include a&#xD;
      thermoregulatory defect (inability to maintain a temperature plateau during an effort) and&#xD;
      several genetic mutations may also contribute to explain a propensity to present an&#xD;
      exertional heatstroke. While exertional heatstroke is clearly not a monogenic pathology, the&#xD;
      association of several polymorphisms could contribute to this vulnerability. Among the genes&#xD;
      that have been explored, mutations in ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR 1), calsequestrin-1 or&#xD;
      angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) appear to be potential candidates. However, it is very&#xD;
      likely that other polymorphisms may be involved, such as: genes involved in sports&#xD;
      performance and exercise rhabdomyolysis, in the inflammatory cascade, permeability of the&#xD;
      digestive epithelial barrier, adenosine receptors and susceptibility to anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, motivation is a mixed factor often claimed to be involved in exertional heatstroke&#xD;
      but has never been quantified and needs to be objectified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, none of these hypotheses has been clearly assessed by comparing patients who&#xD;
      experienced exertional heatstroke to healthy subjects.&#xD;
