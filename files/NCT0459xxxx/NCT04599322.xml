  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to check the balance effects of dry needling in the Flexor&#xD;
      digitorum Brevis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighteen healthy subjects wil be recruited for a quasi-experimental study. Participants will&#xD;
      be from 18 to 40 years old, not obese. Participants will be measured before and after&#xD;
      bilateral dry neddling in Flexor digitorum Brevis. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      stabilometry variables with eyes open and closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures. Stabilometry will be measured by displacement of the center of pressures in X and Y&#xD;
      with eyes open and closed , center of pressure (COP) with eyes open and closed, COP area with&#xD;
      eyes open and closed, COP antero-posterior (a-p) and medio-lateral (m-lat) directions with&#xD;
      eyes open and closed, and COP speed. Two trials will be recorded for each condition and the&#xD;
      order of the conditions will be randomized across subjects, eyes open and eyes closed.&#xD;
