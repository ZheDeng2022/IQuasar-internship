      Normal heart function involves rhythmic contraction of all four chambers of the heart and&#xD;
      this rhythm is maintained by the electrical wiring (conduction system) of the heart.&#xD;
      Abnormality in this system results in either very slow or very fast heart rates leading to&#xD;
      insufficient blood supply to the body due to inefficient pumping of the heart. cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy pacemaker and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator&#xD;
      devices are used to synchronise heart function. The purpose of this study is not only to&#xD;
      determine the pattern of electrical wiring of the heart and identify the variations seen in&#xD;
      individuals with heart failure, but also, to explore the benefits of different types of&#xD;
      pacing using CRT devices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is an abnormality of cardiac structure or function leading to failure of&#xD;
      the heart to deliver oxygen at the rate commensurate with the requirement of the patient or&#xD;
      is able to do so only at the expense of elevated left ventricular filling pressures. European&#xD;
      Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2016 guidelines defined HF as a syndrome in which patients have&#xD;
      typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, swelling and fatigue) and signs (elevated jugular&#xD;
      pressure, pulmonary crackles and displaced apex beat) resulting from an abnormality of&#xD;
      cardiac structure or function. Patients with HF experience decreased exercise capacity,&#xD;
      inability to perform activities of daily living, diminished quality of life, increased&#xD;
      frequency of hospitalization and higher rates of mortality. HF is highly prevalent and&#xD;
      affects approximately 26 million people worldwide with an estimated mortality of 50% within 5&#xD;
      years of diagnosis.1, 2 It remains a major threat to the public health system since more than&#xD;
      1 million patients are hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of HF annually, and, in western&#xD;
      countries it is the most common cause of hospitalization in individuals &gt;65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using biventricular (BiV) pacing has been developed&#xD;
      to restore synchrony in HF patients with delayed ventricular activation, predominantly of the&#xD;
      left ventricle (LV). Studies have demonstrated that simultaneous or sequential BiV pacing&#xD;
      restores the synchrony of contraction, reduces mitral regurgitation, and improves cardiac&#xD;
      output. Several landmark clinical trials published in the past few years have provided&#xD;
      compelling evidence that CRT can produce significant clinical benefits, including&#xD;
      improvements in patients' HF symptoms, quality of life, hospitalization rates, and&#xD;
      echocardiographic measures which confer a mortality benefit. Majority of patients show a&#xD;
      benefit from CRT treatment however, up to 40% derive no improvement. In the MIRACLE study,&#xD;
      34% of patients did not demonstrate an improvement based on a clinical composite score (CCS)&#xD;
      that combined all-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
      class and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Quality of Life Score. Birnie and Tang et&#xD;
      al have summarized nonresponder rates from various clinical studies and the authors suggest&#xD;
      that while most studies quote non-responder rates at 20-30% the true rate may be as high as&#xD;
      40-50%. They indicate that the inconsistencies might be largely due to the lack of standard&#xD;
      definitions or methodologies to measure CRT response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise mechanisms determining response are yet to be fully elucidated. It is generally&#xD;
      believed that success is based on minimizing electrical activation times in the LV with a&#xD;
      fusion between a left ventricular wavefront from a lead placed in the coronary sinus (CS) and&#xD;
      a wavefront from a lead placed in the RV or an intrinsic wavefront.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of different RV pacing sites have been varied in terms of their relationship to&#xD;
      outcomes from CRT pacing. Initial smaller studies showed different outcomes between right&#xD;
      ventricular apex (RVA) and outflow tract (RVOT) lead position, however further studies failed&#xD;
      to demonstrate a benefit. Following this it was demonstrated that lead position initially&#xD;
      believed to be septal were in fact antero-septal and that co-ordinated conduction would not&#xD;
      be expected from these sites. Differing activation patterns have been demonstrated on&#xD;
      Electroanatomic mapping (EAM) between intrinsic left bundle branch block (LBBB&#xD;
      (circumferential)) and RV apical pacing (longitudinal). Another small study showed that RV&#xD;
      lead placement at the site of latest activation during LV pacing improved acute haemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements compared to standard RVA pacing, as did a true mid septal site compared to RVOT&#xD;
      pacing - with the RV septum being the latest activated site during LV pacing when the CS lead&#xD;
      was in the lateral vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LV septal activation has been proposed as a possible contributor to a successful response to&#xD;
      CRT implantation. Trans-septal activation time has been shown in an animal model to&#xD;
      correspond to the presence or absence of Heart failure when an LBBB is present, and&#xD;
      successful acute haemodynamic response correlated to minimal epicardial activation time, LV&#xD;
      endocardial pre-excitation and shortest QRS duration. Trans-septal conduction times have also&#xD;
      been theorized to account for why QRS shortening with CRT is less than expected, however the&#xD;
      degree to which this contributes is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ventricular total and septal scar have also been correlated to non-response to CRT. This&#xD;
      would be expected to contribute to a longer trans-septal activation, as well as to local&#xD;
      tissue strain measurement on echocardiography. Patterns of scar and their relationship to&#xD;
      trans-septal activation times have not been documented. In the normal human heart up to three&#xD;
      early endocardial sites have been documented and the location of scar relative to these sites&#xD;
      and its effect is unknown. Earliest LV septal activation in LBBB heart failure patients may&#xD;
      occur in mid septal regions suggesting activation of the LBB or outside of this region&#xD;
      demonstrating direct trans-septal conduction, whether this correlates to CRT response is yet&#xD;
      to be determined. Further evidence exists that there is a delay between electrical and&#xD;
      mechanical activation of different cardiac segments (EMD), and that this is variable in the&#xD;
      normal heart, as well as in the failing heart where it is further exacerbated between septal&#xD;
      and lateral walls of the left ventricle. Reduction in total activation time may increase the&#xD;
      total amount of myocardium recruited at any time point and that this may minimize EMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single arm, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, clinical investigation of 20&#xD;
      subjects is designed to characterize RV and LV septal activation patterns in CRT patients&#xD;
      with various pacing configurations. The study will also assess the association of CRT&#xD;
      response to septal activation patterns, septal scar and morphology of surface ECG.&#xD;
