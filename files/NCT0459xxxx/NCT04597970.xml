      Purpose：explore the effectiveness and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus&#xD;
      Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy (HAIC) with oxaliplatin and raltitrexed for Barcelona&#xD;
      stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thhis is a non-randomized, open, single-arm clinical study. patients receive cTACE+HAIC&#xD;
      (oxaliplatin, raltitrexed) treatment, 6-8 weeks as a cycle, until the disease progresses,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity occurs, the patient is lost to follow-up or death, or situations other&#xD;
      judged by researchers which treatment should be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 66 patients End points：primary end points：safety 、objective response&#xD;
      rate，disease control rate，progression free overall survival，second end point ：overall&#xD;
      survival Include criteria：&#xD;
