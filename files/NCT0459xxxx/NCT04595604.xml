  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elective surgery is the most effective treatment option for colorectal cancer, however it has&#xD;
      been recognized to be associated with high morbidity and mortality risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) is a preoperative multimodality treatment package,&#xD;
      which has been well investigated and proved to be effective in reducing early postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay and hospital costs, as well. Still, a good&#xD;
      proportion of patients are not suitable for ERAS program, mainly based on lack of compliance&#xD;
      and the impaired physical function before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimodal Prehabilitation Program is a recently introduced preoperative preparation (training)&#xD;
      program, which addresses improvement of physical, mental and nutritional status of the high&#xD;
      risk elective surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the benefit of all efforts of a 4-6-week preoperative&#xD;
      preparation program (Prehabilitation) being added to an established ERAS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the effect of trimodal prehabilitation on gut microbiom diversity and its&#xD;
      relation to clinical outcome will be analyzed.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer patients with a planned resection are tested if a complex, trimodal&#xD;
      rehabilitation program can hold functional and morbidity benefit for them.&#xD;
&#xD;

      and tested ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery) Program.&#xD;
