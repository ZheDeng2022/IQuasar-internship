    <textblock>
      Family-centered prevention services for civilian dwelling military (CDM) families &amp; children&#xD;
      are rarely available in civilian communities or often framed around mental disorders and&#xD;
      family deficits. As of June 2010, over 1 million military service members from various&#xD;
      military conflicts have become veterans. Wartime deployments can adversely impact the&#xD;
      psychological health of children as well as marital relationships, parent-child relationships&#xD;
      &amp; overall family functioning. Although young children in CDM families may never have to cope&#xD;
      with another parental deployment, their families may continue to struggle with the lasting&#xD;
      effects of wartime deployment that cannot be ameliorated by singularly treating the service&#xD;
      member. There is a need for family-centered preventive interventions that effectively build&#xD;
      resilience and mitigate war deployment-related family difficulties, especially given the&#xD;
      potential adverse emotional &amp; developmental impact of deployment separations and&#xD;
      reintegration stress on young children and their parents. To address this need, this study&#xD;
      proposes to test the efficacy of FOCUS-EC (Families OverComing Under Stress for Early&#xD;
      Childhood), an established strength-based, family-centered preventive intervention that is&#xD;
      culturally sensitive and socially accepted by active duty military communities &amp; has&#xD;
      promising program evaluation data. A randomized control trial will be conducted with 200 CDM&#xD;
      families with young children, ages 3 to 5 years, recruited from Los Angeles &amp; surrounding&#xD;
      counties (200 veterans, 150 spouses, and 300 children). CDM families will be randomized to&#xD;
      the FOCUS-EC intervention condition (n=100 families; 100 veterans, 75 spouses, 150 children)&#xD;
      or web-based educational materials condition (n=100 families; 100 veterans, 75 spouses, and&#xD;
      150 children) and assessed at baseline, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months. It is hypothesized that in the&#xD;
      FOCUS-EC condition: 1) children will exhibit more positive social-emotional &amp; behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes &amp; developmental competencies than children in the comparison condition, 2) families&#xD;
      will exhibit more positive family environment, improved parenting, enhanced parent-child&#xD;
      relationships, &amp; fewer parent psychological health problems than families in the comparison&#xD;
      condition. The investigators also aim to explore potential moderating effects of child&#xD;
      health/development risk, military &amp; deployment/separation history, exposure to combat/trauma&#xD;
      during deployment, and veteran &amp; spouse/partner background factors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase I, the investigators modified FOCUS-EC for CDM families with young children, and&#xD;
      developed a platform for the web-based educational materials. The intervention manual,&#xD;
      training materials and assessments were also finalized. The research team already has&#xD;
      well-developed manuals for FOCUS-EC, including an intervention manual, technical assistance&#xD;
      manual, and training curriculum that have been used for various settings. Existing materials&#xD;
      have been customized for CDM families and will be housed online. Materials will include&#xD;
      information about child development and common reactions to early separations, as well as&#xD;
      deployment and family stress. The team also has extensive experience developing online&#xD;
      education for military families (for example, see www.focusproject.org). Online educational&#xD;
      information is a common governmental strategy to serve CDM families; the proposed design&#xD;
      enables a rigorous comparison of a facilitator-led interactive intervention (FOCUS-EC) to the&#xD;
      provision of standardized online resources. Finally in Phase 1, to ensure that FOCUS-EC would&#xD;
      meet the unique needs of CDM families, intervention sessions were modified and conducted with&#xD;
      CDM families. The investigators believe that this customization with a small group of CMD&#xD;
      families has been sufficient to identify the emerging needs of CDM families (e.g., challenges&#xD;
      associated with the transition to civilian life, renegotiating family roles more permanently,&#xD;
      shifting control or power between parents, reestablishing family routines and rituals, and&#xD;
      redefining family relationships), incorporate culturally sensitive language that is common to&#xD;
      this population, and tailor the FOCUS-EC for a home visit delivery model. Themes, current&#xD;
      concerns, and language identified were incorporated into the FOCUS-EC for CDM families&#xD;
      protocol. A similar approach was used to ensure that language used in FOCUS-EC was&#xD;
      appropriate for various branches of the service in the preliminary work. The finalized&#xD;
      intervention manual and training includes protocols and back-up procedures for clinical&#xD;
      emergencies and ethical issues, as documented in the current technical assistance manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All families will complete a baseline assessment, consisting of questionnaires, brief&#xD;
      interviews, and family observational tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline assessment, the family will be randomized into either the FOCUS-EC&#xD;
      condition or a web-based education condition. Simple block randomization will be done.&#xD;
      Families will be assigned to either the intervention or web-based resources control condition&#xD;
      using a computer-generated randomization list with block sizes of 2, 4, and 6. The code for&#xD;
      this randomization process can be found at:&#xD;
      http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/BlockRandomizationwithRandomBlockSizes. No&#xD;
      stratification will be done for gender, age, site, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized to the web-based education condition will be provided with an&#xD;
      account and password to a study-developed/supported website that will provide online&#xD;
      resources with content comparable to and consistent with FOCUS-EC intervention sessions. That&#xD;
      is, web-based materials will provide information on parent-child communication, emotion&#xD;
      regulation, problem-solving, stress management, and family resilience. Participants will not&#xD;
      be required to utilize these resources; they may access this website as often as they choose&#xD;
      and implement the information and strategies as they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These families will also complete the exact same assessments as those families in the&#xD;
      intervention condition. In addition, they will answer a questionnaire assessing various&#xD;
      aspects of the web-based resources (e.g., usefulness, ease of use/navigation, frequency of&#xD;
      use, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized to the FOCUS-EC condition will participate in six&#xD;
      intervention sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FOCUS-EC protocols and measures have been finalized, programmed, and tested, and informed&#xD;
      consent protocols were developed. FOCUS-EC will be delivered using a tele-health 6 session&#xD;
      manualized protocol. Sessions will be led by trained, Master's level facilitators leading&#xD;
      virtual home visiting sessions. FOCUS-EC is framed within a skill-building and&#xD;
      relationship-strengthening psycho-educational model that integrates research on traumatic&#xD;
      stress, child development, and the military-developed combat operational stress continuum&#xD;
      model for prevention. FOCUS-EC provides developmental guidance, parent education, and key&#xD;
      resilience skills that promote positive individual and family coping, including emotional&#xD;
      regulation, problem solving, goal setting, communication, and management of deployment and&#xD;
      combat stress reminders, which foster parent-child and family cohesion. The intervention is&#xD;
      delivered in six 45-90-minute sessions in the family's home via a computer, internet&#xD;
      connection, and webcam . Each session is structured with a check-in, review of the previous&#xD;
      week's &quot;home activity,&quot; primary activity and discussion, selection of a new &quot;home activity&quot;&#xD;
      for the week, and a closing check-out. The family learns and practices the skills during the&#xD;
      sessions, commits to practicing the skills during the week, and reports on their experiences&#xD;
      the following session so that skills can be reinforced and any necessary adjustments can be&#xD;
      made. FOCUS-EC promotes parenting skills and more cohesive family relationships in two key&#xD;
      phases: 1) creating a family deployment timeline and 2) enhancing parent-child interactions&#xD;
      (see figure 3). In the first phase, parents develop a family deployment narrative which&#xD;
      fosters understanding, communication, mutual support, and positive co-parenting across the&#xD;
      parenting dyad (session 1 and 2). This stage begins with a web-based family psychological&#xD;
      health &quot;check-in&quot; utilizing innovative programming already established by this team, and&#xD;
      utilized by families in service settings. This check-in serves to assist the facilitator and&#xD;
      the family in identifying strengths and areas of concern in the initial session through use&#xD;
      of standardized psychological health screening instruments (see Appendix). Parents set goals&#xD;
      for what they are motivated to achieve during program participation. Parents also recount a&#xD;
      narrative timeline for their deployment/separation and reintegration history. Through&#xD;
      perspective taking and active listening, parents bridge estrangements and enhance their&#xD;
      understanding of their child's reactions to deployments and separations, co-parenting, and&#xD;
      family leadership. In the second phase, parents work on enhancing parent-child interactions&#xD;
      in a series of parent-only education and parent-child practice sessions. In these alternating&#xD;
      sessions, parents model and help their children with emotional identification and&#xD;
      communication; learn and practice basic play, attunement, and relationship-enhancement&#xD;
      strategies; increase awareness of trauma, loss, and separation reminders that impact&#xD;
      effective parenting; practice behavior management techniques; elicit a developmentally&#xD;
      appropriate narrative of their child's experiences; and plan for the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team has experience with a number of innovative technologies designed to deliver&#xD;
      in-home preventive interventions utilizing a virtual delivery platform, including a secure&#xD;
      in-home &quot;teleprevention&quot; platform. This platform has been implemented through a service&#xD;
      delivery model pilot and has demonstrated the feasibility of remote/virtual home visits,&#xD;
      including a video-teleconferencing platform which enables participants to access sessions&#xD;
      using secure software (e.g., &quot;Go To Meeting&quot;). In home access to computers and internet in&#xD;
      this population is high; thus, it anticipated that this will not be a barrier to enrollment&#xD;
      and participation. All core intervention components and activities have been adapted for&#xD;
      remote delivery platform modifications, intervention training, delivery and technical support&#xD;
      manuals.&#xD;

    <description>Each parent will also participate in a 15 minute videotaped parent-child interaction task based on the NICHD Study of Early Child Care &quot;Three Bag&quot; semi-structured free play procedure. Mothers and fathers will be provided with three different but comparable sets of developmentally appropriate toys, and instructed to play with the toys in a specified order. Qualitative ratings developed for the NICHD Study of Early Child Care will be used to assess parent behavior (sensitivity/supportive presence, intrusiveness, detachment/disengagement, positive regard, and negative regard) Two research assistants will be trained to reliability to code the videotaped parent-child interactions. Dr. Paley has used this coding system in her previous and current research. Approximately 20% of the interactions will be double-coded to assess inter-rater reliability. Coders will be blind to treatment condition.</description>
