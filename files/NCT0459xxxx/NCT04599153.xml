  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blinded, cross-over study aim to evaluate the effects of shunt&#xD;
      treatment in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) by measuring cerebral&#xD;
      ventricular volume and clinical symptoms at different shunt opening pressures. Further,&#xD;
      proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be compared before and after shunt surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants are evaluated before surgery and one month, two months, three months and&#xD;
      three months plus one day after surgery. At each evaluation point a MRI of the brain with&#xD;
      volumetric sequences is performed and clinical data is collected (Walking speed and steps for&#xD;
      Time up and go, 10m walking and 3m walking backwards. Mini Mental State Examination, balance,&#xD;
      gait, self rating of incontinence, Epworth Sleepiness Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At surgery, all patients are given a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt (Strata ® ) with an&#xD;
      opening pressure setting of 1.5. After the first evaluation, one month postoperatively,&#xD;
      participants are randomized to either a higher (2.5) or a lower (1.0) opening pressure, ratio&#xD;
      1:1. The opening pressure setting is blinded both for patients and the clinician during the&#xD;
      subsequent clinical evaluations. At two months, the opening pressure is crossed over to the&#xD;
      alternative setting (2.5 or 1.0). At three months, all participants receive the lowest shunt&#xD;
      opening pressure (0.5) with the final evaluation the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semiautomatic measurement of the lateral as well as the third cerebral ventricles will be&#xD;
      performed using the MRI scans and volumetric software: SyMRI (SyntheticMR AB, Linköping,&#xD;
      Sweden)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF is collected at three times for each participant, from the lumbar spine pre- and 3 months&#xD;
      postoperatively and intracranially during surgery. Further, intracranial CSF is taken through&#xD;
      the Rickham Reservoir at the 3 months postoperative evaluation. After CSF from the&#xD;
      participants has been collected, a single batch mass spectrometry will be performed with all&#xD;
      the samples simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined to achieve 80% power for a two tailed paired t-test for a mean&#xD;
      change in ventricular volume of 8ml, estimated from postoperative change in ventricular&#xD;
      volume in a previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The volume of the ventricular system in the brain decreases significantly after&#xD;
           shunt-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ventricular volume is larger at high opening pressures compared to low opening&#xD;
           pressures of the shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The decrease in ventricular volume is related to clinical outcome.&#xD;
