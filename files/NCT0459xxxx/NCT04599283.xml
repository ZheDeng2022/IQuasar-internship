  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying MenHealth Mobile Uroflowmetry as a diagnostic tool for LUTS&#xD;
      (lower urinary tract symptoms), a group of conditions involving the bladder, urinary&#xD;
      sphincter, urethra and the prostate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As men age, they are at higher risk of developing lower urinary tract symptoms. The cause or&#xD;
      source of these symptoms can range from overactive bladder (OAB), urethral stricture disease,&#xD;
      and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are also often asked to return to clinic to perform a uroflow test in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate for expected post surgical improvement in flow or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the urinary flow in men with new lower urinary tract complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-office uroflow test involves an office visit, which often requires a patient copay and&#xD;
      other health care resources. In addition, it is performed in an artificial &quot;high pressure&quot;&#xD;
      environment and many patients find it difficult to present with a full bladder due to their&#xD;
      lower urinary tract symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research may help us determine whether an &quot;at home&quot; uroflow test can be used to obtain&#xD;
      similar diagnostic data in the patient's natural environment, without the need for an&#xD;
      in-office visit. A patient's test results taken at home in a comfortable environment could be&#xD;
      reliable and informative for both the patient and the doctor. This data can then be used to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to conduct a performance validation of MenHealth&#xD;
      Uroflowmetry application by comparing data obtained by MenHealth Uroflowmetry application&#xD;
      with the data obtained by a standard office Uroflowmeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is investigational. Its goal is to study and compare test results obtained by the&#xD;
      study subject using MenHealth application with the test results obtained from the subject's&#xD;
      office uroflow test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 60 subjects will participate in this study. The 60 subjects will comprise two groups:&#xD;
      Group 1/Symptomatic (45 subjects) and Group 2/Asymptomatic (15 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation in this study will last approximately 2 weeks and will include 2 study&#xD;
      visits to the study center. At the end of the 2 week period, subjects should have a minimum&#xD;
      of 10 reliable uroflowmetry tests done at home.&#xD;

    <description>To validate the performance of MenHealth Uroflowmetry application by measuring maximum flow, average flow, and voided volume obtained by MenHealth Uroflowmetry application and comparing this data with corresponding data obtained by a standard office Uroflowmeter. Every individual Uroflowmetry test contains these three parameters ( maximum flow, voided volume, and average flow) as an outcome measure.</description>

    <description>MenHealth Uroflowmeter is a mobile application and FDA cleared medical device that analyzes the sound of urine hitting the toilet water when a male urinates and generates voiding data (maximum flow, average flow, and voided volume) and a flow curve. All test results are saved in an automated voiding diary.</description>
