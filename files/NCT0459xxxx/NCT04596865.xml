  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic head malignancies are aggressive cancers that are often inoperable when they are&#xD;
      diagnosed. In the ~20% of patients who are diagnosed when the disease is still operable,&#xD;
      surgery is the only treatment that can provide a chance of cure. Unfortunately, up to 75% of&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery will have the cancer come back (recur). One of the reasons for&#xD;
      this is the challenge of removing the whole tumour with some surrounding non-cancerous tissue&#xD;
      to ensure that every tumour cell has been removed. This is difficult because there are many&#xD;
      structures very close to the pancreas (such as the blood vessels that supply the intestines)&#xD;
      that cannot be removed. A recent review study of &gt;1700 patients who had a Whipple's operation&#xD;
      (the cancer operation that is performed to remove the head of pancreas) and found that whilst&#xD;
      the majority of patients had cancer recurrence in distant sites (like the liver) that would&#xD;
      not be affected by how the operation was performed, 12% of patients had the cancer recur just&#xD;
      at the site of where the operation had been; this is known as 'local' recurrence. This&#xD;
      suggests that a small amount of cancer was not removed at the time of surgery in these&#xD;
      patients. Very few studies have looked at the relationship between the Computerised&#xD;
      Tomography (CT) scan before surgery and the histology results (information about the tumour&#xD;
      after it has been examined under the microscope) and whether this can predict exactly where&#xD;
      the tumour recurs. If investigators can find factors that predict which patients get local&#xD;
      only recurrence, investigators may be able to offer improved surgical techniques or other&#xD;
      therapies during or immediately after the operation to these patients, hopefully leading to&#xD;
      improved cure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective international study will look at these factors in patients who underwent a&#xD;
      Whipple's operation for pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer or ampullary cancer over a three&#xD;
      year period between 2012 and 2015. Participating centres will provide data on pre-operative&#xD;
      scans, complications around the time of surgery, any therapies (e.g. chemotherapy) that the&#xD;
      patients had and if and where the cancer recurred. With this information, investigators hope&#xD;
      to find ways to predict which patients will get local-only recurrence, so researchers can&#xD;
      select them for future studies to see if additional treatments can improve the chance of cure&#xD;
      from surgery for these patients.&#xD;

      Research window:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective observational cohort study will investigate the outcomes of patients who&#xD;
      underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at 30 hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) surgery centres in the&#xD;
      UK and abroad between 01/06/2012 and 31/05/2015. These dates were chosen because:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most HPB units would expect to see 30-50 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy per&#xD;
           annum. Based on the chief investigator's unit's prospectively maintained database of&#xD;
           consecutive patients, 310 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy during this window&#xD;
           (benign and malignant). A five year research window would provide a large number of&#xD;
           patients that is appropriate for subset analysis. This is especially important in distal&#xD;
           cholangiocarcinoma, which is less commonly treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy compared&#xD;
           to pancreatic and ampullary cancer. Even if all centres only provided 100 patients (20&#xD;
           per annum), this would provide a cohort of ~3000 patients. This number of cases will&#xD;
           have greater resolution to detect small but significant statistical differences in&#xD;
           studied variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The amount of data available on patient records reduces with chronicity, in part due to&#xD;
           a heavier reliance on paper rather than digital records. In addition, other reporting&#xD;
           standards (e.g. TNM staging and histology reporting) change over time. 2010 was selected&#xD;
           as a starting year as the 7th edition of the UICC TNM staging came into effect that&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An end date of June 2015 allows the study to collect full five-year follow up data on&#xD;
           all patients to June 2020, thus providing a complete data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by each participating centre on a purpose-built REDCap database.&#xD;
      REDCap is a well-established secure web-based data collection tool that is frequently used in&#xD;
      medical research involving several centres. Advantages include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Real-time collection of data from all centres visible to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guaranteed anonymity of patients as only anonymised data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-built data validation (e.g. set limits on expected ranges of values) to reduce poor&#xD;
           quality/erroneous data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easy download of data into a format suitable for processing on an appropriate&#xD;
           statistical software package (e.g. SPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability to display or hide questions based on previous responses to tailor data&#xD;
           collection to each record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REDCap access is provided through University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust (UHPNT). Data is&#xD;
      stored on the Microsoft Azure web-based cloud service. Servers are based in the EU and are&#xD;
      GDPR compliant. REDCap access will be provided to all participating centres (one user log in&#xD;
      per centre) for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected falls into the following categories (examples given after each category are&#xD;
      not exhaustive):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant ID number (anonymised).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics: Age, sex, body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities: Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, previous history&#xD;
           of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative imaging: Dates, modalities, maximum tumour size, radiological TNM stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative biliary drainage: Approach, stent type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant therapies: Type, duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Date, type, ASA grade, intraoperative procedures and findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative complications: Types, date of occurrence, Clavien-Dindo grade, treatment,&#xD;
           30-day readmission, 90-day mortality and cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histology: Cancer type, differentiation, tumour size, pathological TNM stage, R status,&#xD;
           involved margins and distance, total and involved number of resected lymph nodes,&#xD;
           perineural, microvascular and named vessel invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant therapies: Type, duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence: Date of recurrence, site(s) of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palliative therapies: Type, duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival: Disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of eligible patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see&#xD;
      below). Each unit will be responsible for screening patients for eligibility. All&#xD;
      participating units have confirmed that they already have an existing list of consecutive&#xD;
      patients who underwent PD during the research window. The clinical team at each participating&#xD;
      unit will be responsible for maintaining a password-protected participant look up database&#xD;
      that links the local patient hospital number to the anonymised participant ID number on&#xD;
      REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plymouth sub-study on sarcopenia and myosteatosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that sarcopenia and myosteatosis may indicate a higher risk of&#xD;
      postoperative complications, although its impact on DFS and OS is not yet established.&#xD;
      Patients entered into the study from Plymouth will also have their pre-operative CT scan&#xD;
      reviewed by a member of the research team trained in sarcopenia and myosteatosis estimation&#xD;
      (an academic radiology trainee). The clinicians taking the measurements will be unaware of&#xD;
      any outcomes or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is not being extended to other centres for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal values of tissue attenuation are specific to local populations due to the&#xD;
           variation in morphology of patients and the HU cut-offs in one country are not&#xD;
           applicable to other countries. It would therefore not be possible to pool data on&#xD;
           myosteatosis and sarcopenia from multiple countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As the measurement relies on pre-operative CT imaging, and CT scanners and protocols&#xD;
           vary between hospitals and change over time, it is difficult to retrospectively pool&#xD;
           such data from multiple sites and maintain meaningful data. Using a single centre&#xD;
           provides more robust data for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will be using an inbuilt software package that is part of Plymouth's&#xD;
           InSightWeb. This package may not be available in other centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this reduces the number of patients in the cohort, Plymouth will extend its research&#xD;
      window to 01/05/2006. This date was chosen as it is the beginning of their prospectively&#xD;
      maintained database. This provides a pre-screened population of 365 patients who underwent PD&#xD;
      at our unit, with a predicted 276 patients for analysis.&#xD;
