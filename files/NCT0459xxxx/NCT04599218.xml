      This research study is designed to determine if targeted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) fusion biopsy is better than the standard of care ultrasound guided biopsy&#xD;
      alone in diagnosing subjects with clinically significant prostate cancer with MRI visible&#xD;
      lesions. This study will consist of comparing the standard of care (ultrasound guided&#xD;
      prostate biopsy) with the protocol biopsy which consists of an ultrasound guided prostate&#xD;
      biopsy and a MRI/US fusion tracked prostate biopsy. There are two biopsy approaches we are&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a choice to be enrolled into the transrectal (TRUS) or transperineal (TP)&#xD;
      arms at their discretion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of targeting lesions for ultrasound-guided biopsy, surgery,or ablation may be&#xD;
      limited by the visibility of a target during the procedure. The successful outcome of the&#xD;
      intervention depends upon accurate device placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, prostate cancer was diagnosed by finger guided trans-rectal prostate biopsies.&#xD;
      However, with the advent of PSA screening and improvements in ultrasonography, ultrasound&#xD;
      guided prostate biopsy has become the standard of care to screen and diagnose men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer. A standard 12-14 core prostate biopsy is now common practice, detecting&#xD;
      cancer in 27% to 44% of patients in patients with an elevated serum PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, prostate MR imaging was not considered for routine clinical practice. However, the&#xD;
      addition of an endorectal-coil probe and a 3 Tesla magnet has improved its diagnostic&#xD;
      utility. Currently, most mpMRI are done without the use of an endo-rectal coil at 3Tesla. The&#xD;
      MRI is able to evaluate the entire prostate (transrectal ultrasound images are overlaid on a&#xD;
      previously obtained prostate MRI, combined with an electromagnetic tracking system) prior to&#xD;
      biopsy and allows the physician to target specific areas of the prostate that are suspicious&#xD;
      for cancer. This contrasts with the typical US guided approach which samples regions of the&#xD;
      prostate in a standard fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of comparison of the standard of care prostate biopsy with the&#xD;
      protocol biopsy which consists of a US guided prostate biopsy and a MR/US fusion tracked&#xD;
      prostate biopsy in patients undergoing the transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) biopsy&#xD;
      approaches. The researchers are interested in learning which procedure is more useful in&#xD;
      obtaining a clearer picture of the prostate which will in turn provide a better way of&#xD;
      finding abnormalities. Each patient will act as their own control.&#xD;

    <description>The Gleason Score ranges from 1-5 and describes how much the cancer from a biopsy looks like healthy tissue (lower score) or abnormal tissue (higher score). Sum of the gleason grade of the most predominant tumor pattern and a second gleason grade of the second most predominant pattern. Full score from 2 to 10, with higher score indicating more clinically significance.</description>
