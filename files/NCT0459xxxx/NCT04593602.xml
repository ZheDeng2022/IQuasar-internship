  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EM-HEART study is a prospective, multi-centre stepped wedge cluster randomized trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic early mobilization (EM) program to improve&#xD;
      patient-centred and clinical outcomes in older adults with acute CV disease. There will be&#xD;
      256 participants ≥60 years old with acute CV disease enrolled at 6 participating Canadian&#xD;
      hospitals. The study will investigate whether EM improves functional status during admission,&#xD;
      as compared to usual care, and whether this leads to improved health-related quality of life&#xD;
      post-hospitalization. Functional status will be measured with the validated Level of Function&#xD;
      Mobility Scale. The primary outcome will be the Short-Form SF-36 physical component scale&#xD;
      score at 1-month post-hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include functional status and&#xD;
      hospital readmission at 1-month post-hospitalization.&#xD;

      muscle mass loss and inflammation in older adults with acute CV disease.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the stepped-wedge cluster design, there is random and sequential crossover of clusters from control (phase 1) to intervention (phase 2) until all clusters are exposed. The nature of the intervention requires randomization of entire units to the intervention with associated mobility culture change and this precludes a standard randomized controlled trial design (i.e., randomization of some patients to the intervention but not others). The stepped-wedge design allows each site to function as its own control.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The bedside nurse determines the prehospital Level of Function based on patient and family report and current Level of Function based on nursing mobility assessment. Each Level of Function has 3 primary activities designed to promote the patient to the next level. The nurse leads mobility activities based on the patient's current Level of Function once per shift, twice daily (AM+PM). If a patient is able to complete each of the 3 activities, the nurse on the subsequent shift will assess whether the Level of Function can be advanced. Physiotherapy consultation is available if required, although not obligatory. Patients are encouraged to spend as much time in the chair and ambulatory as possible.</description>
