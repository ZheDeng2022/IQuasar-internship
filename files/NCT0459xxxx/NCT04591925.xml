      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of how well blood glucose is managed&#xD;
      when a participate wears the investigational SteadiSet™ Infusion Set (SteadiSet device) for&#xD;
      up to 14 days post-insertion when compared to a Teflon Control infusion set.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 48 adult participants, ages 18-70, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) may&#xD;
      be enrolled, aiming for approximately 40 completers. Participants must have ≥6 months&#xD;
      experience using a rapid-acting insulin analog delivered via tubing-based insulin pumps and&#xD;
      infusion sets and must demonstrate willingness and ability to use a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitor (CGM). Study participants will be drawn from existing T1DM patient populations&#xD;
      meeting the study eligibility at the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing patient populations at the study center will be screened for study eligibility&#xD;
      within 21 days of planned study randomization. Eligible participants will complete written&#xD;
      informed consent and will be assigned a unique study ID. Enrolled participants will complete&#xD;
      a one-week run-in period to assess participant compliance to collect adequate CGM data (&gt;80%&#xD;
      of possible readings) with the study CGM. Participants who do not achieve this goal will be&#xD;
      given a second week of CGM data collection; failing the second week of adequate data&#xD;
      collection they will be discontinued from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Day of Insertion (Day 0) clinic visit, study participants will be randomized to insert&#xD;
      (under supervision) either an investigational SteadiSet or a commercially-available Teflon&#xD;
      infusion set (different to their routine set); an automatic insertion device will be used for&#xD;
      all infusion set insertion procedures during study. Participants will undergo training and be&#xD;
      provided written instructions if infusion set failure occurs and set change is required&#xD;
      during the up to 14-day wear period. Visual inspection and photographic documentation of the&#xD;
      infusion set insertion site will be recorded at Day 0. Participants will be asked to conduct&#xD;
      daily insertion site visual inspection and report/record site reactions, unexplained hypo-&#xD;
      and hyperglycemic events and symptoms and/or the need for infusion set change (Days +1 to&#xD;
      +14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of a wear period (after 14 days or sooner, in the event that infusion set&#xD;
      change out has occurred), participants will be asked to insert a new set at home and thus&#xD;
      start the next 14-day wear period. After two periods participants will return to the study&#xD;
      site to cross over into the last two periods with the respective other infusion set&#xD;
      (SteadiSet or Control device, self-insertion under supervision). A total of four infusion&#xD;
      sets will be studied in each participant, two SteadiSet and two commercially available Teflon&#xD;
      infusion sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin therapy will be performed by the participants using their own insulin pump as under&#xD;
      routine conditions. Participants will continue to use the rapid acting insulin analog they&#xD;
      also use under routine conditions (insulins aspart or lispro). Insulin reservoir and tubing&#xD;
      change will be performed as under routine conditions every 6 (insulin aspart) or 7 (insulin&#xD;
      lispro) days (or sooner for participants who use more than 300 units every 6-7 days). The&#xD;
      infusion set will NOT be changed at the time of reservoir change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring will be performed throughout the study. At least four-point&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose measurements will be performed each day (pre-meal, bed-time).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to perform capillary ketone measurements in case of unexplained&#xD;
      hyperglycemia (glucose &gt;250 mg/dL or 14 mmol/L). Unexplained hypo- or hyperglycemia measured&#xD;
      by CGM needs to be verified by capillary glucose measurements. Data from the participant's&#xD;
      blood glucose and ketone monitor will be downloaded upon completion of each infusion set wear&#xD;
      period. The diary will be collected at each study center visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-study will occur at the clinic visit following the fourth study period or upon 30-day&#xD;
      follow-up of ongoing adverse events.&#xD;

    <description>Successful insulin delivery period is defined as the days from infusion set insertion to either a removal of the infusion set due to normal use or removal of the infusion set due to set failure. a removal due to normal use or an infusion set failure, defined as:&#xD;
The occurrence of hyperglycemia (glucose &gt;250 mg/dL or 14 mmol/L), not responsive to a pump bolus dose where response to the bolus is defined as a fall of at least 50 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L in blood glucose within one hour&#xD;
The occurrence of any hyperglycemic episode (glucose &gt; 250 mg/dL or 14 mmol/L) not associated with acute intercurrent illness, but with a concurrent ketone level ≥0.6 mmol/L, or&#xD;
Signs of infection at the infusion site (e.g. erythema or induration &gt;1 cm in diameter) at the investigator's discretion, or&#xD;
