    <description>Changes of the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) from preoperative (baseline) to 1 year after the implant of the Physica KR compared to Physica CR designs.&#xD;
Specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain after TKR surgery. Responses to each question ranges from 0-4 with a range of a possible overall score from 0-48. A score of 0 is the worst possible outcome while a score of 48 is the best possible outcome.</description>

    <measure>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 year FU</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) from pre-operative (baseline) to 1 year after the implant of the Physica KR compared to Physica CR designs.&#xD;
KOOS is a 42-item self-administered self-explanatory questionnaire that covers five patient-relevant dimensions: Pain, Other Disease-Specific Symptoms, Active Daily Living Function, Sport and Recreation Function, and knee-related Quality of Life. A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 year FU</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) outcome from pre-operative (baseline) to 1 year after the implant.&#xD;
This questionnaire includes 8 scales of differing domains of health: physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, general health, vitality, role emotional, social functioning, and mental health. Each scale is scored on a 0 to 100 scale with a 100 representing the best score possible.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 year FU</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) from pre-operative (baseline) to 1 year after the implant of the Physica KR compared to Physica CR designs.&#xD;
It comprises measures for the assessment of joint-specific patient-reported outcome and focus on patients' awareness of a specific joint in everyday life. It consists of 12 questions and is scored using a 5-point Likert response format (never-almost never-seldom- sometimes-mostly) with the raw scores transformed onto a 0-100 point scale. High scores indicate good outcome.</description>

    <description>Changes in the Knee Society Score (KSS) from pre-operative (baseline) to 1 year after the implant of the Physica KR compared to Physica CR designs.&#xD;
KSS is divided into two components to assess the knee clinically through the physical examination, and to assess the individual's functionality . The maximum score of 100 points that is the best outcome.</description>
