  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults aged over 18 years, with the diagnosis of Prader-willi syndrome will be recruited&#xD;
      through the hospital's outpatient clinic for either as intervention group receiving&#xD;
      therapeutic elastic band training, or as control group receiving usual care for a total of 16&#xD;
      weeks. Body composition, physical capacity, and serum changes will be assessed before and&#xD;
      after the intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants that fulfill the inclusion criteria will be assigned into one of the two arms:&#xD;
      elastic band intervention group (EB) or control group (CG). Both groups will received a&#xD;
      baseline: dual X-ray absorptiometry body composition, physical capacity, and serum markers&#xD;
      examinations. EB will then receive a 16-week progressive elastic band resistance exercise&#xD;
      training, while the CG will receive usual care. After the 16 weeks from the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, a followed-up: dual X-ray absorptiometry body composition, physical capacity, and&#xD;
      serum examinations will be assessed.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Berg balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Berg balance scale assesses simple mobility function tasks (sit unsupported, sit-to-stand, stand to sit, stand unsupported, transfer, stand with eyes closed and feet together) and more difficult balance tasks (turn to look behind, retrieve object from floor, turn 360 degrees, reach forward with an outstretched arm, tandem stand, place alternate foot on stool, and single leg stand). It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4. A maximum scoring of 56 indicates functional balanced, while scoring&lt; 45 indicates higher risk of falling.</description>

    <description>The appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) will be obtained from the dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Densitometer Discovery A, USA) measurement, excluding the bone mass from the mass of the extremities, from which fat mass is already excluded. ASM (kg)=lean body mass of extremity - bone mass of extremity.&#xD;
The lower extremity skeletal muscle mass (LESM) will be obtained from the dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Densitometer Discovery A, USA) measurement, by excluding the bone mass of the lower extremity, from which fat mass is already excluded. LESM (kg)=lean body mass of lower extremity - bone mass of lower extremity.</description>

    <description>A16-week therapeutic program using Elastic Thera Band will be taught. The exercises are designed to train specific major muscle groups, strengthen the motivation of participants, and facilitate home-based compliance. The program will be performed two times per week (once supervised and guided by a trained physical therapist and the other supervised by educational trainers) over 16 weeks for a total of 32 sessions. Each session supervised by a physical therapist last for 60 minutes, including a 5-minute warm-up consisting of light-intensity aerobic and dynamic stretching exercises, followed by 50 minutes of EB exercise and a 5-minute period of cool-down and static stretching exercises.</description>
