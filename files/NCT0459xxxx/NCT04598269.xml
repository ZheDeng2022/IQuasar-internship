      This is a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of ATI-1777 solution following&#xD;
      twice-daily applications to target areas of patients with moderate or severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility up to 30 days prior to&#xD;
      randomization. Patients who meet all the entry criteria will be randomized on Day 1 to active&#xD;
      or vehicle treatment. Patients will apply study drug (ATI-1777 topical solution 2.0% w/w or&#xD;
      vehicle) twice daily for 4 weeks with weekly study visits and will return 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      last dose of study medication for a Post treatment Follow-up (PTFU) Visit. Adverse event (AE)&#xD;
      collection, physical examinations, clinical disease assessments (Eczema Area and Severity&#xD;
      Index [EASI], Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA], AD body surface area [BSA], Peak&#xD;
      Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [PP-NRS]), vital sign assessments, PK evaluations, and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed as detailed in the Schedule of Events.&#xD;

             investigator, could affect the safety of the patient's participation in the study or&#xD;
             would preclude participation in and completion of study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of, current, or suspected systemic or cutaneous malignancy and/or&#xD;

             latent tuberculosis infection (positive QuantiFERON® Tuberculosis Gold Test) will only&#xD;
             be allowed to participate in the study if there is documented evidence of a completed&#xD;
             adequate treatment course for latent tuberculosis and if active tuberculosis is&#xD;

             baseline mean QTcF &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females (use of the ECG&#xD;
             algorithm is acceptable for this purpose).&#xD;
&#xD;
