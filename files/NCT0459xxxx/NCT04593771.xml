    <textblock>
      A total of 80 healthy people aged 65 years and below who are randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      experimental group and the control group. The experimental group is injected with BCG-PPD&#xD;
      test drug once, and the control group is injected with BCG-PPD control drug once.Subjects&#xD;
      will undergo physical examination, vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, blood&#xD;
      biochemistry, electrocardiogram, HIV antibody test and blood pregnancy test for women of&#xD;
      childbearing age during the screening period.Vital signs were checked before skin test, the&#xD;
      injection site was photographed at 0min after skin test, and vital signs were checked at&#xD;
      30min after skin test.Vital signs examination, injection site photography and injection site&#xD;
      reaction measurement were performed 48h and 72h after skin test.Physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs, routine blood test, routine urine test, biochemical test, electrocardiogram and blood&#xD;
      pregnancy test of women of childbearing age were performed again 7 days after skin test to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of BCG-PPD.&#xD;

      Prior to the commencement of the study, the Investigator/his authorized officer will contact&#xD;
      the subject and/or guardian to enroll the candidate subjects and invite them to participate&#xD;
      in the study.Subjects who are eligible for screening receive the drug number in the order&#xD;
      they arrive at the random number allocation room.During the screening period, physical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, blood biochemistry,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, HIV antibody test and blood pregnancy test (only women of childbearing&#xD;
      age).Inverstigator absorb and inject 0.1ml drug into the upper and middle 1/3 of the left&#xD;
      forearm by Mondo's method. The reaction of the injection site was checked and photographed at&#xD;
      0min, 48h and 72h after the skin test. Meanwhile, the transverse and longitudinal diameers of&#xD;
      skin induration and redness were measured at 48h and 72h after the skin test.Vital signs are&#xD;
      checked at 30min after skin test.Vital signs examination, injection site photography and&#xD;
      reaction measurement are performed 48h and 72h after skin test.Physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs, routine blood test, routine urine test, biochemical test, electrocardiogram and blood&#xD;
      pregnancy test are performed again 7 days after skin test.All AE occurred within 7 days after&#xD;
      skin test were recorded by a diary card. AE related to the test drug should be followed up to&#xD;
      the end of the event.Skin test of subjects aged 18-45 years shall be conducted first. After&#xD;
      safety assessment, skin test of subjects aged 46-65 years old, 6-17 years old and under 6&#xD;
      years old shall be conducted successively.&#xD;
