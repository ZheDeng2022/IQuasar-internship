      This study will compare the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments, alone&#xD;
      and in combination, for the treatment of loss-of-control eating and weight following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. This is an acute treatment comparing behavioral weight loss alone or in&#xD;
      combination with combination naltrexone/bupropion medication.&#xD;

      Participants who provide informed consent and are determined to be eligible will then&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 160 patients with obesity and regular LOC-eating following MBS will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (double-blind) in a balanced factorial (2 X 2) design, to one of four 16-week&#xD;
      interventions: BWL+NB, BWL+Placebo, NB, or Placebo. The randomization will be in equal&#xD;
      proportions but stratified by surgery type.&#xD;
