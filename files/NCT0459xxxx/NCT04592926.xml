  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of lumbar ultrasound anatomic mapping&#xD;
      using the Accuro device on the number of needle redirections, when performing spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia in the lateral decubitus position on patients undergoing elective cesarean&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Training in neuraxial placement most commonly occurs with patients in the sitting position,&#xD;
      since it is easy to master. However lateral placement may be preferred in emergent situations&#xD;
      and for patient comfort. In order to provide safe and effective anesthesia to parturients,&#xD;
      providers must be competent with the technique in both sitting and lateral positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination prior to spinal placement is a safe, non-invasive method of&#xD;
      determining depth, midline, and interspinous location. Its use may decrease the number of&#xD;
      needle insertions and needle passes in parturients in the sitting position, however little is&#xD;
      known about the benefit of ultrasound use in the placement of lateral spinals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of lumbar ultrasound with Accuro may improve success rates, safety, and the education&#xD;
      of residents as they learn neuraxial placement in the lateral position. This will be the&#xD;
      first study to examine the use of Accuro for lateral neuraxial placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize that lumbar ultrasound with the handheld Accuro device by&#xD;
      an experienced provider prior to spinal insertion will result in fewer needle redirections&#xD;
      compared to palpation of landmarks when performed by anesthesia residents or fellows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two arms of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Control Group: sham pre-puncture ultrasound procedure with the handheld Accuro&#xD;
      device turned off, followed by a sham marking on the participant's back using the Accuro&#xD;
      locator marker attached to the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Ultrasound Group: pre-puncture ultrasound with Accuro followed by marking placed at&#xD;
      the L3-4 interspace in the midline using the attached Accuro locator marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasound exams will be performed by an unblinded physician study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will have a spinal anesthetic in lateral position performed by one of&#xD;
      the residents or fellows participating in the study.&#xD;
