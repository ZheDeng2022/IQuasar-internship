    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine Oncostatin M (OSM), Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and&#xD;
      Interleukin-11 (IL-11) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, and serum in&#xD;
      periodontally healthy individuals and those with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis before&#xD;
      and after periodontal treatment and to evaluate the relationship between these cytokine&#xD;
      levels and clinical periodontal parameters.&#xD;

    <description>As described by Silness&amp;Löe 1964; The measurement of the state of oral hygiene by Silness-Löe plaque index is based on recording both soft debris and mineralized deposits on the following teeth. Each of the four surfaces of the teeth (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) is given a score from 0-3. Scores 0: No plaque. scores 1: A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque may be seen in situ only after application of disclosing solution or by using the probe on the tooth surface.&#xD;
Scores 2: Moderate accumulation of soft deposit s within the gingival pocket, or the tooth and gingival margin which can be seen with the naked eye.&#xD;
Scores 3: Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival margin.&#xD;
Score 0 considered good oral hygiene, score 3 bad oral hygiene habits. plaque index for a tooth=scores from 4 areas/4 plaque index individual= scores from 28 tooth/28</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (before treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>As described by Löe&amp;Silness 1963; The bleeding is assessed by probing gently along the wall of soft tissue of the gingival sulcus. Each of the four surfaces of the teeth (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) is given a score from 0-3.&#xD;
Score 0 - Normal, healthy gingival with sharp, non-inflamed margins. score 1 - Marginal gingivitis with minimal inflammation and edema at the free gingival. No bleeding on probing.&#xD;
Score 2 - Moderate gingivitis with a wider band of inflammation and bleeding upon probing.&#xD;
Score 3 - Advanced gingivitis with inflammation clinically reaching the mucogingival junction usually with ulceration.&#xD;
Score 0 considered healthy gingiva, score 3 assessed advanced gingival disease. gingival index for a tooth=scores from 4 areas/4 gingival index individual= scores from 28 tooth/28</description>

    <description>Oral hygiene education, including the use of toothbrushes and dental floss and/or interproximal brushes, was given to them. After one week Chronic Periodontitis group received nonsurgical periodontal therapy consisting of scaling and root planing (quadrant by quadrant) using manual scalers and curettes under local anesthesia. No antibiotics or any medications were prescribed during the treatment. Periodontal treatment was performed by the same investigator</description>
