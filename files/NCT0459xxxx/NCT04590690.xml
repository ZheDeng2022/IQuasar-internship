    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study that aims to better understand how diet and sex affect the risk&#xD;
      of kidney stones in people who have had gastric bypass surgery. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      follow a special (clinic-provided) diet for six days and come to a research clinic for 3&#xD;
      study visits.&#xD;

      Experimental Design: We will determine sex differences in 24-hour urine supersaturation (SS)&#xD;
      with respect to calcium oxalate (CaOx) in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy patients and the correlation of microbial species and their metabolic pathways&#xD;
      with urine oxalate. This will be determined under the conditions of an isocaloric,&#xD;
      standardized sodium (200 mmol/day), calcium, potassium, macronutrient distribution. We will&#xD;
      recruit subjects from the Bariatric Surgery Clinic at The University of Chicago Medical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: The study will take place at participants' homes (Periods 1, 4) and in the&#xD;
      University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) Clinical Research Center. (Periods 2, 3, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 5 separate periods. Periods 1 and 2 will be before surgery and&#xD;
      periods 3-5 will occur after surgery. Periods 1 and 4 will last three days and periods 2, 3,&#xD;
      and 5 will last four days, three of which are at home and a fourth (half-day) in the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center (CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period 1 will occur prior to RYGB or specific gravity (SG) in the participant's home.&#xD;
      Each participant will provide a three-day diet record and complete a 1.5-hour phone call with&#xD;
      the CRC dietician and one 24-hour urine collection (on day three). Urine collection kits will&#xD;
      be couriered directly to home and couriered back to the Kidney Stone Lab after completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period 2 will be completed in the CRC and will occur prior to RYGB or SG. The fixed&#xD;
      study diet will be shipped by courier along with a stool collection kit. Each participant&#xD;
      will eat the study diet on days one, two, and three of this study period. On the morning of&#xD;
      day four, subjects present to the CRC in a fasting state and bring stool collections to the&#xD;
      CRC. Each participant will collect three 45-minute urines with a blood sample at the midpoint&#xD;
      of each collection. Study participants then consume a fixed breakfast and collect six&#xD;
      45-minute urines with blood samples in the post-prandial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period 3 will be completed in the CRC and will occur between 2 and 4 weeks post-RYGB or&#xD;
      SG. The 2 to 4 week timing of this period was selected because the biological changes in&#xD;
      anatomy and neuroendocrine signaling would have occurred by 2 weeks post-surgery and patients&#xD;
      are typically advanced from a diet of soft foods to regular foods by 2 weeks. Subjects will&#xD;
      not participate in period 3 until after clinical clearance by the surgeon for diet&#xD;
      advancement. It is also expected that by this time any effect of anesthesia or peri-operative&#xD;
      antibiotics and medications is minimal. The protocol of study period 3 is identical to that&#xD;
      of period 2 with three days of study diet and CRC on day four with fasting and fed blood and&#xD;
      urine collections (see period 2 for specifics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period 4 will occur at home between 9 and 12 months post-RYGB or SG in the&#xD;
      participant's home. The timing of this period is selected because patients have typically&#xD;
      undergone the majority of weight loss and had time to adopt new self-chosen home diets. Urine&#xD;
      changes expected to occur in kidney stone formers are also expected to be detectable at this&#xD;
      time. Participants will provide a three-day diet record and complete a 1.5-hour phone call&#xD;
      with the CRC dietician and one 24-hour urine collection (on day three). Urine collection kits&#xD;
      will be couriered directly to home and couriered back to the Kidney Stone Lab after&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period 5 will occur in the CRC at 12 months (+/- 1 month) post-RYGB or SG. The timing&#xD;
      of this period is selected because patients have typically undergone the majority of their&#xD;
      weight loss and most have had resolution of metabolic syndrome. The protocol of study period&#xD;
      3 is identical to that of periods 2 and 3 (see period 2 for specifics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Diet: Subjects will eat a diet containing 65 mmol sodium, 1740-2940mg potassium,&#xD;
      800-1200 mg calcium, and meals will be isocaloric with controlled macronutrient distribution.&#xD;
      Food will be prepared in the CRC kitchen and shipped to patients. Intake of water is ad lib,&#xD;
      other fluids only as prescribed. The diet will be prepared in consultation with dieticians,&#xD;
      including dieticians with expertise in bariatric surgery. Food will be shipped to&#xD;
      participants on day 1. Participants will continue to take prescribed medications and vitamin&#xD;
      supplements per the bariatric surgery clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home diet record and nutritional data collection (study period 1, 4): Each participant will&#xD;
      be provided a food log and a handout on portion estimates prior to home diet record. A&#xD;
      three-day diet record will be recorded by the participant. Within one to three days of&#xD;
      completing the diet record each participant will have a 1.5-hour phone call with the CRC&#xD;
      dietician. The dietician will review the record for completeness and clarification, and then&#xD;
      enter the data into the Nutritional Data System for Research (NDSR). The NDSR is a&#xD;
      well-established, computer based, dietary analysis software program that was developed at the&#xD;
      University of Minnesota and provides quantitative data on both micro- and macronutrients from&#xD;
      the dietary recall. The food database in the NDSR includes over 18,000 foods and uses the&#xD;
      United States Department of Agriculture laboratory as their primary source for nutrient&#xD;
      values and composition. The UCM CRC has an existing contract with NDSR to support use of this&#xD;
      software for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and Serum Measurements: Two 24-hour urine collections will be performed at home (with&#xD;
      instructions provided). 24-hour urine volume, Ca, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, Na, K, Cl, Mg,&#xD;
      sulfate, ammonium, and creatinine will be measured. Urine measurements will be performed at&#xD;
      the University of Chicago Kidney Stone Research Group laboratory. Serum 25-vitamin D and&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone levels will be measured through the CRC in the University of Chicago&#xD;
      laboratory. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,&#xD;
      creatinine, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) will be done at the University of Chicago&#xD;
      Kidney Stone laboratory. Serum peptide YY and insulin will be assayed at the University of&#xD;
      Chicago Diabetes Research and Training Center laboratory. Serum glucagon will be assayed at&#xD;
      LabCorp. Glucose will be measured using the gold standard YSI methodology at the CRC. Serum&#xD;
      and urine will be frozen at -80 degrees C and stored at the Kidney Stone laboratory for&#xD;
      potential later assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1, Urine Statistical Analysis: Urine CaOx SS will be calculated using EQUIL2 (a computer&#xD;
      program used for the calculation of urinary saturation). We will compare the CaOx SS of men&#xD;
      vs. women using a t-test that accounts for any differences in variances between the two&#xD;
      groups. We will perform linear regression models by sex to determine predictors of CaOx SS.&#xD;
      We will use Spearman's correlation tests to find independent correlations between microbial&#xD;
      species and/or metabolic pathways with CaOx SS. Generalized linear models will be generated&#xD;
      for any modules that are associated with high CaOx SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2, Stool Microbial Species and Statistical Analysis: Shotgun sequencing will be performed&#xD;
      for all stool samples. Shotgun sequencing will be performed for all stool samples. TruSeq DNA&#xD;
      Sample prep kit (Illumina) and reagents from KAPA Library Preparation kit (Kapa biosystems)&#xD;
      will be used to generate libraries. Libraries will be sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform&#xD;
      using 2x250 nucleotide paired-end sequencing. Sequencing reads will be converted into&#xD;
      relative abundances of microbial metabolic modules using HUMAnN and mapped to KEGG Relative&#xD;
      abundances will be calculated using the Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis (MetaPhlAn)&#xD;
      pipeline.&#xD;

    <description>The research clinic will provide subjects with a special diet for six days. After six days of isocaloric sodium, calcium and fluid intake, the study team will analyze three sequential 24-hour urine compositions including supersaturation of calcium oxalate, calcium, and urine volume, as well as stool collections. We will also evaluate components of 24-hour urine composition, specifically supersaturation, and the microbial contributions to urinary composition in 72-hour stool samples simultaneously collected using shot-gun metagenomic sequencing in men and women 1 year after surgery.</description>
