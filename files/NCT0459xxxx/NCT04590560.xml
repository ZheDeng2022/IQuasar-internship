    <textblock>
      Italian, multicenter, study aimed at defining the best interval for screening women 45-49 and&#xD;
      70-74 years for Breast Cancer (BC). This research project includes (1) a controlled,&#xD;
      prospective randomized non-inferiority trial to determine the optimal screening interval for&#xD;
      women aged 45-49, with and without high mammographic density, (2) a retrospective data&#xD;
      collection, with the same purpose, on screening performed by women aged 70-74, and (3) a&#xD;
      qualitative research to define the best communication strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2006 European guidelines, the target age for mammography screening is 50-69&#xD;
      years. For women aged 40-49, effectiveness is less and less certain. For those over 70, the&#xD;
      most important concern is overdiagnosis. In Europe, so far, both age groups have been invited&#xD;
      to screen only in a few countries and regional areas, including some Italian regions.&#xD;
      Recently, new European guidelines have been published, developed in the framework of the&#xD;
      European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer. Although with caution, they recommend&#xD;
      screening for both women aged 45-49 and those aged 70-74. The recommended interval is 2 or 3&#xD;
      years in the first case and 3 years in the second. The quality of the evidence on which these&#xD;
      recommendations are based is defined as very low. Particularly for women aged 45-49, the new&#xD;
      European guidelines indicate the need for a research effort, based on comparative studies, on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of different screening intervals. This responsibility also falls on Italy,&#xD;
      which is the only European country where women aged 45-49 are invited on an annual basis.&#xD;
      Therefore, a research project is proposed which includes (1) a controlled, prospective&#xD;
      randomized non-inferiority trial to determine the optimal screening interval for women aged&#xD;
      45-49, with and without high mammographic density, (2) a retrospective data collection, with&#xD;
      the same purpose, on screening performed by women aged 70-74, and (3) a qualitative research&#xD;
      to define the best communication strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the best interval for screening women 45-49 years old a three-arm multicenter&#xD;
      randomized non-inferiority trial will be conducted. Women signing the written informed&#xD;
      consent will be randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: 1-year screening interval; Arm 2: 2-year screening interval; Arm 3: tailored screening&#xD;
      interval on the basis of breast density. Women with very dense breast (Breast&#xD;
      Imaging-Reporting and Data System -BI-RADS- category D) will be referred to 1-year interval&#xD;
      whereas women with less dense breast to 2-year interval (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data&#xD;
      System -BI-RADS- category A, B, C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will last 2.5 years and all women will be followed for 6 years. 60,000 women will&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the cumulative incidence of stage 2 or higher breast&#xD;
      cancer between different screening intervals and this will be evaluated at the end of the&#xD;
      6-year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, data from all women registered in screening archives who have had a&#xD;
      negative mammogram at the age of 69-71 years will be collected and analyzed. The data will be&#xD;
      retrieved up to the age of 78 and will concern screening mammograms as well as other&#xD;
      screening procedures (e.g. biopsies) and also mammograms performed outside the program. Data&#xD;
      from screening and outpatient information systems as well as from cancer registries will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the best strategy to communicate changes in screening protocols, especially when&#xD;
      the new protocol would be less intensive than the actual one, a qualitative research will be&#xD;
      conducted. In particular the following steps will be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focus groups for discussing, with women from target population and health care&#xD;
           professionals, key arguments identified in a preliminary research (i.e. scientific&#xD;
           literature and case-studies research), with particular focus on how they should be&#xD;
           translated into communication strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-test of the study's communication material through web-based semi-structured&#xD;
           interviews to eligible women and key-informants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the effectiveness of the communication material through web-based&#xD;
           semi-structured interviews to participants, that may bring insights on how planning&#xD;
           communication strategies for the implementation of new screening protocols.&#xD;
