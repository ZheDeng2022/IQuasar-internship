  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to describe Crohn's disease (CD) participants' as well as&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) participants' preferences towards the attributes of treatment with&#xD;
      advanced therapies for IBD, including safety and efficacy profiles, frequency and route of&#xD;
      administration (RoA) in a real-world setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional survey of participants with IBD. The&#xD;
      survey will look into the preferences of participants towards the attributes of treatment&#xD;
      with advanced therapies for IBD based on DCE (experimentally designed survey), including&#xD;
      safety and efficacy profiles, frequency and RoA in a real-world setting, in European&#xD;
      participants living with CD or UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will involve data collection in a real-world setting via an online self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaire hosted on the Carenity platform, an international participant community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will enroll approximately 600 participants. Participants will be enrolled in two&#xD;
      observational cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UC Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain,&#xD;
      Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands.&#xD;

    <measure>Partworth Utilities for Participants With CD and UC</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes after one time-survey start</time_frame>
    <description>Partworth utilities (attribute importance scores and level values) will be evaluated separately for UC and CD in discrete choice experiment's (DCE) conditional logit (CL) models.DCEs:an attribute-based measure of benefit. CL model analyses DCEs.All DCE attributes will be included in CL models.For CD:remission after one year,occurrence of serious adverse effects or events,mild adverse effects or events, long-term remission on maintenance treatment and administration of medication.For UC: corticosteroid-free remission,healing of intestinal mucosa of bowel after one year,long-term remission on continuous treatment and administration of medication.All attributes will be coded as categorical variables;attribute levels will be dummy-coded,whereby omitted categories will be coded:0,omitted category for each attribute will be reference level of partworth utility.Negative partworth utility indicates less desired levels and positive partworth utility indicates more desired levels of attributes.</description>

    <measure>Partworth Utilities for Subgroup Participants With CD and UC</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes after one time-survey start</time_frame>
    <description>Partworth utilities for each pathology, by computing CL models on subgroup of participants based on demographic and medical profiles as well as quality of life criteria. Those subgroups will be created by using the clustering method available within the CL model, which will be conducted for each separated group and then compared using their estimated coefficients.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Latent Classes and Respective Partworth Utilities</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes after one time-survey start</time_frame>
    <description>Latent classes and respective partworth utilities will be assessed by latent-class multinomial logit (LC-MNL) models. LC-MNL models will identify groups with similar preferences (latent classes), and estimate the probability that each respondent belongs to each class. Logistic regression models will then be applied to determine the association between latent class membership and participant characteristics.</description>
