  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial seeks to determine the role of nodal radiation therapy after sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with high risk sentinel lymph node positive melanoma&#xD;
      who are planned for immunotherapy without completion lymph node dissection. Prior studies of&#xD;
      patients with more advanced melanoma have shown nodal radiation therapy can decrease the risk&#xD;
      of nodal recurrence but it is not known if this same benefit will be seen in patients with&#xD;
      high risk sentinel lymph node positive disease who are planned for immunotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if regional nodal radiation therapy prolongs the time to regional recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive adjuvant immunotherapy and nodal radiation therapy (30 Gy in 5&#xD;
      treatments over 2-2.5 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive adjuvant immunotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

             lymphovascular invasion of the primary tumor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has provided written informed consent for participation in this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
