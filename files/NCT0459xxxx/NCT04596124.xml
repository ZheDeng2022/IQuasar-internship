  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy and clinical tolerability of two medical devices in&#xD;
      gauze and cream containing the aqueous extract of triticum vulgare and polyhexanide in&#xD;
      comparison with two medical devices containing hyaluronic acid and silver sulfadiazine in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute skin lesions . The reason why the two types of devices are compared is&#xD;
      because hyaluronic acid and silver sulfadiazine represent the gold standard for the treatment&#xD;
      of acute skin lesions. Therefore, making a comparison between the activity of the aqueous&#xD;
      extract of triticum vulgare and polyhexanide and this gold standard of control in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute skin lesions, is useful to better define the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      both medical devices in order to eventually expand the therapeutic armamentarium available&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute skin lesions&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin lesions, more or less deep, are areas of rupture and tissue loss with exposure of the&#xD;
      underlying tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term &quot;external lesion&quot; or &quot;wound&quot; indicates the morphological and functional destruction&#xD;
      of the continuity of the superficial skin layers and, in the most serious cases, of the deep&#xD;
      subcutaneous layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lesions are evaluated and cataloged on the basis of their width, depth and&#xD;
      characteristics. Furthermore, the development, the causes (etiopathogenesis) and the&#xD;
      pathophysiological context of the wound are considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superficial, slight lesions affect only the epidermis, the dermis and at most part of the&#xD;
      hypodermis; the deeper ones involve all the subcutaneous tissue (fat) up to the muscles, the&#xD;
      periosteum, reaching the exposure of the bone or supporting structures (tendons and&#xD;
      cartilages); the most severe (chronic) are characterized by loss of substance in the skin and&#xD;
      a poor tendency to healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the timing of healing, the lesions are divided into acute and chronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute injuries heal through 3 different phases and reach tissue repair within 8/10 weeks.&#xD;
      Beyond this time the lesion becomes chronic and, if not acted correctly, the wound becomes&#xD;
      more complicated and degrades in increasingly serious stages / degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute wounds that the healthcare professional must treat most frequently are surgical&#xD;
      wounds. Depending on their extent, acute wounds can be distinguished into stab wounds,&#xD;
      puncture wounds, lacerated wounds and lacerated-contused wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of acute wounds can generally heal in a physiological way or be induced to healing&#xD;
      through the use of dressings, which reduce healing times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main dressings used to treat these lesions are hyaluronic acid-based dressings containing&#xD;
      antiseptics, such as silver sulphadiazine to prevent the risk of contamination and&#xD;
      colonization by microorganisms. In these dressings, hyaluronic acid promotes the acceleration&#xD;
      of the tissue repair process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, among the main products used by hospital and non-hospital surgeries there are also&#xD;
      dressings based on Rigenase® (aqueous extract of triticum vulgare) and polyhexanide.&#xD;
      Rigenase®, containing the aqueous extract of triticum vulgare, has pro-proliferative,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. These activities are attested by recent&#xD;
      literature which indicates that the aqueous extract of triticum vulgare has pro-proliferative&#xD;
      activity on fibroblasts and keratinocytes, the main cells involved in proliferation during&#xD;
      the lesion repair process; in addition, the aqueous extract of triticum vulgare also has a&#xD;
      documented anti-inflammatory activity, mediated by the reduction of the main cytokines&#xD;
      responsible for skin inflammation, and an anti-metalloprotease9 activity, the main actor of&#xD;
      inflammation in skin lesions. The antioxidant activity of Rigenase®, verified on the&#xD;
      hemolysis of erythrocytes, is comparable to that of ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity of polyhexanide is also fundamental for the prevention of the risk of&#xD;
      colonization and contamination by microorganisms in acute skin lesions. In fact, this latest&#xD;
      generation antiseptic has a consolidated antiseptic activity on gram positive and gram&#xD;
      negative bacteria, on fungi and on some viruses, without the development of resistance both&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the foregoing, this study aims to compare the efficacy and clinical tolerability of&#xD;
      two medical devices in gauze and cream containing the aqueous extract of triticum vulgare and&#xD;
      polyhexanide in comparison with two medical devices containing hyaluronic acid and silver&#xD;
      sulfadiazine. in the treatment of acute skin lesions. The reason why the two types of devices&#xD;
      are compared is because hyaluronic acid and silver sulfadiazine represent the gold standard&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute skin lesions. Therefore, making a comparison between the activity&#xD;
      of the aqueous extract of triticum vulgare and polyhexanide and this gold standard of control&#xD;
      in the treatment of acute skin lesions, is useful to better define the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of both medical devices in order to to possibly expand the therapeutic&#xD;
      armamentarium available for the treatment of acute skin lesions&#xD;
