      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the BTL-899 device for changes&#xD;
      in subcutaneous fat tissue and muscle tissue of inner thighs. The study is a prospective&#xD;
      multi-center open-label single-arm study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a&#xD;
      single study group. Subjects will be required to complete four (4) treatment visits and two&#xD;
      follow-up visits. All of the study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject&#xD;
      device&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the BTL-899 device for changes&#xD;
      in subcutaneous fat tissue and muscle tissue of inner thighs. The study is a prospective&#xD;
      multi-center open-label single-arm study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a&#xD;
      single study group. Subjects will be required to complete four (4) treatment visits and two&#xD;
      follow-up visits. All of the study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, MRI imaging will be performed; the subject's weight and thigh&#xD;
      circumference will be recorded. Photos of the treated area will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment administration phase will consist of four (4) treatments, delivered 5-10 days&#xD;
      apart. The applicator of BTL-899 will be applied over the treatment area. The device will&#xD;
      induce visible muscle contractions along with heating of the subcutaneous fat. Each therapy&#xD;
      session will last 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the last therapy visit, the subject's weight and thigh circumference will be recorded, and&#xD;
      photos of the treated area will be taken. In addition, subjects will receive a Subject&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire to fill in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE), including the subject's&#xD;
      experience of pain or discomfort after each procedure. Following each treatment&#xD;
      administration and at all of the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate&#xD;
      post-procedure adverse event assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the post-procedure visits (at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits), the subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a MRI imaging. Also, the subject's satisfaction will be noted, and weight with thigh&#xD;
      circumference will be recorded. Photographs of the treated area will be taken. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a Lifestyle Change Questionnaire to fill in.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the patient's satisfaction with study treatment for non-invasive lipolysis and improvement of muscle tone in inner thighs. The 5-point Likert scale Satisfaction questionnaire will be used to evaluate the participant's satisfaction with the therapy outcome. Subject satisfaction will be assessed after the last therapy visit and during the follow-up visits with 4-therapy related questions with answer &quot;Strongly agree&quot; will be the best possible answer and &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; the worst.</description>
