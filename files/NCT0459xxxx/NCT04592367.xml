  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of primary ACL-R in patients 30 years of&#xD;
      age or older using PRO. The PRO used are Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score(KOOS) and Tegner&#xD;
      score. The Danish Knee Ligament Reconstruction Registry has data including more than 31,000&#xD;
      primary ACL-R performed in the period from 2005 to 2018, of which approximately a little less&#xD;
      than 40% are performed in patients 30 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, ACL-R has been used for the active, younger patients with the purpose of&#xD;
      returning to their pre-injury level of activity. The increasing activity level and the desire&#xD;
      to stay active among some patients in their fourth decade, and later, possibly increases the&#xD;
      demands of the reconstructed ACL in this group. The aim is to investigate the PRO in this&#xD;
      group of patients and compare them with the PRO of patients younger than 30 years of age. The&#xD;
      study may help orthopedic surgeons counselling patients 30 years of age or older when&#xD;
      deciding to perform an ACL-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's hypothesis is, that the overall benefit from ACL-R is equal but the patients 30&#xD;
      years of age or older has a worse baseline and as an implication of that worse PRO one year&#xD;
      after the ACL-R.&#xD;

      Quality Assurance Plan: Clinical data reported by orthopedic surgeons at public and private&#xD;
      hospitals, while patients undergoing ACL-R report PRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source Data Verification with the Danish National Central Person Registry. Degree of&#xD;
      completeness compared to Central Person Registry is approximately 85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data dictionary provided by the data manager at RKKP - &quot;Regionernes Kliniske&#xD;
      Kvalitetudviklingsprogram&quot; - Regional Clinical Quality Development Program. Patients are&#xD;
      recruited when the ACL-R is performed, and approximately 35% report PRO 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
      Data collection, data management and the extract from the Danish Knee Ligament Reconstruction&#xD;
      Registry is performed by the Regional Clinical Quality Development Program. Data analysis&#xD;
      done with support from statistician from &quot;Region Sjælland&quot; - Region Zealand. Sample Size&#xD;
      Assessment not done. The cohort size is the largest we can get from the registry. The&#xD;
      estimated number of patients 30 years of age or older with complete PROs is 2,600 men and&#xD;
      1,600 women. This estimation is based on the numbers from the annual report of 2019 from the&#xD;
      Danish Knee Ligament Reconstruction Register, which states that 7,368 men and 4,656 women 30&#xD;
      years of age or older has undergone the procedure from 2005-2018. We expect that they report&#xD;
      PROs as frequently as the entire cohort, which is approximately 35%. Patients with missing&#xD;
      data will be described in table 3 and not used in table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will present five tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flowchart: Cohort size, excluded patients, patients with missing values, patients in each age&#xD;
      group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Descriptive statistics of the cohort with reported PRO stratified in three strata&#xD;
      (0-14 years of age, 15-29 years of age or 30 years of age or older) with information about&#xD;
      gender, age, previous surgery in the knee, activity at time of injury, operational technique&#xD;
      and cartilage and meniscal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2: Unpaired t-test if data shows normal distribution, otherwise Mann-Whitney, by change&#xD;
      in KOOS from before surgery to one year after surgery, overall KOOS one year after surgery,&#xD;
      Tegner one year after surgery, and Tegner from preoperatively to one year after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 3: Descriptive statistics of population lost during follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 4: Multivariate analysis for primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method: Consecutive patients. Patients are enrolled into the registry when the ACL-R&#xD;
      is performed. The completeness of registry depends on physicians' reporting of pre-, intra-&#xD;
      and postoperative findings and patients' reporting of PROs.&#xD;
