  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclin D-dependent kinases (CDKs) are often activated in human cancer owing to various&#xD;
      genetic and epigenetic events. This affects regulatory pathways, and it results in&#xD;
      uncontrolled proliferation due to loss of checkpoint integrity. Most tumors show increased&#xD;
      activity of CDKs, and this permits escape from senescence during the evolution of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among them, cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4 pathway alterations accelerate G1 progression which provides&#xD;
      proliferative and survival advantage to cancer. Therefore, preclinical data demonstrated&#xD;
      inhibition of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity have therapeutic benefit. CDK4/6 controls&#xD;
      entry into cell cycle progression by regulating Retinoblastoma protein (Rb). The majority of&#xD;
      human cancers are known to retain wild-type Rb. In addition, CDK4 amplification and mutations&#xD;
      also noted in several tumors. In Rb retained tumors, CDK 4/6 inhibitors reduced Rb&#xD;
      phosphorylation and induced G1 arrest. In previous study, CDK4/6 inhibitor showed antitumor&#xD;
      activities in Rb-positive breast and colon cancer cell lines. Rapid tumor regression was also&#xD;
      noticed in mouse xenograft model. In CDK4 amplified sarcoma cell lines, knockdown of CDK4&#xD;
      inhibited cancer cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclin D1 acts with CDK4 and CDK6 to phosphorylate Rb and promote cell-cycle progression, and&#xD;
      CDK4/6 inhibitor might be effective for the patients with CCND1/2/3 amplification/mutation or&#xD;
      CDK 4/6 amplification. Therefore, basket trial (NCT03310879) is ongoing for the patients with&#xD;
      genomic alterations in CCND1, CDKN2A, or CDK4. Amplification/mutation of CCND1/2/3 and CDK4/6&#xD;
      occurs in approximately 15-30% of various solid tumors; sarcoma, GBM, melanoma, gem cell&#xD;
      tumor, and gynecologic tumors Regarding the more potent synergistic effect, paclitaxel&#xD;
      demonstrated a rationale for promising combination partner with CDK 4/6 inhibitors. In&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, synergistic anti-tumor activities were reported with&#xD;
      paclitaxel combination. Corollary, we planned to conduct the phase Ib/II trial of abemaciclib&#xD;
      and paclitaxel combination in CDK4/6 pathway activated tumors as one subgroup of multi-arms&#xD;
      in ongoing basket trial.&#xD;
