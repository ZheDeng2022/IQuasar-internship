  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is trying to find out if flutamide (a medication that blocks the effects of&#xD;
      testosterone) may help normalize an aspect of pituitary function (specifically, gonadotropin&#xD;
      surge generation) in PCOS. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded,&#xD;
      crossover study. The investigators hypothesize that in estradiol-pretreated women with PCOS,&#xD;
      acute progesterone augmentation of FSH release (positive feedback) will be enhanced by&#xD;
      flutamide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with PCOS appear to exhibit impaired progesterone (P4) augmentation of gonadotropin&#xD;
      release (positive feedback), and this is at least partly independent of BMI differences. To&#xD;
      test more directly the role of hyperandrogenemia/hyperandrogenism (HA), we will assess if the&#xD;
      androgen-receptor blocker flutamide enhances P4 augmentation of gonadotropin release in&#xD;
      estradiol (E2)-treated women with PCOS. We will study 10 women with PCOS. This is a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover study, with subjects undergoing two&#xD;
      assessments of P4 positive feedback - once after 4 weeks' pretreatment with flutamide and&#xD;
      once after 4-weeks' pretreatment with placebo (in random order). We will assess P4 positive&#xD;
      feedback via frequent sampling for 16 hours. Subjects will be pretreated for 3 days (prior to&#xD;
      CRU admission) with transdermal E2 (0.2 mg/day), starting no earlier than cycle day 7.&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the CRU the evening of day 3 of E2 treatment. Starting at 0200&#xD;
      h, blood will be collected for 16 hours. After 6 h of sampling (0800 h), subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single oral dose of P4. A second CRU admission - performed at least 2 months later&#xD;
      to permit adequate washout of flutamide (as needed) - will be identical to the first except&#xD;
      that placebo pretreatment will be exchanged for flutamide pretreatment or vice versa. We will&#xD;
      assess the P4-mediated augmentation of FSH release, with secondary endpoints including the&#xD;
      P4-mediated augmentation of LH release. We hypothesize that in E2-pretreated women with PCOS,&#xD;
      acute P4 augmentation of FSH release (positive feedback) will be enhanced by&#xD;
      androgen-receptor blockade (flutamide).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-pubertal (&gt; 4 years post-menarche) adult woman aged 18-30 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PCOS, defined as clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism&#xD;
             and/or elevated serum [calculated] free testosterone concentration) plus ovulatory&#xD;
             dysfunction (irregular menses, fewer than 9 per year), but without evidence for other&#xD;
             potential causes of hyperandrogenism and/or ovulatory dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General good health (excepting overweight, obesity, hyperandrogenism, PCOS, and&#xD;
             adequately-treated hypothyroidism)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of and willing to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to strictly avoid pregnancy with use of reliable non-hormonal methods during&#xD;
             the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability/incapacity to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males will be excluded (PCOS is unique to females)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 years or &gt; 30 years (ovarian reserve may decrease beyond age 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obesity resulting from a well-defined endocrinopathy or genetic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test or current lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence for non-physiologic or non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism and/or anovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of virilization (e.g., rapidly progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice,&#xD;
             clitoromegaly)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl, which suggests the possibility of virilizing ovarian&#xD;
             or adrenal tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DHEA-S elevation &gt; 1.5 times the upper reference range limit. Mild elevations may be&#xD;
             seen in PCOS, and will be accepted in these groups&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl measured in the follicular phase,&#xD;
             which suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if elevated during&#xD;
             the luteal phase, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be repeated during the follicular&#xD;
             phase). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl is confirmed on repeat testing,&#xD;
             an ACTH stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 1000 ng/dl performed by the subject's&#xD;
             personal physician will be required for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Note that subjects with stable and&#xD;
             adequately treated primary hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperprolactinemia &gt; 20% higher than the upper limit of normal. Mild prolactin&#xD;
             elevations may be seen in women with PCOS, and elevations within 20% higher than the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency, or acromegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism&#xD;
             (e.g., symptoms of estrogen deficiency) including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea&#xD;
             (which may be suggested by a constellation of symptoms including restrictive eating&#xD;
             patterns, excessive exercise, psychological stress, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent hematocrit &lt; 37% and hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 50,000 cells/microliter) or leukopenia (total&#xD;
             white blood count &lt; 4,000 cells/microliter)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose &gt; or = 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
             &gt; or = 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Given that this study involves flutamide use, any liver panel abnormality will be&#xD;
             grounds for exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids,&#xD;
             etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decreased renal function evidenced by GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to micronized progesterone, flutamide, or transdermal estradiol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &lt; 18 or &gt; 40 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the amount of blood being drawn, volunteers with body weight &lt; 110 pounds must&#xD;
             be excluded&#xD;
