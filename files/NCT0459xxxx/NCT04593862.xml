  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Canada and has the eighth highest cancer&#xD;
      mortality rate. The treatment for the most frequent type of bladder cancer is surgically&#xD;
      removing the tumour followed by six weeks of medication placed within the bladder. There are&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial challenges from bladder cancer and its treatment that may affect&#xD;
      how patients feel and function, and consequently their quality of life. Moreover, bladder&#xD;
      cancer patients are at a high risk of their bladder cancer coming back and getting worse.&#xD;
      Exercise is a low-cost intervention that may lower the chances of bladder cancer coming back&#xD;
      or getting worse, manage side effects related to treatment, help patients feel better, and&#xD;
      improve quality of life. To date, however, no study has examined if it is safe or even&#xD;
      possible for bladder cancer patients to exercise when they are receiving drugs placed into&#xD;
      their bladder. The Bladder cancer and exeRcise trAining during intraVesical thErapy (BRAVE)&#xD;
      Trial will be the first study to test the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of exercise in&#xD;
      bladder cancer patients during this drug therapy. The investigators will ask some patients to&#xD;
      do a supervised exercise program during their drug treatment while other patients will be&#xD;
      asked not to exercise. The investigators will compare the 2 groups on how they fare with&#xD;
      their bladder cancer treatment. This study will provide information on whether exercise may&#xD;
      help patients feel better, function better, and possibly even lower their chances of the&#xD;
      disease coming back or getting worse.&#xD;
