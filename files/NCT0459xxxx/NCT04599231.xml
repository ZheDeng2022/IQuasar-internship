  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate preoperative anxiety, depression, and coping strategy of the&#xD;
      patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy for early gastric cancer and their effects on&#xD;
      short-term postoperative recovery measured by Quality of Recovery-15 (QOR-15). The findings&#xD;
      of the study would improve the perioperative management of early gastric cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers plan to investigate preoperative psychological factors such as anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and coping strategy in association with short-term quality of recovery from&#xD;
      surgery in 100 patients scheduled for early gastric cancer surgery (laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following items are investigated before surgery; Age, sex, BMI, level of education,&#xD;
      occupation, marital status, ECOG performance status, ASA physical status, Apfel score,&#xD;
      history of mental disorder, type of surgery, past surgical history, the number of days from&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer to surgery, clinical stage of cancer, histological type of cancer,&#xD;
      presence of chronic pain, Quality of Recovery-15 (QOR-15), Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale (HADS), Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS), Coping and&#xD;
      Adaptation Scale-Short Form (CAPS-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QOR-15 is investigated for 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. The severity of&#xD;
      postoperative pain by the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is concurrently measured at&#xD;
      24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. In addition, the researchers measure postoperative&#xD;
      complications, particularly nausea/vomiting, at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery and length&#xD;
      of stay by counting the number of days from the day of surgery to discharge.&#xD;
