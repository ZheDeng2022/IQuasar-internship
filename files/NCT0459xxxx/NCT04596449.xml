      Meta-analyses demonstrate that sleep spindles, characterizing NREM sleep, may be a&#xD;
      physiological index of high-level cognitive processes. The aim of the study is to determine&#xD;
      if sleep spindles can predict interindividual variation in attention and cognitive&#xD;
      performance. Relationship between attention and cognitive performance and sleep spindles&#xD;
      characteristics (density, frequency and amplitude) recording during 1 night in 80 healthy&#xD;
      subject (aged between 18-75y), will be calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is currently well demonstrated that sleep promotes brain plasticity and therefore is&#xD;
      directly involved in cognitive processes such as memory, language, reasoning, learning,&#xD;
      intelligence, problem solving…. Sleep deprivation affects most cognitive processes. More&#xD;
      specifically, it is the sleep microstructure and in particular the sleep spindles that are&#xD;
      specifically linked to memory, learning and cognitive abilities. Sleep spindles are&#xD;
      grapho-elements that characterize NREM sleep. They exhibit high inter-individual stability&#xD;
      and variability, depend on the genetic heritage and correlate with anatomical properties of&#xD;
      the brain. Sleep spindles can therefore be considered as an electrophysiological&#xD;
      &quot;finger-print&quot; as one of the most heritable traits of humans. Studies support the notion that&#xD;
      sleep spindles are electrophysiological markers of high-level cognitive abilities. It remains&#xD;
      to be seen whether the sleep spindles can predict interindividual variations in attention and&#xD;
      executive functions.&#xD;

    <description>The sleep structure of healthy volunteers will be recorded (9 Electroencephalograms (EEG), 2 Electrooculograms (EOG), 2 Electromyograms (EMG) and 2 Electrocardiograms (ECG)) during 1 night. The characteristics of the spindle (density, frequency and amplitude) will be automatically analyzed from purified EEG during Non Rapid Eye Movement sleep (NREM).&#xD;
Volunteers will completed a neuropsychological evaluation that will evaluate Sustained attention (simple reaction time test), Vigilance (TAP Vigilance), Sustained and selective attention (CPT II), Inhibition (Stroop test), Mental flexibility (TAP flexibility) , Executive operation (Tower of London), Short-term memory (Wechsler code test).&#xD;
Driving performance will be analyzed as part of a complex scenario involving attentional and high-level functions on a driving simulator.</description>
