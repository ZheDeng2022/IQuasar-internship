  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of FLASH radiotherapy for the&#xD;
      palliative treatment of painful bone metastases. FLASH radiotherapy is radiation treatment&#xD;
      delivered at ultra-high dose rates compared to conventional radiation treatment.&#xD;

      This clinical investigation is designed to assess the workflow feasibility of FLASH&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment in a clinical setting, as well as the toxicities, and pain relief when&#xD;
      used to treat bone metastasis(-es) in the extremities (excluding feet, hands, wrists). FLASH&#xD;
      radiotherapy has been shown in preclinical studies to cause less injury to surrounding normal&#xD;
      tissues during radiation treatment, while still having similar tumor cell killing. Patients&#xD;
      at least 18 years of age with painful bone metastases located in the limbs will be considered&#xD;
      for the study. These patients represent an ideal population for a feasibility study of FLASH&#xD;
      radiotherapy as they are known to benefit from the palliative effects of radiotherapy using&#xD;
      single dose radiation regimens of 8Gy which is what is being used in this investigation.&#xD;
      After treatment, patients will be assessed for pain response as well as any adverse&#xD;
      side-effects of radiation. The workflow feasibility of the treatment will also be evaluated.&#xD;
