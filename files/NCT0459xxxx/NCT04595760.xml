      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study (EPS) was held from 1982 to 1986. Women who were&#xD;
      trying to get pregnant took part in the study. They collected urine samples. They kept&#xD;
      diaries. They filled out surveys. They answered questions about their partners. They were&#xD;
      asked about their drug use. Data about air pollution and other exposures were also collected.&#xD;
      A follow-up study was held from 2010 to 2011. Researchers want to use the data and samples to&#xD;
      study factors that affect reproductive success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine behavioral and environmental exposures and reproductive health, such as menstrual&#xD;
      cycles, conception, pregnancy loss, and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 221 healthy women age 21-42 who were planning to get pregnant and took part in the&#xD;
      1982-86 North Carolina EPS at the time they stopped using all birth control. A 2010-11&#xD;
      follow-up included 173 of these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses existing data. No new data will be collected in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored urine samples may be used. Data from surveys and other sources will be used. All of&#xD;
      the women who gave data and samples will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic data is held in secure databases. The data is kept on computers that are password&#xD;
      protected. Hard-copy data are stored in locked file cabinets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at more than one site. Data will be shared with groups outside the&#xD;
      NIH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing self-reported data and assay results from the 1982-1986 North Carolina Early&#xD;
      Pregnancy Study (EPS) and a subsequent 2010-2011 cohort follow-up study will be used to&#xD;
      examine predictors of fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Some of these data will be harmonized&#xD;
      with data from other studies by our collaborator (Harville PI, Tulane University) to examine&#xD;
      factors, such as marijuana use in women and their partners, influencing reproductive success,&#xD;
      including (but not limited to) conception, pregnancy loss, and birth outcomes. Women enrolled&#xD;
      in the original EPS study after discontinuing birth control and were followed for the&#xD;
      occurrence of a pregnancy. Participants completed daily diaries and collected first morning&#xD;
      urine specimens which allowed the identification of hormonal endpoints. Thus, each woman s&#xD;
      time to pregnancy was prospectively measured. In the EPS Follow-up study, women completed a&#xD;
      questionnaire that included their recall of their time to pregnancy during the study. This&#xD;
      allowed analysis of two major questions, one regarding the recall of time- to-pregnancy, and&#xD;
      the other regarding the natural length of gestation. Several exposure metrics based on&#xD;
      address geolocation data were calculated, including the distance from residence to nearest&#xD;
      major road, air pollution and related exposures, light at night, and other exposures.&#xD;
      Existing urine specimens can be assayed for numerous environmental contaminants including&#xD;
      metals, pesticides, and drug metabolites (both over-the-counter medications like&#xD;
      acetaminophen and drugs of abuse like marijuana or opioids). Urine specimens can also be used&#xD;
      to examine nutritional markers such as phytoestrogen exposure and caffeine metabolites.&#xD;
      Additional hormone measures may also be possible as metabolomics and technology improve.&#xD;
      Thus, the stored EPS specimens can be leveraged to answer multiple, relevant fertility&#xD;
      research questions. Women in the original tudy answered questions regarding their tobacco&#xD;
      smoking and marijuana smoking. In addition, partners of the women were asked the same series&#xD;
      of questions regarding tobacco and marijuana use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use all of this existing data, assay results, and to perform additional urine&#xD;
      assays, to examine factors influencing reproductive success, including (but not limited to)&#xD;
      conception, pregnancy loss, and birth outcomes. To address some of these questions,&#xD;
      de-identified data from the Early Pregnancy Study will be harmonized with data from other&#xD;
      studies in the Preconception Period Analysis of Risks and Exposures Influencing Health and&#xD;
      Development (PrePARED) consortium. Further, de-identified data and specimens will be shared&#xD;
      with Dr. Ashley Boggs and colleagues to address the objectives below. Data and specimens will&#xD;
      be shared with other qualified investigators in the future to address relevant research&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
