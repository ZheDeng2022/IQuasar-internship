    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of pure binaural beats on anxiety levels and pain&#xD;
      scores using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) in male patients undergoing DC and USR procedures under local anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic cystoscopy (DC) and ureteral stent removal (USR) are two common simple procedures&#xD;
      in urology practice. DC is generally performed to investigate the etiology of hematuria,&#xD;
      recurrent urinary tract infections, lower urinary tract symptoms, and suspected bladder tumor&#xD;
      cases.Ureteral stent removal is usually carried out after the placed urethral stent for the&#xD;
      treatment of urolithiasis and urethral stricture. In many urology clinics, both procedures&#xD;
      are generally performed under local anesthesia. To reduce pain, it is recommended that DC&#xD;
      should be performed using a flexible cystoscope. In many urology clinics, USR is performed&#xD;
      using a rigid cystoscope in both sexes, as a rigid cystoscope is easier to manipulate during&#xD;
      stent removal compared with a flexible cystoscope. Although performed under local anesthesia,&#xD;
      both procedures are invasive and can cause increased anxiety levels and pain&#xD;
      perception.Anxiety is commonly associated with an increased perception of pain.Therefore,&#xD;
      patients who have high anxiety levels experience longer pain and require more analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binaural beats have been recommended to reduce anxiety levels and the perception of pain in&#xD;
      many treatment modalities.hey were discovered by Dove in 1841 and described in detail by&#xD;
      Oster in 1973. Binaural beats are resulted from exposing each ear to two sounds which have&#xD;
      steady intensities with different frequencies. A single tone with a midway frequency between&#xD;
      the carrier tones is perceived. This frequency also waxes and wanes in amplitudes at a rate&#xD;
      equal to the difference between the carrier tones It has been suggested that the human brain&#xD;
      alters its dominant wave frequency toward that of the frequency of external stimuli to&#xD;
      synchronize neural activity with stimuli from binaural beats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics statement and participant selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the institutional review board (Approval number and date: 16/15 -&#xD;
      04/07/2019 ). Male patients aged ≥ 18 y with negative urine culture, at least formal&#xD;
      schooling (1-8 y of education) who had undergone local DC for various reasons (e.g.,&#xD;
      hematuria, carcinoma suspicion, follow-up for bladder cancer, and screening of the urethra or&#xD;
      prostate) or unilateral USR were included in the study. Informed consent was provided by all&#xD;
      the patients who accepted to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were patients who had a hearing or vision problems, neurological&#xD;
      deficits, mental retardation, a history of chronic pelvic pain syndrome, history of previous&#xD;
      DC or USR procedures, antidepressant use, or analgesia use 24 h before the procedure.&#xD;
      Patients who underwent a bilateral USR procedure (for USR patients), required additional&#xD;
      manipulations of the lower urinary tract (e.g., urethral dilation or biopsies), declined to&#xD;
      participate, failed to complete the questionnaires, or could not tolerate the intervention&#xD;
      were also excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, sample size, procedures, interventions, measurement of anxiety levels and pain&#xD;
      scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prospective randomized, non-blinded and placebo-controlled study. After initial&#xD;
      exclusions, patients were allocated to the study using the block randomization method. Two&#xD;
      main groups were created according to the procedure applied: a DC group (DCG) and a USR group&#xD;
      (USRG). The patients in the DCG were divided into three subgroups, according to the&#xD;
      intervention applied: DCG-1, patients listened to binaural beats; DCG-2, patients listened to&#xD;
      classical music; and DCG-3, patients wore headphones but were not exposed to audio (control&#xD;
      group). The USRG was also divided into three subgroups, according to the intervention&#xD;
      applied: USRG-1 patients listened to binaural beats; USRG-2 patients listened to classical&#xD;
      music; and USRG-3 patients wore headphones but were not exposed to audio (control group). A&#xD;
      power analysis indicated a minimum of 62 patients were required in each DCG to have power&#xD;
      (1-β) of 0.90 at an alpha value of 0.05, with an effect size of 0.265. A minimum of 41&#xD;
      patients was required in each USRG to have power (1-β) of 0.90 at an alpha value of 0.05 with&#xD;
      an effect size of 0.326. The sample sizes of the groups were calculated using the G-power 3.1&#xD;
      (Kiel, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STAI is a questionnaire used for measuring anxiety.20 The STAI is often employed to&#xD;
      determine an individual's emotional status before surgical interventions. It consists of 20&#xD;
      questions, and STAI scores range from 20 to 80. Higher STAI scores indicate increased anxiety&#xD;
      levels. In this study, we used the Turkish validation of the STAI questionnaire to evaluate&#xD;
      the patients' anxiety scores.21 Before the DC and USR procedures, the patients who accepted&#xD;
      to participate in the study were asked to complete the STAI questionnaire and a nurse&#xD;
      recorded the score of each patient (initial STAI: STAI-I). All the patients then put on&#xD;
      headphones. For 10 min before the interventions, the patients in DCG-1 and USRG-1 listened to&#xD;
      binaural beats, those in DCG-2 and USRG-2 listened to classical music and those in DCG-3 and&#xD;
      USRG-3 sat in a quiet room with headphones on but no audio playing. The binaural beats were&#xD;
      produced using a software program (Audacity®, version win. 2.3.2, 2019 Audacity Team) at&#xD;
      frequency of 10 Hz (a tone of 200 Hz in the right ear and a tone of 210 Hz in the left ear).&#xD;
      The binaural beats that the patients in DCG-1 and USRG-1 listened to were &quot;pure&quot; frequencies,&#xD;
      with no background music or waves. The classical music that those in DCG-2 and USRG-2&#xD;
      listened to was Mozart's 40th Symphony. The audio headphones used in the DCGs and USRGs were&#xD;
      wireless stereo headphones (Sony WH-CH510; Sony Corporation, U.S.). The patients who could&#xD;
      not tolerate the interventions were also recorded. After the interventions, the STAI scores&#xD;
      of the patients were measured again and recorded. (Terminal STAI: STAI-T). Delta anxiety&#xD;
      score is recorded as STAI-I score minus STAI-T score (delta STAI: STAI-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genital area was disinfected with povidone-iodine, and 10 ml of 2% lidocaine jelly was&#xD;
      instilled intraurethrally and the penis was clamped approximately 5 min for local anesthesia&#xD;
      before the procedures. We used a 17 F video flexible cystoscope for DCG procedure (Hawk GmbH,&#xD;
      China) and 17 F rigid cystoscope (Stema GmbH, Germany) with 30 ͦ telescope (Karl Storz GmbH,&#xD;
      Germany) for USR procedure. Semi-rigid forceps were used when performing USR. During the DC&#xD;
      and USR procedures, the same interventions before the procedures were applied to the patients&#xD;
      again. The VAS is a common tool in which patients score their pain level on a scale between 0&#xD;
      and 10.22 In this study, we also used the VAS to evaluate the patients' pain scores. After&#xD;
      the procedures, the duration of the procedures and VAS scores 20 of the patients were also&#xD;
      recorded. The duration of each procedure was calculated as the time between the entry and&#xD;
      exit of the cystoscopy device into the urethral meatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Statistical analysis was made using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (IBM&#xD;
      Corp., Armonk, NY). The assumptions of normality were evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. To&#xD;
      determine differences between groups, One-way ANOVA test was used for parametric variables&#xD;
      and Kruskal Wallis test was used for non-parametric variables. Bonferroni-Dunn test was used&#xD;
      as a post-hoc test for significant cases. Pearson chi-square test and Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      were used to compare the categorical variables between the groups while Bonferroni-Dunn test&#xD;
      was also used as a post-hoc test for significant cases. A p value of &lt; 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
