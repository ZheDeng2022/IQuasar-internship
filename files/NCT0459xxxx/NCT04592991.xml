  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at whether an investigational imaging agent,&#xD;
      64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i, used during Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/ Computed Tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scanning, can help to identify conditions that place patients at an increased risk for AAA&#xD;
      rupture. The study is also looking more closely at cellular, molecular and inflammatory&#xD;
      properties of the aortic wall. Having the ability to identify markers that predict AAA&#xD;
      progression/expansion and risk for rupture could allow the physician to manage patients in a&#xD;
      more individualized, personal way.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening degenerative vascular disease&#xD;
      characterized by transmural aortic macrophage infiltration, elastin degradation, and&#xD;
      reduction of smooth muscle cell content. AAAs occurs later in life and are especially&#xD;
      prevalent in men over the age of 65. Patients typically remain asymptomatic until rupture,&#xD;
      which is associated with high mortality. Currently, surgical repair is the only approach for&#xD;
      AAA treatment, and there is no pharmacological intervention. Clinically, ultrasound and&#xD;
      computed tomography measurement of aneurysm diameter represents the mainstay of management&#xD;
      and the principal determinant of timing for elective surgical repair. However, this&#xD;
      anatomy-based approach fails to provide useful information about the cellular and molecular&#xD;
      processes associated with aneurysm expansion and rupture. Therefore, developing translatable&#xD;
      molecular biomarkers, specifically expressed by aneurysms, is necessary to determine&#xD;
      associated status and progression, capture the risk of rupture, and deliver personalized&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients undergoing open AAA repair will be scheduled for PET/CT imaging at 1-2 weeks prior to surgery. This will be first-in-patient molecular imaging using CCR2 targeted 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i in AAA patients undergoing open repair. The surgically removed aneurysmal tissue will be collected and processed for a complete characterization.</description>

    <description>Participants with AAA will undergo routine clinical evaluation of AAA including ultrasound and CT and scheduling of open surgical repair as directed by the treating physician. We will record age and tobacco use of participant. If participant has not had a renal function blood test performed within the past 90 days, we will draw approximately 2 teaspoons of blood for a creatinine test. We will also ask the participant's permission to use a contrast dye for the CT portion of the PET-CT scan. If the participant agrees we will additional questions to gauge eligibility to receive the contrast dye.&#xD;
If available, we would like to collect any discarded AAA tissue from the surgical procedure. This discarded tissue will be kept as part of a Washington University vascular research repository. If the participant agrees to this there will be a separate consent form to sign allowing the collection of the leftover tissue along with some information about medical history.</description>

    <description>Participants with non-aneurysmal aortoiliac occlusive disease, will be eligible for the study based on lifestyle limiting claudication (lack of blood flow to muscles causing cramping), pain in the feet or toes at rest, and/or tissue loss (leg or foot ulcers that don't heal or gangrene) that requires aortofemoral bypass. The aortofemoral bypass is not part of this research study.</description>
