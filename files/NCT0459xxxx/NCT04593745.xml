    <textblock>
      Childhood ALL patients are treated with high dose steroids. The study will follow the&#xD;
      intraocular pressure of children treated in according to an AIEOP-BFM protocol, during the&#xD;
      induction phase that will be compared to the pressure before treatment. Potential risk&#xD;
      factors for developing elevated intraocular pressure will be estimated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with ALL in Israel are treating according to the BFM ALL Protocol which contains&#xD;
      high dose steroid therapy. One of the known side effects of high dose steroids is Intraocular&#xD;
      hypertension, glaucoma, and even irreversible optic nerve injury. Early diagnosis of elevated&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) and early therapeutic interventions might help to prevent future&#xD;
      ocular damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the risk of developing evaluate Intraocular&#xD;
      pressure during high dose steroid therapy. If elevated IOP will be common enough, we will try&#xD;
      to corelate the risk of elevated IOP with potential risk factors, such as initial IOP, WBC at&#xD;
      diagnosis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure will be measured by ophthalmologists using iCare devise: TONOPEN during&#xD;
      general anesthesia at the day of diagnosis of ALL before steroid therapy initiation, and then&#xD;
      after 15 and 33 days. Children with elevated IOP will continue ophthalmologists' follow up&#xD;
      and treatment as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parents or patients' guardians will sign informed consent for participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group contains all newly diagnosed children with ALL in Schneider Children Medical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
