  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of experimental hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) therapy in&#xD;
      sickle-cell disease (SCD) must strike a balance between the underlying disease severity and&#xD;
      the possibility of a direct benefit of the treatment, particularly in pediatric populations.&#xD;
      Clinical studies in adults with SCD have focused on interventions that prolong survival and&#xD;
      improve the quality of life. Unlike children, adults with SCD are much more likely to have a&#xD;
      debilitating complication. As a result, the risk/benefit ratio of HCT is very favorable in&#xD;
      adults, particularly if an approach to HCT that defines an acceptable level of toxicity can&#xD;
      be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment&#xD;
      currently available for patients with SCD, the morbidity, the frequent irreversible damage in&#xD;
      target organs and the mortality reported in the natural course of patients with severe SCD&#xD;
      are strong incentives to perform HSCTs in younger age groups. For those who lack a matched&#xD;
      related donor, CB transplant is an appealing option, but despite been less problematic, CB&#xD;
      accessibility related to cell dose of appropriately matched cord blood unit (CBU) remains a&#xD;
      significant issue. Through a 7-day culture process of a CBU's hematopoietic stem cell HSCs&#xD;
      with the UM171 compound, the total cell dose is increased mitigating this limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UM171-CB expansion (ECT-001-CB) allows a greater CB accessibility, the selection of better&#xD;
      matched cords that might translate into favourable clinical outcomes as reported in previous&#xD;
      trials, including a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease. After CB selection and ex-vivo&#xD;
      expansion, ECT-001-CB transplant will follow a myeloablative reduced-toxicity conditioning&#xD;
      regimen consisting of rATG, busulfan and fludarabine with doses of all agents optimized to&#xD;
      the individual using model-based dosing and will be followed by standard supportive care and&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and MMF.&#xD;
