  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this clinical investigation is to show the superiority of a&#xD;
      rehabilitation based on the use of Blueback® Physio compared to a rehabilitation without the&#xD;
      use of Blueback® Physio in terms of reducing the time needed for a patient to control the&#xD;
      voluntary contraction of the transversus abdominal muscle and to return to autonomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Blueback® Physio is a wireless device for indicating, for a given patient, the relative&#xD;
      level of contraction of the transversus abdominal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blueback® Physio is a CE marked class I medical device. This medical device allows to measure&#xD;
      and visualize in real time the activity of the transversus abdominal muscle, one of the&#xD;
      deepest muscle of the abdominal wall. It is placed on the patient, during a rehabilitation&#xD;
      session with a mhysiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to optimize the three key phases followed by the healthcare professional:&#xD;
      teaching his patient to feel the contraction of the muscle, learning to control this&#xD;
      contraction, then learning to master this contraction when the patient is in double task&#xD;
      (movements rehabilitation targeting other muscles, cognitive tasks or other tasks of everyday&#xD;
      life that strain the spine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ABC-TRACC study, the objective is to compare the time needed for patient to get a good&#xD;
      motor control on his transversus abdominal muscle if he is using the Blueback® Physio during&#xD;
      his sessons or not.&#xD;

    <time_frame>5 weeks including 5 rehabilitation sessions per week</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is mastering the motor control of the muscle on defined exercises with a quotation calculated using the Blueback Physio.&#xD;
The primary outcome measure is a composite between two tests mesauring the ability for the patient to control his mucle activity, and a third test to measure his autonomy on this control (does the patient has enough awarness of his own ability to control the muscle).&#xD;
The three tests are underwent using the Blueback Physio in order th get the quotations used for the calculations.</description>

    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome will be assessed by using the NHP questionnaire. Each section of the questionnaire is rated between 0 and 100. A higher rate shows a lower well-being for the patient.</description>

    <measure>Well-being for daily life based on a muscular test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome will be assessed by using a muscular test (ito-shirado and sorensen). The tests consist in calculating the time during which the patient can maintain the requested posture. THe outcome is evaluated by calculating the ratio between the two tests. The closer to one (value 1) the better.</description>
