  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystectomy with bladder replacement, with or without urinary diversion, is the preferred&#xD;
      treatment option for benign pathologies responsible for neurogenic bladder or sphincter&#xD;
      dysfunction after failure of conservative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This surgery has both the objective of preventing urological complications and improving&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that women are especially affected by these conditions, as demonstrated by the high&#xD;
      prevalence of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis in this population. Patients&#xD;
      are often young and sexually active before the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the existence of validated evaluation tools since the early nineties, there is poor&#xD;
      data exploring effects of invasive procedures such as cystectomy on sexual activity and&#xD;
      quality of sexual life in female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, existing literature largely focuses on sexual function in male population after&#xD;
      cystectomy for urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on sexual function after stoma formation in women with colorectal cancer show a&#xD;
      significant change after the surgery, partly due to body image issues. We can easily suppose&#xD;
      that there's also an important impact of cystectomy that may affect sexual quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of the study is to assess sexual function and determine factors that may&#xD;
      influence sexual quality of life in female patients following cystectomy or urinary&#xD;
      diversion.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at least 6 months after the surgery (Cystectomy and/or urinary diversion)</time_frame>
    <description>The FSFI Score will be obtained from answers of the validated questionnaire &quot;Female Sexual Function Index&quot;, a 19-item self-report measure of female sexual function.&#xD;
It uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1-5 for each item. It provides scores on overall levels of sexual function and its six components: Desire, Arousal, Lubrication, Orgasm, Satisfaction and Pain. The full scale score is between 2 and 36.&#xD;
According to literature, total score of 26 or less indicates a risk of sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
The version used in this study is the French one.</description>

    <description>Four Questionnaires in French will be sent to participants :&#xD;
1 questionnaire about sexual and urinary symptoms before and after the surgery ;&#xD;
1 validated questionnaire &quot;Female Sexual Function Index&quot; to assess sexual function over the past 4 weeks ;&#xD;
1 validated questionnaire &quot;Body Image Scale&quot; to assess body image during the past week ;&#xD;
1 validated questionnaire &quot;Stoma Quality of Life&quot;, only for patients with incontinent urostomy.&#xD;
If the questionnaires are not returned 15 days after sending, a follow-up phone call will be made by one of the investigators.&#xD;
The data collection will include both the answers to the questionnaires and the patients' computerized medical data:&#xD;
Pathology responsible for the urological disorders and date of onset of the disorders&#xD;
Date and Type of surgery performed&#xD;
Patient's age at the time of surgery&#xD;
Post-operative complications within one month of surgery</description>

        The study population consists in alive female patients aged 18-75 years, who undergone a&#xD;
        partial or total cystectomy and/or urinary diversion and/or urinary ostomy repair&#xD;
        operations between 01/01/2007 and 15/12/2019 at the &quot;Lyon Sud&quot; Hospital and able to&#xD;
        complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients suffer from urological disorders caused by a non-malignant pathology, and have&#xD;
        had surgery after failure of conservative therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Among the patients identified from the computerized medical records, 55 suffer from&#xD;
        Multiple sclerosis, 29 patients from Spinal Cord Injury, 21 suffer from Suprapontine and&#xD;
        pontine lesion or disease, 19 suffer from non-traumatic lesion or disease between caudal&#xD;
        brainstem and sacral spinal cord,18 suffer from lesions of the peripheral nervous system, 8&#xD;
        suffer from interstitial cystitis or idiopathic disorders and 1 suffers from a&#xD;
        neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology&#xD;
