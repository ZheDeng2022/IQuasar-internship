  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of minimally invasive&#xD;
      decompression and fusion over the traditional open decompression and fusion in patients with&#xD;
      single-level lumbar stenosis caused by degenerative spondylolisthesis. Postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up will continue for 12 months. Ð¡linical, safety, radiological and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      endpoints will be evaluated.&#xD;
