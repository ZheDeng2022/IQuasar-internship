    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, Phase II study aimed at defining the activity and safety&#xD;
      of SBRT in MPR-OC. Clinical and imaging data as well as SBRT parameters would be analyzed&#xD;
      with the aim to identify potential predictors of response to treatment and clinical outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) represents the cutting edge within high conformal and&#xD;
      modulated radiotherapy techniques; it can provide high local control (LC) for curative-intent&#xD;
      of low burden metastatic, persistent and metastatic lesions in face of minimal acute and late&#xD;
      toxicities. SBRT is amenable even in patients who had already been managed by radiotherapy.&#xD;
      In addition, SBRT has been shown to be active in chemoresistant disease, and potentially able&#xD;
      to mount immune response through the release of tumor neoantigens after cell killing, thus&#xD;
      allowing to synergize with immunotherapeutic approaches. SBRT has been widely adopted in the&#xD;
      clinical setting of oligometastatic/persistent/recurrent (MPR) disease (up to &lt;5 lesions) in&#xD;
      several malignancies including also ovarian cancer (OC); the recently published&#xD;
      retrospective, multicenter Italian study (MITO-RT1) has confirmed the activity and safety of&#xD;
      SBRT in MPR OC, thus providing a model able to predict the higher chance of complete response&#xD;
      of tumor lesions to SBRT, and local control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MITO-RT3/RAD trial is a prospective, Italian multicenter Phase II study aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating the activity and safety of SBRT in MPR-OC patients. Clinical and imaging data, as&#xD;
      well as SBRT technical parameters, would be analyzed with the aim to identify potential&#xD;
      predictors of response to treatment and clinical outcome: in this context, additional&#xD;
      insights into the tissue features of tumor lesions would be of clinical interest in the&#xD;
      context of the personalized treatment, as testified by studies demonstrating that image-based&#xD;
      quantitative features from pre-treatment imaging could predict clinical outcomes in several&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, given the crucial role played by the mutational status of BRCA 1/2 genes in this&#xD;
      disease, the assessment of BRCA gene status was considered mandatory, thus representing&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with oligo-metastatic/persistent/recurrent lesions (MPR) from&#xD;
      OC patients for which salvage surgery or other local therapies resulted not feasible, as per&#xD;
      relative contraindication to further systemic therapy because of serious comorbidities, as&#xD;
      per previous severe toxicity, unavailability of potentially active chemotherapy, or patient&#xD;
      refusal of systemic therapy&#xD;
