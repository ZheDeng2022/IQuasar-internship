  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      this is a randomized, double-blinded, parallel, active-controlled clinical phase III study.&#xD;
      the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CMAB807 treatment compared&#xD;
      with Prolia in Chinese postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should sequentially enrolled according to the protocol in one of two arms. Subjects&#xD;
      who entered in test arm would receive 60mg of CMAB807 subcutaneously every 6 months for one&#xD;
      year, while those who entered in control arm should receive 60mg of Prolia subcutaneously&#xD;
      every 6 months for one year. Meanwhile, every subject should taking 600mg calcium and 400IU&#xD;
      vitamin D daily from successfully screening to the end of study.&#xD;
