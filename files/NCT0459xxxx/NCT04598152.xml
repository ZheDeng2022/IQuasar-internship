  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to gather scientific information about how different&#xD;
      people's brains work when they look at different types of pictures. This will help to improve&#xD;
      the investigators' understanding of the way the brain works for people who are depressed or&#xD;
      anxious, and this knowledge could help lead to better diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

      In this study the investigators are examining the effects of weak electrical stimulation on&#xD;
      brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MRI is a widely&#xD;
      used method to obtain high resolution brain pictures that are routinely used for diagnostic&#xD;
      and clinical purposes. The electrical stimulation is applied on the scalp with a non-FDA&#xD;
      approved method called tDCS (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation), typically equivalent&#xD;
      to what a 6V battery would produce (and up to no more than 15V). To compare, an AA battery&#xD;
      delivers current at 1.5 volt. While almost unnoticeable to the participants, these currents&#xD;
      can still temporarily affect brain activity without causing adverse effects. This stimulation&#xD;
      would be applied while the participants are in the MRI scanner so that the brain activity can&#xD;
      be measured. The participants will have the opportunity to have a test session with the&#xD;
      stimulation outside the scanner to get familiar with it.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The first part of the study consists of screening procedures that are meant to determine if potential participants are eligible to take part in the remainder of the study.&#xD;
If you qualify to take part in the scanning portion of the study, you will have 2 scanning sessions on separate days approximately a week apart. For each scan session you will undergo a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scan that lasts approximately 30 minutes and no more than 1 hour. The total time you will spend for each scan session will be between 1-3 hours.&#xD;
During the scanning session you will receive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Prior to scanning, sponge-electrodes will be placed on your scalp. These electrodes will be connected to a stimulator. This stimulator will apply weak currents to the brain while the MRI takes pictures of your brain's responses. The stimulation current that you will experience is usually less than a 6-volt battery but may be increased up to 15-volts.</intervention_model_description>

    <intervention_name>TDCS - transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>TDCS involves passing a weak current through the brain. One variant, cathodal TDCS, can be used to temporarily hyperpolarize cortical pyramidal cells, thereby decreasing neuronal connections. TDCS has been explored as a possible treatment for depression, but results to date are mixed. No work has examined whether TDCS can be used in an individually guided manner to target locations in the parietal cortex and alter the patterns of circuitry dysfunction described previously.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Between 18-30years old&#xD;
