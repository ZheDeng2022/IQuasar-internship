  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scarring of the lung, termed pulmonary fibrosis (PF), is a chronic, progressive, and usually&#xD;
      fatal disorder. While two anti-fibrotic drugs have recently been approved for treating PF of&#xD;
      unknown cause (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF), neither drug is curative, and nearly&#xD;
      40% of patients stop taking the prescribed drug within a year because of side effects. The&#xD;
      study includes the use of saracatinib, an investigational drug originally developed to treat&#xD;
      certain types of cancers, in the treatment of IPF in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to: i) evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics, and to explore the efficacy of saracatinib in IPF; ii) identify&#xD;
      biomarkers of Src kinase activity and fibrogenesis linked to pulmonary fibrosis; and iii)&#xD;
      explore the application of these biomarkers to assess the anti-fibrotic effect of saracatinib&#xD;
      in IPF patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, three-site trial. The&#xD;
      trial is a biomarker-based, integrated Phase 1b/2a clinical trial involving 100 subjects. One&#xD;
      group (n=50) will receive placebo, while the other group (n=50) will receive 125 mg of oral&#xD;
      saracatinib once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by center. The randomization scheme will be in random blocks&#xD;
      of 2 and 4 within each stratum to maintain balance. The study is designed to have interim&#xD;
      analysis of the drop-out rates when approximately 30% of the randomized patients have&#xD;
      achieved the 24-week assessment. Should the drop-out rate be higher than the 20% that is&#xD;
      anticipated, a new sample size calculation will be performed to make sure that the power of&#xD;
      the study is maintained at 80% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of follow-up will be 28 weeks including 24 weeks of treatment with saracatinib or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
