      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of smoking cessation on total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty patients with respect to perioperative complications and outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine patients who are asked to stop smoking in any manner they choose&#xD;
      and also refrain from nicotine replacement therapy, and those who are allowed to continue&#xD;
      smoking during the perioperative period for their total knee or total hip replacement.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to examine the impact of smoking cessation on total joint arthroplasty patients with respect to combined complications. For the purpose of the study combined complications will include: major in-hospital complications (MI, CVA, PE, pneumonia, return to the operating room, mortality), wound complications, readmission at 90 days, 90-day major complications (MI, CVA, PE, pneumonia, return to the operating room, mortality), and wound complications (prolonged hospitalization due to a wound issue, prolonged drainage &gt; 7 days, superficial or deep SSI</description>
