  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        As a general principle, subjects eligible for access must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a serious or life-threatening condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no appropriate, comparable, or satisfactory alternative treatment available, or&#xD;
             such alternatives have been tried without clinical success, including clinical&#xD;
             studies; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be unable to participate in a PVSRIPO clinical trial that is currently open to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are eligible if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject is able and willing to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Prior histologically confirmed supratentorial GBM based on imaging studies with&#xD;
                  measurable disease (≥ 1 cm of contrast-enhancing tumor; multifocal acceptable if&#xD;
                  total enhancing disease burden considered acceptable); OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects with GBM &gt; 5.5 cm in diameter (these are excluded from current clinical&#xD;
                  studies of PVSRIPO), but for whom PVSRIPO is judged by Investigator to be&#xD;
                  appropriate for treatment. Such cases may include subjects with large resection&#xD;
                  cavities with residual infusible tumor, where the cavity allows space for&#xD;
                  expansion of peritumoral edema (PTE); OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects with recurrent GBM (rGBM) who benefitted from prior PVSRIPO treatment;&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects with GBM who do not meet eligibility for a clinical trial of PVSRIPO&#xD;
                  currently open to enrollment, but who would otherwise benefit from treatment. If&#xD;
                  appropriate, comparable or satisfactory alternative treatments approved for GBM&#xD;
                  must have been tried without clinical success, or in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  Investigator the subject is not a good candidate for those treatments but is&#xD;
                  anticipated to potentially benefit from PVSRIPO treatment without additional&#xD;
                  risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Before catheter placement based on screening MRI and at the time of catheter placement&#xD;
             via CT prior to infusion, neurosurgical investigator should confirm placement of&#xD;
             infusion catheter within or through the progressive enhancing tumor is feasible and at&#xD;
             a safe distance relative to eloquent brain function, with the tip of the catheter&#xD;
             being placed within these guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Within the enhancing portion or in the vicinity of enhancement of target lesion&#xD;
                  (ie, infiltrative disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ≥ 0.5 cm from ventricles&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. ≥ 1 cm deep into the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. ≥ 0.5 cm from the corpus callosum&#xD;
&#xD;
             Any changes from the above catheter tip placement guidelines require discussion and&#xD;
             prior approval from the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum (Beta-Human&#xD;
             Chorionic Gonadotropin, β-hCG) pregnancy test prior to PVSRIPO infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women and men in the study, and female partners of men in the study, must use highly&#xD;
             effective birth control for 6 months after the last dose of PVSRIPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) Score ≥ 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Undergone prior vaccination against PV and received a boost immunization with&#xD;
             trivalent IPOL® (Sanofi-Pasteur SA) at least 1 week, but less than 6 weeks, prior to&#xD;
             administration of PVSRIPO (within 6 months of PVSRIPO retreatment). Note: Patients who&#xD;
             are unsure of their prior vaccination status/who have not been vaccinated must provide&#xD;
             proof of vaccination and/or evidence of anti-PV immunity prior to enrollment, as&#xD;
             applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Prior to biopsy (if required)/catheter placement, the following must be met: Platelet&#xD;
             count ≥ 100,000/µL unsupported is necessary for eligibility; however, because of risks&#xD;
             of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet count ≥ 125,000/µL is&#xD;
             required for the subject to undergo biopsy/catheter insertion, which can be attained&#xD;
             via platelet transfusion (ie, supported).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any of the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the&#xD;
             assessment of the institution's neurosurgeons, and/or designee(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an unexplained&#xD;
                  febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5°F/37.5°C).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
                  infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Have unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo- and/or radiation therapy, if&#xD;
             applicable. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific&#xD;
             therapeutic agent received; the following are excluded relative to planned PVSRIPO&#xD;
             treatment:&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. May not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to PVSRIPO treatment unless the&#xD;
             subject has recovered from side effects of such therapy, as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
