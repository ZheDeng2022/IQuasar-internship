  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to compare the effect of Vancomycin and Tobramycin powder combined&#xD;
      (treatment) to Vancomycin powder (control) in the reduction of post-fixation infections of&#xD;
      tibial plateau and tibial pilon fractures at high risk of infection (collectively considered&#xD;
      the &quot;study injuries&quot;).&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Compare the proportion of deep surgical site infections (SSI) of the study&#xD;
      injury within 365 days of definitive fracture fixation surgery in patients allocated to&#xD;
      receive a combination of local Vancomycin and Tobramycin powders compared to patients&#xD;
      allocated to local Vancomycin powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Analyses: A series of sensitivity analyses will be conducted to look at&#xD;
      alternative measures of deep SSI under Specific Aim 1. These sensitivity analyses will&#xD;
      consider the following alternative end points of deep SSI: infection by gram-negative&#xD;
      bacteria, infection by gram-positive bacteria, polymicrobial pathogenic infections, culture&#xD;
      negative infections, and cellulitis/skin infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To compare the safety of treatment with a combination of local Vancomycin and&#xD;
      Tobramycin versus Vancomycin powder alone as measured by the proportion of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance in each arm.&#xD;

    <description>Compare the proportion of deep SSIs of the study injury within 365 days of definitive fracture fixation surgery in patients treated with local Vancomycin powder compared to those treated with a combination of local Vancomycin and Tobramycin powders. For this study a &quot;deep SSI&quot; is a SSI that is treated with operative debridement. In the current CDC terminology this would include all deep organ space, deep incisional, and superficial infections that are treated with surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Tibial plateau or tibial pilon fractures that is treated operatively with plate and&#xD;
             screw fixation AND at least one of the following characteristics indicative of higher&#xD;
             risk of infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Initially treated with an external fixation and treated definitively more than 3&#xD;
                  days later after swelling has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any open type I, II, or IIIA fracture, regardless of timing of definitive&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Tibia fracture is associated with ipsilateral leg compartment syndrome and&#xD;
                  fasciotomy wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients ages 18 through 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Study injury is already infected at time of study enrollment.&#xD;

             are unwilling to provide phone and address contact information).&#xD;
&#xD;

             Vancomycin (such as a history of Redman's Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
