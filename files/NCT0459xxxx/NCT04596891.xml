  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this uncontrolled pilot trial is to examine feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      safety, and preliminary efficacy of a new behavioral treatment for survivors of sudden&#xD;
      cardiac arrest with clinically elevated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited among cardiac arrest survivors enrolled in the observational&#xD;
      CANOE research study (CUIMC IRB# AAAR8497). Study participants will be interviewed about&#xD;
      their symptoms and evaluated for baseline assessment before receiving eight weekly sessions&#xD;
      of an acceptance and mindfulness-based exposure therapy (AMBET). Participants will be&#xD;
      additionally evaluated at treatment mid-point (week 4), and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment and all assessments will be conducted remotely via Zoom. To assess whether&#xD;
      patients' physical activity is improved over the course of treatment, participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a wearable device (Fitbit wristband) to monitor their physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop an acceptable protocol for an AMBET&#xD;
      intervention for survivors of sudden cardiac arrest with elevated PTSD symptoms (2) examine&#xD;
      its safety and feasibility in a small sample of 14 patients (3) investigate acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of the assessments and measurements including physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically elevated levels of PTSD symptoms occur in approximately 1 in 3 cardiac arrest&#xD;
      survivors with intact cognitive function and are associated with increased risk for future&#xD;
      cardiac events and mortality. Survivors of acute cardiovascular events are typically&#xD;
      encouraged to monitor for somatic cues of cardiovascular activity that might indicate&#xD;
      recurrent events. However, threat-related attention bias is a common sequela of trauma. In&#xD;
      cardiac patients, this hypervigilant attention to interoceptive cues of danger may serve to&#xD;
      maintain threat perception, as arousal amplifies awareness of internal stimuli. Elevated PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms have also been associated with low adherence to physical activity and medication&#xD;
      regiments in patients with elevated PTSD symptoms after other types of cardiovascular events&#xD;
      in part because they can serve as traumatic reminders. Although several well-studied,&#xD;
      validated treatments for PTSD exist, there is no evidence-based treatment for PTSD in cardiac&#xD;
      arrest survivors. Standard PTSD interventions targeting fear extinction and threat perception&#xD;
      in the context of current safety pose a problem in a population that is living with an actual&#xD;
      ongoing cardiac threat. Thus, the investigators will be developing a de novo protocol for an&#xD;
      Acceptance and Mindfulness-Based Exposure Therapy (AMBET) intervention that targets increased&#xD;
      discriminatory perception through mindful interoceptive attention and adaptive threat&#xD;
      responding. Initial evidence has been published to suggest the safety and potential efficacy&#xD;
      of imaginal exposure in cardiac patients to reduce PTSD symptoms. Among PTSD treatments,&#xD;
      exposure therapy is the most widely recommended. However, the efficacy is moderate, and high&#xD;
      dropout rates are well documented. An innovative line of PTSD therapies can be found among&#xD;
      mindfulness- and acceptance-based treatments. Although large scale RCTs are still limited,&#xD;
      there are promising findings of treatment effects on reduced PTSD symptoms. Reported dropout&#xD;
      rates have been low across treatments, indicating a high degree of treatment acceptability.&#xD;
      The addition of mindfulness components to exposure therapy has been proposed to enhance the&#xD;
      effects of exposure as well as the willingness to engage in them. Of particular interest for&#xD;
      cardiac patients are findings that mindfulness-based approaches have normalized cortisol&#xD;
      levels and reduced inflammatory biomarkers in PTSD patients, as these are physiological&#xD;
      processes that have been implicated in the links between PTSD and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      Several mechanisms have been posited to underlie the efficacy of mindfulness-based approaches&#xD;
      including increased metacognitive awareness of interoceptive sensations and mind-body&#xD;
      connections. Furthermore, and contrary to the associations found between hypervigilant&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness and psychopathology, mindful attention to interoceptive cues has been&#xD;
      linked with adaptive, resilience-enhancing behaviors. The goals of the AMBET treatment will&#xD;
      be to reduce PSTD symptoms and hypervigilance to internal stimuli (i.e., interoceptive bias),&#xD;
      and increase cardiovascular health behaviors (medication adherence, physical activity)&#xD;
      following cardiac arrest. Following psychoeducation about PTSD and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      related health behaviors, participants will be engaged in in-vivo and imaginal exposure&#xD;
      exercises to reduce avoidance responses. Participants will be introduced to acceptance and&#xD;
      mindfulness-based strategies that will be practiced in session and as homework assignments.&#xD;
      Eight 90 minute sessions will be delivered to patients individually on a weekly basis through&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant zoom-hosted video visits. Patient symptoms will be assessed by an independent&#xD;
      evaluator before, at mid-point, and post-treatment. A within-subjects repeated measures&#xD;
      design will be used to assess the feasibility of conducting all aspects of the study&#xD;
      remotely, including recruitment, assessment, and treatment delivery.&#xD;
