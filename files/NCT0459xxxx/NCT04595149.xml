    <textblock>
      The outcome of irresectable oesophaguscancer is poor, despite the fact that curative&#xD;
      treatment with definitive chemoradiation is possible. The outcome of treatment can possibly&#xD;
      be improved by combining chemoradiation with immunotherapy such as bintrafusp alfa, a&#xD;
      combined TGF-β and PD-L1 inhibitor. In this study investigators investigate the feasibility&#xD;
      of combining bintrafusp alfa with definitive chemoradiation in patients with irresectable&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized feasibility study in which patients with esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma receive bintrafusp alfa (B), combined with paclitaxel (P), carboplatin (C), and&#xD;
      radiation (RT). For safety reasons the first ten patients will be treated in a maximum of&#xD;
      four selected hospitals. If no unexpected safety signals occur, the study will start in all&#xD;
      participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 and Carboplatin AUC = 2 will be given by intravenous infusion on days 1,&#xD;
      8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. External beam radiotherapy will be delivered to a total dose of 50.4&#xD;
      Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy, 5 fractions per week, starting the first day of the first cycle&#xD;
      of chemotherapy (see below for details on radiation technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bintrafusp alfa will be given iv every three weeks on day 1, 22, and 43 at a dose of 2400 mg.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Feasibility of this treatment strategy is the main focus of this study. In this study&#xD;
      feasibility is defined as ≥80% of patients completing two cycles (of in total three) cycles&#xD;
      of bintrafusp alpha. In the ART-DECO study, which included a similar patient population, more&#xD;
      than 80% of patients was able to receive five cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel (i.e. up&#xD;
      to week 5) (personal communication dr. Hulshof). Therefore, the investigators will regard&#xD;
      treatment with Bintrafusp alfa during chemoradiation feasible if ≥80% of patients complete&#xD;
      two cycles of bintrafusp alfa, while with a completion rate ≤62% the treatment will be&#xD;
      regarded unfeasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of this feasibility study is the percentage of patients completing&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa treatment. This study requires 41 subjects to decide whether the proportion&#xD;
      completing at least two cycles of bintrafusp alfa, P, is less than or equal to 0.62 or&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 0.80. If the number of patients completing two or more cycles of&#xD;
      Bintrafusp alfa is 31 or more, the hypothesis that P ≤ 0.62 is rejected with a target error&#xD;
      rate of 0.05 and an actual error rate of 0.048. If the number of patients completing two or&#xD;
      more cycles of bintrafusp alfa is 30 or less, the hypothesis that P ≥ 0,80 is rejected with a&#xD;
      target error rate of 0.20 and an actual error rate of 0.182. The test statistic used is the&#xD;
      one-sided one-sample test for binomial proportion, testing against the fixed reference&#xD;
      proportion of 0.62. Taking into account 20% drop-out, 52 patients need to be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Bintrafusp alfa (M7824, MSB0011359C) is an innovative first-in-class, bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the human transforming growth factor β receptor II (TGFβRII or TGFβ Trap) covalently linked via a flexible linker to the C-terminus of each heavy chain of an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody blocking programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1). Bintrafusp alfa is the international nonproprietary name for M7824.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patient with tracheo-esophageal fistula or extension into the mucosal layer of the&#xD;
             trachea, highly at risk to develop fistula. Thus, tumor extension to the trachea is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of pulmonary fibrosis and/or clinically significant impairment of lung&#xD;
             function precluding safe treatment with chemoradiation. In case of doubt about&#xD;
             pulmonary function, a lung function test should be performed and, in case of&#xD;
             abnormalities, discussed with the principle investigator.&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for patients with a history of&#xD;
             autoimmune-related hypothyroidism, insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Patients with&#xD;
             vitiligo with dermatological manifestations only are eligible to enter the study.&#xD;

             prednisone or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An active infection requiring systemic therapy, which has not resolved 3 days (simple&#xD;
             infection such as cystitis) to 7 days (severe infection such as pyelonephritis) prior&#xD;
