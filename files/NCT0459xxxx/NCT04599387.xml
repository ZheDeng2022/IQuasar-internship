      Remote Prescribed and Monitored Exercise Program After Pulmonary Rehabilitation in&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The benefits of exercise during post PR (Pulmonary Rehabilitation) programs in COPD (Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) patients is well established. However, there are numerous&#xD;
      patient's and program factors that influence the benefits gained (e.g. exercise intensity and&#xD;
      frequency, goal setting, non-exercise modalities, compliance, social support and&#xD;
      supervision). The investigators aim to explore the possibility of a real-life program that&#xD;
      will allow the patient the freedom to perform exercise in their own environment. The&#xD;
      BioGradient system allows both goal oriented, supervised exercise prescription, and the&#xD;
      ability to adapt to the patient's schedule and preferences. The system also provides as&#xD;
      needed human involvement for encouragement and supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the primary outcome (the six-minute walk test, see&#xD;
      Outcomes section) will not change significantly in active participants and measures of&#xD;
      quality of life and adherence will be higher than reported in the literature in similar&#xD;
      publications. Moreover, data collected may provide opportunity to explore the factors that&#xD;
      might influence the primary and secondary outcomes, and in particular hospitalizations and&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a patient blinded, randomized control trial, comparing usual care to&#xD;
      goal oriented supervised post PR program. After recruitment the patient will be randomized to&#xD;
      usual care arm or supervised exercise arm. The study duration will be 1 year (per&#xD;
      participant), and the minimal time for each participant to be included in the final analysis&#xD;
      will be 3 months (with at least two outcome measurements). At the end of the study each&#xD;
      patient will be scheduled a short interview with the research coordinator for assessment of&#xD;
      outcome measurements and spirometry testing.&#xD;
