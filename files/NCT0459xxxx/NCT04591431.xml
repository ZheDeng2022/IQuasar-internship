      Personalizing cancer medicine depends on the implementation of personalized diagnostics and&#xD;
      therapeutics. Detailed genomic and gene expression signatures screening are likely to play a&#xD;
      central role in this. Personalized Medicine has been widely depicted as a striking&#xD;
      innovation, that is able to reform the standard approach to disease management, replacing the&#xD;
      one-size-fits-all scheme of medicine with a single-patient-sized medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized medicine promoters usually highlight its potential to combine a more effective&#xD;
      health-care with costs containment, according to the following rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monitoring of disease risks and more effective prevention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  early intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  selection of optimal therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of trial-and-error prescribing and reduction of adverse drug reactions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exclusion of unnecessary drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  therapeutic drug monitoring and disease progression/remission monitoring;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increased patient compliance with therapy. In spite of expectations, many unsolved&#xD;
           practical issues, from technical and scientific to ethical, legal and economic topics,&#xD;
           are slowing down the translation of personalized medicine principles into medical&#xD;
           practice. Furthermore, wide adoption of personalized strategies also has to deal with&#xD;
           the peculiar rules, policy and reimbursement system of each country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of Personalized Medicine in the real world seems entangled by the unmet need to&#xD;
      develop evidence-based guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of personalized medicine in routine clinical practice have firstly emerged in&#xD;
      oncology. The power of precision medicine in the field of anticancer therapy resides in the&#xD;
      possibility to characterize the genomic profile of both the disease (eg somatic mutations in&#xD;
      the tumor tissue or blood sample) and the patient (eg the germinal genomic profile). The&#xD;
      first piece of information allows stratification of patients in responder and non-responder&#xD;
      to specific drugs, improving efficacy and avoiding wasting of expensive medications as&#xD;
      biological drugs. Personalized medicine for cancer can be classified in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  targeted therapy (which bloks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific&#xD;
           molecular targets of cancer cells) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immunotherapy (which use the body'immune system to fight cancer cells by stimulating the&#xD;
           immune system) Targeted therapy belongs to Personalized Medicine approach and the study&#xD;
           of genetic mutations on tumor tissue or blood sample (CTC or cfDNA ) are changing the&#xD;
           scenario of the treatment approach of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, the use of target therapies driven by mutation's assessment has&#xD;
      radically changed the survival of patients affected by breast cancer, NSCLC, melanoma,&#xD;
      colo-rectal cancer, while the clinical application of specific gene expression signatures is&#xD;
      driving the choice of the best adjuvant strategy in early breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the efficacy of such approach its use is restricted to a relatively small fraction of&#xD;
      patients and the evaluation of mutation is conditioned by the primary site of the cancer,&#xD;
      i.e. by the tumor histology. The current biological understanding leads to hypothesize that&#xD;
      the cancer behavior is highly dependent from the underlying driver genetic alterations&#xD;
      independently from the histology. It's widely demonstrated that such molecular alterations&#xD;
      are detected regardless of the histology, and this has already modified the treatment&#xD;
      approach of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the choice of treatment&#xD;
      according to genomic evaluation regardless of its histology with acceptable&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of precision medicine the Immuno-oncology is becoming Precision&#xD;
      Immuno-oncology and the efforts of science are directed towards the identification of&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising biomarkers are Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and the tumour mutational load&#xD;
      (TMB). In particular TMB is a quantitative biomarker that reflects the total number of&#xD;
      mutations carried by tumor cells. TMB is well-known to reflect neoantigens burden potentially&#xD;
      recognized by the immune system. This has been shown to correlate with better anti-PD-1&#xD;
      response in particular for both pembrolizumab and nivolumab combined with ipilimumab .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same findings were demonstrated in the OAK study considering peripheral blood mutational&#xD;
      load and response to atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High tumor mutation burden (defined as tumors that have high ≥10 mutations/megabase, mut/mb)&#xD;
      allows to identify 45% of patients who can benefit from immunotherapy regardless of PD-L1&#xD;
      expression. So, ever keeping in mind that although many evidences are available, the&#xD;
      relationship between histology and genomic alterations is still under definition, as well as&#xD;
      the relationship between the latter and gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present investigation is to combine all of the information available to drive&#xD;
      the therapy selection according to the genomic alteration profile. Therefore, the main&#xD;
      objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of therapy according to genomic profile&#xD;
      (TT - Tailored Treatment) versus Standard of Care (SoC). A molecular profile of the cancer&#xD;
      will be evaluated on tumor tissue biopsy (using the Foundation One (with updated gene panel&#xD;
      324 gene reflecting CDx) at the time of patient inclusion in the trial and on circulating DNA&#xD;
      fragments (i.e. using FoundationOne Liquid test) at the time of patient inclusion in the&#xD;
      trial and at progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, Proof of Concept, clinical trial. Patients&#xD;
      with progressive disease (recurrent and/or metastatic) of breast cancer, metastatic&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal tumors, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or others will be included.&#xD;
      Patients should have completed at least 1 line of treatment and no more than 2 as defined by&#xD;
      the current version of the AIOM guidelines. Patients are included if surgery is&#xD;
      contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients could have received targeted therapy for metastatic disease. A molecular profile of&#xD;
      the cancer will be evaluated on tumor tissue biopsy and on ctDNA of around 1280 patients at&#xD;
      patient inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After FO evaluations patients with actionable mutations, not previous identified with other&#xD;
      methods, for which approved drugs according to histotype are available, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once identified molecular abnormalities (not only those that are disease-specific), that can&#xD;
      be modulated with target or immunotherapeutic intervention available within the present&#xD;
      study, patients will be randomized to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Therapy at choice of physician, according to Standard of Care (SoC) ARM B: Tailored&#xD;
      treatment according to genomic profile (Tailored Treatment, TT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) will define the target therapy and immunotherapy while&#xD;
      standard treatment will be decided by study physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should remain in the treatment phase of the study until investigator assesses&#xD;
      radiographic or clinical progressive disease, unmanageable toxicity, or study termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be conducted every 12 weeks from the date of randomization until any&#xD;
      of the above events occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delays in treatment administration will not impact the timing of the tumor assessments. If a&#xD;
      tumor assessment must be performed early/late, subsequent assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      according to the original schedule of every 12 weeks from the date of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the first progression of disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood sample will be collected to evaluate the molecular profile of the cancer on&#xD;
           circulating DNA fragments (i.e. using FoundationOne Liquid test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatment (SoC or TT) will be interrupted waiting for the evaluations for the&#xD;
           Rescue/Switched Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments must be conducted until progressive disease (PD for RECIST 1.1 or iCPD for&#xD;
      iRECIST if clinically indicated), even if treatment has been discontinued due to&#xD;
      investigator-determined PD or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discontinuation of study treatment for reason different from progressive disease and&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, tumor assessments will continue until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will be followed for survival until death, loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or study termination.&#xD;
