  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial focusing on the effect of different tracheal tube cuff&#xD;
      shape; the tapered-shaped tracheal tube cuff versus the cylindrical-shaped tracheal cuff in&#xD;
      anterior cervical spine surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High endotracheal cuff pressure (ETCP) during surgical retractor splay associates with&#xD;
      recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis/ palsy and results in post-anterior cervical spine surgery&#xD;
      (post-ACSS) dysphonia. Control of intraoperative ETCP during ACSS may benefit voice outcome.&#xD;
      The taper-shaped tracheal tube cuff was originally designed as a new strategy to reduce fluid&#xD;
      leakage across the conventional cylindrical cuff and prevention of ventilator associated&#xD;
      pneumonia. Literature has revealed the just seal pressure for the tapered-shaped tracheal&#xD;
      tube (TT) cuff was lower than conventional cylindrical cuff. Therefore the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that use of a tapered-shaped ET cuff during the surgery can lead to a lower ETCP&#xD;
      during retractors splay and improve voice recovery after ACSS. In this study, 80 patients&#xD;
      were randomized into 2 groups, to receive endotracheal intubation using TaperGuard tracheal&#xD;
      tube (tapered- shaped cuff) or a conventional tracheal tube (a cylindrical cuff). The just&#xD;
      seal pressure, intraoperative cuff pressure, and postoperative sore throat and voice outcome&#xD;
      are recorded and compared.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The patient will be intubated by an anesthesiologist who is aware of the grouping. After tracheal intubation is finished, the cuff is connected to the pressure monitor system and another blinded assessor will adjust and record the minimal volume that is required for sealing the tracheal tube-ventilator. The cuff pressure will be monitored and recorded all throughout the surgical period. A blinded assessor will follow up the patient after the surgery and do the voice analysis. Patients are unaware of the type of tracheal tube they used and will score subjectively for the sore throat and postoperative dysphonia.</masking_description>
