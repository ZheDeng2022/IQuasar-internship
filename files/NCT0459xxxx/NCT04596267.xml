  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial that will test&#xD;
      the effect of pitolisant on alcohol self-administration and craving following a priming dose&#xD;
      of alcohol. The specific objective of this proposal is to determine whether pitolisant has&#xD;
      effects on alcohol consumption and craving&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal is intended to answer the call for accelerating drug development by&#xD;
      exploring the potential of a novel anticonvulsant, Pitolisant as a candidate medication for&#xD;
      the treatment of AUD. Pitolisant is an H-3 receptor inverse agonist that is FDA-approved for&#xD;
      treating narcolepsy which has been found to have effects of on alcohol craving and&#xD;
      consumption in preclinical studies. The aims of this study are to test the effects of&#xD;
      Pitolisant on alcohol self-administration and craving among a sample of non-treatment seeking&#xD;
      heavy drinkers. The effects of 5-days of pitolisant (8.9mg) or placebo will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      human laboratory using an alcohol self-administration methodology. In this within-subjects&#xD;
      crossover design, heavy drinkers (N=28) will be randomized to the order of exposure&#xD;
      (Pitolisant or placebo) prior to completing two alcohol self-administration trials. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive a priming drink of alcohol and will have access to 8 alcoholic drinks over a&#xD;
      2-hour period. The investigators anticipate that subjects will consume less alcohol during an&#xD;
      alcohol self-administration trial when receiving Pitolisant compared to when they are&#xD;
      receiving placebo. Significant Pitolisant-induced reductions in the quantity of alcohol&#xD;
      self-administered will be considered to be an indication that this drug may have value as an&#xD;
      AUD medication. This study may provide a rationale for phase II clinical studies testing&#xD;
      Pitolisant with a treatment-seeking AUD population.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>2.6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol consumption will be measured by using a graduated cylinder to determine the amount of alcohol given to the subject that was not consumed. This outcome will be measured as standard drink units. A standard drink contains approximately 0.6 fluid ounces of pure alcohol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>2.6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol craving will be measured by self report with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a straight line with one end meaning no alcohol craving and the other end meaning intense alcohol craving. The Participant marks a point on the line that matches their amount of alcohol craving.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Urge</measure>
    <time_frame>2.6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol Urge questionnaire (AUQ) is an 8 item measure of self-reported urges to drink in human laboratory studies that assesses the participant's urge for an alcoholic drink at the time the questionnaire is completed, Questions are in the form of a 7-point Likert scale (from strongly disagree to strongly disagree) and participants select the extent to which they disagree or agree with the 8 statements relating to desire to drink, expectation of a desired outcome from drinking, and inability to avoid drinking if alcohol was available. Lower scores are associated with less urge for an alcoholic drink.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol-induced stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>2.6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Whether pitolisant increases the stimulant effects of a priming drink of alcohol will be assessed using the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES). It is a self-report, unipolar adjective rating scale that is designed to measure both stimulant and sedative effects of alcohol. It consists of fourteen items, that comprise two subscales (stimulant and sedative). Items are rated on a eleven-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The stimulant subscale can range from 0 to 70 and the sedative scale can rage from 0 to 50. Higher scores are associated with more stimulant and sedative effects, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol craving during 4-day drug exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to assess alcohol craving during the medication exposure period. The VAS is a 10 cm straight line with one end meaning no alcohol craving and the other end meaning intense alcohol craving. Higher scores are associated with more cravings.</description>
