      Haemophilia is an X-linked hereditary sex recessive disorder that impairs the body's ability&#xD;
      to make blood clots. It includes two types: A (FVIII deficit factor) and B (IX deficit&#xD;
      factor), depending on FVIII/FIX percentage in blood. The severity of haemophilia is&#xD;
      classified into (severe: &lt;1%, moderate: 1-5%, and mild: &gt;5%). The prevalence of haemophilia A&#xD;
      is 1: 5000 live births and haemophilia B is 1: 30000 live births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This disease is characterized by hemarthrosis which is a hemorrhage in the locomotor system,&#xD;
      mainly muscles and joints. Joint bleeding mainly occurs in knees, ankles and elbows.&#xD;
      Haemorrhage in the muscle or joints accounts for 80% to 90% of all bleeding episodes in&#xD;
      people with haemophilia. The most commonly affected joints in non-prophylaxis patients are&#xD;
      the knees (45%) which is thought to be due to the large size of the synovial membrane and&#xD;
      large rotational forces present. It is followed by the elbows (30%), ankles (15%), shoulders&#xD;
      (3%), and wrists (2%). Bleeds are best detected by the patients themselves as bruising and&#xD;
      swelling or described as a feeling of warmth or tingling within the joint preceding the&#xD;
      clinical signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) has been reported to be effective in reducing pain,&#xD;
      healing of ulcers and promote bone healing, and treating osteoarthritis and inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases of the musculoskeletal system. Also, it was reported that PEMF exposure&#xD;
      significantly increases the anti-inflammatory effect, suggesting its potential therapeutic&#xD;
      use in the treatment of inflammatory bone and joint disorders.&#xD;
