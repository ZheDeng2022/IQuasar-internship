  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Hypidone Hydrochloride&#xD;
      by multiple doses in 36 healthy male and female subjects who are of 18 to 55 years old.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose, single center study.&#xD;
      36 male and female healthy subjects will be enrolled in this study. Within 14 days prior to&#xD;
      study drug administration, subjects will be screened based on the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The study will be performed in 3 groups of 12 subjects each. In each group of 12&#xD;
      subjects, 10 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive Hypidone Hydrochloride and 2&#xD;
      subjects to receive matching placebo.&#xD;
