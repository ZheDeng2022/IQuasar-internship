    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is being conducted to investigate the practicalities and potential&#xD;
      benefits of equipping patients with wearable monitoring devices.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vital signs are important indicators used in healthcare to inform a patient's treatment&#xD;
      options and care plan. However, the opportunity to monitor vital signs is largely limited to&#xD;
      the time a patient spends at a healthcare providers premises. This study is being conducted&#xD;
      to see if the use of small wearable monitoring devices could help deliver a better service&#xD;
      and improve patient care by continuing to monitor patients remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is observational and has been designed to address two key questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is it possible in principle to use the information captured from the devices to improve&#xD;
           the treatment of the patient?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How practical is it to implement remote patient monitoring (RPM)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these questions, consenting patients will be asked to wear a small adhesive&#xD;
      biosensor for a short period of time following discharge from hospital (either as an&#xD;
      outpatient or inpatient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data gathered by the device will be examined retrospectively and patients will not be&#xD;
      monitored in real-time. Following the monitoring period, the vital signs data captured by the&#xD;
      device will be analysed to see if it correlates with any unscheduled healthcare needs (such&#xD;
      as unplanned GP appointments or emergency hospital visits). Specifically, the study team will&#xD;
      be investigating whether the monitoring could have picked up a nascent problem before it&#xD;
      became more serious, or whether monitoring could have saved the patient from having to make a&#xD;
      trip to see their GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding the practicalities of implementing RPM will be captured by monitoring&#xD;
      compliance and through an exit interview with participating patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is able to comply with the English instructions for using a wearable&#xD;
             device (e.g, follow simple instructions, able to answer the telephone, able to answer&#xD;
             symptom questions, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant may have been recently discharged from a hospital care setting&#xD;
             (including emergency departments, ward and acute assessment units) to home (including&#xD;
             a relative's home) or be currently admitted to a hospital care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a recent medical history that suggests there is a risk their&#xD;
             health may deteriorate at home. In the first instance we will focus upon patients with&#xD;
             at least one of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart Failure (the patient being discharged),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arrhythmia (e.g. patient on the waitlist for a pacemaker)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will also consider patients with other conditions that present a risk of&#xD;
             deterioration at home, for example: COPD, stable angina, liver failure, minor trauma,&#xD;
             chronic kidney disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer ( e.g. recent surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that are clinically unstable (eg: respiratory distress, ongoing angina&#xD;
             pectoris, sepsis, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aphasia or other conditions that prevents the patient from adequately communicating&#xD;
             with the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Terminal diagnosis with life expectancy &lt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing renal dialysis, or other treatment that prevents the patient from being at&#xD;
             home for extended periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia or uncontrolled psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe dermatitis or another skin disorder that prevents the patient from wearing a&#xD;
             patch.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a pacemaker or ICD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other inability, or unwillingness, to adequately co-operate with the RPM-team.&#xD;
