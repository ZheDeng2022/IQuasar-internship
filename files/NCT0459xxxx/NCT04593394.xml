  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first part will be a comparative cross-sectional study to identify the frequency of ILO&#xD;
      and other comorbidites among participants with asthma compared to a group of reference&#xD;
      subjects without asthma, matched for age- and gender and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part will be a longitudinally observational study study following the patients&#xD;
      with asthma for one year after the cross-sectional study. The Maat-scores ILO-symptoms and&#xD;
      asthma-outcomes longitudinally will be evaluated, .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) is characterized by inappropriate closure of the&#xD;
      structures of the larynx causing reduced airflow. The symptoms are breathing difficulties&#xD;
      that resemble those seen in asthmatic patients, such as dyspnea, coughing and stridor. ILO&#xD;
      may be diagnosed by the continuous laryngoscopy during exercise test (CLE-test), where the&#xD;
      larynx is visualized live on video as the patient runs to exhaustion on a treadmill whilst&#xD;
      having a laryngoscope placed through the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of ILO in asthmatic patients will be assesed by preforming a CLE-test at start&#xD;
      and after one year. Participant will be given visual feedback and instructed in breathing&#xD;
      techniques. Others common comorbidities will be assessed by questionnaires and clinical&#xD;
      interview. Respiratory polygraph recording will be done in participants with STOP-BANG score&#xD;
      &gt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in ILO-symptoms and asthma-symptoms and outcomes will be assessed after 1 year.&#xD;
