      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STDG3 is an inherited eye disease. Currently there is no treatment for STDG3. Past studies of&#xD;
      STDG3 have largely looked at members of large families at a single time point. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about the disease at an individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the natural history of changes in the retina that occur in people with STDG3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 10 and older with STDG3 due to a variant in the ELOVL4 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 5 visits. First they will have a screening visit. Then they will have&#xD;
      a visit 6 months later. Then they will have a visit 1, 2, and 3 years after the first visit.&#xD;
      Visits will last 4 to 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete eye exam. Participants' eye pressure and ability to see letters on a vision chart&#xD;
      will be tested. Their pupils will be dilated with eye drops. Pictures will be taken of the&#xD;
      retina and the inside of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about participants' family history, especially the presence of eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual field test. Participants will be seated in front of a large dome and asked to press a&#xD;
      button when they see a light within the dome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroretinogram. Participants will sit in the dark with their eyes patched for 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Then they will wear special contact lenses and watch flashing lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography. Cross-sectional pictures will be taken of participants'&#xD;
      retinas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus autofluorescence. Blue light will be shone into participants eyes to assess the health&#xD;
      of the retina....&#xD;

      Title: An Observational Prospective Natural History Study of Stargardt-like Macular Dystrophy&#xD;
      (STDG3) Secondary to Mutations in ELOVL4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: Potential therapeutics for Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STDG3) have&#xD;
      been proposed. Cross-sectional studies of large families suggest progressive macular atrophy&#xD;
      in STDG3 but there is a paucity of longitudinal data for these patients. The overall goal is&#xD;
      to establish a natural history study of STDG3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in retinal structure&#xD;
      in STDG3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in retinal function in STDG3&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in functional vision and the&#xD;
      participant s perceived effect on activities of daily living (e.g., mobility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: The primary endpoints are: A) the growth rate of the square root area of loss of&#xD;
      the inner segment/outer segment band (EZband) obtained from spectral-domain optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (SD-OCT) and B) the rate of atrophy enlargement obtained from fundus&#xD;
      autofluorescence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are: A) the change in BCVA total letters read from baseline to Year 3&#xD;
      and B) the rate of loss of retinal sensitivity measured with perimetry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 25 patients with Stargardt-like macular dystrophy 3 who are &gt;= 10&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Patients will be seen in the&#xD;
      Ophthalmic Genetics Clinic at the National Eye Institute within the NIH Clinical Center in&#xD;
      Bethesda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 84 months (7 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: 36 months (3 years).&#xD;
