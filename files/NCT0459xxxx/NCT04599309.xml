    <textblock>
      This research study will include patients with high risk locally advanced head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx and&#xD;
      patients that are starting on standard definitive treatment. Patients with both stage III HPV&#xD;
      positive and stage III HPV negative will be included. In this study, we aim to evaluate&#xD;
      feasibility of ctDNA and/or HPV DNA detection in real time in high-risk LA-HNSCC.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Targeted gene sequencing results, along with limited clinical information that does not identify the patient as an individual, such as age, partial date of birth (year, month), gender, cancer type, and pathology information related to the samples tested, and survival time may be shared with collaborating researchers.&#xD;
Data from this study can be shared through two types of databases: open-access or controlled-access. An open-access database is publicly accessible and contains limited clinical information and analyses of samples. A controlled-access database contains more detailed clinical information, such as relevant past medical history and the results of prior and ongoing cancer treatments, and analyses of samples, but is only accessible to researchers who sign agreements defining how data may be used. All data will be stripped of all personal identifying information.</ipd_description>
