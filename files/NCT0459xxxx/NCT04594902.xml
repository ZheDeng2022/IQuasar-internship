    <textblock>
      The PANTHERS (Parents And iNfants Together in Home-based Early Remote Services) Projects is a&#xD;
      study funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and maintenance of a remote home-based preventive intervention, the Infant Behavior&#xD;
      Program (IBP), to decrease behavior problems in infants from high-risk families. All families&#xD;
      will participate in five remote evaluations in their home, and families will also receive 6&#xD;
      remote treatment sessions of either the IBP or the EPPC. All participant procedures will be&#xD;
      conducted remotely.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research Design: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and maintenance of a remote&#xD;
      home-based preventive intervention, the Infant Behavior Program (IBP), to decrease behavior&#xD;
      problems in infants from high-risk families. Specifically, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate its efficacy and maintenance in reducing&#xD;
      behavior problems and increasing infant regulation relative to an enhanced pediatric primary&#xD;
      care (EPPC) active control condition. Assessments will occur at pre (week 0)- and post (week&#xD;
      8)-intervention assessments (approximately 2 months apart), as well as at 4-month (week 24) ,&#xD;
      8 -month (week 40), and 12-month (week 56) follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Families will be primarily recruited from pediatric primary care centers and will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive six sessions of either IBP or EPPC in their home. Families also will&#xD;
      participate in five remote home-based assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits: Families may experience risk from a breach in confidentiality as&#xD;
      participants reveal sensitive information and there are risks in breach of confidentiality&#xD;
      due to videoconferencing methods, in particular if study staff become aware of abuse or&#xD;
      neglect situations. Families may experience discomfort when answering personal questions.&#xD;
      Benefits to families could include providing families with information that can assist in&#xD;
      caring for their child, and instilling new parenting strategies that are designed to outlast&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge: This study will provide information about the efficacy of a remote home-based&#xD;
      preventive intervention to improve infant behavior and regulation.&#xD;

    <measure>Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from week 0 to weeks 8, 24, 40, and 56</time_frame>
    <description>The ITSEA is a 166-item parent-report measure of the frequency of specific behaviors (e.g., temper tantrums) in 12- to 36-month-olds. Participants will score their child behavior on a scale of 0-2 (0 Not true/Rarely, 2 Somewhat True/Sometimes and 3 Very True/Often). The higher the score, the higher the child is on behavior problems. The Externalizing scale will be an indicator of infant behavior. The higher the score the higher child's behavior problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Second Edition (WASI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screen</time_frame>
    <description>The WASI will be used at screening to ensure ability to learn the skills. The vocabulary and matrix reasoning subtests will be administered, and primary caregivers will be required to receive an estimated IQ score ≥ 70 on the two-subtest version of the WASI-II. The higher the score the higher IQ.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screen</time_frame>
    <description>The BITSEA will be used at screening as inclusion criteria. The 31-item Problem scale will be used to screen infants for the inclusion criterion (≥ 75th percentile) because it has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting current and predicting subsequent elevated externalizing problems. The higher the score the higher the child's behavior problem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Third Edition (ASQ-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Assess for developmental delay in children ages three months to five years. It is a 30-item parent-rating scale used to assess for developmental delay in children ages three months to five years. The ASQ-III has high test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, and concurrent validity134 and will be used as a baseline measure of the infant's developmental functioning. We will administer every scale- communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, personal-social. Families respond to various milestones prompts on a scale of Yes, Sometimes, Not Yet. The higher the score the the higher the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-IV (DPICS-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from weeks 0 to week 8, 24, 40, and 56</time_frame>
    <description>The Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-4th Ed (DPICS-IV; Eyberg et al., 2013) is a structured behavioral observation coding system assessing caregiver-child interactions. Observed parenting behaviors will be coded during a 5-min child-led play and combined into two categories of positive (praises, behavior descriptions, and reflections) and negative (questions, commands, and negative talk) verbalizations, reflecting behaviors caregivers are taught to use and avoid in PCIT. Additionally, child compliance will be assessed and coded for during a 5-min caregiver-led play and 5-min clean up situation which will be adapted to meet the infant's developmental level (e.g., toy bucket in close proximity to infant). The higher the score the higher the parenting behavior and child compliance.</description>

    <description>The ECBQ is a 36-item parent questionnaire of temperament. The effortful control scale will be used as the behavioral indicator of infant regulation. Participants will respond to various child behavior prompts using the 1-7 scale: 1- never, 2-very rarely, 3- less than half the time, 4- about half the time, 5- more than half the time, 6- almost always, 7- always. The higher the score the higher the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (Lab-TAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from weeks 0 to week 8, 24, 40, and 56</time_frame>
    <description>The Lab-TAB is a standardized observation to assess early regulation. We will include an episode to elicit mild frustration that will involve the infant playing with a desired toy for 30 seconds, and then the parent will remove the toy from the infant and place the toy in a clear box that the child cannot open for 1 minute (repeated twice). Episodes will be videotaped and coded for infant emotional reactivity (latency to distress in seconds), lability (range from 0 = unstable to 4 = stable), and regulation (range from 0 = dysregulated to 4 = well-regulated). The higher the child distress the higher the outcome.</description>
