  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT),&#xD;
      precise X-ray treatment, is best given in five treatments (also called fractions) over 10&#xD;
      days or in two treatments over 8 days. SBRT is an accurate way to deliver a high dose of&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the prostate in a smaller number of doses. We have considerable experience&#xD;
      with 5-dose SBRT and now wish to examine the feasibility and safety of delivering treatment&#xD;
      over two, larger, doses. Previous work has shown it is theoretically possible to deliver two&#xD;
      fraction SBRT on the MR-linac and previous studies have shown internal radiotherapy&#xD;
      (brachytherapy) administered in two fractions to be a safe option for patients with low-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment within this trial will be delivered on a new, state of the art, radiotherapy&#xD;
      machine called an MR-linac (Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator). It puts together an MRI&#xD;
      scanner with a radiotherapy treatment machine called a Linear Accelerator. The use of the&#xD;
      MR-linac means there is no extra radiation dose given when taking images (unlike computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans or X-ray), enabling us to adapt the radiotherapy plan each day if&#xD;
      needed to more precisely target the prostate. The results of the study will enable us to find&#xD;
      out if the new, shorter treatment (2 doses of radiotherapy), has a similar level of side&#xD;
      effects as the 5 dose treatment and is suitable for further study.&#xD;

    <description>Combined data from the IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), EPIC-26 (Expanded Prostate Index Composite-26), EQ-5D (EuroQol-5D) and IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) QOL instruments will be summarised. Domain scores from the quality of life patient-reported outcome tools will be derived using standard algorithms with missing data handled accordingly. Domain scores and individual items from the patient questionnaires will be presented graphically at each time point and summarised using descriptive statistics, separately for each treatment group. Changes from baseline will be assessed within treatment groups, and multiple regression models (e.g. ANCOVA, ordinal logistic regression or longitudinal models) will investigate patient and clinical factors that may be associated with change in patient-reported outcomes.</description>
