  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide the first rigorous integrative test of the hypothesis that rapid&#xD;
      rises in estradiol (a female hormone) increase the rewarding and disinhibiting effects of&#xD;
      alcohol and that such increased sensitivity correlates with increased alcohol use.&#xD;
      Identification of the behavioral mechanisms by which estradiol surges can increase alcohol&#xD;
      use would provide a critical advancement of neurobiological theory of alcohol abuse in women,&#xD;
      an understudied area, as well as provide new directions for personalization of alcohol abuse&#xD;
      treatment in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, naturally-cycling women will be examined daily over their menstrual cycle&#xD;
      using an integrative combination of daily ecological assessments of hormone fluctuations and&#xD;
      alcohol use along with strategically-timed laboratory tests of their acute sensitivity to the&#xD;
      rewarding and disinhibiting effects of a controlled dose of alcohol.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Placebo</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will attend two identical laboratory sessions to test sensitivity to the rewarding and disinhibiting effects of a controlled dose of alcohol, once during the early follicular phase and once during the late follicular phase. The test battery consists of measures of rewarding effects and alcohol (or placebo) effects on disinhibition and impulsive choice. The placebo consists of 300 ml of lemon-flavored soda with a small amount (3 ml) of alcohol floated on top.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend two identical laboratory sessions to test sensitivity to the rewarding and disinhibiting effects of a controlled dose of alcohol, once during the early follicular phase and once during the late follicular phase. The test battery consists of measures of rewarding effects and alcohol effects on disinhibition and impulsive choice. The alcohol dose consists of 0.60 g/kg absolute alcohol that produces a peak blood-alcohol concentration of 80 mg/dl. Doses will be mixed with a carbonated, non-caffeinated, lemon-flavored soda and consumed within 10 minutes.</description>
