  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, crossover study of Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection for&#xD;
      PET-MPI in subjects referred for evaluation of known coronary artery disease (CAD) or for&#xD;
      suspected CAD with intermediate to high pre-test probability (PTP). The objective is to&#xD;
      assess the difference and variability between 2 sets of rest images synthesized by the same&#xD;
      or 2 different manufacturing processes. Twenty-eight evaluable subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study and will undergo 2 Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection PET-MPI at rest. Each subject will&#xD;
      attend a Screening Visit at least 2 days and up to 14 days prior to the first Flurpiridaz&#xD;
      (18F) Injection PET-MPI. The subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to 4 possible sequences of&#xD;
      receiving 2 doses of Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection: 2 groups of 7 subjects will receive 2&#xD;
      Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection doses synthesized by the same manufacturing processes (either&#xD;
      HPLC or SPE) and 2 groups of 7 subjects will receive 2 Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection doses&#xD;
      synthesized by different manufacturing processes (1 dose by HPLC followed by 1 dose by SPE or&#xD;
      1 dose by SPE followed by 1 dose by HPLC). All subjects will be followed up by telephone for&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) at 24 (+8) hours following each Flurpiridaz (18F)&#xD;
      Injection administration.&#xD;
