      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of double antibiotic paste when&#xD;
      compared to Ca (OH)2, in terms of RANKL and OPG levels in chronic periapical lesions and&#xD;
      correlate the results with periapical bone healing findings after a follow up period of one&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Apical periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that occurs as a consequence of the bacterial&#xD;
      infection of dental pulp tissue. It represents an inflammatory/immune pathogenesis affecting&#xD;
      the periapical tissue including the surrounding bone. This periapical process is primarily&#xD;
      initiated by bacterial infection in the necrotic pulp. Its persistence, progression to&#xD;
      chronic lesions and destruction of bone structures are a consequence of the inability of&#xD;
      host-defense mechanisms to eradicate infection. Periapical lesions are characterized&#xD;
      histologically by fibrous and granulated tissue, infiltrated by different inflammatory cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now the diagnosis and follow-up of asymptomatic apical periodontitis AAP is based on a&#xD;
      clinical radiographic evaluation, however, this reflects the accumulated damage from previous&#xD;
      episodes of periodontal tissue destruction. Moreover, the clinical presentation does not&#xD;
      reflect the underlying inflammatory response. In accordance, differences in disease severity&#xD;
      involve qualitatively and quantitatively different inflammatory responses. Nowadays, the&#xD;
      challenge focuses on the necessity of designing innovative non-invasive chair-side&#xD;
      point-of-care assessment methods, accounting for the biological profile as a complement to&#xD;
      the existing clinical-radiographic assessment to contribute to the early evaluation of&#xD;
      treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for conducting the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When dental pulp is infected or inflamed, various inflammatory mediators, including&#xD;
      cytokines, chemokines, and neuropeptides, are released by innate and adaptive immune cells.&#xD;
      During the development of pulp inflammation, inflammatory mediators result in the formation&#xD;
      of apical osteolytic lesions. Bone loss is mainly caused by activated osteoclasts. Various&#xD;
      cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-11, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)&#xD;
      stimulate osteoclast progenitor cell differentiation and activation by the osteoprotegerin&#xD;
      (OPG)/nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)/nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular mechanisms underlying bone resorption are regulated by the interaction between&#xD;
      RANKL and OPG.The interaction between RANKL and RANK is necessary for the differentiation and&#xD;
      activation of osteoclasts. This is modulated by OPG, which, in turn, suppresses osteoclast&#xD;
      differentiation by preventing the interaction between RANKL and RANK.The production of OPG&#xD;
      and RANKL by different cell types is regulated by local and systemic stimuli, including&#xD;
      bacterial products, hormones, and inflammatory mediators.Changes in the balance of the&#xD;
      mediators determine the progression and severity of bone diseases such as those found in&#xD;
      periapical and periodontal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that antibiotics regulate the immune response through modulation of&#xD;
      cytokines production. Therefore, the level of cytokines, RANKL, and OPG can also be affected&#xD;
      by antibiotics. In the infected root canal system, virulence products, antigens, and&#xD;
      microbial cells are the main causes of apical periodontitis. Microorganisms in the root canal&#xD;
      system adhere to root canal walls, isthmuses, ledges and commonly formed biofilm&#xD;
      communities.The application of antimicrobial intra-canal medication is recommended to&#xD;
      eliminate bacteria that could not be removed from the root canal system after instrumentation&#xD;
      and irrigation of the root canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium hydroxide (Ca (OH)2) is generally preferred in endodontics as an intracanal&#xD;
      medicament because of its antimicrobial and biological effects. Because of its solubility, Ca&#xD;
      (OH)2 releases calcium and hydroxyl ions slowly providing an alkaline environment in the&#xD;
      periapical region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been only a single in vivo study performed to evaluate the effect of Ca (OH)2&#xD;
      combined with ciprofloxacin or ibuprofen on the release of RANKL/OPG in periapical lesions.&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of double antibiotic paste when&#xD;
      compared to Ca (OH)2, in terms of RANKL and OPG levels in chronic periapical lesions and&#xD;
      correlate the results with periapical bone healing findings after a follow up period of one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
