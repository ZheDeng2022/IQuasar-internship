      The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence, describe the types and risk factors of&#xD;
      congenital anomalies among newborns admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Assiut&#xD;
      University Children Hospital (AUCH). It is a prospective and a case control study was&#xD;
      performed and screening of the newborn admitted at NICU of Assiut University Children&#xD;
      Hospital during the period of 6 months from 1-12-2017 to the end of 5-2018 the sample was 346&#xD;
      newborns, 173 cases and 173 control. Data were collected using a record checklist and an&#xD;
      interviewing questionnaire. Conclusion: The prevalence of congenital anomalies was 22.97%.&#xD;
      The most common anomalies were gastrointestinal anomalies (GIT), musculoskeletal anomalies,&#xD;
      multiple anomalies and circulatory system anomalies. The risk factors were consanguineous&#xD;
      marriage, positive family history, urban areas, full-term and singleton pregnancies.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence, describe the types and risk factors of&#xD;
      congenital anomalies among newborns admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Study&#xD;
      design: This is a prospective case control study was carried out in the neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care unit. It is a tertiary care center. The center provides multi-specialist care and serves&#xD;
      as a major referral center for hospitals within and outside the city. The study was done&#xD;
      during the period of 6 months from December 2017 to May 2018. Patients: All the babies&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital with congenital anomalies during this period were included. All&#xD;
      stillbirths were excluded from this study. The sample was 346 newborns, 173 cases and 173&#xD;
      control. For each case, a detailed perinatal and maternal and family history were obtained by&#xD;
      interviewing questionnaire. Diagnosis of congenital anomalies was based on clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of newborn babies by the neonatologist and other appropriate investigations such&#xD;
      as radiography, ultrasonography, echocardiography and chromosomal analysis etc...&#xD;
      Classification of anomalies is done by systems according to WHO international classification&#xD;
      of diseases (ICD10) [10]. Data was entered into excel data sheet and appropriate statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed. The prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of CA during the&#xD;
      6 months (173) by the total number of admission during this period (753). Statistical&#xD;
      analysis: Data were analyzed using (SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0, NY).&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis of the whole sample; where data were expressed as mean values and&#xD;
      standard deviations for quantitative variables, and numbers and frequencies for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. Bivariate analysis was performed to assess associations between various&#xD;
      independent variables and the dependent variable (presence of congenital anomalies),&#xD;
      chi-square was used to compare the difference in distribution of frequencies among different&#xD;
      groups and if number inside the cell was small we used Fisher's Exact Test. Independent&#xD;
      sample T-test was used to compare the difference in means among different groups. A&#xD;
      significant p value was considered when it less than or equal 0.05.&#xD;
