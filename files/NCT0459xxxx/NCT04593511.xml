      The purpose of this study is to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      Four Formulations of LY03009 in Healthy Volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of four formulations of LY03009 (F1, F2, F3, F4) after a single&#xD;
      intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40 healthy subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study and assigned to&#xD;
      four cohorts (F1, F2, F3, F4) sequentially, 10 subjects per group at a fixed dose of 112 mg&#xD;
      for F1~F3 and 224 mg for F4. Each subject will receive only one dose in this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria：&#xD;
&#xD;
        To participate in the study, subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and capable of giving signed written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, 18-65 years of age (inclusive) at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index (BMI, weight [kg]/height [m]2) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The screening results within the normal range or outside the normal range but assessed&#xD;
             as clinically non-significant by the Investigator based on detailed medical history,&#xD;
             clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG; QTcF&#xD;
             ≤450 msec for male subjects, and QTcF ≤470 msec for female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Males who are willing to remain abstinent; or if engaging in sexual intercourse with a&#xD;
             female partner of childbearing potential, willing to use a condom in addition to&#xD;
             having the female partner use a highly effective method of contraception throughout&#xD;
             the study and until at least 3 months after the end of the study. This requirement&#xD;
             does not apply to subjects in a same sex relationship or subjects with female partners&#xD;
             of non-childbearing potential. Male subjects must also be willing to not donate sperm&#xD;
             throughout the study and until at least 3 months after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria：&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. With history of history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,&#xD;
             endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, neurologic, bronchopulmonary,&#xD;
             immunologic, and/or lipid metabolism disorders, and/or drug hypersensitivity, or any&#xD;
             other condition that, in the opinion of the PI, would jeopardize the safety of the&#xD;
             subject, affect the validity of the study results, or impair the ability to provide&#xD;
             informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hospital admission or major surgery within 3 months prior to screening, or plan to&#xD;
             have surgery before the completion of study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of another investigational product within 1 month or 5 half-lives of the other&#xD;
             investigational product, whichever is longer, before study drug administration in this&#xD;
             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Unwillingness or inability to comply with food and beverage restrictions during study&#xD;
             participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a history of significant drug sensitivity or drug allergy, or known&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to the study drugs, the metabolite or formulation excipients;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Malignancy within 5 years of screening visit (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and&#xD;
             cervical carcinoma in situ that has been completely resected);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject who is considered unsuitable for participating in the study in the opinion of&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recent administration of live vaccine within 3 months prior to dosing and until at&#xD;
             least 30 days after the completion of the study.&#xD;
