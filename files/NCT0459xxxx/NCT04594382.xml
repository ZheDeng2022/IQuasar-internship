      The study will be designed to investigate the effect of pupillometry guided compared to&#xD;
      non-PPI-guided postoperative pain therapy, conducted immediately at the end of surgery before&#xD;
      extubation, on total postoperative opioid consumption during the first 2 postoperative hours&#xD;
      after elective ear nose throat (ENT) surgery.&#xD;

      Pupillometric pain measurements helps clinicians determine and administer the optimized&#xD;
      amount of opioids and so avoids opioid-induced side effects.The study will be designed to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of pupillometry guided compared to non-PPI-guided postoperative pain&#xD;
      therapy, conducted before extubation, on total postoperative opioid consumption during the&#xD;
      first 2 postoperative hours after elective ENT surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The evaluation of pain intensity during the immediate postoperative period in the&#xD;
      operating room (OR) is a key factor for post interventional pain treatment. However, this&#xD;
      evaluation may be difficult when patients are still intubated, restricted in consciousness or&#xD;
      are showing verbal impairment due to ENT surgery. Verbally impaired patients are at increased&#xD;
      risk of under treatment for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With rising opioid consumption, the risk of postoperative side effects like nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, sedation with a longer recovery time or respiratory depression increases.&#xD;
      Especially in the cohort of ENT surgery patients, where a difficult airway is regularly&#xD;
      presented, such side effects should be avoided. A means of predicting immediate postoperative&#xD;
      pain after surgery and the response to opiate analgesics would therefore be highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pupillary dilatation reflex (PDR), measured by pupillometry, has been successfully used&#xD;
      to assess intraoperative analgesic component of anesthetic regimes and correlates with pain&#xD;
      intensity measured on a numeric rating scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of this study is to investigate if a pupillometry-guided opioid administration&#xD;
      immediately postoperative in the OR leads to less opioid requirement during the first 2&#xD;
      postoperative hours compared to a non-pupillometry-guided treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim is to evaluate postoperative pain intensity during the first 2 postoperative&#xD;
      hours in patients after pupillometry-guided versus non-pupillometry -guided opioid therapy in&#xD;
      the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis that through a targeted pain therapy based on the measurement of&#xD;
      immediate postoperative pupillometry scores, opioid consumption and pain intensity can be&#xD;
      reduced during the first 2 postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done by observing postoperative pain intensity using pupillometry in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for elective ENT surgery, carrying out pain intervention (opioid therapy)&#xD;
      and re-observing to verify the effectiveness of the targeted postoperative opioid&#xD;
      administration in the OR. Pain on an 11-point verbal Likert response score and total opioid&#xD;
      consumption will be recorded by a blinded investigator at 30-minute intervals for the initial&#xD;
      2 postoperative hours.&#xD;
