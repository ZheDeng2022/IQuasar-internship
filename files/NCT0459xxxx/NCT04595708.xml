  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial of the effect of 4 weeks of regular check-in calls, up to 5 per&#xD;
      week based on participant's choice and 2 survey collection calls and possible referral of&#xD;
      other services, versus no daily check-in calls, on self-reported loneliness measures for&#xD;
      current Meals on Wheels participants (MOW).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention arm will include 125 MOW clients to receive a call of between 5 - 10 minutes&#xD;
      in length each by a consistent caller, five times a week, Monday through Friday for 4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks to check in on them. After the first week of calls, subjects in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will be asked if the frequency of calls is acceptable or if they would like&#xD;
      to reduce the call frequency, potentially to a minimum of twice per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief guidance and training will be provided for the daily conversation to maximize time&#xD;
      spent speaking by the recipient but otherwise, the calls are unscripted other than specific&#xD;
      prompts to ask about the recipient's general sense of well-being. &quot;How are you doing today?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control Arm will include 125 MOW clients who will be randomized to a control group that&#xD;
      will not receive the intervention calls. The control group will receive calls from a member&#xD;
      of the research team at the beginning of the study to collect baseline survey data and at the&#xD;
      post-4-week period to collect post-study survey data.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Loneliness as assessed by the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness 6-Item Scale for Overall, Emotional, and Social Loneliness. Scored from 0-6, a score of 0 indicates least lonely while a score of 6 indicates most lonely.</description>

    <measure>Loneliness as Assessed by the UCLA Short Scale for Measuring Loneliness in Large Surveys</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the UCLA Short Scale for Measuring Loneliness in Large Surveys to measure loneliness. Scored from 3-9, higher scores indicate greater degrees of loneliness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression as Assessed by the 8-item Depression Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Depression Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) to measure depression. Scored from 0-3, and a score of 0 indicates lower levels of depression while a score of 3 indicates higher levels of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety as Assessed by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. Scored from 0-3, and a score of 0 indicates lower levels of anxiety while a score of 3 indicates higher levels of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Status and Quality of Life as Assessed by the Short Form-12 Question Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Short Form-12 question survey to measure physical and mental health status. Summary scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a better self-reported level of health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Engagement as Assess by the Short Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the 6-item Short Lubben Social Network Scale to measure social engagement. For the LSNS-6, the score ranges between 0 and 30, with a higher score indicating more social engagement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Empathy as Assessed by The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 4 week intervention (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the CARE Measure to evaluate measures of empathy in the context of the caller/participant relationship</description>
