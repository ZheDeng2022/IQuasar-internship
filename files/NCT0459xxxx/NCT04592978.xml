  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over one-quarter of American adults engage in hazardous drinking (i.e., a pattern of alcohol&#xD;
      consumption that increases risk for harmful consequences), which is the third leading cause&#xD;
      of preventable death in the U.S. Rates of hazardous drinking are significantly higher among&#xD;
      individuals with (vs. without) chronic pain. Moreover, 20% of individuals prescribed opioids&#xD;
      endorse concurrent alcohol and opioid use, which may interfere with chronic pain treatment&#xD;
      and lead to dangerous/potentially fatal health effects. No interventions to date have&#xD;
      targeted either hazardous drinking or concurrent use of alcohol and opioids in the context of&#xD;
      chronic pain. The current four-year R01 builds upon our past work by developing a brief,&#xD;
      single-session, computer-based, personalized feedback intervention (PFI) designed to enhance&#xD;
      knowledge regarding adverse pain-alcohol-opioid interrelations, increase motivation and&#xD;
      intention to reduce hazardous drinking, and reduce positive attitudes and intention regarding&#xD;
      concurrent use of alcohol and prescription opioid medications. Specifically, we will develop&#xD;
      an integrated PFI for hazardous drinkers with chronic pain who are prescribed opioids&#xD;
      (PA-PFI). Our approach will follow a staged model consistent with NIH guidelines for&#xD;
      developing and standardizing behavioral interventions. Phase IA activities will involve&#xD;
      collecting qualitative and quantitative feedback from three iterative focus groups (N = 21)&#xD;
      to refine intervention content and evaluate treatment acceptability and feasibility. Phase IB&#xD;
      activities will include a proof-of-concept and highly rigorous randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to compare PA-PFI to control PFI (C-PFI) among a sample of 174 hazardous drinkers&#xD;
      with chronic pain who are currently prescribed opioid medications. This study represents an&#xD;
      important and pivotal step in the larger landscape of translating basic research to more&#xD;
      efficacious strategies for reducing hazardous drinking among underserved populations with&#xD;
      medical comorbidities. This intervention would be highly disseminable and relevant to&#xD;
      millions of hazardous drinkers with chronic pain. Given the collective public health impact&#xD;
      of chronic pain, hazardous drinking, and concurrent alcohol-prescription opioid use, we&#xD;
      believe the current study will yield findings that enhance scientific knowledge, enhance our&#xD;
      understanding of mechanisms in reciprocal pain-alcohol-opioid relations, and inform the&#xD;
      development of novel treatments for hazardous drinkers with chronic pain that are adaptable&#xD;
      and easily implemented across a variety of healthcare settings.&#xD;
