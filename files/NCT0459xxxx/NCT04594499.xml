  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was considered as a heterogeneous&#xD;
      disease with multi-organ and multi-system design, which is related to various complications,&#xD;
      such as hypertension, obesity and arteriosclerosis. Studies have found that hypertension and&#xD;
      obesity are respectively associated with increased arterial stiffness. However, there is&#xD;
      still no research investigating the the relationship between blood pressure and arterial&#xD;
      stiffness in HFpEF patients with different levels of obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has typical symptoms and signs of&#xD;
      heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF≥50%). Often associated with obesity,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia and other metabolic syndromes. At present, the incidence of HFpEF accounts for&#xD;
      about 50% of heart failure, and it is increasing year by year. However, the specific&#xD;
      pathogenesis of HFpEF is unknown, and there is a lack of effective diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      methods. A number of studies have shown that obesity is a unique pathophysiological phenotype&#xD;
      of individuals with HFpEF, and the activation of inflammatory mediators is extremely&#xD;
      prominent in the pathophysiological process of HFpEF. Therefore, we speculate that both&#xD;
      obesity and inflammation are related to increased arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a heterogeneous disease. Certain ectopic fats, such as epicardial adipose tissue&#xD;
      (EAT), may be related to obesity-related cardiovascular risks. EAT is a kind of visceral fat.&#xD;
      Under pathological conditions, it releases factors harmful to the coronary artery and&#xD;
      myocardium, and promotes the transition of EAT to a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic&#xD;
      phenotype. Brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is an indicator for evaluating arterial&#xD;
      stiffness. It is a relatively simple, non-invasive method for detecting vascular compliance&#xD;
      and an independent prediction of cardiovascular events in people without cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Factors can be used to assess the risk of cardiovascular events. However, no&#xD;
      relevant research has confirmed that pericardial fat can increase the arterial stiffness of&#xD;
      HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to observe the influence of pericardial fat on the arterial stiffness of&#xD;
      HFpEF and explore the relationship between pericardial fat thickness and arterial stiffness&#xD;
      of HFpEF, in order to assist the clinic in evaluating the vascular state of HFpEF patients&#xD;
      faster and better, and to judge the prognosis. At the same time, EAT has the characteristics&#xD;
      of fast metabolism, strong organ fat specificity, and simple measurement. It can also be used&#xD;
      as a target for drug targeted therapy, opening up a new way for drug therapy of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
