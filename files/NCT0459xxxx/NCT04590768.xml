  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of daily intake of 11 grams of Fermotein™ on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complaints and several other health related biomarkers. Furthermore,&#xD;
      consumer acceptance is investigated. The study has a randomized parallel design. Two&#xD;
      different treatments will be evaluated e.g. a 18-day intervention with fermotein based meals&#xD;
      and a 18-day intervention with control meals. At the start and at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention, a blood sample will be collected. Questionnaires about gut complaints, stool&#xD;
      consistency and frequency, wellbeing, health complaints or other adverse effects will be&#xD;
      collected daily during intervention and up to two days after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fermotein™ is a mycoprotein, derived from fungi, especially produced for human consumption.&#xD;
      It is high in protein, high in fiber, low in saturated fat and contains no cholesterol. Its&#xD;
      functional properties and nutrient content makes them ideal to use as an ingredient for meat&#xD;
      alternatives and other vegetarian/vegan food products. This study aims to assess the impact&#xD;
      of frequent intake of 11 grams of Fermotein™ powder (dry) on gastrointestinal complaints and&#xD;
      several other health related biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to investigate gastro-intestinal complaints during 18 days of&#xD;
      Fermotein™ consumption. The secondary objective is to assess blood based parameters related&#xD;
      to general health and consumer acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomized parallel design. Two different treatments will be evaluated e.g. a&#xD;
      18-day intervention with Fermotein™ based meals and a 18-day intervention with control meals.&#xD;
      At the start and at the end of the intervention a blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
      Questionnaires about gut complaints, stool consistency and frequency, wellbeing, health&#xD;
      complaints or other adverse effects will be collected daily during intervention and up to two&#xD;
      days after the intervention.&#xD;
