  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the true impact inner-ear dysfunction has on patient head&#xD;
      movement kinematics, activity levels, and participation, and (2) to explore the efficacy of&#xD;
      rehabilitation on laboratory, clinical, and community-based outcomes in people following&#xD;
      surgical removal of a schwannoma from the inner-ear nerve.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project we will focus on characterizing deficits in community-based performance&#xD;
      (i.e., head and trunk control during simulated community activities, short term community&#xD;
      mobility, and patient reported participation) and relating these deficits to laboratory&#xD;
      (i.e., video head impulse testing and corrective postural responses) and clinical (i.e.,&#xD;
      MiniBEST and dynamic visual acuity, and visual spatial cognition) measures of gaze and&#xD;
      postural stability in individuals with varied forms of vestibulopathy (unilateral vestibular&#xD;
      neuritis, bilateral vestibular loss, migraine related vestibulopathy, concussion, BPPV,&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis). Additionally, we will examine the longitudinal change of laboratory, and&#xD;
      community-based measures of gaze and postural in two cohorts of people with a specific form&#xD;
      of unilateral vestibular loss (Vestibular Schwannoma resection); one group of these&#xD;
      individuals will receive 6 weeks of vestibular rehabilitation during the acute onset of&#xD;
      symptoms and the other one will begin intervention 6 weeks post onset. This portion of the&#xD;
      proposed project will test my global hypothesis that changes in community-based performance&#xD;
      of head and trunk control impair recovery following the onset of VH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: In individuals with vestibulopathy, characterize and compare laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      measures of body structure, function, and performance to community-based, activity levels,&#xD;
      performance, and patient reported participation. Hypothesis 1: The severity of laboratory and&#xD;
      clinically measured gaze and postural stability function deficits will not strongly correlate&#xD;
      with head and trunk control during community-based performance or patient reported&#xD;
      participation. Hypothesis 2: The nature and severity of laboratory and clinically measured&#xD;
      gaze and postural stability function deficits will differ between varied diagnostic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: In individuals with unilateral vestibular hypofunction following unilateral vestibular&#xD;
      schwannoma resection, examine the longitudinal trajectories of laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      measures of body structure, function and performance, and community-based performance,&#xD;
      activity levels, and patient reported participation during periods of spontaneous and&#xD;
      rehabilitation driven recovery. Hypothesis: Recovery of laboratory and clinical measures will&#xD;
      follow different trajectories than measures of community-based performance and patient&#xD;
      reported participation during both periods of spontaneous and rehabilitation driven recovery.&#xD;
