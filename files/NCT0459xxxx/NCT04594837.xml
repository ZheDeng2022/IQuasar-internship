    <textblock>
      The randomized study (in Phase II of the U44) compares the efficacy and durability of 9 weeks&#xD;
      (18 sessions) of robot-assisted physical therapy (PTR) versus physical therapy (PT) alone on&#xD;
      foot drop as assessed by gait biomechanics (ankle angle at initial contact, peak swing ankle&#xD;
      angle, number of heel-first strikes - % total steps, gait velocity) and blinded clinician&#xD;
      assessment (dorsiflexion active range of motion, ankle muscle strength, assistive device&#xD;
      needs).&#xD;

      This proposal investigates a portable ankle robot (AMBLE) to be used during over-ground&#xD;
      mobility training to reduce foot drop and improve walking function in hemiparetic (half-body,&#xD;
      partially paralyzed stroke patients with foot drop (inability to properly lift and clear the&#xD;
      foot during walking. About 30% of stroke survivors are left with permanent ankle weakness&#xD;
      that impairs their mobility and increases fall-risk. Currently, stroke survivors with foot&#xD;
      drop live with a cane or other assistive device, and often ankle-foot braces (AFOs) for&#xD;
      safety. These assistive devices do not reverse or reduce the underlying neurological foot&#xD;
      drop problem. Recognizing the crucial role of ankle function in walking and balance, and&#xD;
      recognizing that the distal part of the lower extremity often suffers the greatest damage&#xD;
      after a human stroke, the investigators have come up with a portable ankle robot as a tool&#xD;
      for therapists to help shape recovery of walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AMBLE, and its underlying control system, uses information about how patients are walking&#xD;
      from one step to another to assist and shape foot lifting so as to help re- train walking&#xD;
      recovery by a process that neuroscientists call motor learning. It is the combination of the&#xD;
      partially paralyzed stroke survivor's movement efforts with timely assistance &quot;only as&#xD;
      needed&quot; by the robot that investigators and others show is the key to movement recovery after&#xD;
      stroke. Thus, the ankle robot is not a crutch, but a learning and measuring device that&#xD;
      incrementally &quot;gets out of the way&quot; of the learner to facilitate human robot learning such&#xD;
      that the human takes over more of the volitional learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team at University of Maryland has demonstrated in 4 prior studies using seated&#xD;
      and treadmill based robot assisted training using a bulky laboratory robot programmed with a&#xD;
      motor learning formula that can improve ankle motor control in both the early and chronic&#xD;
      phases of stroke, and this can improve over-ground unassisted walking. A significant&#xD;
      proportion of stroke survivors showed session by session recovery of volitional (not assisted&#xD;
      by the robot) ankle lifting during walking across 6 weeks of three 30- 45 minute sessions of&#xD;
      robot training while walking on a treadmill, even years after their stroke. In fact, it has&#xD;
      been found that two weeks of 3 sessions per week ankle robotics training was the time profile&#xD;
      for most motor learning recovery to reduce foot drop. This information has informed the&#xD;
      design of the study described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research was done using a bulky, heavy (~8 lbs), and expensive laboratory robot that&#xD;
      only allowed seated or treadmill based training because it was tethered by wires. This&#xD;
      greatly limits how it can be used by physical therapists, and is not appropriately configured&#xD;
      for ease of use by physical therapists in practice. NextStep Robotics invented and built the&#xD;
      ankle robots motor learning programs with a lot of input from physical therapists and other&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinicians into a portable lightweight robot that can be used over-ground&#xD;
      anywhere with blue tooth controls that also tell the therapist precisely how well the stroke&#xD;
      survivors is learning, step by step. It is this new portable ankle robot that is configured&#xD;
      for use in practice that investigators seek to test in studies with physical therapists using&#xD;
      it fully integrated into their usual outpatient stroke mobility recovery training at&#xD;
      University of Maryland Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This U44 Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is&#xD;
      not a typical single phase randomized clinical study, but consists of Phase I that completes&#xD;
      commercial design of the robot the first year, followed by Phase II randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      across years 2-4 of a finalized commercial version of the ankle robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (following completion of commercial design in Phase I) is a randomized (group&#xD;
      assignment by chance), blinded (outcome testing done by technicians unaware of patient group&#xD;
      assignment), two arm (2 groups) study that investigates the hypothesis that in subacute (6&#xD;
      weeks to 6 months) stroke subjects with foot drop, AMBLE integrated physical therapy (PTR)&#xD;
      consisting of 18 training sessions over nine weeks is more effective than usual physical&#xD;
      therapy (PT) to improve foot drop outcomes measured by movement analyses of walking, and by&#xD;
      standardized clinical assessments of walking including specific foot drop outcomes as&#xD;
      assessed by a certified PT clinician (blinded to treatment assignment), cross checked by&#xD;
      blinded review of 2 other clinicians of films of the standardized mobility assessments to&#xD;
      provide a consensus impartial judgement. Notably, this Phase II study focuses on sub-acute&#xD;
      stroke recovery (6 weeks to 6 months) because it represents a therapeutic window into which&#xD;
      conventional outpatient physical therapy is typically front-loaded to optimize outcomes. This&#xD;
      phase of stroke rehabilitation is selected to test the AMBLE in real world settings when&#xD;
      outpatient physical therapy typically occurs, using a treatment frequency and duration (18&#xD;
      physical therapy sessions across 9 weeks) that is representative of practice in Maryland and&#xD;
      most of the United States. If wearing the AMBLE robot during physical therapy in this&#xD;
      time-frame reduces foot drop and improves longer term outcomes measured 3 months after all&#xD;
      robotics therapy has ended, then the investigators will apply for FDA approval for the first&#xD;
      robotics device to actively treat foot drop after stroke.&#xD;
