    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the combine effects of Behavioral Activation and Attention&#xD;
      Training on depression, well-being and other processes involved in depression as rumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multiple baseline design is followed with multiple idiographic assessments, in addition to&#xD;
      a pre-post and follow-up standardized assessment design.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders, as well as one&#xD;
      of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Behavioral activation is an empirically&#xD;
      validated treatment for depression associated with medium effect size. The rationale of&#xD;
      behavioral activation is to increase activation and reduce avoidance in order to reduce&#xD;
      depressive affects. In parallel, Attention Training Techniques (ATT) is also an empirically&#xD;
      validated treatment for depression. The rationale of ATT is to attenuate the self-focused&#xD;
      attention and increase flexible attentional control over information processing to reduce&#xD;
      depressive affects. ATT could target specific cognitive factors that are not changed through&#xD;
      traditional interventions, and might enhance treatment outcomes for clinical and subclinical&#xD;
      depressed when used in adjunct to psychotherapy. Then, the use of ATT may be a promising&#xD;
      avenue to increase effectiveness of behavioral activation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are multiple. First, to measure the treatment feasibility and adherence&#xD;
      of different treatment combinations and to measure it throughout the study. Second, to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression combined with&#xD;
      Attention Training sessions in subclinical and clinical depressed participants. Third, to&#xD;
      investigate the mechanisms of change of both interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will follow an &quot;A1-B-A2'&quot; design. Daily ideographic measures will be collected&#xD;
      during all phases. Phase A1 and A2 are non-interventional phases of baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      period respectively. Participants are randomly allocated to baseline lengths of 7, 10 and 15&#xD;
      days. Phase B is the intervention phase ranging from 5 weeks to 7 weeks. Three conditions&#xD;
      exist with participants randomly allocated to one of these conditions. The intervention is&#xD;
      provided in individual once a week. The first condition is a combination of 5 weeks of&#xD;
      behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) and Attention Training technique&#xD;
      (ATT)(2 hours/week). The second condition is 3 weeks of ATT followed by 5 weeks of BATD (1&#xD;
      hour/week), and the third is 5 weeks of BATD followed by 3 weeks of ATT (1 hour/week).&#xD;
      Nomothetic standardized measures were also collected at pre-treatment (T0), after treatment&#xD;
      (T1), after two weeks (T2) and 3 months later (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the three proposed conditions will have an effect on the&#xD;
      following target variables: activation, avoidance, reward motivation, self-focused attention,&#xD;
      awareness as well as on transfer measures: depressive symptoms, rumination, anhedonia,&#xD;
      well-being, social and work impairments, and cognitive control (2) changes in the target&#xD;
      variables should preceded changes in the transfer measures (3) the therapeutic effects would&#xD;
      be greater and faster when the treatments are combined than when they are offered sequentialy&#xD;
      (i.e., in condition 1 versus conditions 2 and, (4) the therapeutic effect observed in Phase B&#xD;
      was maintained in follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target measures were expected to change with the introduction of intervention in comparison&#xD;
      to baseline phase. In Condition of combination, the investigators expected to observe in&#xD;
      Phase B an enhancement of activation, awareness and reward motivation and a decrease in&#xD;
      avoidance and self-focused attention in comparison to the baseline phase. In Condition 2 with&#xD;
      ATT sessions followed by BA sessions, the investigators expected to observe a reduction of&#xD;
      self-focus attention, and an enhancement of awareness with the introduction of ATT, and an&#xD;
      enhancement of activation and reward motivation and a reduction of avoidance with the&#xD;
      introduction of BA. In Condition 3 with BA sessions followed by ATT sessions, the&#xD;
      investigators expected the opposite pattern of change with first an enhancement of activation&#xD;
      and reward motivation and a reduction of avoidance with the introduction of BA in comparison&#xD;
      to baseline and then a reduction of self-focus attention, and an enhancement of awareness&#xD;
      with the introduction of ATT in comparison to baseline.&#xD;

    <description>The Credibility and expectancy of treatment Questionnaire (CEQ) is a 6-items scale that assesses the therapy credibility who refers to the extent to which a treatment makes sense, is believable, convincing and logical, and the expectancy who refers to improvements that patients believe will occur with the intervention. Two subscales are identified: the Credibility and the Expectancy. Higher scores indicate better credibility and Expectancy from the patients (better outcome).</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Behavioral Activation treatment with Attention Training Technique</intervention_name>
    <description>The BATD includes the development of a shared formulation, psychoeducation, self-monitoring of daily activities, identifying &quot;depressed behaviours&quot;, developing alternative goal orientated behaviours, scheduling of valued activities, and problem solving around difficulties implementing scheduled activities.&#xD;
Wells's Attention Training is a task designed to train selective attention to specific information by training individuals to attend to multiple auditory external sources. In addition to auditory exercices, the ATT sessions included psychoeducation, discussion around rumination (e.g. controllability, usefulness), self-report evaluation of self-focused before and after the auditory exercices, and transfer to everyday life.</description>
