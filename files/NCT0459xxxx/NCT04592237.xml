    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of cabazitaxel, carboplatin, and cetrelimab followed&#xD;
      by niraparib with or without cetrelimab in treating patients with aggressive variant prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      cabazitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as niraparib, can&#xD;
      keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetrelimab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving niraparib with or without cetrelimab, after treatment with cabazitaxel,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and cetrelimab, may help control aggressive variant prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the progression free survival of men with aggressive variant prostate carcinoma&#xD;
      (AVPC) treated with induction cabazitaxel-carboplatin and cetrelimab followed by maintenance&#xD;
      niraparib with or without cetrelimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate changes in the density and localization of immune markers and cell subsets in&#xD;
      AVPC tumors treated with or without cetrelimab added to cabazitaxel-carboplatin induction and&#xD;
      niraparib maintenance, and screen for their association with outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the percentage of patients that are able to complete the 6 cycles of induction&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) responses in men with AVPC treated with&#xD;
      induction cabazitaxel-carboplatin and cetrelimab followed by maintenance niraparib with or&#xD;
      without cetrelimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the overall survival of men with AVPC treated with induction&#xD;
      cabazitaxel-carboplatin and cetrelimab followed by maintenance niraparib with or without&#xD;
      cetrelimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the safety and tolerability of each of the regimens. V. Determine the frequency&#xD;
      of PD-L1 expression in tumors treated with cabazitaxel-carboplatin induction and niraparib&#xD;
      maintenance and its association with outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Collect and archive solid and liquid tumor samples from study patients for later&#xD;
      hypothesis generating associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive cabazitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning cycle 2, patients also receive cetrelimab IV over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive cabazitaxel IV over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
      on day 1. Beginning cycle 2, patients also receive cetrelimab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive cetrelimab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and niraparib PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up for 30 to 90 days (after last&#xD;
      dose cetrelimab), and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

          -  A malignancy (other than the one treated in this study) which has a &gt;= 30% probability&#xD;
             of recurrence within 24 months (except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix or Ta urothelial carcinomas)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of adverse events. Examples include, but are not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on high resolution&#xD;
             computed tomography (HRCT) scan, uncontrolled seizures, history of allogeneic organ&#xD;
             transplant, history of primary immunodeficiency or any psychiatric disorder that&#xD;
             prohibits obtaining informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases or spinal cord compressions. A&#xD;
             scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can&#xD;
             receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these&#xD;
             were started at least 28 days prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to niraparib, carboplatin, cabazitaxel or an&#xD;
             anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of cetrelimab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid or steroids as pre-medication for&#xD;
             hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with&#xD;
             the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome,&#xD;
             or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.]). The following are exceptions to this&#xD;
             criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with vitiligo or alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on&#xD;
                  hormone replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only&#xD;
                  after consultation with the study physician&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days of receiving cetrelimab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
             physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness&#xD;
