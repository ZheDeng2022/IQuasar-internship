  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CHF is a most wild-spread and prognostically poor outcome most of cardiovascular and other&#xD;
      disease. Despite of significant progress in treatment of CHF for the last years, death from&#xD;
      this pathology stayed very high, reaching 60% for men, 45% for women during the 5 years after&#xD;
      establishing diagnosis. The purpose of treatment is creating &quot;seamless&quot; system of care the&#xD;
      whole continuum stretch CHF, in this connection, the particular relevance take in creating of&#xD;
      new way and strategy with IT-technology mHealth. On the whole, mHealth application&#xD;
      potentially suggest economic efficiency solution with continuous access for symptoms&#xD;
      monitoring, stimulation of patients to self-servicing, self-controlling and achieving better&#xD;
      results compare with optimal medical therapy. So, remote monitoring of patients on the base&#xD;
      of mobile application must improve clinical and economic efficiency of medical care received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In trial will be studied efficiency of using mobile application for remote monitoring of&#xD;
      patients with ischemic etiology HF, also quality of life, commitment to therapy and prognosis&#xD;
      (frequency of cardiovascular poor outcomes). Clinical indicators and tests (Quality of Life&#xD;
      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,&#xD;
      6-minute walking test) will be evaluated in the beginning of the trial and repeatly after 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial financed by Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Education and Science.&#xD;

      It is single-centered, open-labled, comparative, prospective, randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      intended to study the benefits, if that's have, 12-month remote monitoring with using mobile&#xD;
      application based on chronic heart failure clinical flow of 200 patients with coronary heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will seen twice: screening, initial randomization, last 12 month, during which&#xD;
      will be evaluated clinical and laboratory indicators. At the time of first screening visit&#xD;
      will be singed informed consent. In the department of chronic heart failure of National&#xD;
      Center of Cardiology and Internal Medicine named by M. Mirrakhimov the patients will be&#xD;
      laboratory and clinical-instrumentary examined and have been teaching for using mobile&#xD;
      application, basics of self-servicing and self-controlling. Participants, meeting all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, will come back for randomization during the hospitalization or just to&#xD;
      standard medical therapy, or to standard medical therapy and remote monitoring with mobile&#xD;
      application. In active comparator patients besides of standard medical therapy will use&#xD;
      mobile application twice a week, if necessary every day, also foreseen two-way feedback with&#xD;
      the coordinating doctor and online chat on WhatsApp.&#xD;

    <description>Mobile application &quot;M-Cardio&quot; for remote monitoring have algorithm of clinical indicators, which allowing to define current clinical condition of the patient depended from quantify deviations above or below thresholds (recommended by ESC and AHA), includes 7 indicators such as dyspnea (yes or no), position on bed (horizontally or sit), complaints of heart interruption (pulse), edema (yes or no), weight (&gt;1kg from base), systolic (&gt;140mmHg) and diastolic (&lt;90mmHg) pressure, heart rate (&gt;90 and &lt;60 per minute), which will fill in twice a week, during 12 month. Cardivascular death will be determined by monitoring changes from randomization till the end of the study or so long the patient remains in the study, whichever is earlier.</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life is measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). The questionnaire consists of 21 items that assess the impact of HF and HF treatment on key physical, emotional, and social dimensions of a patient's life during the past four weeks. Responses are coded from 0 = does not apply and 1 = very little to 5 = very much. A higher score represents a greater negative HR-related impact on quality of life.</description>
