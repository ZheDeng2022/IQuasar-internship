      Subjects will be enrolled into 3 balanced groups each using a different strength toothpaste.&#xD;
      Dental hypersensitivity (DHS) will be assessed at study start, midway and study end.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-and positive-controlled, stratified&#xD;
      parallel group clinical trial. The three groups will be randomly assigned to use one of three&#xD;
      test toothpastes having an identical base formulation but containing respectively either 0%&#xD;
      nano-hydroxyapatite (HAP) (placebo), 15% nano-HAP or 5% KNO3 (positive control). All dental&#xD;
      examinations for data collection will be conducted by the same Clinical Examiner.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>8-week Cold Air Stimulus</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy outcome will be the decrease in cold air stimulus sensitivity (VAS score) from baseline to 8 weeks. Assessment of change in cold air sensitivity will be conducted using air delivered from a standard dental unit air syringe at room temperature (~70°F±3°F)(~21°C±2°C) and a pressure of 60psi (± 5psi). The air will be directed perpendicular to the exposed root surface of the isolated sensitive tooth for one second from a distance of approximately one centimeter. Assessment of sensitivity will be carried out using Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>8-week Tactile Stimulus</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy outcome will be the increase in tactile stimulus force from baseline to 8 weeks. Assessment of Change in tactile sensitivity will be assessed using the Yeaple Electronic Force Sensing Probe.The explorer tip will be applied perpendicular to the tooth surface and a pressure load applied starting at 10 g and increasing to 80g. The load at which the subject says &quot;yes&quot; will be recorded. (Baseline screening will begin at 30g).</description>
