  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if treatment of less severe hypertension in the postpartum period results in a&#xD;
      lower frequency of maternal morbidity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with postpartum hypertension are at risk of developing preeclampsia, eclampsia, and&#xD;
      severe maternal morbidity. About one-third of eclampsia occurs in the postpartum period.&#xD;
      Fifty percent of intra-cerebral hemorrhages occurring in association with preeclampsia occur&#xD;
      in the postpartum period. In addition to the maternal morbidity that may arise from severe&#xD;
      hypertension in the postpartum period, additional consequences of inadequate blood pressure&#xD;
      control include maternal readmission, its associated costs to the healthcare system, and its&#xD;
      destabilizing effect on a new family. Furthermore, pregnant women with hypertensive disorders&#xD;
      in pregnancy are at an increased risk of persistent postpartum hypertension and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome within the first year after delivery. Therefore, untreated postpartum hypertension&#xD;
      may significantly impact on long term cardiometabolic outcomes for reproductive aged-women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based guidance is lacking on the blood pressure threshold to initiate&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy in the postpartum period. Current clinical practice is extrapolated&#xD;
      from management during pregnancy and no prior trials have been conducted on the threshold for&#xD;
      initiation of antihypertensive medication in the postpartum period. A systematic review in&#xD;
      2017 concluded &quot;there is a lack of good quality evidence for postpartum management,&#xD;
      emphasizing the need for further RCTs directly comparing different antihypertensive agents,&#xD;
      BP threshold for medication adjustment and different models of care, with outcome measures&#xD;
      other than postnatal readmissions&quot; Based on low quality evidence/expert opinion ACOG and the&#xD;
      National Institute of Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK both recommend initiating&#xD;
      antihypertensive at a BP threshold of 150/100mmhg. NICE further recommends keeping BP lower&#xD;
      than 140/90mmHg in patients with chronic hypertension and reducing antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications when BP is less than 130/80mmHg in this population. ACOG does not mention at&#xD;
      which BP threshold to reduce medications or when to stop antihypertensive therapy. There are&#xD;
      obvious gaps in knowledge as stated in the systematic review. Therefore, our objective is to&#xD;
      provide evidence to inform best practices with regards to the management of hypertension in&#xD;
      the postpartum period through this randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
