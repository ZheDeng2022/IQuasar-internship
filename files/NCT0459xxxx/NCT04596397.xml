  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing proportion of pregnant women have their labors induced due to changing&#xD;
      guidelines. In correlation with this increase, the population of the induced women has&#xD;
      changed toward more women with a low-risk pregnancy. Traditionally, induction of labor has&#xD;
      taken place in an inpatient setting where the women have spent extra days in hospital before&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral prostaglandins, such as misoprostol, is one of the most commonly used induction agent&#xD;
      and is easy for the pregnant women to administrate. The pharmacological effect is ripening&#xD;
      the cervix and compared to the mechanical cervical ripening, with a balloon catheter, the&#xD;
      demands on busy maternity services seems reduced. Before contractions start, the risk of&#xD;
      adverse effects on mother or fetus is considered low, but the evidence on use of misoprostol&#xD;
      in an outpatient setting is sparse.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The implementation of induction of labor in outpatient settings is increasing despite&#xD;
      insufficient evidence regarding safety and effectiveness. The use of a balloon catheter in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting is not associated with adverse outcomes in a low-risk population. There is&#xD;
      also evidence that outpatient vs inpatient induction of labor with balloon catheter is&#xD;
      equally effective. Examination of vaginal dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2) is found to be&#xD;
      efficacious in outpatient settings. However, strong evidence concludes that the oral route of&#xD;
      administration of prostaglandin is preferable when inducing labor. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization recommend 25ug misoprostol (prostaglandin E1) orally every 2 hour until&#xD;
      contractions start for induction of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women randomized to an inpatient setting will receive the hospital standard follow-up;&#xD;
      oral misoprostol 25ug every two hours and a cardiotocography for fetal monitoring every 4-6&#xD;
      hour until start of contractions for two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women randomized to an outpatient setting will receive one oral misoprostol 25ug at the&#xD;
      maternity unit. After two hours, provided a normal cardiotocography and no contractions, they&#xD;
      can go home. They will continue to take 25ug misoprostol every two hours until start of&#xD;
      contractions or increasing pain. Maximum time spent at home will be 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dedicated midwife on call will always be available for questions. The women will receive&#xD;
      oral and written information to return to the maternity unit if the water breaks, if they&#xD;
      experience increasing pain or bleeding, if they feel insecure or anxious, if there are&#xD;
      reduced or no fetal movements, and/or when the contraction starts. When the woman returns,&#xD;
      she will stay admitted until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will be given standard of care and fetal surveillance when admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital, when the contractions start or if the contractions are still absent after 48 hours.&#xD;
      We will also ask eligible women who refrain to participate about their reasons for&#xD;
      non-participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION We aim to explore that induction of labor using oral misoprostol&#xD;
      appears feasible in an outpatient setting and may positively influence the length of the&#xD;
      hospital stay and maternal satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY RESEARCH PLAN This is a pilot study to explore the feasibility of a possible&#xD;
      multicenter randomized controlled trail.&#xD;
