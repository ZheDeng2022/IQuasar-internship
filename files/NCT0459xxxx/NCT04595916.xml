      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and the safety of polyene&#xD;
      phosphatidylcholine Injection in patients with acute drug-induced liver injury after 2-4&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;

      This study is a phase IV study in subjects with acute drug-induced liver injury. As designed,&#xD;
      the study will include a screening period of up to 1 week, 2 to 4 weeks of treatment, and 1&#xD;
      week of safety follow-up. The eligible subjects will randomly be assigned to polyene&#xD;
      phosphatidylcholine group or magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate group to receive single-blind&#xD;
      treatment with a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
