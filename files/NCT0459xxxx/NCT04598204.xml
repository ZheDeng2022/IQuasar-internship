  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KHE and TA are rare tumors and some of the cases may lead to life-threatening complications&#xD;
      including Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon. Typically treated with steroids and vincristine, a&#xD;
      majority of the cases do not have good prognosis. Complex vascular malformations are always&#xD;
      managed by surgery,sclerotherapy and embolization therapy. While many of the cases still lead&#xD;
      to complications such as disfigurement, chronic pain, recurrent infections, coagulopathies.&#xD;
      Different medical centers are exploring new therapy for these tough problems. This study is&#xD;
      plotted to determine the efficacy and safety of rapamycin monotherapy in KHE/TA and complex&#xD;
      vascular malformations in pediatric patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to the classification （revised in 2014）by International Society for the Study of&#xD;
      Vascular （ISSVA ）, vascular anomalies are classified into two distinct disease&#xD;
      entities，including vascular tumors and vascular malformations differing in their biologic and&#xD;
      pathologic features. Vascular tumors include infantile and congenital hemangiomas, Tufted&#xD;
      angiomas (TA), and Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas (KHE). Vascular malformations are&#xD;
      classified according to their vascular tissue of origin which include capillary, venous,&#xD;
      arteriovenous, lymphatic, and mixed malformations. Infantile hemangiomas, the most common&#xD;
      vascular anomaly, generally have a good prognosis due to its specific biological&#xD;
      characteristics（a predetermined life cycle from proliferation to subsequent involution).&#xD;
      However，KHE and TA are rare vascular tumors with incidence less than 1/1000000 and along with&#xD;
      complex lymphatic malformations and complex mixed malformations，are difficult to be&#xD;
      successfully treated resulting in clinical problems such as disfigurement, chronic pain,&#xD;
      recurrent infections, coagulopathies (thrombotic and hemorrhagic,including life-threatening&#xD;
      Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon), organ dysfunction. Rapamycin directly inhibits the mTOR&#xD;
      pathway, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and angio/lymphangiogenesis and is recently&#xD;
      applied to refractory vascular . Preclinical data and case reports have confirm that&#xD;
      rapamycin is effective for KHE/TA and some slow-flow vascular malformations. The overall goal&#xD;
      of this trial is to objectively determine the effectiveness and safety of rapamycin&#xD;
      monotherapy in KHE/TA and complex vascular malformations in pediatric patients and to explore&#xD;
      the rational doses. In this study, 30 patients (aged from 1 month to 14 years old) diagnosed&#xD;
      with KHE/TA or complex vascular that respond poorly to propranolol hydrochloride and&#xD;
      corticosteroid are enrolled. Oral rapamycin is given as a monotherapy at a initial dose of&#xD;
      0.8mg/m2, once daily for children under 3 years old and twice daily (every 12 hours) for&#xD;
      those above 3 years. And further dosage is adjusted to target a trough concentration of&#xD;
      rapamycin in plasma as 10-15ng/ml （OR 15-20ng/ml if the efficacy of treatment is not&#xD;
      satisfactory with concentration at 10-15ng/ml. One course lasts for 12weeks and no more than&#xD;
      4 courses are given.Volumetric changes as the primary outcome measure will be analysed by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasonography. Frequency of adverse events as&#xD;
      assessed by CTCAE v4.0 is calculated to evaluate the safety of rapamycin.&#xD;

    <description>Response to rapamycin treatment was measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasonography analyses.

    <description>For cases complicated with Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon, clinical lab indexes including blood platelet and fibrinogen are followed up at least weekly before a improved and stable state is reached.

Improved hematologic parameters are defined as a platelet count greater than 50,000/uL (or a 2 times increase in platelet count compared to baseline) and a fibrinogen level greater than 100mg/dl.</description>
