  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To propose a competency-based theory of change for reducing suicide risks among male Internet&#xD;
      users with salient traits of societal masculinity; To test whether the theory of change using&#xD;
      the competency-based model has additional effects on reducing self-harm and/or suicidal&#xD;
      ideation in addition to the online social work treatment-as-usual model; To provide online&#xD;
      social work service providers with evidence-based measures for reducing the risks of&#xD;
      self-harm and/or suicide among young male Internet users.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized waitlist-controlled trial of 60 participants examining the effects of a&#xD;
      proposed competency-based model on self-harm relative to those of OSW alone. In the online&#xD;
      survey (T0), subjects with self-harm or suicidal ideation will be invited to give informed&#xD;
      consent, and then be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) OSW (control), or 2) OSW +&#xD;
      six weekly sessions of competency-based physical training (intervention). They will be&#xD;
      assessed at three measurement time points (T1 = one-month; T2 = three-month; and T3 =&#xD;
      five-month from T0 at post-intervention). The intervention group is hypothesized to display a&#xD;
      greater reduction in the primary outcomes of self-harm and suicidal ideation than the OSW&#xD;
      group. Chi-square tests giving p &lt;=0.05 will indicate a goodness of fit of the linear mixed&#xD;
      model, which address random effects in the data and handles intention-to-treat (ITT).&#xD;

    <description>Change in scores on Suicidal ideation as measured by the self-report the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ-4) - the four-item short form in Chinese, scoring on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 to 24.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 5-month</time_frame>
    <description>Hopelessness will be assessed by four questions measuring hopelessness extracted from the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS4), scoring on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 to 20.&#xD;
A higher score on the scale suggests a higher levels of depression, suicidal intent, and/or ideation.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline measurement of depression at 1-month, 3-month and 5-month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 5-month</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed via 12 questions from the short-form General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), scoring on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 36.&#xD;
A higher score on the scale suggests a higher level of emotional distress and depression.</description>

    <measure>Change of baseline sense of competency at 1-month, 3-month and 5-month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 5-month</time_frame>
    <description>Sense of competency will be assessed via 40 questions from the Chinese Physical Self-Description Questionnaire-Short Form (CPSDQ-S), scoring on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 to 200.&#xD;
A higher score suggest a higher level of self-perceived physical competency and self-esteem.</description>

    <measure>Change of baseline perceived social support at 1-month, 3-month and 5-month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 5-month</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS-C). The MSPSS measures the degree of social support received from family, friends, and significant others, and has been proven to have good internal and test-retest reliability and moderate construct validity</description>

    <description>The intervention to be added to online social work treatment as usual (OSW) is a well-designed, one-on-one structural physical workout module which will be offered by a licensed senior physical trainer in public sports ground or gymnasium. The aim is to strengthen participants' sense of competence, improve their physical fitness, self-confidence and self-image through an outcome-driven Circuit training. One of the chief advantages of Circuit training is its adaptability. Circuit training can be performed with gym equipment and/or bodyweight exercises which is deemed to be suitable for beginner and easy to practice at home on oneself. Participants can continue to replicate the exercise with or without any equipment. The program will be delivered in six one-hour sessions, including face-to-face and online mode, over one month.</description>
