  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is currently made by trans-nasal endoscopy and&#xD;
      biopsy. The small caliber endoscope provides only a limited view of the nasopharynx and may&#xD;
      not be able to provide a thorough assessment of the nasopharynx. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed a novel endoscopic approach to access the nasopharynx by using a trans-oral high&#xD;
      definition endoscope with magnification and image enhancement function. In this cohort study,&#xD;
      we aim to investigate the efficacy of diagnosing NPC by applying the novel technique in a&#xD;
      high risk patient group with elevated plasma EBV DNA but with negative screening with&#xD;
      conventional trans-nasal endoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in our region and is the 9th most common cancer in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. Traditionally diagnosis has been through a nasoendoscopic examination of the&#xD;
      nasopharynx with white light followed by a biopsy of suspicious lesions for a confirmatory&#xD;
      diagnosis. However, given the geometry of the anatomy of the nasopharynx, with its inherent&#xD;
      crevices and varying amounts of lymphoid tissues, lesions are not always easily identified&#xD;
      leading to potential missed lesions. The non-specific aspect of white light also leads to&#xD;
      excessive biopsies that are not without risk and of some discomfort to patients. Recent&#xD;
      advances in liquid biopsies have also allowed for the detection of earlier and smaller&#xD;
      lesions that are not always easily identified on nasoendoscopy but rather are seen on&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative imaging technique is the use of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) to view the&#xD;
      vasculature of the mucosa to identify suspicious lesions for pre-malignancy and malignancy&#xD;
      that has been popularized in the gastrointestinal tract. In NPC, NBI with the flexible&#xD;
      nasoendoscopes has been used in the diagnosis of NPC with varying success. Researchers at&#xD;
      Chinese University of Hong Kong has found that in NPC NBI has limitations arising from a lack&#xD;
      of consensus on vascular findings on NBI that constitute malignancy, lack of magnification&#xD;
      and long focal length of current nasoendoscopes1. Flexible endoscopy using conventional&#xD;
      esophago-gastroscopy endoscope (OGD) with NBI and magnification power up to 80x overcome the&#xD;
      limitations of current nasoendoscopes. The passage of the endoscope through the mouth and&#xD;
      retroflexion at oropharynx could visualize the nasopharynx clearly and detailed assessment is&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here in this study the investigators will seek to use a trans-oral magnifying endoscopy with&#xD;
      NBI and retroflexion into the nasopharynx to view the nasopharynx to evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      in the diagnosis of occult nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical usefulness of trans-oral magnifying&#xD;
      endoscopy with NBI as a screening tool for patients at increased risk of nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma (NPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that with the use of magnifying NBI trans-oral endoscopy, the&#xD;
      nasopharynx could improve the diagnostic yield of NPC in high risk patients with negative&#xD;
      test on conventional investigations. As a result, such endoscopic screening tool could be&#xD;
      used routinely to identify early NPC in patients deemed at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective single arm study designed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      trans-oral magnifying NBI endoscopic assessment of nasopharynx in patients who are deemed&#xD;
      elevated risk of NPC but with negative traditional endoscopic and radiological screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study conducted by the Department of Chemical Pathology and&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology, screening of 20000 asymptomatic individuals was performed using plasma&#xD;
      Epstein Barr Virus DNA analysis. The presence of plasma EBV DNA consisting of short DNA&#xD;
      fragments released by NPC cells helped identify NPC patients. In the published results, 34&#xD;
      NPC was identified in 300-screened positive individuals. In the rest of the cohort, NPC was&#xD;
      not identified with initial nasoendoscopy and biopsy. A few more cancers was subsequently&#xD;
      identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging upon follow-up at 3 years and was confirmed with&#xD;
      repeated endoscopic biopsies. In the current study the investigators would invite patients&#xD;
      with persistently positive screening on plasma EBV-DNA analysis and no cancer found on usual&#xD;
      diagnostic tests to undergo the novel screening endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals would be screened for eligibility at the clinic follow-up at the Department of&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology. Study consent would be taken if they agree to participate in the current&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic procedures would be performed by endoscopists with expertise on performing&#xD;
      magnifying NBI endoscopy at the Combined Endoscopy Center, Prince of Wales Hospital. It would&#xD;
      be conducted at the Combined Endoscopy Center, Prince of Wales Hospital. Topical local&#xD;
      anaesthetic will be applied to the oropharynx and nasopharynx. In addition, intravenous&#xD;
      sedation by use of Midazolam and Fentanyl would be given. Endoscopes with magnification and&#xD;
      NBI function would be used (GF-H290Z, Olympus Medical Corporations, Tokyo, Japan). A soft&#xD;
      black hood would be attached to the tip of the endoscope for better focal length adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon insertion through a mouthpiece, the scope will then be retroflexed into the nasopharynx&#xD;
      and the lateral walls into the Fossa of Rosenmuller and the posterior nasopharyngeal wall&#xD;
      will be systematically examined with white light and NBI. Target suspicious areas would be&#xD;
      examined by use of magnification with the power up to 80X. Biopsy would be taken if&#xD;
      suspicious lesion is identified during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, non-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx would be&#xD;
      performed if the participants have not received a similar scan in recent 6 months and have no&#xD;
      contra-indications to MRI. The MRI finding would be correlated with the endoscopic and&#xD;
      histological findings.&#xD;
