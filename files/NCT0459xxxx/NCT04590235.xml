      Paediatric and adult patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable Plexiform&#xD;
      Neurofibromas (PN) will be evaluated in the screening visit to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
      Approximately 16 paediatric and 16 adult qualified patients will receive oral selumetinib 25&#xD;
      mg/m^2 twice a day (approximately every 12 hours) continuously until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable drug-related toxicity, whichever occurs first. Once a patient has discontinued&#xD;
      the study treatment then the patient will be followed for specified period for safety&#xD;
      assessment&#xD;
