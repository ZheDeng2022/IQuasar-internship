  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is an incurable disease that involves breakdown of the knee joint.&#xD;
      This breakdown is often accompanied by knee pain and stiffness, which can limit a person's&#xD;
      daily physical activity. Fortunately, there are treatments that may stop or slow the&#xD;
      progression of knee OA. Bone marrow aspirate can be extracted and processed into autologous,&#xD;
      nucleated cells, then injected back into the knee affected by OA. These cells provide&#xD;
      important nutrients that can improve the health of the knee joint and alleviate the symptoms&#xD;
      of knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are interested in determining whether an injection of&#xD;
      autologous, nucleated cells can improve physical activity, pain and function in people who&#xD;
      are diagnosed with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit a total of 10 subjects for this study and examine changes in&#xD;
      physical activity using a research-grade Actigraph Monitor.&#xD;

    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in physical activity from baseline to 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Actigraph GT3X (Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) to objectively measure physical activity. The Actigraph GT3X is a hip-worn accelerometer that measures the intensity of physical activity on a minute-by-minute basis. The Actigraph GT3X is valid and reliable in community-dwelling older adults with knee OA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain of Target Knee</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in pain of target knee from baseline to 3 weeks, and change in pain of target knee from baseline to 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask participants to complete the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), a single-item instrument in which the participant makes a mark on a 100 mm line to indicate their pain score in each knee from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity of the target knee. The instrument takes &lt;1 minute to complete.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function of Target Knee</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in function of target knee from baseline to 3 weeks, and change in function of target knee from baseline to 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask participants to complete the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), a 42-item instrument that assesses the following five domains: pain, symptoms (other than pain), function in activities of daily living, function in sport and recreation, and quality of life. The score is a percentage score from 0 to 100, 0 representing extreme problems of the target knee and 100 representing no problems of the target knee. The instrument takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>For each participant, bone marrow will be aspirated from the iliac crest, and then processed to achieve a concentrated dose of autologous, nucleated cells. These cells will be injected into the same participant's knee that is affected by knee OA.</description>
