  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the prospective, randomized, controlled multi-centre study, 100 patients who were&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed with sarcopenia were assigned to either a home-based exercise group or&#xD;
      the control group. The home-based exercise program was performed three days per week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Before and three months after the exercise program, all the patients were evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a complex and multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive and&#xD;
      generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength.The randomized, multicenter study was&#xD;
      conducted at the physical medicine and rehabilitation departments of five different centers.&#xD;
      One hundred patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly allocated to&#xD;
      either a home-based exercise group (n=50) or a control group (n=50). The patients were&#xD;
      evaluated before and 3 months after inclusion using the timed up and go test, the Berg&#xD;
      balance scale, the 6-minute walk test , a numeric rating scale to determine QoL, and the&#xD;
      number of falls.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline timed up and go test at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>The timed up and go test test measures the amount of time needed for a patient to stand up from a chair, walk three meters as quickly and safely as possible toward a cone, walk around it, and sit down on the chair again.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Berg balance scale score at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is a reliable tool for assessing balance and postural control in older adults. This scale consists of 14 items, each scored from 0 to 4, with a maximal score of 56 points. A higher score indicates better balance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline 6-minute walk test (6MWT) at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is used to assess people's physical capacity. participants were asked to walk back and forth in a hospital corridor free of obstacles for 6 minutes at a regular pace.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline self-reported QoL at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>The average level of QoL was evaluated using the numeric scale and scored between 0 and 10, where 0 indicates the best QoL and 10 indicates the worst QoL</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline number of falls at 3-months</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        community-dwelling older adult diagnosis of sarcopenia according to the clinical&#xD;
        examination; and able to walk independently. The physical performance of patients with a&#xD;
        SARC-F score ≥4 were tested using a gait speed test and a short physical performance&#xD;
        battery (SPPB). The diagnosis of sarcopenia was confirmed in cases where the patient's gait&#xD;
        speed was ≤0.8 m/s and the SPPB score was ≤8&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        having cardiovascular, pulmonary, and/or chronic diseases that may affect participation in&#xD;
        the exercise program; impaired cognition; previous diagnosis of a neurological condition&#xD;
        that severely affected mobility and balance; malignancy; metastatic cancer; serious vision&#xD;
        loss or vestibular impairment&#xD;
