  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized trial. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      carbon ion radiotherapy versus standard care for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Subjects&#xD;
      who receive carbon ion radiotherapy may receive additional chemotherapy afterwards, at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physicians. Subjects on the control arm are also expected to&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy, using a regimen selected by the treating physicians. Subjects on the&#xD;
      control arm will not receive upfront radiotherapy but may receive radiotherapy (not carbon&#xD;
      ion radiotherapy) if disease progression occurs.&#xD;
