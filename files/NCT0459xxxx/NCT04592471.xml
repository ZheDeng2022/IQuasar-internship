  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decathlon has developed kneeMID500-STRONG700 products which are two medical devices designed&#xD;
      to be used for sport resumption after knee sprain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      kneeMID500 device is intended to be used following a mild knee sprain. STRONG700 device is&#xD;
      intended to be used following a moderate knee sprain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between these devices is based on the strength of compression and the knee&#xD;
      maintain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this multicentre study is to collect data on the related clinical&#xD;
      complications and clinical outcomes of market-approved Decathlon kneeMID500-STRONG700&#xD;
      products to demonstrate safety and performance of these devices in a real-world setting.&#xD;
