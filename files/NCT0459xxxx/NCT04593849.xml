  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no study evaluating the clinical effect of traditional chinese medicine(TCM) in&#xD;
      topical use on musculotendinous injury, nor is that investigating the effectiveness on bone&#xD;
      fracture healing. We hypothesize that with aid of topical chinese herbal medicine in addition&#xD;
      to oral analgesics can be more beneficial in treating post traumatic injury, launching early&#xD;
      mobilization, and enhancing fracture healing process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthopedic fractures are a common acute health issue, which often accompanied with life-long&#xD;
      burden, accounts up to 34% total lifetime medical costs in the United States. It may also&#xD;
      lead to significant long-term morbidity and, potentially, mortality if treated Improperly.&#xD;
      Initial management is particularly crucial in helping the bone fracture healing process and&#xD;
      reducing comorbidity. Apart from fracture fixation through nonoperative/conservative or&#xD;
      operative methods in aim to restore anatomic alignment, oral analgesics are same important in&#xD;
      Orthopedics patients in symptomatic control and for early mobilization. Non-opioid medication&#xD;
      such as Acetaminophen or NSAIDs are routinely used for injury or postoperative pain&#xD;
      management, despite that inevitable side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding and&#xD;
      inconsistent show concerns of NSAIDs impairing bone healing in historical animal-based&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In which case, topical agents used in traditional chinese medicine(TCM) usually become a&#xD;
      well-placed supplement to relieve inflammatory conditions. In spite of the lack of scientific&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy, topical applications such as Ru- Yih-Jin-Huang-Saan (RYJHS) and&#xD;
      Wan-Yin-Gao(WYG) have been used on musculoskeletal injuries in oriented countries for&#xD;
      centuries, as their transcutaneous transport of the herbal chemicals to deeper tissues show&#xD;
      biological activities of anti-inflammation, reducing swelling soft tissue, angiogenesis,&#xD;
      fracture healing and cellular proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no study evaluating the clinical effect of traditional chinese medicine in&#xD;
      topical use on musculotendinous injury, nor is that investigating the effectiveness on bone&#xD;
      fracture healing. We hypothesize that with aid of topical chinese herbal medicine in addition&#xD;
      to oral analgesics can be more beneficial in treating post traumatic injury, launching early&#xD;
      mobilization, and enhancing fracture healing process.&#xD;

    <description>quantified by Visual Analogue Scale scoring system, Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain&quot;, providing a range of scores from 0-100 [100-mm scale]. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>scored with Dyshidrotic Eczema Area and Severity Index (DASI index). The total score of the DASI results from the sum of severity grade score points of each of the four items (V = vesicles, E = erythema, S = desquamation, I = itch) multiplied by the affected area (A) score points: DASI = (pV + pE + pS + pI) Ã— pA.&#xD;
The maximum possible score is 60. By the DASI, the dyshidrotic eczema is graded as: mild (0-15), moderate (16-30) and severe (31-60).</description>
