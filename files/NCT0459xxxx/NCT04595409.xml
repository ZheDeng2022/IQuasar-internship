        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who provided written informed consent and who are able to complete study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are at least 18 years of age at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with PASI score of at least 12 at screening and at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with involved body surface area of at least 10% at screening and at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of at least 3 at screening&#xD;
             and at baseline by means of a 5-point scoring scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous failure, inadequate response in the opinion of the investigator, intolerance,&#xD;
             or contraindication to at least 1 conventional antipsoriatic systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For female patients (except those at least 2 years postmenopausal or surgically&#xD;
             sterilised): a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients of childbearing potential with a fertile male sexual partner must use&#xD;
             adequate contraception from screening until 4 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
             intervention. Adequate contraception is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or an&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD), combined with at least one of the following forms of&#xD;
             contraception: a diaphragm, cervical cap, or a condom. Total abstinence from&#xD;
             heterosexual activity, in accordance with the lifestyle of the patient, is acceptable.&#xD;
             Female patients must not donate ova starting at screening and throughout the clinical&#xD;
             study period and for 4 months after study intervention administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male patients who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential must agree&#xD;
             they will use adequate contraception if not surgically sterilised and will not donate&#xD;
             sperm from the time of screening until 6 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
             intervention. Adequate contraception for the male patient and his female partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or an IUD combined&#xD;
             with at least one of the following forms of contraception: a diaphragm, cervical cap,&#xD;
             or a condom. Total abstinence from heterosexual activity, in accordance with the&#xD;
             lifestyle of the patient, is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, guttate&#xD;
             psoriasis, medication-induced psoriasis, any other skin disease, or other systemic&#xD;
             inflammatory autoimmune disorder at the time of the screening and baseline visits that&#xD;
             would interfere with evaluations of the effect of study intervention on psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have received any topical psoriasis treatment including corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have received the following treatments for psoriasis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. PUVA phototherapy and/or ultraviolet B phototherapy and/or laser therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Non-biologic psoriasis systemic therapies, tofacitinib, or apremilast&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adalimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Etanercept or secukinumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Infliximab, brodalumab, certolizumab pegol, ixekizumab, golimumab, or alefacept&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients taking drugs that may cause new onset or exacerbation of psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have received ustekinumab or any biologics directly targeting interleukin&#xD;
             (IL) 12 or IL 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with active infection or history of infections as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Any active infection for which systemic anti-infectives were used within 4 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A serious infection, defined as requiring hospitalisation or intravenous&#xD;
                  anti-infectives, within 8 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Evidence of any clinically relevant bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic&#xD;
                  infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Recurrent or chronic infections or other active infection that, in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the investigator, might cause this study to be detrimental to the patient&#xD;
