      The primary objectives are to evaluate the prevalence of LARS and Quality of Life in rectal&#xD;
      cancer patients 3 years after anterior resection, to investigate if anastomotic technique is&#xD;
      a risk factor for major LARS and to study the prevalence of colostomy 3 years after anterior&#xD;
      resection and evaluate stoma function according to the stoma scale in EORTC QLQ-CR29.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who have undergone anterior resection for rectal cancer between Q1 2015 and Q4&#xD;
      2017 have been identified in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR). Three years&#xD;
      after surgery the patients were sent a questionnaire including the LARS (Low Anterior&#xD;
      Resection Syndrome)-score, the quality of life questionnaire EORTC QLQ 30 and CR29 in&#xD;
      addition to a questionnaire regarding prevalence of remaining stoma.The patient cohort will&#xD;
      be divided into two groups operated with total (TME) or partial (PME) mesorectal excision for&#xD;
      further analyses. Patients with a stoma will be analysed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of major LARS and Quality of Life, QoL, 3 years after anterior resection will be&#xD;
      assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and by calculation of LARS Score with categories &quot;no&quot; (0-20&#xD;
      points), &quot;minor&quot; (21-29) and &quot;major&quot; (30-42). The LARS score will be dichotomized into the&#xD;
      categories no/minor and major LARS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stoma function will be evaluated by the stoma scale in EORTC QLQ-CR29.&#xD;

Both QLQ 30 and CR 29 include symptom scales and functional scales from 0-100 with lower scores on symptom scales indicating better quality of life and higher scores on functional scales indicating better quality of life.</description>
