  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic breast cancer may respond well to treatment and metastases can&#xD;
      remain stable for several years. Despite personalised medicine being increasingly used for&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment, follow-up still include radiological response evaluation every 3-4&#xD;
      months, which renders a significant number of 'unnecessary' exams for patients with long-term&#xD;
      stable disease. Increasing evidence indicates that tumour markers such as circulating tumour&#xD;
      DNA (ctDNA), thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) may be useful for&#xD;
      disease monitoring in the metastatic setting. However, algorithms that accurately define the&#xD;
      time-points at which imaging can be foregone or reinstituted when progression is forecast,&#xD;
      have not been developed. This study will measure ctDNA, TK1 and CA15-3 at all imaging&#xD;
      time-points. The primary aim is to develop an algorithm based on these biomarkers, alone or&#xD;
      in combination, that with sufficient specificity and sensitivity can advise whether a scan&#xD;
      can be safely admitted at a specific time-point, for patients with MBC receiving first line&#xD;
      therapy with AI plus cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i). Additional samples will&#xD;
      be stored such that novel biomarkers can also be tested in future. The cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      using the devised biomarker protocol will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/ Human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor negative (HER2-) metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, eligible for 1st line&#xD;
      endocrine therapy with AI + CDK4/6i will be included. Patients will receive standard therapy&#xD;
      (AI + CDK4/6i) and follow-up will proceed according to local guidelines, namely cross&#xD;
      sectional imaging with CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis +/- MRI as required and analysis of CA 15-3,&#xD;
      every 3 cycles for the first year and every 3-4 cycles thereafter. Participation in the study&#xD;
      will include serial blood sampling for the bespoke study biomarkers. Decisions on progression&#xD;
      will be made according to the routine imaging tests and the biomarkers will be subsequently&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the biomarkers ctDNA, TK1 and CA15-3, alone or in&#xD;
      combination, will accurately correlate with disease status in patients receiving AI + CDK4/6i&#xD;
      for metastatic breast cancer such that routine imaging can be delayed until predefined levels&#xD;
      of biomarker progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To develop a biomarker-based prediction model to be used in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer, receiving first line therapy with AI and CDK4/6i, that provides the&#xD;
      physician with a recommendation whether or not a radiological examination is required, based&#xD;
      on the likelihood that the scan will actually show progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the lead time between rising biomarker and subsequent progression on imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the clinical utility of the bespoke biomarkers for disease monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relative value of analysing TK1 &quot;on CDK4/6i treatment&quot; versus &quot;off CDK4/6i&#xD;
           treatment&quot; for disease monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the economic impact of implementation of the chosen prediction model&#xD;
