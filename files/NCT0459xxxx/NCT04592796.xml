    <textblock>
      Introduction: Poor sleep quality is common in most older adults. Because of the progressive&#xD;
      aging of the population in Spain, there are more and more nursing-home and day centers, which&#xD;
      give care to older adults. However, the attention focused on some difficulty related to sleep&#xD;
      has not been thoroughly investigated. The use of wearable devices, which measure some&#xD;
      parameters such as the sleep stages, can help to determine the influence of quality sleep in&#xD;
      the health state among nursing-home residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To analyze the sleep quality and its influence on the daily life of nursing-home&#xD;
      residents through the use of assessment tools and Xiaomi MiBand 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: This is an observational and analytical study whose objective is the&#xD;
      observation and registration of variables of a determined population without the intervention&#xD;
      of the researcher and establishing relations between association variables and causality. It&#xD;
      is also considered as longitudinal since the follow-up of some of the characteristics of the&#xD;
      population will be performed during a period of time. The study is set in a nursing-home in A&#xD;
      Coru単a (Spain). Xiaomi MiBand 2 will be used to measure biomedical parameters and different&#xD;
      assessment tools will be administered to participants for evaluating their sleep quality,&#xD;
      cognitive state, and daily functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, T-Test and ANOVA analysis will be used to compare the means&#xD;
      between variables. Also, a Chi-Square test will be used to study the association of&#xD;
      qualitative variables. Finally, a multivariate analysis of logistic regression will be&#xD;
      performed to determine the variables associated with the presence of the dichotomous variable&#xD;
      of interest.&#xD;

      Introduction: In the aging, some disturbance in the health state, as poor sleep quality or a&#xD;
      sleep disorder, are likely to appear. The disturbances in sleep stages can influence&#xD;
      cognitive state, quality of life, and daily functioning. The progressive aging of the&#xD;
      population has led to an increase in resources for the direct care of older people, with a&#xD;
      60.9% of increase in recent years in Spain. Yet, the sleep role in the health state and the&#xD;
      activities of daily life from older adults in nursing-home and daily centers hasn't been&#xD;
      thoroughly researched. On this issue, wearable devices, which were developed in the last&#xD;
      years, monitor the sleep stages and the activity that people perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective of this study will be to analyze the sleep quality and its&#xD;
      influence on the daily life of nursing-home residents through the use of assessment tools and&#xD;
      Xiaomi MiBand 2. Secondary objectives are 1) To know the situation of older people in a&#xD;
      nursing-home, recording general data, results of assessment instruments and data obtained&#xD;
      from Xiaomi MiBand 2; 2) To explore and determine the quality of life and daily functioning&#xD;
      of the participating older people; 3) To determine the level of the cognitive state of the&#xD;
      participating older people; 4) To analyze the level of physical activity and the quality of&#xD;
      sleep, as well as the factors linked to both constructs, in the older adults who are in a&#xD;
      residence; 5) to promote the use of technological devices in the daily life of older adults,&#xD;
      especially for the empowerment and management of their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Analysis: It is proposed to carry out an observational and analytical study,&#xD;
      whose objective is the observation and registration of variables of a determined population&#xD;
      without the intervention of the researcher and establishing relations between association&#xD;
      variables and causality. Likewise, this study is considered as longitudinal since the&#xD;
      follow-up of the characteristics of this population will be carried out during a period of&#xD;
      time (variables will be followed for 1 year). Specifically, the physical activity and the&#xD;
      sleep of the participating population will be continuously registered and monitored&#xD;
      throughout the entire study. The study will be developed with the resident population in a&#xD;
      nursing-home in A Coru単a (Spain). To measure biomedical parameters from users, it will be&#xD;
      used the Xiaomi MiBand 2. Besides, different assessment tools will be administered to the&#xD;
      participants related to self-perception of sleep quality, cognitive state, and daily&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, quantitative variables will be expressed as mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation, while qualitative variables will be expressed as absolute value and percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare means between them, the Student t-test will be used, and for the multiple&#xD;
      comparisons of means, the analysis of variance will be used. This design is applied when the&#xD;
      data are paired, that is when they come from subjects with variables measured before and&#xD;
      after treatment. This test makes it possible to determine whether the differences between the&#xD;
      values of both variables are statistically significant or whether they are differences due to&#xD;
      chance. To study the association of the qualitative variables, the Chi-square test will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, to determine the variables that are associated or not with the presence of&#xD;
      the dichotomous variable of interest, a multivariate analysis of logistic regression will be&#xD;
      performed, using as a dependent variable the presence or not of the event of interest, and as&#xD;
      covariates, the variables that in the bivariate analysis are associated with the presence of&#xD;
      said event or are clinically relevant.&#xD;

    <measure>Cognitive state</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and completion of the study (two months).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. This tool is used to detect the presence of cognitive impairment. It presents 6 values for each section (Orientation, Fixation, Concentration and calculation, Memory and Language and construction) and their final score. The test has a maximum score of 35 points, with different levels of cognitive impairment from the following scores: Geriatric patients: cut-off point 23/24 (a score lower than 23 implies the existence of cognitive impairment, whereas a score higher than 24 means the absence of cognitive impairment). Non-geriatric patients: cut-off point 27/28 (a score lower than 27 implies the existence of cognitive impairment, whereas a score higher than 28 means the absence of cognitive impairment).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and completion of the study (two months).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). This questionnaire consists of 24 items, of which 19 are answered by the person him/herself and the other 5 by his/her roommate. This tool analyzes the quantity, quality, duration, latency and efficiency of sleep. The total score of the PSQI scale is the result of adding 7 components. Each component is scored from 0 to 3. The total value of this tool can vary from 0 to 21 points, where a score equal to or less than 5 points corresponds to the absence of difficulties in sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait and balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and completion of the study (two months).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Tinetti scale. This tool is used to determine the falling risk of an older person. The tool is divided into two parts, the assessment of balance on the one hand and the assessment of gait on the other. The range of scores goes from 0 (most impairment) to 2 (represents independence) for each item. The maximum score for the balance test is 16 points, and 12 points for the gait test, so the total score is 28. The higher the final score, the better the patient's functionality and the lower the risk of a fall.</description>
