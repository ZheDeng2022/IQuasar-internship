      Protocol PTR-01-002 is a 3-part Phase 2, open-label study of PTR-01. While new patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled, priority will be given to patients that satisfactorily completed study&#xD;
      PTR-01-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, patients will receive a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every week for a total of 4 doses. This&#xD;
      will be followed by Part 2 in which patients will receive a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every other&#xD;
      week for a total of 7 doses. In Part 3, patients will be followed for 12 weeks. No&#xD;
      investigational therapy will be administered during this time. At the end of each dosing&#xD;
      period, an efficacy assessment will be performed. Safety will be assessed continuously&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the end of Part 3, patients may be eligible for a potential long-term extension to&#xD;
      further refine the dosing regimen, depending upon study drug availability.&#xD;

             has provided informed consent form and the minor has signed an assent form&#xD;
             acknowledging that they understand and agree to study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has a diagnosis of RDEB based on genetic analysis and consistent with a recessive&#xD;
             inheritance pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has deficient C7 staining at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) by IF.&#xD;

          5. Be willing and able to comply with this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following will be excluded from participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the inactive ingredients in PTR-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has previously had an anaphylactic reaction to PTR-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received in the last six months any investigational gene therapy product or in the&#xD;
             last three months any non-gene therapy investigational products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is anticipated to receive new regimens of antibiotics or other anti-infectives during&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has any other medical or personal condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the patient, or may preclude&#xD;
