  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-FMPP is a novel PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) tracer which targets to&#xD;
      mitochondria complex I (MC-I). Preclinical animal studies have shown that its uptake is&#xD;
      highly uniform and long in the heart and rather low in the liver. It may be a promising&#xD;
      tracer for myocardial perfusion imaging. In addition, as a myocardial PET tracer, it is&#xD;
      capable of quantifying absolute myocardial blood flow. Thus this prospective and open-label&#xD;
      study is going to evaluate the diagnosis performance of 18F-FMPP PET MPI in suspected or&#xD;
      known CAD patients who will be referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) can provide not only qualitative images, but also&#xD;
      absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) in the unit of ml/min/g to facilitate&#xD;
      the early diagnosis of coronary disease (CAD). It can be more beneficial for patients with&#xD;
      three-vessel disease, microvascular disease or obesity. At present, the diagnostic capability&#xD;
      of 13N-ammonia PET MPI has been well studied, but its clinical usability is largely limited&#xD;
      by short half-life. 18F-labeled MPI tracer (18F-FMPP) is a new type of PET tracer for MPI.&#xD;
      Preclinical studies showed that 18F-FMPP has important characteristics such as high&#xD;
      myocardial retention and low background uptake of adjacent organs, which may be a more ideal&#xD;
      drug for PET MPI toward routine clinical utilization. Our study will assess the safety&#xD;
      profile, image quality and diagnostic performance of 18F-FMPP PET in detection of CAD by&#xD;
      using invasive coronary angiography as the reference standard. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will further compare the diagnostic performance of 18F-FMPP PET MPI with that of 13N-ammonia&#xD;
      PET MPI.&#xD;

    <description>Imaging Procedure: 18F-FMPP PET Day 1: All subjects will receive rest and stress IV boluses of 18F-FMPP injections in a large peripheral vein. The dosages of 18F-FMPP Injection administered at rest and during stress conditions are 2.5 mCi and 6.0 mCi for an individual subject. Rest or stress PET imaging will be acquired for 20 minutes. The pharmacological stress will utilize ATP as the stressor.&#xD;
Imaging Procedure: 13N-Ammonia PET All subjects will receive 2 IV boluses of 13N-ammonia Injection in a large peripheral vein: 1 at rest and 1 during stress. The dosages of 13N-ammonia Injection administered at rest and during stress conditions is 20mCi and 20 mCi for an individual subject. Rest or stress PET imaging will be acquired for 20 minutes. The pharmacological stress will utilize ATP as the stressor.</description>
