    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares a home-based telemonitoring program that collects symptom and&#xD;
      daily step information to surgeon only care in improving recovery and stopping complications&#xD;
      within 30 days after surgery in patients with gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or gynecologic&#xD;
      cancer who are scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery. Patients may experience a decrease in&#xD;
      functional capacity and experience symptoms like pain and fatigue after surgery, and this may&#xD;
      change their ability to walk and function. Home-based telemonitoring of patient symptoms and&#xD;
      their ability to walk and function after surgery may help doctors and nurses find and treat&#xD;
      problems early, which may improve the patient's recovery and lower the number of&#xD;
      complications after surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the impact of remote perioperative telemonitoring care versus surgeon only&#xD;
      perioperative care on clinically significant changes in functional recovery (accelerometer&#xD;
      daily step count) and related secondary patient-centered outcomes (sleep, sedentary time,&#xD;
      symptom severity, symptom interference with daily activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the impact of remote perioperative telemonitoring care versus surgeon only&#xD;
      perioperative care on postoperative complications (Comprehensive Complications Index - CCI)&#xD;
      and related secondary surgical outcomes (hospital readmission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare early withdrawal (dropout or loss of accelerometer device) between the&#xD;
      comparators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore perioperative telemonitoring care-related experiences (acceptability, technology&#xD;
      usability, uptake/integration) among patients, families, and surgeons through qualitative&#xD;
      focus groups and exit interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (REMOTE PERIOPERATIVE TELEMONITORING CARE GROUP): Before surgery, patients complete a&#xD;
      functional and nutritional assessment. The home environment of patients will also be&#xD;
      assessed. Based on findings, patients undergo personalized prehabilitation. Patients also&#xD;
      wear an actigraph throughout the study to measure and record daily steps taken and sedentary&#xD;
      time. Patients use the TapCloud application (app) on a smart device (phone, tablet) or home&#xD;
      computer to collect, track, and report their symptoms. Based on patient input in the TapCloud&#xD;
      app, a real-time alert is sent to a registered nurse (RN) when predetermined thresholds are&#xD;
      met. RNs then contact the patient via the TapCloud app and further phone calls if necessary.&#xD;
      Patients, caregivers and surgeons may also participate in a focus group in-person, via&#xD;
      telephone, or videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (SURGEON ONLY PERIOPERATIVE CARE GROUP): Patients and their families meet with the&#xD;
      surgeon at least once before surgery. After surgery, patients are managed daily during&#xD;
      post-operative care. Patients may receive a referral for functional and nutritional&#xD;
      prehabilitation at the discretion of the surgeon/surgical team. Patients and their families&#xD;
      receive instructions to follow the standard procedures for reporting problems between clinic&#xD;
      visits, including contacting their surgical team if symptoms become severe and physical&#xD;
      function worsens; and the use of the hospital call line to report problems. Patients,&#xD;
      caregivers and surgeons may receive the opportunity to participate in focus group in-person,&#xD;
      via telephone, or videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3-4 months.&#xD;
