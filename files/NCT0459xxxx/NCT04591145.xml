  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A deep learning based system to calculate the proportion of Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS)&#xD;
      score of 0-1 during withdrawal phase has been constructed previously. This multi-center study&#xD;
      is going to perform a prospective observational study to validate the threshold of the&#xD;
      adequate proportion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate bowel preparation is insufficient for identification of polyps greater than 5 mm.&#xD;
      However, bowel preparation assessment involved subjectivity and uncertainty. We constructed a&#xD;
      deep learning based system to calculate the proportion of Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS)&#xD;
      score of 0-1 during withdrawal phase and performed a prospective observational study to&#xD;
      validate the threshold of the adequate proportion.The multi-center study is aimed to verify&#xD;
      the extrapolation and robustness of the scoring threshold based on artificial intelligence&#xD;
      intestinal cleanliness evaluation system explored in the early stage, and propose a more&#xD;
      accurate and quantifiable threshold for evaluating the eligibility of intestinal preparation.&#xD;
