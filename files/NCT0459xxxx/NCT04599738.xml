  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millet is a functional grain that has attracted the attention of scientists for many years&#xD;
      due to its significant benefits to human health. Research has shown that millets have a high&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity and polyphenol content which can contribute to a reduced risk of some&#xD;
      chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and its complications. This study aimed to assess&#xD;
      the glycaemic response (GR), insulinaemic response (IR) and gastric emptying (GE) after the&#xD;
      consumption of millet-based muffins in pre-diabetic and healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single-blind, randomized controlled crossover study in which participants consumed&#xD;
      one control muffin (wheat) and one test muffin (millet). During each session, participants&#xD;
      were required to consume either the test or the control muffin, consuming the alternative on&#xD;
      the next visit. Then, 10 finger-prick blood samples were taken for the determination of&#xD;
      glucose and insulin over 4 hours. 13Carbon (13C) sodium acetate was added to the muffins&#xD;
      (control and test) in order to measure gastric emptying from the breath samples collected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the glycaemic response (GR), insulinaemic response (IR) and&#xD;
      gastric emptying (GE) after the consumption of millet-based muffins in pre-diabetic and&#xD;
      healthy participants. This was a single-blind, randomized controlled crossover study in which&#xD;
      participants consumed one control muffin (wheat) and one test muffin (millet).This study&#xD;
      investigated the effect of polyphenol-rich millet-based muffin on glycaemic response (GR),&#xD;
      insulinaemic response (IR) and gastric emptying (GE) in healthy and pre-diabetic participants&#xD;
      (people with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not yet&#xD;
      high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes - the normal fasting blood glucose level is below 6.1&#xD;
      mmol/l or 108 mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After potential participants have read the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and signed the&#xD;
      consent form, they were screened during the first visit to measure fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      (FBG; fasting blood glucose should be between 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l for pre-diabetic participants&#xD;
      and &lt; 6.1 mmol/l for healthy participants ).If eligible for the study, body weight and height&#xD;
      and blood pressure were taken in the Functional Food Centre (currently known as Oxford&#xD;
      Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health). If the fasting blood glucose test was less than&#xD;
      6.1mmol/l (participants were informed of their fasting blood glucose result and given the&#xD;
      choice either to do Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to check for Impaired Glucose&#xD;
      Tolerance (IGT), participate in the healthy group or to be excluded). If the participant&#xD;
      agreed to continue and had one or more of the pre-diabetes inclusion criteria, they could&#xD;
      complete an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) over 2 hours.( An oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      involves taking a fasting sample of blood and then taking a very sweet drink containing 75g&#xD;
      of glucose. After having this drink participants had to stay at rest until a further blood&#xD;
      sample is taken after 2 hours.) If their 2 h blood glucose result was between 7.9 to 11.0&#xD;
      mmol/l, they were considered eligible to participate in the study as a prediabetic&#xD;
      participant, and were asked to come for a subsequent visit in order to begin the study. If&#xD;
      the participant does not have IGT, they had the option to take part in the study as a healthy&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
