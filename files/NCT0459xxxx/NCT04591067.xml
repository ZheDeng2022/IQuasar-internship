    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study investigates the physical capacity of patients, who have undergone&#xD;
      a periacetabular osteotomy for hip dysplasia within the last 1-5 years.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip dysplasia is a common disease both worldwide and among the Danish population. The disease&#xD;
      is characterized by a shallow and oblique acetabulum, resulting in insufficient coverage of&#xD;
      the femoral head. The abnormalities of the dysplastic hip joint lead to altered biomechanical&#xD;
      adaptations, highly affecting the physical capacity of patients. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      patients with hip dysplasia experience reduced muscle strength and gait abnormalities, when&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, approximately 200 Danes with hip dysplasia are treated with periacetabular&#xD;
      osteotomy (PAO). As the preferable joint-preserving surgical treatment for younger patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic hip dysplasia, the PAO reduces prevalence of muscle-tendon-related pain and&#xD;
      improves hip and groin related patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). By extension,&#xD;
      studies report a hip survival rate of approximately 75% 12 years following PAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, little is known about objective measures of physical capacity following PAO. Despite&#xD;
      reducing muscle-tendon-related pain and improving PROMs, gait adaptations still remain and&#xD;
      studies report no improvements in muscle strength, nor in the physical activity profile, 1&#xD;
      year following treatment with PAO. Thus, the field calls for research aiming to identify&#xD;
      parameters of impaired physical capacity in patients treated with PAO. Thorough knowledge of&#xD;
      physical capacity in these patients may contribute to the establishment of a science-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategy, potentially improving physical activity, function, work capacity and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to analyse and identify parameters of impaired physical&#xD;
      capacity in patients with hip dysplasia 1-5 years following treatment with PAO. Gait&#xD;
      function, defined as peak hip extension angle and peak hip flexor moment, is chosen as the&#xD;
      primary outcome, due to previously shown correlations between the extent of gait impairments&#xD;
      and the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As recommended by the International Hip-related Pain Research Network (IHiPRN), measurements&#xD;
      of physical capacity in patients with hip-related pain should include: clinical measures,&#xD;
      laboratory-based measures, measures of physical activity and return to physical activity.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of this study are: muscle activity during level walking and walking with&#xD;
      inclination, endurance and pain during walking, range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, hip&#xD;
      and muscle-tendon-related pain, radiographic measures and PROMs (present level of physical&#xD;
      activity and sports &amp; activity level prior to and after treatment with PAO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that patients with the lowest scores of HAGOS subscales pain and&#xD;
      sport/recreation will have the lowest physical capacity, measured as: gait impairments,&#xD;
      reduced muscle strength and prevalence of muscle-tendon-related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty subjects from across the country, aged 18-40 years, who have undergone a PAO for hip&#xD;
      dysplasia within the last 1-5 years, will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All testing will be performed at Hvidovre Hospital.&#xD;
