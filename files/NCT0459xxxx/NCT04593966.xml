  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal tangles which are usually believed&#xD;
      congenital. AVM can cause different symptoms depending on where it is located, but the most&#xD;
      common symptoms are intracranial hemorrhage and seizure. Outcomes of AVM patients can be very&#xD;
      different due to factors like the location of lesion, age, sex etc. Generally, more early the&#xD;
      intervention was taken, the risk of adverse events would be lower. But the selection of&#xD;
      surgical timing for pediatric AVM patients is hard to judge, due to children's cerebral&#xD;
      vessels angioarchitecture can be still developing with their age. Some previous studies&#xD;
      indicated that there is no difference in intervention outcomes between pediatric and adult&#xD;
      AVM patients, so pediatric patients should undergo more aggressive intervention. DOPA study&#xD;
      aims to compare the clinical intervention outcomes of both pediatric and adult patients with&#xD;
      eloquent region cerebral arteriovenous malformations, helping to determine the treatment&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;

      Follow-up: In the investigators' neurosurgical center, follow-up was conducted for all&#xD;
      participants at the first 3-6 months and annually after discharge by clinical visit and&#xD;
      telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study overview: DOPA will aim on outcomes of both pediatric and adult AVMs patients who&#xD;
      underwent intervention in investigators' institution. Intervention strategies contains&#xD;
      microsurgical resection, embolization, embolization + radiosurgery, and single-stage hybrid&#xD;
      surgery (embolization + resection). Outcomes will be measured by a neurologist using Modified&#xD;
      Rankin Scale (mRs). Participants' mRs&lt;2 will be considered as a good outcome and&#xD;
      investigators will keep follow-up with every patient for at least 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: About 300 patients will be enrolled in this study, and adults and children will&#xD;
      account for half. All kinds of intervention will be included. The distribution of different&#xD;
      strategies is excepted as: 30% resection, 20% embolization, 30% embolization + radiosurgery&#xD;
      and 20% hybrid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: The patients' mRs, occlusion rate and complication will be evaluated at 2&#xD;
      weeks, discharge from hospital, 1 year and 3 years after the first-time intervention.&#xD;
