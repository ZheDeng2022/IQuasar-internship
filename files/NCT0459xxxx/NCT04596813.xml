  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical circulatory support, specifically implantable continuous flow left ventricular&#xD;
      assist device (CF-LVAD) therapy has been established as a viable treatment for rapidly&#xD;
      deteriorating patients suffering from end stage heart failure either as bridge or alternative&#xD;
      to heart transplantation. However, a large proportion of these patients experience severe&#xD;
      complications in the early postoperative period including right ventricular failure or multi&#xD;
      organ failure leading to increased mortality. The leading theory explaining these&#xD;
      complications involves exaggerated systemic inflammatory response prior to, during and early&#xD;
      after CF-LVAD insertion. Among the cytokines IL-6 appears to play a major role. There is&#xD;
      increasing demonstration of the efficacy of a cytokine haemoadsorption (HA) technology in&#xD;
      attenuating cytokine response and particularly IL-6 in various inflammatory states and&#xD;
      emerging data on the safety of the Cytosorb® device in routine and complex cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team hypothesizes that Cytosorb® treatment is feasible and safe in heart failure&#xD;
      patients undergoing LVAD insertion and that it is effective in attenuating IL-6 secretion&#xD;
      with benefit in the wider inflammatory and metabolic response to this high-risk surgery.&#xD;

      The principle objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the efficacy of Cytosorb® treatment in attenuating perioperative changes&#xD;
           in IL-6 during CF-LVAD implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the feasibility, and safety of Cytosorb® treatment during CF-LVAD&#xD;
           implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To pilot the effect of Cytosorb® treatment on vasoplegia and organ dysfunction with&#xD;
           specific focus on right ventricle failure, liver failure and acute kidney injury (AKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To establish a collaborative biobank of patient's biological samples to allow extensive&#xD;
           characterisation of patient phenotype prior to CF-LVAD implantation and their individual&#xD;
           inflammatory and metabolic responses to surgery and perioperative management.&#xD;
