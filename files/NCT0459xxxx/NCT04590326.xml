      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Escalation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of REGN5668 alone and in&#xD;
           separate combinations with cemiplimab or REGN4018, in order to determine a maximally&#xD;
           tolerated dose(s) (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of these combinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Expansion Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary efficacy of REGN5668 in combination with cemiplimab or&#xD;
           REGN4018, (separately by cohort and combination) as determined by the objective response&#xD;
           rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Escalation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary efficacy of REGN5668 in combination with cemiplimab or&#xD;
           REGN4018 (separately by cohort and combination) as determined by ORR by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Expansion Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety profile in each expansion cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the PK of REGN5668 in combination with cemiplimab or REGN4018&#xD;
           (separately by cohort and combination)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess preliminary efficacy of REGN5668 in combination with cemiplimab or REGN4018&#xD;
           (separately by cohort and combination) as measured by ORR based on immune based therapy&#xD;
           RECIST (iRECIST), best overall response (BOR), duration of response (DOR), disease&#xD;
           control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS) based on RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in CA-125 levels from baseline after treatment with REGN5668 in&#xD;
           combinations with cemiplimab or REGN4018 (separately by cohort and combination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunogenicity of REGN5668, alone and in combinations with cemiplimab or REGN4018&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced epithelial ovarian&#xD;
             cancer (except carcinosarcoma), primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has&#xD;
             received at least 1 line of platinum-based systemic therapy as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In dose escalation, patients will provide either newly obtained biopsy (newly obtained&#xD;
             biopsies at screening are required unless medically inappropriate and discussed with&#xD;
             medical monitor. If fresh biopsies are not appropriate, and after sponsor approval,&#xD;
             archived tumor tissue in dose escalation is acceptable. In dose expansion, patients&#xD;
             will provide a fresh tumor biopsy in screening and on treatment. Hence, in expansion&#xD;
             cohorts, only patients who (in the opinion of the investigator) have accessible&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Expansion cohorts only: Has at least 1 lesion that is measurable by RECIST 1.1. Tumor&#xD;
             lesions in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has&#xD;

             immunotherapy) within 3 weeks or has not yet recovered as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior anti-cancer immunotherapy as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received radiation therapy or major surgery within 14 days of first administration&#xD;
             of study drug as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has had another malignancy within the last 5 years that is progressing, requires&#xD;
             active treatment, or has a high likelihood of recurrence as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior treatment with a MUC16-targeted therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Expansion cohorts only: More than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for&#xD;
             platinum-experienced and/or intolerant disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has any condition that requires ongoing/continuous corticosteroid therapy as defined&#xD;
             in the protocol within 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments as defined in the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has untreated or active primary brain tumor, CNS metastases, leptomeningeal disease,&#xD;
             or spinal cord compression as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has encephalitis, meningitis, organic brain disease (eg, Parkinson's disease) or&#xD;
             uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has history of clinically significant cardiovascular disease as defined in the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
