  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, observational, cohort study to determine the impact of integrated&#xD;
      diagnostics using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, whole genome sequencing and&#xD;
      digital pathology on intended patient management for liver cancer patients referred for liver&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with primary or secondary liver cancer will be recruited from Hampshire&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in Basingstoke or Oxford University Hospitals NHSFoundation&#xD;
      Trust in Oxford. The incidence of treatable liver tumours is on the rise globally, driven by&#xD;
      obesity, viral hepatitis and metastases from colorectal cancers. Survival rates can be&#xD;
      improved with optimised allocation of treatment options including surgical resection,&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation, embolisation, chemotherapy and targeted molecular therapies&#xD;
      (including immunotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key motivation of this study is to help patients access the most suitable treatment&#xD;
      combinations, based on integrating clinical, radiological and genomic data. A similar&#xD;
      integrated approach, integrating radiology and pathology, has been shown to improve outcomes&#xD;
      in breast cancer care. Detailed pathologic analysis of the surgical specimen from breast&#xD;
      carcinoma biopsy provides valuable feedback to the radiologist, establishes the completeness&#xD;
      of surgical intervention, and generates predictive information for therapeutic decisions.&#xD;
      Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has discovered cancer driver mutations and the complex&#xD;
      molecular profile of liver cancer. In many metastatic solid tumours, WGS has been used to&#xD;
      identify a significant patient population (31%) who present with a biomarker that predicts&#xD;
      sensitivity to a drug and lacked any known resistance biomarkers for the same drug.&#xD;
      Identifying which patients possess druggable mutations will allow clinicians to make the&#xD;
      optimal treatment decisions. The next challenge is integrating WGS into scalable clinical&#xD;
      practice&#xD;

    <description>All participants will attend their planned outpatient surgery appointment.The consultant will document the intended treatment plan for each participant in line with their usual care pathway.Following this, participants will be required to attend three dedicated study visits:The results of the MRI scans from Study Visit 1 will be analysed into a LiverMultiScan report.A report will be sent to the consultant who will review their original documented care plan alongside the LiverMultiScan report.The consultant may update the intended care plan as a result of the LiverMultiScan report, in line with the device CE-marking.Any changes to the care plan will be documented.The patient will then undergo their planned treatment.The tumour explant will be collected and samples will be stored, transported and processed for genetic sequencing and digital histopathology.Study Visit 2 will be performed remotely 12 months following their planned treatment,where patient reported outcomes will be collected</description>

        The primary endpoint of the study is an evaluation of the number of patients for whom&#xD;
        clinically actionable data is provided by whole genome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on the following information, we will aim to recruit 200 patients from HHFT and&#xD;
        expect to observe at least a 25% change in intended clinical management (at 95% confidence&#xD;
        interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recent study using whole-genome analyses of metastatic solid tumours identified 31%&#xD;
             of patients who present with a biomarker that predicts sensitivity to a drug and&#xD;
             lacked any known resistance biomarkers for the same drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The primary end-point can be achieved with only the first study visit, and so no&#xD;
             drop-out is expected.&#xD;
