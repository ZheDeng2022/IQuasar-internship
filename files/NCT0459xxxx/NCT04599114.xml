    <textblock>
      Patients will atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm, frequently go to the&#xD;
      emergency room in order to manage their condition. This study will use a chart review to look&#xD;
      at the characteristics and frequency of atrial fibrillation patients who go to the emergency&#xD;
      room. In addition to the chart review, patients with atrial fibrillation who have recently&#xD;
      gone to the emergency room or have been hospitalized will be approached and asked if they&#xD;
      want to use an electronic health care system that can be accessed by both themselves and&#xD;
      their health care providers. Along with the system, patients will be given a Health Canada&#xD;
      approved heart rhythm sensor, so patients will be able to record their heart rhythm when they&#xD;
      feel symptoms and send the information to the heart rhythm team. The heart rhythm team will&#xD;
      then make real-time recommendations to the patient about how they can manage their rhythm and&#xD;
      symptoms. Patients will be asked to complete satisfaction and quality of life surveys. Our&#xD;
      goal is to provide efficient and effective care for patients with AF, resulting in decreased&#xD;
      repeat ED visits.&#xD;

    <description>Survey-based experience will be determined by the &quot;Virtual AF Care Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire&quot;. The questionnaire consists of 5 questions regarding the VIRTUES platform using a 5 point likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) in addition to a final open ended question asking for feedback regarding the application.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) questionnaire is a well-validated questionnaire with 2 sections. The first section asked about a patient's incidence of atrial fibrillation, the second section inquires as to the presence of atrial fibrillation symptomsand how limiting they were. In general, higher scores mean more frequent atrial fibrillation symptoms that are very/extremely limiting and bothersome.</description>
