  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: Although regional anesthesia (RA) techniques are advantageous in the anesthetic&#xD;
      management of obese patients (body mass index (BMI)≥30); their performances can still be&#xD;
      associated with technical difficulties and greater failure rates. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the performance properties and analgesic efficacy of ultrasound (US)-guided bilateral&#xD;
      thoracic paravertebral blocks (TPVBs) in obese and non-obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval; data of 82 patients, who&#xD;
      underwent elective bilateral reduction mammaplasty under general anesthesia with adjunctive&#xD;
      TPVB analgesia between December of 2016 and February of 2020, were reviewed. Patients were&#xD;
      allocated into two groups with respect to their BMI scores (Group NO: BMI&lt;30 and Group O:&#xD;
      BMI≥30). Demographics, TPVB ideal US image visualization and performance times, needle tip&#xD;
      visualisation and TPVB performance difficulties, number of needle maneuvers, surgical,&#xD;
      anesthetic and analgesic follow-up parameters, incidence of postoperative nausea vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV), sleep duration, length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital stay, patient&#xD;
      and surgeon satisfaction scores were all investigated and compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim: The number of obese patients (body mass index (BMI)≥30) has increased dramatically&#xD;
      worldwide, and we, as anesthesiologists, routinely come up against them in our daily clinical&#xD;
      practice. Although the preference of various peripheral and neuroaxial regional anesthesia&#xD;
      (RA) techniques seems to be advantageous in the anesthetic management of these patients,&#xD;
      their performances can also be associated with technical difficulties and greater failure&#xD;
      rates. The aim of this study is to compare the performance properties and analgesic efficacy&#xD;
      of ultrasound (US)-guided thoracic paravertebral blocks (TPVBs) in obese and non-obese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval; data of 82 patients, who&#xD;
      underwent elective bilateral reduction mammaplasty under general anesthesia with adjunctive&#xD;
      TPVB analgesia between December of 2016 and February of 2020, were reviewed. Patients were&#xD;
      allocated into two groups with respect to their BMI scores (Group NO: BMI&lt;30 and Group O:&#xD;
      BMI≥30). Demographics, TPVB ideal US image visualization and performance times, needle tip&#xD;
      visualisation and TPVB performance difficulties, number of needle maneuvers, surgical,&#xD;
      anesthetic and analgesic follow-up parameters, incidence of postoperative nausea vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV), sleep duration, length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital stay, patient&#xD;
      and surgeon satisfaction scores were all investigated and compared. Student's t,&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney-U and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
