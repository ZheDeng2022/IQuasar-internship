      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of a topical sodium bicarbonate&#xD;
      lotion on physiological and psychological responses associated with hydration status and&#xD;
      fluid balance in humans during passive heat stress. Currently, the ingestion of sodium has&#xD;
      been an effective measure for improvements in fluid regulation and hydration status in&#xD;
      humans. However, the investigators do not know its regulatory relationship with measurements&#xD;
      of fluid balance when supplemented through the skin.&#xD;

      Design This laboratory study is a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover design involving 20&#xD;
      participants (20 males) from the local community and university. This project will be&#xD;
      conducted within the thermal physiology laboratory, complete with a climatic chamber&#xD;
      (Cantrol, CES +13/+44) located within the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) at the&#xD;
      University of Connecticut. The investigators expect each interested individual will complete&#xD;
      both phases included within the study design within a randomized, counterbalanced order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant grouping orders will be randomly assigned by the project's lead student&#xD;
      investigator (Jeb Struder). Each phase will be fairly similar in procedures completed;&#xD;
      however, one phase will be completed with a trial that introduces a biomedical intervention&#xD;
      (sodium bicarbonate topical lotion; PR group), while the other phase will be completed with a&#xD;
      trial that introduces a placebo (PLA group) product similar to the biomedical intervention.&#xD;
      Approximately 24 hours should pass between the completion of each session within a phase of&#xD;
      the study. Additionally, approximately 3 days should pass between the completion of a phase&#xD;
      and the initiation of the next phase (5th session completed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental Conditions Sessions I, II, and III of both counterbalanced groups (PR and PLA)&#xD;
      will all be completed within thermoneutral conditions. Session IV of both counterbalanced&#xD;
      groups (PR and PLA) will be conducted within the climatic chamber set to a climate with&#xD;
      ambient temperature at approximately 33C (91.4F) and relative humidity at approximately 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessments (PR/PLAI, PR/PLAII, PR/PLA III) Baseline visits should be completed over&#xD;
      3 consecutive days for the establishment of baseline measurements regarding the participant's&#xD;
      body weight, dietary behaviors, and hydration status. Each assessment will be performed at&#xD;
      the relatively same time of day (early to late morning) and will involve approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes spent within the laboratory space of the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL). All&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment sessions will consist of fairly similar data collection procedures and&#xD;
      will begin with the participant providing the completed 24-h dietary recall log, thirst&#xD;
      perception scale, and filled urine jug to the administrating researcher. Additionally, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to provide a morning urine sample and nude body weight for the&#xD;
      assessment of session-specific hydration status and Fluid Retention Index (FRI). Furthermore,&#xD;
      once these tasks are completed, an HPL trained researcher will conduct a blood draw for the&#xD;
      collection of approximately ½ teaspoon of blood. Each session will deviate slightly in&#xD;
      additional tasks required for completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (PR/PLAI): After the collection of a morning urine sample and nude body weight&#xD;
      measurement, the participant's height (for additional anthropometrics) and resting blood&#xD;
      pressure (for safety precautions) will be measured. Additionally, after the completion of the&#xD;
      blood draw, the final task for this session will be the participant's familiarization to the&#xD;
      Cognitive/Perceptual Battery tasks that you will be tested during Session 4 (PR/PLAIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 (PR/PLAII): After the collection of a morning urine sample and nude body weight&#xD;
      measurement, the participant will be asked to rest within a comfortable position for&#xD;
      approximately 10-15 minutes for the measurement of their resting heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 (PR/PLAIII): After the collection of a morning urine sample and nude body weight&#xD;
      measurement, the participant will have their body fat percentage measured via handheld Lange&#xD;
      Skinfold Calipers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Trial (PR/PLAIV) Pre-Testing Procedures Prior to completing all Intervention&#xD;
      Trial visits, participants will be asked to drink 500 mL of water before going to bed and an&#xD;
      additional 500 mL of water upon waking to ensure proper hydration. If morning sample urine&#xD;
      USG is ≤1.020, participants will be cleared to participate. If the participant arrives with a&#xD;
      urine USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink an additional 500 mL of&#xD;
      water prior to entering the chamber to ensure proper hydration status. If participants arrive&#xD;
      at the lab with a urine USG &gt;1.025, the visit will be rescheduled for the following day. In&#xD;
      addition to completing a morning urine spot sample, participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      nude body mass measurement as well as provide their completed thirst perception scale,&#xD;
      dietary recall log, and urine jug. Furthermore, using the urine and nude body weight&#xD;
      measurements collected, the session-specific FRI will be assessed. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      participant will be provided a standardized breakfast. Once the participant has indicated&#xD;
      they are finished with their meal, resting blood pressure measurements will be conducted.&#xD;
      Once all measurements have been completed, participants will have a venous cannula inserted&#xD;
      by an HPL trained research team member. Finally, prior to entering the environmental chamber,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to privately insert the rectal thermometer 10-15 cm beyond&#xD;
      the anal sphincter in addition to completing an additional nude body mass measurement and&#xD;
      being fitted with a heart rate strap by the administrating research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection - Initial 120-minutes Upon the completion of participant arrival procedures,&#xD;
      participants will then be permitted to enter the environmental chamber (~33C [91.4F], ~25%&#xD;
      relative humidity) where they will be instructed to sit down and begin a 30-minute period of&#xD;
      environmental equilibration. Once this period has been initiated the participant will be&#xD;
      asked to complete their baseline measurements in regard to the Cognitive/Perceptual Battery.&#xD;
      After the equilibration period has been completed, the participant will have their resting&#xD;
      blood pressure measured, provide a baseline blood sample (~11 mL), and then provide both a&#xD;
      urine sample and nude body weight measurement. Once all of these tasks have been completed,&#xD;
      the participant will be provided approximately 50 g of the topical lotion (i.e. PR Lotion or&#xD;
      Placebo) to apply to their upper body. Afterwards, blood samples (~3 mL) will be collected&#xD;
      approximately 15- and 30-minutes post-lotion application. Furthermore, the hyperhydration&#xD;
      protocol will be initiated at the 30-minute post-lotion application time point. During this&#xD;
      time period, the first of 4 fluid boluses will be provided to the participant for consumption&#xD;
      with instructions to consume all fluids provided within the allotted 15-minute time period&#xD;
      before the provision of their next fluid bolus. Additionally, before the 3rd fluid bolus has&#xD;
      been provided for consumption (identified as time point -30 min in Figure 4), another blood&#xD;
      sample (~11 mL) will be completed before completing the rest of the hyperhydration protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperhydration Protocol To induce hyperhydration, participants will drink a total fluid&#xD;
      volume of approximately 25 mL/kg of fat free mass (FFM) of water. These solutions will be&#xD;
      pre-measured and provided within four enclosed water bottles for consumption at a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 6.5 mL/kg FFM about every 15 minutes within a duration of approximately 60&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical Solution Procedures Approximately 50 grams of the topical solution will be&#xD;
      pre-measured into 2 separate plastic bags and provided to the participant for application.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to apply the solution primarily to areas of their upper&#xD;
      extremities which will include an identified area from the wrist up to the clavicular area of&#xD;
      the shoulder in addition to their chest, neck, upper back, midsection, and lower back if&#xD;
      enough solution is available. Application will be considered complete when the solution has&#xD;
      been transmitted to the skin in a fashion to where no residue from the lotion is visible by&#xD;
      researchers from the skin of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection - 3-hour Protocol Collection of Blood Samples Aside from the baseline blood&#xD;
      sample collected around the -90-minute time point, an initial blood sample will occur at time&#xD;
      point 0 min, where approximately 11 mL of blood will be collected via the inserted cannula.&#xD;
      Similar blood samples will be collected at time intervals of approximately 60-minutes up to&#xD;
      the completion of the data collection protocol, occurring around the 180-minute mark&#xD;
      (approximately 3-hours). In total, approximately 72 mL of blood will be collected during the&#xD;
      Intervention Trial, which is less than ¼ of the amount of blood collected during a blood&#xD;
      donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Urine Samples and Body Weight Measurements For the collection of all urine spot&#xD;
      samples, researchers will provide a clean cup and top to seal the capsule. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to provide a sample regardless of urgency to urinate at specific time points during&#xD;
      the trial. If the participant is unable to provide a sample at the time point requested, no&#xD;
      protocol deviation will be considered as the lack in sample provided will still be used&#xD;
      towards the completion of data analysis. Furthermore, if the participant must provide a urine&#xD;
      sample without being requested by a research team member, any urine expelled will be added to&#xD;
      the amount collected (if any) during the next urine sample collection time point.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be instructed to complete a measurement of nude body weight&#xD;
      completed before the provision of a urine sample. Both the collection of urine samples and&#xD;
      measurement of body weight will be completed within the privacy of a bathroom. Aside from the&#xD;
      baseline measurement completed around the -90-minute time point, the initial urine sample&#xD;
      collection and body weight measurement for the intervention (i.e. PR Lotion or Placebo) will&#xD;
      approximately occur at time point 0-minutes and supplementary urine collection and body&#xD;
      weight measurement will be completed in 30-minute intervals up to the end of the data&#xD;
      collection period, occurring around the 180-minute mark (approximately 3-hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of Cognitive/Perceptual Battery Aside from the baseline Cognitive/Perceptual&#xD;
      Battery completed around the -115-minute time point, the initial Cognitive/Perceptual Battery&#xD;
      will be completed at time point 0-minutes. Completion of supplemental Cognitive/Perceptual&#xD;
      Batteries will be continually measured within a 60-minute time interval from time point&#xD;
      0-minutes until the completion of data collection which will coincide with the 180-minute&#xD;
      time point (approximately 3-hours).&#xD;
