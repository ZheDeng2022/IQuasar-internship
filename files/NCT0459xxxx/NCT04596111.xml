  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between the changes in&#xD;
      physiological variables based on fitness testing and the changes in rowing performance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The literature has shown that both aerobic capacity and anaerobic capacity are important for&#xD;
      exercise performance in rowing. Simple fitness tests (e.g., the modified Wingate test and the&#xD;
      graded exercise test) have been validated to examine aerobic and anaerobic capacities in&#xD;
      rowers. However, it remains unclear whether these fitness tests can be used to track rowing&#xD;
      performance changes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between the&#xD;
      changes in fitness test outcomes and the changes in rowing performance. The investigators&#xD;
      expect that improvements in rowing performance are closely related to improvements in fitness&#xD;
      test outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend two sessions of fitness testing, one in the fall 2020 and one in the&#xD;
      spring 2021. Each session will include the modified Wingate test to examine anaerobic&#xD;
      capacity, the graded exercise test to examine the aerobic capacity, and the 2,000-meter&#xD;
      rowing test on rowing ergometers to assess rowing performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Wingate test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 minutes of warm-up at 40-50% of heart rate reserve, the participants will perform 30&#xD;
      seconds of rowing at maximal effort on the rowing ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graded exercise test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workload will start from 25 Watts and it will be increased by 25 Watts by each stage until&#xD;
      exhaustion. Each stage includes 2 minutes of rowing and 1 minute of rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2,000-meter rowing test: A 2,000-meter race simulation will be performed using an indoor&#xD;
      rowing ergometer.&#xD;
