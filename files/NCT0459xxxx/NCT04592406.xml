  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Maastricht University Medical Centre (Maastricht UMC+) a specialised unit was established&#xD;
      where a dual screening process including both renal and cardiac parameters is used to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury as well as the risk of prophylactic&#xD;
      hydration in eGFR&lt;30mL/min/1.73m2 patients. Very little data exists on patients with eGFR&#xD;
      &lt;30mL/min/1.73m2 in this context. The current study aims to describe post-contrast outcomes&#xD;
      of patients to whom this screening method has been applied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large retrospective observational study, including 4-years of elective procedures with&#xD;
      intravascular iodinated contrast administration in eGFR&lt;30mL/min/1.73m2 patients at&#xD;
      Maastricht UMC+, found that prophylactic intravenous hydration might confer some benefit for&#xD;
      renal function. For patients who had received prophylactic hydration, adjusted odds ratios&#xD;
      for risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury, and 1-month eGFR decline and dialysis were all&#xD;
      lower than 1. These results were not significant, but suggest that hydration may be&#xD;
      protective. On the other hand, adjusted odds ratios for all-cause mortality within 1-month&#xD;
      post-contrast were higher than 1, with point estimates indicating a trend toward higher risk&#xD;
      of short-term mortality after prophylaxis as compared to no prophylaxis. Confounding by&#xD;
      indication may be responsible for the observed increased risk of short-term mortality, but&#xD;
      complications of the prophylaxis did contribute towards the risk. Amongst the 281&#xD;
      eGFR&lt;30mL/min/1.73m2 prophylaxis patients studied, 18 (6.4%) serious complications occurred:&#xD;
      3 arrhythmias, and 15 heart failures including 5 deaths. Of all 21 deaths recorded for the&#xD;
      prophylaxis patients, 24% (5/21) were considered to be related to intravenous fluids. An&#xD;
      exploration of differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without&#xD;
      serious complications suggested that these can be avoided if cardiac function parameters are&#xD;
      given extra and individual attention before deciding whether to administer prophylaxis to&#xD;
      high-risk patients with eGFR&lt;30mL/min/1.73m2. At Maastricht UMC+ a specialised unit (called&#xD;
      the CVP) was established where a dual screening process including both renal and cardiac&#xD;
      parameters is used to minimize the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury as well as&#xD;
      the risk of prophylactic hydration in eGFR&lt;30mL/min/1.73m2 patients. In order to enable real&#xD;
      function follow-up, the CVP also registers data on patients who did not receive the dual&#xD;
      screening process prior to prophylactic intravenous hydration. The current study aims to&#xD;
      describe post-contrast outcomes of patients to whom the CVP screening method has been&#xD;
      applied, and if feasible, to compare them to outcomes of patients to whom the screening was&#xD;
      not applied.&#xD;
