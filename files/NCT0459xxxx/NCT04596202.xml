      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effect of different&#xD;
      positions (supine, prone, right lateral and left lateral) in post-op term newborns staying in&#xD;
      Pediatric Cardio Vascular Surgery (PCVS) Intensive Care Unit on gastric residual volume and&#xD;
      comfort level.&#xD;

      In the study, crossover design from experimental designs was preferred. Crossover design is&#xD;
      an experimental design type in which two or more interventions are applied in a sequence to&#xD;
      each case in the study group. In these studies, each group is its own control group. In this&#xD;
      design type, all different interventions in the study are applied to the same case; thus,&#xD;
      differences that may arise due to individual differences are prevented. Additionally, less&#xD;
      number of cases is sufficient in order to obtain the same number of observation data compared&#xD;
      to the other design examples. Due to these properties, randomized crossover design model was&#xD;
      used in this study. The study will be conducted in PCVS Intensive Care Unit of a University&#xD;
      Hospital in Turkey between October 2020 and August 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, sample size was calculated at the confidence interval of 95% using &quot;G.&#xD;
      Power-3.1.9.4&quot; program. In a study the effect size used for determining the sample size in&#xD;
      the study was found to be 0.54 based on the mean and standard deviation values of the study.&#xD;
      By using this effect size, minimum sample size was found as 38 children in order for the&#xD;
      gastric residue amount difference between positions to express statistically significance&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05) with theoretical power of 0.95. By considering that there might be losses in the&#xD;
      study, it is planned to include a total of 44 children in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of the 4 positions to be given to the infants in the study group (A:Prone Position,&#xD;
      B:Right lateral Position, C:Left lateral Position, D:Supine Position) was determined by lot&#xD;
      method. 4 different orders were chosen randomly from all possible orders of 4 positions to be&#xD;
      given to the infants in the study group (24 different orders). Each different order of the&#xD;
      positions was expressed as a group. 4 orders randomly selected from 24 different orders were&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in the first group is A, C, D, and B; The order in the second group is D, A, B, and&#xD;
      C; The order in the third group is C, B, A, and D; The order in the fourth group is B, D, C,&#xD;
      and A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups and position orders according to the result of the draw:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st GROUP ORDER; Prone (A), Left lateral (C), Supine (D), and Right lateral (B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd GROUP ORDER; Supine (D), Prone (A), Right lateral (B), and Left lateral (C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd GROUP ORDER; Left lateral (C), Right lateral (B), Prone (A), and Supine (D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. th GROUP ORDER; Right lateral (B), Supine (D), Left lateral (C), and Prone (A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assigning the infants to 4 groups was made in Microsoft Excel program using &quot;RANDBETWEEN&quot;&#xD;
      command. All positions will be applied once to each infant. The newborns to be assigned to&#xD;
      the groups according to this result are stated in the below table.&#xD;

      Data Collection tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the data collection, &quot;Information Form&quot; prepared by the researcher to record the&#xD;
      descriptive information of the newborn, &quot;Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale&quot; to evaluate the&#xD;
      comfort level and &quot;Residue Follow-up Form&quot; to record the residual amount and the &quot;Vital Signs&#xD;
      Follow-up Form&quot; to record the vital signs will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information Form: It is a form prepared by the researcher in line with the literature to&#xD;
      record the natal and postnatal information of the newborn. The information in this form will&#xD;
      be filled out by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale: It is a Likert-type scale developed to be used to assess&#xD;
      sedation and comfort needs, pain, and distress of newborns followed-up in the intensive care.&#xD;
      The Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale will be evaluated at the 30th, 60th and 120th minutes&#xD;
      after the position. The comfort level scale scoring will be evaluated and filled by the&#xD;
      researcher and a second observer working in the Intensive Care Unit for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residue Follow-up Form: The form prepared to follow up the residue includes the position&#xD;
      given, amount of nutrition, the way of feeding, feeding type, and residue amount control. The&#xD;
      researcher will evaluate and fill out the form at the 30th, 60th and 120th minutes after&#xD;
      feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital Signs Follow-up Form: This form prepared by the researcher in line with the literature&#xD;
      was composed of the parameters of heart rate (min), respiratory rate (min) and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation value (%SpO2) of the newborn. The researcher will evaluate and fill out the form&#xD;
      at the 30th, 60th and 120th minutes after positioning.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale will be evaluated at the 30 to 120 minutes after the position.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a Likert type scale developed to be used in the evaluation of sedation and comfort needs, pain and distress of newborns followed-up in intensive care. COMFORTneo is composed of six parameters including alertness, calmness/agitation, respiratory response, crying, body movements, facial tension, and muscle tone. Each item in the scale is scored from 1 to 5. It is evaluated over the total score. The lowest score of COMFORTneo is 6 and the highest score is 30. If total score of the scale is between 9-13 points, it refers that the infant is &quot;comfortable&quot;. If it is between 14-30 points, it is emphasized that the infant has &quot;pain or distress&quot;, is uncomfortable and requires interventions that will provide comfort.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>It is the supine position. The body parts of the patient stand as if the patient is standing upright. The head, neck and shoulders should be supported with a pillow placed under the head. Arms are aside and body muscles are relaxed. The upper arms should lie on both sides of the body, should slightly be moved away from the body and should be supported by a pillow.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Prone Position</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>It is the position where the patient lies face down with his/her head turned to the side. Arms are stretched to both sides of the head. The prone position (prone lying) is a relaxing and resting position.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Lateral position</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Lateral position is the left or right lateral lying position. The lateral position is given to the patient to provide proper anatomical lying and to reduce lateral flexion of the back and the strain of the large back muscles. This position prevents pressure on the bones in the back.</description>

    <description>After the infants are treated and fed, they will be given the supine position. After positioning, the residue control will be performed in accordance with the procedure steps guideline at the 30th, 60th and 120th minutes and it will be recorded on residue follow-up form. In addition, the comfort level, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels of the infant will be evaluated and recorded at the specified times. At the end of two hours, until the next feeding hour (between 121st-180th minutes), the routine position (supine position) applied in the clinic will be given to the infant and waited in order for physiological parameters and comfort levels to return the period without intervention. The aim here is to ensure for the case to get over the effect of the previous position. No data will be collected within this period.</description>
