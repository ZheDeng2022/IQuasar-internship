  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study evaluates the effect of 500 mg of 2S-hesperidin for 8 weeks on&#xD;
      performance (power generated in different metabolic zones), body composition (fat and muscle&#xD;
      mass) and biochemical (antioxidant, inflammatory status) and metabolic (capillary blood in&#xD;
      finger) markers in amateur cyclists. Our hypothesis is that chronic intake of 2S-hesperidin&#xD;
      can improve performance (maximum power generated). To justify this hypothesis, we measured&#xD;
      the parameters mentioned above, which could establish a cause-effect relationship between&#xD;
      2S-hesperidin intake and possible yield improvement.&#xD;

      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were informed about the procedures and provided signed informed consent. The&#xD;
      study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration for Human&#xD;
      Research and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Catholic&#xD;
      University of Murcia (Code: CE091802).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclists were instructed to take the supplement along with breakfast and to continue their&#xD;
      usual diet and training schedule. Subjects in both groups were instructed not to consume&#xD;
      foods high in citrus flavonoids (grapefruit, lemons or oranges) for 5 days prior to and&#xD;
      during the study, this was verified by diet recalls records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants visited the laboratory on seven occasions. Visit 1 consisted of a medical&#xD;
      examination and blood extraction to determine health status. On visits 2 and 5, a 24-hr diet&#xD;
      recall and a Wingate test were performed. On visits 3 and 6, another 24-hour diet recall was&#xD;
      conducted, followed by an incremental test until exhaustion on a cycle ergometer. On visits 4&#xD;
      and 7, the 24-hour diet recall was repeated, and participants performed a rectangular test on&#xD;
      the cycle ergometer. Prior to each testing session (visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7), a&#xD;
      standardized breakfast composed of 95.16 g of carbohydrates (68%), 18.86 g of protein (14%)&#xD;
      and 11.30 g of lipids (18%) was prescribed by the sport nutritionist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and post evaluation test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention visits: 1,2,3 and 4 Post-intervention visits: 5,6 and 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health status blood analysis: A general analysis will be performed both in the pre and&#xD;
      post-supplementation period. The extraction will be done by venous via. (Fasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical examination: A clinical history of family and personal history, a resting&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and a medical examination (auscultation, blood pressure measurement,&#xD;
      etc.) will be taken to certify that the person is healthy and not at risk to participate in&#xD;
      the study. (Fasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): A resting test will be performed with the ergospirometer to&#xD;
      determine macronutrient supply at rest and caloric expenditure. (Fasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition by absorptiometric densitometry (DXA): A body composition test will be&#xD;
      performed by the dual energy absorptiometric densitometry technique (X-ray), with the&#xD;
      objective of to determine parameters of fat mass, fat-free mass and fat percentage. In&#xD;
      addition, anthropometry was also used to determine changes in body composition (fat and&#xD;
      muscle mass). (Fasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaerobic power and mechanical power production: After a standardized breakfast, a Wingate&#xD;
      test was performed on a cycloergometer. Wingate test (WAnT) consisted of an all-out 30-s&#xD;
      sprint on a cycloergometer (Monark Ergomedic 894E Peak Bike, Vansbro, Sweden). Breaking&#xD;
      resistance was held constant at 7.5% of each individual's body mass. All participants were&#xD;
      verbally encouraged to pedal as fast as possible during the entire sprint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incremental step with final ramp test was performed on a cycle ergometer using a metabolic&#xD;
      cart (Metalyzer 3B. Leipzig, Germany) to determine maximal fat oxidation zone (FatMax),&#xD;
      ventilatory thresholds 1 (VT1) and 2 (VT2) and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max).&#xD;
      Participants began cycling at 35W for 2 min, increasing then by 35W every 2 min until&#xD;
      RER&gt;1.05, initialling then the final ramp (+35W·min-1) until exhaustion. The estimated&#xD;
      functional threshold power (FTP) was calculated using the following equation [16]:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FTP (W) = Pmax (W) x 0.865 - 56.484.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 4 and 7:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectangular test was performed on a cycle ergometer using the power output values resulting&#xD;
      from the maximal test (FatMax, VT1 and VT2). Participants exercised continuously from FatMax,&#xD;
      to VT1 and to VT2 for 10 min, without rest. Cardiorespiratory variables (VO2, VO2R,&#xD;
      carbohydrate oxidation (CHO), fat oxidation (FAT) and cycling economy) were determined for&#xD;
      each metabolic zones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hesperidin metabolites were analysed in participants' urine. Urine samples,&#xD;
      corresponding to 24 h urine collection from each participant before and after the&#xD;
      supplementation, were frozen in liquid nitrogen after collection and thawed for its analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data of the subjects who participated in the study were stored under a computer&#xD;
      system with a security key. In addition, a record was also made of some of the paper data&#xD;
      that was saved under key, and to which only the researchers of this project had access.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized parallel study was conducted, where 40 amateur cyclists were divided into 2 groups: one group took 500 mg of 2S-hesperidin (n= 20) and the other group took 500 mg of placebo (microcellulose) (n= 20). All participants completed the study.</intervention_model_description>
