  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purposes of the dose escalation part of this study is to determine the following in&#xD;
      participants with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) or esophageal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (EAC):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability of NT-I7 in combination with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purposes of Phase 2 of this study is to make a preliminary assessment of the&#xD;
      antitumor activity and long-term survival of NT-I7 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
      participants with gastric or GEJ or EAC.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             carcinoma of Gastric or Gastro-esophageal Junction (GEJ) or Esophageal Adenocarcinoma&#xD;
             (EAC) who progressed on or intolerant to 2 or more prior lines of chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
             targeted therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. Participants with&#xD;

             other line of therapy are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: GEJ adenocarcinomas are defined as tumors that have their center within 5 cm&#xD;
             proximal and distal of the anatomical cardia, as described in the Siewert&#xD;
             classification system (Siewert et al, 2000)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants enrolling in the dose escalation phase must have biopsiable disease.&#xD;
             Participants must agree to provide a) pre- treatment tumor tissue sample and b)&#xD;
             on-treatment tumor biopsy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases are asymptomatic and do not require immediate&#xD;
             treatment or have been treated and subjects have neurologically returned to baseline&#xD;
             (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or&#xD;
             intravenous immunoglobulin preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Clinically significant cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a history of allergy or intolerance (unacceptable adverse events [AEs]) to study&#xD;
             drug components or polysorbate-80-containing infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Polysorbate 80 is a buffer used to make NT-I7.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has received a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are&#xD;
