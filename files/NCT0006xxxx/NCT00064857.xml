      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized botanical extract&#xD;
      of Pycnogenol as a treatment for stable arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema of the arm affects the function and self-image of approximately 600,000 of the 2&#xD;
      million breast cancer survivors in the United States. Chronic lymphedema can lead to&#xD;
      recurrent infections and permanent swelling, in some cases impairing function. Although&#xD;
      various methods of massage and the use of non-elastic compression &quot;sleeves&quot; have been shown&#xD;
      to decrease the severity of lymphedema, these methods of physical therapy are limited in&#xD;
      terms of patient acceptance, compliance, and by the availability of trained therapists. There&#xD;
      is presently no pharmacologic treatment that has proven effective in treating or preventing&#xD;
      the development of lymphedema in women treated for breast cancer. This is a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of an extract of the bark of the French maritime pine tree&#xD;
      (Pycnogenol(r)) as a treatment for arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors. Pycnogenol(r)&#xD;
      is widely used in Europe for lymphedema of the leg and varicose veins, and is thought to act&#xD;
      by several mechanisms including vascular permeability and vascular constriction. The&#xD;
      development of such a therapeutic approach would therefore constitute a major breakthrough in&#xD;
      the treatment of this common symptom of breast cancer lymphedema. Bioelectric impedance is a&#xD;
      painless, quick, and easily-performed method of estimating the extracellular and total water&#xD;
      volume of the body or segment, such as the arm. We will compare the correlation of both a&#xD;
      single- and a multiple-frequency bioelectric impedance instrument in measuring change in arm&#xD;
      volume to a standard assessment using water displacement. We expect that bioelectric&#xD;
      impedance will prove faster and more sensitive to changes in extracellular water (lymphedema)&#xD;
      than the water displacement method. We also propose to use a small oral dose of midazolam and&#xD;
      single blood sampling to screen for effects of Pycnogenol(r) on the activity of the common&#xD;
      drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4. For those subjects who are already receiving digoxin, we&#xD;
      will use digoxin urine excretion to screen for effects of the botanical upon the activity of&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein. Finally, we will continue the evaluation of a new questionnaire of lymphedema&#xD;
      symptoms presently being tested as a tool for assessing the severity and improvement of&#xD;
      symptoms with treatment. In summary, the successful completion of this research can be&#xD;
      expected to provide an alternative therapy and new instruments for treating and measuring&#xD;
      lymphedema.&#xD;
