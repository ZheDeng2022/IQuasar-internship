  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to stimulate the immune system in HIV infected adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults so that it can better control the HIV infection. When anti-HIV drugs are stopped for a&#xD;
      period of time, the virus &quot;grows back.&quot; This may stimulate the immune system, which may then&#xD;
      be more effective in controlling the virus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to use Structured Treatment Interruption (STI) as an approach to&#xD;
      auto-immunization. The STI management schema is based on current understanding of HIV-1 viral&#xD;
      dynamics, pharmacology of available antiretroviral medications, and HIV-specific host&#xD;
      responses. This is a Phase II trial to provide preliminary data on the feasibility and&#xD;
      possible efficacy of using STI to enhance immune-based control of HIV-1 replication. A steady&#xD;
      state HIV-1 viral load determined from historical tests prior to initiating highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) will be compared to the steady state viral load post-STI.&#xD;
      HIV-1 specific CD4 and CD8 cell responses will be measured before and after the period of STI&#xD;
      management and HIV-1 specific CD8 cell maturational phenotype will be assessed and correlated&#xD;
      with ability to control viral replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents and young adults who have either had sustained viral suppression on HAART for at&#xD;
      least 2 years or who have had sustained viral suppression from 3 to 6 months will be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants will have 12 weeks of HAART followed by 2 to 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment interruption. Participants will undergo three rounds of this regimen. After the&#xD;
      third STI, participants will have an additional 12 weeks of HAART and then stop therapy.&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored off HAART for up to 20 weeks. During this time, if there is&#xD;
      evidence of HIV progression (two consecutive viral loads exceeding 10,000 copies/ml; two&#xD;
      consecutive CD4 cell counts under 350 cells/microL; two consecutive CD4 percentages less than&#xD;
      15%; or two consecutive CD4 cell counts less than 50% of baseline), standard continuous&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy will be reinstituted. Plasma HIV RNA will be tested monthly during&#xD;
      therapy and weekly while subjects are off treatment. Immunologic studies are monthly&#xD;
      throughout the study. Participants will be involved in the study for approximately 2 years.&#xD;
