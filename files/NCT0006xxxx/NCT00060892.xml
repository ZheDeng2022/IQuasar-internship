  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to assess the overall safety of different dose regimens&#xD;
      of AMG0001 (HGF transferred via plasmid vector) as well as evaluate the improvement of blood&#xD;
      perfusion in subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI). This study also evaluated the&#xD;
      improvement in wound healing without adverse effects on the quality of life, as well as the&#xD;
      potential reduction of amputation, mortality and rest pain in the CLI population.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this study was to assess the safety of AMG0001, detect potential&#xD;
      angiogenesis response to AMG0001 treatment and to correlate these changes to clinical&#xD;
      endpoints dependent upon improvement in tissue perfusion for relief of CLI complications. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study were to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the overall safety of different exposure regimens of AMG0001 in the CLI subject&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the potential effect of angiogenesis associated with different doses and dose&#xD;
           regimens of AMG0001 as measured by improvement in tissue perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the activity of different exposure regimens of AMG0001 to benefit clinical&#xD;
           outcomes of reduction of amputation and mortality, wound healing, rest-pain reduction&#xD;
           and improvement in subject's ability to function without adverse consequences on quality&#xD;
           of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will have one or more clinical indications diagnostic of CLI such as: distal&#xD;
             extremity pain at rest that requires the subject to use analgesics for &gt;2 weeks; or&#xD;
             peripheral ischemic ulcer(s); or areas of gangrene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject will have a TcPO2 of &lt;/= 40 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will have one or both of the following hemodynamic indicators of severe&#xD;
             peripheral arterial occlusive disease: (a) Ankle systolic pressure of &lt;/= 70 mmHg;&#xD;
             (b)Toe systolic pressure &lt;/= 50 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a poor candidate for standard revascularization treatment options for&#xD;
             peripheral arterial disease, based on inadequate bypass conduit, unfavorable anatomy,&#xD;
             or poor operative risk.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a clinically significant liver enzyme abnormality (i.e., AST or ALT more&#xD;
             than two times the upper limit of normal and/or bilirubin more than 50% the upper&#xD;
