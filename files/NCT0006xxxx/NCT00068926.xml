      This protocol will screen healthy normal volunteers for participation in studies of vaccines&#xD;
      under development at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center. Of interest are vaccines for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly identified infectious diseases such as SARS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infectious diseases of concern as possible bioweapons, such as smallpox and Ebola virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emerging infectious diseases that are more widespread geographically than in the past,&#xD;
           such as West Nile virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For preventing diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 70 years of age may be eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
      Screening begins about 1 to 6 months before the start of the vaccine study. Participants will&#xD;
      have a physical examination and health history, including questions about sexual activity and&#xD;
      drug use. Over the course of the screening visits, participants will be asked to give urine&#xD;
      and blood samples to test for various infections and other medical problems. Women capable of&#xD;
      getting pregnant will be given a pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding will&#xD;
      not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the screening, participants will be informed about which vaccines are currently&#xD;
      being tested in clinical trials for which they may be eligible. Once participants enroll in a&#xD;
      vaccine study, their participation in the screening protocol ends.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN: The purpose of the study is to screen potential study volunteers to determine&#xD;
      if they are eligible for infectious disease vaccine clinical trials being sponsored by the&#xD;
      Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the NIH Clinical Center. All work will be conducted by the&#xD;
      VRC Clinic of the National Institutes of Health or IRB-approved extramural sites that are&#xD;
      collaborating with the VRC Clinic. Educational materials on vaccines will be reviewed with&#xD;
      and provided to subjects before enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: Approximately 3,000 healthy adults; age 18-70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION: Duration of participation is variable, and may last from a few weeks to&#xD;
      several months for each subject. Study participation is complete when the subject enrolls in&#xD;
      a vaccine study, is found to be ineligible for all vaccine studies or declines to participate&#xD;
      in any vaccine studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY EVALUATIONS: Evaluations usually include history, physical examinations and laboratory&#xD;
      tests. Only those evaluations needed to determine eligibility for a particular study will be&#xD;
      done. Evaluations other than those described in this protocol may be done if necessary for&#xD;
      eligibility for a study. Blood will also be collected for storage.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Age: 18 to 70 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Available to participate for the planned duration of the investigational vaccine study for&#xD;
        which the screening is being done (vaccine studies may require 6 months to 18 months of&#xD;
        clinic visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able and willing to complete the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Agree to have blood stored for future studies of the vaccine, the immune system, and/or&#xD;
        other medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known to be infected with HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A condition in which repeated blood draws or injections pose more than minimal risk for the&#xD;
        subject such as hemophilia, other severe coagulation disorders or significantly impaired&#xD;
        venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert serious danger&#xD;
        to the participant's health or well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known to be pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
