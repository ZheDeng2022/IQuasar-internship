  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about acupuncture's efficacy for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). This trial&#xD;
      uses a manualized acupuncture treatment format that closely follows clinical practice and&#xD;
      allows flexibility in designing individualized treatments. In addition, a second parallel&#xD;
      qualitative study will follow a subgroup of patients throughout the trial to explore the&#xD;
      relationships between patients' interpretations and understandings (what anthropologists call&#xD;
      &quot;meaning&quot;) of irritable bowel and their response to treatment. Cortisol levels (an important&#xD;
      stress hormone) will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 3-arm trial: Active acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, and wait list.&#xD;
