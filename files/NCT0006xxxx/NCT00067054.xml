  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study collects specimens from volunteers for use in studies by NIAID's Vaccine Research&#xD;
      Center. A number of different types of specimens or samples can be collected, including&#xD;
      blood, urine, body fluids or secretions, skin swabs, or skin biopsies. The samples are used&#xD;
      for medical research, including the study of HIV, hepatitis, and other diseases; immune&#xD;
      system responses, such as responses to vaccinations or infections; and for research on&#xD;
      vaccine development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples may be collected either by ordinary blood drawing (phlebotomy) or by apheresis,&#xD;
      a procedure for collecting a larger quantity of blood cells or plasma than would be possible&#xD;
      through simple blood drawing. For this procedure, the subject lies on a recliner or couch.&#xD;
      Blood is removed through a needle in the vein of one arm and spun in a machine that separates&#xD;
      out the desired component (plasma or white blood cells). The remainder of the blood is&#xD;
      returned either through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm. The procedure&#xD;
      takes about 1 to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who are 18 years of age and older, including participants in other NIH research&#xD;
      protocols, may be eligible. Individuals who have a condition that the research staff&#xD;
      considers a reason not to make a sample donation will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have only one sample collected or may be asked to undergo repetitive sample&#xD;
      collection procedures, depending upon the requirements of the particular research project for&#xD;
      which the samples are being collected. Each individual's enrollment is for a 1-year period,&#xD;
      which can be extended.&#xD;

      Protocol Design: This protocol is designed to perform collection of human specimens, such as&#xD;
      blood, mucosal secretions, skin swabs, skin biopsy, or body fluids to support research&#xD;
      studies. These samples will be used by researchers in their work on the development of&#xD;
      vaccines, to study the correlates of immunity related to infectious diseases and in&#xD;
      laboratory work related to the development and/or validation of immunological assays.&#xD;
      Standard phlebotomy and apheresis procedures will be utilized to safely obtain necessary&#xD;
      quantities of blood and cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Obtain human biological specimens such as blood (via phlebotomy), plasma or PBMC&#xD;
      samples (via apheresis), mucosal secretions, skin swabs, body fluids or skin biopsy to&#xD;
      support medical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Adults ages 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Plan: Subjects, including healthy volunteers and infectious disease patients who&#xD;
      consent to participate in this study, will undergo standard medical procedures to obtain&#xD;
      biological specimens for research purposes only. The signed informed consent is valid for one&#xD;
      year; at least once per year, the subject must re-consent and eligibility should be&#xD;
      re-confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Individual subjects may donate samples as often as permitted by their&#xD;
      institution s guidelines. The IRB-approved protocol will remain open and undergo annual&#xD;
      continuing review by the IRB as long as there continues to be a need for human biological&#xD;
      specimens for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: There is no analysis plan for this protocol. This protocol will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with Good Clinical Practices for human research solely for the purpose of&#xD;
      obtaining samples for research laboratories. Samples will be identified only by subject&#xD;
      identification number. Subject data, such as demographic information, aspects of medical&#xD;
      history, laboratory parameters, recent immunizations or medications, HLA type, genetic tests&#xD;
      and other medical information may be provided (identified by study number, but not subject&#xD;
      name) to researchers if needed to support the objectives of the laboratory research.&#xD;

        Participants may be subjects participating solely in this protocol or may be subjects in&#xD;
        other VRC studies from whom more cells are needed for research than can be collected by&#xD;
        routine phlebotomy.At the VRC site, NIH employees and members of their immediate families&#xD;
        may participate in this protocol. The UPR MSC site will only enroll subjects from the&#xD;
        community. Children are not eligible to participate in this clinical trial.&#xD;
