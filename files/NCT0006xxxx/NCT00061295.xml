      Body weight support (BWS) treadmill training uses an overhead harness to give partial support&#xD;
      to patients walking on a treadmill. This study will determine whether BWS training is more&#xD;
      effective than conventional rehabilitation therapy in improving walking ability in patients&#xD;
      with spinal cord injuries (SCI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gait rehabilitation is a specific component of physical rehabilitation of persons with&#xD;
      sub-acute or chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). One novel method of gait rehabilitation&#xD;
      involves the use of an overhead support point and a harness. The BWS strategy has been&#xD;
      combined with treadmill-based gait training in recent studies with dramatic results. It is&#xD;
      believed that this form of training may enhance output of a 'central pattern generator' of&#xD;
      stepping movement from circuitry intrinsic to the patient's spinal cord. However, only&#xD;
      limited attention has been paid to the role that training-induced physical conditioning might&#xD;
      play in mediating functional improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether BWS gait training is more effective than conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy in improving functional gait in patients with neurologically&#xD;
      incomplete spinal cord injury. The study will also compare treadmill-based training to&#xD;
      overground-based training. Treadmill-based training has the inherent advantage of providing&#xD;
      highly rhythmic input to the subject's legs; overground-based training has the inherent&#xD;
      advantage of allowing use of assistive devices and thereby replicating a more 'natural'&#xD;
      training condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic SCI (greater than 1 year post-injury) and patients with sub-acute SCI&#xD;
      (2 to 8 months post-injury) will be evaluated. Patients with chronic SCI will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of 3 groups: body weight support and treadmill-based training, body weight&#xD;
      support and overground training, and conventional rehabilitation therapy. Patients with&#xD;
      sub-acute injury will be randomized to receive either BWS treadmill training or conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Training sessions are typically 1 hour long, with 3 sessions per week for 13&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated with a battery of functional, metabolic, and neurophysiologic&#xD;
      measures prior to the onset of training and during the week after training has been&#xD;
      completed. The primary outcome measure will be average maximum overground walking velocity&#xD;
      without body weight support but with the use of passive assistive devices. Secondary measures&#xD;
      will concentrate on function (balance, mobility), fitness (work capacity, strength, gait&#xD;
      efficiency), and spinal cord neurophysiology (motor conduction, reflex excitability).&#xD;
