  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center trial to test the safety, efficacy and tolerability of alicaforsen&#xD;
      (ISIS 2302), a new type of drug called an antisense drug, in patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      active Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Alicaforsen is designed to reduce the production of a&#xD;
      specific protein, called ICAM-1, a substance that plays a significant role in the increase of&#xD;
      inflammation and is likely to be involved in inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis. The ISIS 2302-CS22 study will examine the effects of one of two dosages of&#xD;
      alicaforsen delivered by enema over a six-week period as compared to an active control,&#xD;
      mesalamine enema (The probability of receiving the alicaforsen formulation is 2:1). The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate the percentage reduction in DAI at Week 6.&#xD;
