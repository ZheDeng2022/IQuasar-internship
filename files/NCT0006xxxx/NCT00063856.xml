  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to find out the risk of spreading the vaccine virus,&#xD;
      vaccinia, from the smallpox vaccination site when different types of bandages are used to&#xD;
      cover the site. The study will also look at how each bandage type affects the healing of the&#xD;
      sore. Study participants will include healthy individuals, 18-50 years old, who have not&#xD;
      previously received a smallpox vaccine and healthy individuals, 18-50 years old, who have&#xD;
      received a previous smallpox vaccine. All participants will receive the smallpox vaccine and&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 different bandage groups to cover the vaccine site: standard&#xD;
      gauze dressing attached with paper tape, Opsite gauze-impregnanted occlusive dressing&#xD;
      (attached by paper tape and waterproof), and Allevyn hydropolymer dressing (which is&#xD;
      self-adhesive and highly absorbent). Volunteers will be involved in study related procedures&#xD;
      for up to 252 days.&#xD;

      This study will investigate the potential for secondary transmission of vaccinia from&#xD;
      smallpox vaccination sites covered by various types of dressings, as well as the effects of&#xD;
      each dressing type on the healing of the vaccination lesion. The results could have great&#xD;
      implications for infection control and public health in the wake of potential mass smallpox&#xD;
      vaccination. The study population will consist of two cohorts: healthy individuals who are&#xD;
      naive to the smallpox vaccine (&quot;naive group&quot;) and healthy individuals who have had previous&#xD;
      vaccination with the smallpox vaccine (&quot;experienced group&quot;). Individuals in each group will&#xD;
      be vaccinated with a dose of smallpox vaccine diluted to 1:5 and will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one of three dressing preparations to cover the vaccination site: standard 2 inch x 2&#xD;
      inch gauze attached to the skin via paper tape (&quot;Gauze dressing&quot;); Opsite gauze-impregnated&#xD;
      occlusive dressing (&quot;occlusive dressing&quot;); and Allevyn hydropolymer dressing (Smith and&#xD;
      Nephew, &quot;hydropolymer dressing&quot;). In addition, 30 of the 108 subjects (15 naïve and 15&#xD;
      experienced) will be enrolled as a &quot;cardiac subgroup&quot; and will have additional blood drawn&#xD;
      for the assessment of specific biochemical markers related to thrombosis and platelet&#xD;
      activation (specifically, plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and soluble CD40&#xD;
      ligand (sCD40L). The primary study objective will be the assessment of infectivity of&#xD;
      vaccination sites via evaluation of vaccinia growth from specimens of the outer dressing for&#xD;
      each bandage type. Positive culture reflects failure of the bandage to prevent possible&#xD;
      spread of vaccinia. Secondary study objectives include the following: assessment of&#xD;
      infectivity of vaccination sites via evaluation of vaccinia growth from specimens from the&#xD;
      hand contralateral to the vaccine site for each dressing type; comparison of the rate of&#xD;
      lesion healing (time from vaccination until lesion is deemed &quot;well-healed&quot;) for each dressing&#xD;
      cohort; association of adverse events (AEs) involved with transmission of vaccinia, such as&#xD;
      autoinoculation and secondary dissemination, with the type of dressing covering the&#xD;
      vaccination site; and determination of the alterations after smallpox vaccination in the&#xD;
      body's endogenous fibrinolytic system to investigate the potential pathophysiology of adverse&#xD;
      ischemic cardiac events seen in vaccinated subjects in the recent civilian and military&#xD;
      campaigns. The tertiary objectives of the study include: assessment of the overall safety&#xD;
      profile in each cohort, as determined by reactogenicity of the vaccine and the development of&#xD;
      expected and unexpected AEs unrelated to dressing type; assessment of the efficacy of a 1:5&#xD;
      dilution of APSV in vaccinia-experienced adults as measured by the proportion of individuals&#xD;
      who respond to vaccination with a &quot;take: 6-11 days after vaccination; characterization of the&#xD;
      humoral immune response generated following vaccination in each cohort; assessment of&#xD;
      pharyngeal carriage and shedding of vaccinia virus in each cohort of vaccinated volunteers;&#xD;
      and assessment of the tolerability of the dressing and total number of bandage changes&#xD;
      determined from a volunteer questionnaire and summarized by bandage type. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      followed for 56 days following their primary vaccination. Volunteers who do not have a &quot;take&quot;&#xD;
      will be offered revaccination under a separate protocol after their 56-day blood sample is&#xD;
      drawn. All volunteers will be contacted by telephone for information about serious adverse&#xD;
      events at or about 180 days after their primary vaccination.&#xD;
