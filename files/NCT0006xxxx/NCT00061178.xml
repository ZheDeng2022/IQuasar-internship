      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rhuMAb VEGF (Bevacizumab) is safe and&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of renal cell cancer when other treatments have failed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed, metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) of clear cell histology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression (as assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator and reviewed by the Sponsor) during or after completion of one, and only&#xD;
             one, cytokine-based regimen for metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 21 days since any prior therapy for RCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior nephrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of an acceptable means of contraception (potentially fertile men and women)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RCC of papillary or collecting-duct type&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than one nonsurgical therapy for metastatic RCC (note that medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
             acetate not used for physiologic replacement or birth control is considered a therapy&#xD;
             for RCC for the purposes of this study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with thalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days of Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current, recent (within 21 days of Day 0), or planned participation in an experimental&#xD;
             drug study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following screening clinical laboratory values: 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
             with &gt;= 1 g of protein; Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&#xD;
             &lt;500/mL; Platelet count &lt;75,000/mL; INR &gt;= 1.5; Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL; AST or&#xD;
             ALT &gt; 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for subjects with documented liver&#xD;
             metastases or &gt; 2.5 x the ULN for subjects without evidence of liver metastases;&#xD;
             Hemoglobin &lt; 9 gm/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa [e.g., Epogen] to&#xD;
             maintain or exceed this level)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other invasive malignancies within 5 years of randomization (other than squamous or&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the&#xD;
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from&#xD;
             treatment complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures&#xD;
