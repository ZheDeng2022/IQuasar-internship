      African American mothers infected with HIV face unique challenges in management of their&#xD;
      disease. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an HIV self-care and&#xD;
      symptom management program designed to help low-income African American mothers with HIV.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) poses a growing threat to the health of&#xD;
      women in childbearing years and occurs disproportionately among lower socioeconomic&#xD;
      populations and minority women. Early identification of HIV infection and advances in&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapies have begun to prolong the lives of infected individuals. However,&#xD;
      women with HIV appear to have more rapid disease progression and shorter survival after&#xD;
      diagnosis than men. Evidence is emerging that women are less likely to use health services,&#xD;
      are more likely to present at clinical facilities with advanced disease, and are less likely&#xD;
      to receive antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, little attention has focused on the prevention and management of symptoms&#xD;
      experienced by women with HIV before they develop AIDS. The primary aim of this randomized&#xD;
      clinical study was determine the efficacy of an HIV self-care and symptom management&#xD;
      intervention designed to help low-income African American mothers with HIV. The study was&#xD;
      based on the Maternal HIV Self-Care Symptom Management framework, which postulates that&#xD;
      helping mothers to cope with their emotional responses to HIV diagnosis and to reframe their&#xD;
      understanding of HIV from an immediate life-threatening illness to a chronic disease&#xD;
      decreases emotional distress and improves health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and nine African American mothers, including 17 grandmothers who were primary&#xD;
      caregivers for children, participated in the trial. Women were randomized to either the&#xD;
      intervention or the control group. The intervention focused on the mother's responses to her&#xD;
      HIV diagnosis and helped her understand, manage, and prevent selected HIV-related symptoms,&#xD;
      using her concern about her child(ren) as a motivator. The intervention used a cognitive&#xD;
      reframing educational approach based within a therapeutic relationship with an advanced&#xD;
      practice nurse. The nurse provided a culturally sensitive milieu designed to help the woman&#xD;
      feel safe in exploring her feelings and expressing her needs. Eight teaching modules provided&#xD;
      basic information to improve knowledge about HIV and help the mother identify self-care&#xD;
      strategies related to general health promotion. Data were collected using self-report&#xD;
      measures assessing emotional distress and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers in the intervention group reported fewer feelings of stigma 6 months after the&#xD;
      intervention ended than did mothers in the control group. Within the intervention group,&#xD;
      there was a reduction in two aspects of affective state (depression/dejection and&#xD;
      tension/anxiety) and in stigma. However, most outcomes did not differ significantly. There&#xD;
      was no reduction in depressive symptoms, in other aspects of affective state, or in HIV&#xD;
      worry. Mothers in the intervention group reported higher physical function scores 6 months&#xD;
      after the intervention ended compared to control mothers. Other aspects of health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, such as perception of health, health distress, energy/fatigue, and role&#xD;
      function, did not improve. Within the intervention group, mothers reported fewer infections&#xD;
      from enrollment to 1 month after the intervention ended. In contrast, mothers in the control&#xD;
      group reported a decline in physical function and overall role function. There was a high&#xD;
      drop-out for mothers in both groups. Analysis of enrollment data comparing the mothers who&#xD;
      dropped out and mothers who remained in the study indicated that drop-out mothers had&#xD;
      significantly higher scores on emotional distress variables and social conflict and lower&#xD;
      perceptions of health, suggesting the need for a more targeted intervention with a stronger&#xD;
      focus on mental health.&#xD;
