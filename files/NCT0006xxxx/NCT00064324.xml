  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have&#xD;
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as perifosine use different&#xD;
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free rate in patients treated with perifosine and&#xD;
      having advanced soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate survival and time to progression. II. To evaluate objective tumor response&#xD;
      status and duration. III. To evaluate adverse event rates. IV. To evaluate patterns of&#xD;
      treatment failure. V. To evaluate pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine every 6 hours for a total of 4 doses on&#xD;
      day 1 and once daily on days 2-28 of course 1 only. For all subsequent courses, patients&#xD;
      receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed advanced soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;

          -  Measurable disease; measurable disease lesions that are being monitored for response&#xD;
             and have been previously irradiated must have progressed &gt; 25% since completion of&#xD;
             radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PLT &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; upper normal limit (UNL)&#xD;

             Cockcroft-Gault or Jeliffe methods)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of&#xD;
             the study and able to provide valid informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following as this regimen may be harmful to a developing fetus or nursing&#xD;
             child:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Breastfeeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men or women of childbearing potential or their sexual partners who are unwilling&#xD;
                  to employ adequate contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills,&#xD;
                  injections, intrauterine device [IUD], surgical sterilization, subcutaneous&#xD;
                  implants, or abstinence, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because perifosine is an&#xD;
                  alkylphospholipid with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects;&#xD;
                  because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
                  infants secondary to treatment of the mother with perifosine, breastfeeding&#xD;
                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with perifosine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt;= 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chemotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nitrosoureas or mitomycin C =&lt; 6 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Biologic therapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Failure to recover from acute, reversible effects of prior therapy regardless of&#xD;
                  interval since last treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy&#xD;
             considered investigational (utilized for a non-FDA-approved indication and in the&#xD;
             context of a research investigation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled brain metastases; NOTE: these patients are excluded because of the poor&#xD;
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; however, if brain&#xD;
             metastasis are treated and controlled for &gt; 8 weeks, the patient would be eligible for&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to perifosine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia despite appropriate therapy, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; NOTE: these&#xD;
             patients are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
             with perifosine; appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy, except for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated noninvasive carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other invasive cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years&#xD;
