  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dietary supplementation can&#xD;
      improve macular function in patients with Stargardt macular dystrophy and Stargardt-like&#xD;
      macular dystrophy. Stargardt macular dystrophy is a recessive inherited trait that causes a&#xD;
      severe form of macular degeneration. (The macula is the center part of the retina in the back&#xD;
      of the eye that is responsible for fine vision.) The disorder begins in late childhood and&#xD;
      progresses to a significant decrease in central vision. One of the earliest signs of the&#xD;
      disorder is accumulation in and under the macula of a fatty pigment called lipofuscin.&#xD;
      Stargardt-like macular dystrophy is a dominant inherited trait involving loss of central&#xD;
      vision, but it begins later than Stargardt macular dystrophy, and the accumulation of&#xD;
      lipofuscin extends beyond the central region of the macula. DHA is a fatty acid that is&#xD;
      essential for normal brain and eye development. It is normally found in the diet, but not in&#xD;
      large amounts. Supplements may help prevent or slow the progression of some eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular dystrophy or autosomal recessive&#xD;
      Stargardt macular dystrophy are eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test to measure levels of DHA and vitamins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination: The patient's vision and eye pressure are tested, then the pupils are&#xD;
           dilated to examine structures inside the eye. Photographs are also taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual field test: The patient looks at a tiny spot of light projected onto a white&#xD;
           screen and is asked to note when other lights appear at other places on the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram (ERG): An electrode (small silver disk) is taped to the patient's&#xD;
           forehead. Drops are given to numb the eyes and special contact lenses are inserted in&#xD;
           the eyes. For the first part of the test, the patient looks at the center of a black and&#xD;
           white checkerboard screen that flickers for 30 seconds at a time. This is repeated 16 or&#xD;
           more times. For the second part of the test, the patient looks inside a sphere, in which&#xD;
           flashes of light flicker for 20 seconds at a time. This is repeated four or more times.&#xD;
           The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina during the&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will begin taking DHA capsules or a placebo (look-alike capsules with no active&#xD;
      ingredient) from 1 week to 3 months after enrolling in the study and will repeat several of&#xD;
      the screening tests at follow-up visits scheduled 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months after they start&#xD;
      taking the capsules. They will also be interviewed about any treatment side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We propose to undertake a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study on&#xD;
      the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dietary supplementation in subjects with macular&#xD;
      dystrophy to determine whether DHA can improve macular function. Subjects will receive either&#xD;
      oral DHA supplementation (5x200 mg BID, 2,000 mg/day) or placebo. Subjects will 'crossover'&#xD;
      to the opposite treatment twice during this study. Primary outcomes will measure the change&#xD;
      in macular function during periods with and without DHA supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zhang and colleagues found a mutation in the gene, ELOVL4 (elongation of the very long chain&#xD;
      fatty acid-4), in individuals with Stargardt-like macular dystrophy. The gene is presumed to&#xD;
      function in the pathway of synthesis of very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,&#xD;
      including DHA. DHA is the major very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid of the retina. As&#xD;
      our North American diet is poor in DHA, we hypothesize that a DHA dietary supplement might&#xD;
      improve macular function in individuals with the ELOVL4 mutation. Since the effect of DHA&#xD;
      supplementation may be non-specific, we propose to study a second cohort with Stargardt&#xD;
      macular dystrophy, which has a different genotype involving a different metabolic pathway in&#xD;
      the eye, but presents with a similar phenotype. Two cohorts of up to 10 subjects for analysis&#xD;
      will be recruited from patients with either Stargardt-like macular dystrophy or Stargardt&#xD;
      macular dystrophy.&#xD;
