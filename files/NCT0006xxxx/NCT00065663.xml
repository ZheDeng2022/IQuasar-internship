  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes may develop chronic wounds that respond poorly to treatment. Gene&#xD;
      therapy with the platelet-derived growth factor-B gene has been shown to help with the&#xD;
      healing of chronic wounds. This study will evaluate a new way to deliver the gene to the&#xD;
      wound tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic wounds, such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers, cause&#xD;
      significant morbidity in millions of patients each year in the United States. Individuals&#xD;
      with long-standing diabetes develop both peripheral vascular disease and peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy. These patients may not feel pressure from shoes or objects which can damage their&#xD;
      skin. Once a wound is formed, it may heal very slowly or not at all due to diabetic&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) has been approved for use in diabetic ulcers.&#xD;
      However, delivery and maintenance of the drug at the wound site in sufficient quantities for&#xD;
      a sufficient period of time is a major hurdle to widespread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene activated matrix (GAM) technology offers the opportunity to place a therapeutic gene&#xD;
      contained within a structural matrix into a wound site. This study will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and potential clinical utility of topical applications of GAM501, a gene for PDGF-B contained&#xD;
      within an E1-deleted adenoviral vector and formulated in a bovine type I collagen gel. This&#xD;
      formulation allows for the migration of wound repair cells into the structural matrix, where&#xD;
      they encounter the viral vector and subsequently produce the therapeutic protein within the&#xD;
      local wound environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive up to four treatments with GAM501. Participants will&#xD;
      be followed by multiple observations over a 6 to 7 month period.&#xD;
