  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have had a leg amputated often choose to use a prosthetic (artificial) leg. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate a new method of making prosthetic legs for people who have had an&#xD;
      amputation below the knee.&#xD;

      The traditional assumption when fabricating a transtibial amputee (TTA) socket is that the&#xD;
      residual limb is not homogeneous in its ability to tolerate load. As a result, prosthetic&#xD;
      sockets are currently fabricated by modifying a positive mold to account for this&#xD;
      non-homogeneity; these are called rectified sockets. Unrectified sockets retain the shape of&#xD;
      the residual limb, except for a distal end pad. Unrectified sockets use an alginate gel&#xD;
      method of fabricating that is simpler and less time consuming than the method used to&#xD;
      fabricate rectified sockets. This study will compare patient satisfaction and function with&#xD;
      rectified and unrectified sockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomized to either a recitified socket group or an&#xD;
      unrectified socket group. Participants will wear the socket for a minimum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will then fill out a Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ). The PEQ&#xD;
      quantifies patient satisfaction by evaluating nine validated scales. Functional measures of&#xD;
      energy expenditure, kinematics, and ground reaction forces during gait will also be&#xD;
      collected. After 4 weeks, participants in the rectified socket group will switch to an&#xD;
      unrectified socket and participants in the unrectified socket group will switch to a&#xD;
      rectified socket. At the end of 4 weeks with the new socket, participants will once again&#xD;
      fill out the PEQ and undergo functional assessment. At the end of study participation, each&#xD;
      participant will freely choose the socket they wish to have in their final prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far, 10 study participants with unilateral transtibial amputations have been evaluated&#xD;
      after randomly wearing both rectified and unrectified sockets for 4 weeks. Results indicated&#xD;
      no differences between sockets for gait speed and timing, gait kinematics and kinetics, gait&#xD;
      energy expenditure, and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). There were also no differences in&#xD;
      the Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire. Four participants selected the rectified socket and&#xD;
      6 selected the unrectified socket as their exit socket.&#xD;
