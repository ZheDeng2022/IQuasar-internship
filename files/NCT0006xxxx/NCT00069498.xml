  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lining of the gastrointestinal tract contains specialized lymphoid tissue that is part of&#xD;
      the immune system. Like other parts of the immune system, HIV attacks this lymphoid tissue.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effect of an anti-inflammatory drug on the lymphoid tissue in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tracts of people with HIV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal tract is the body's largest lymphoid organ. Because it contains&#xD;
      significant numbers of activated memory T lymphocytes, it is a prime site for HIV infection&#xD;
      and amplification. Mucosal T cells are extremely vulnerable to HIV infection due, in part, to&#xD;
      a marked increase in CCR5 co-receptors. Understanding the impact of HIV on the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is essential and may provide insight into&#xD;
      the profound drop in mucosal lymphocytes during early infection, persistence of tissue viral&#xD;
      replication in the setting of undetectable plasma viral activity, and compartmentalization of&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the mucosal compartment in HIV uninfected&#xD;
      individuals is characterized by features which enhance vulnerability to HIV infection&#xD;
      compared to blood. Once infected, the mucosal response to HIV is inflammation. This study&#xD;
      will further evaluate the inflammatory response of mucosal tissue to HIV by examining the&#xD;
      effect of the anti-inflammatory drug 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) on the gut mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either 5-ASA or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study for 8 weeks; participants may then elect to&#xD;
      continue on 5-ASA for an additional 16 weeks. Participants will have four screening visits in&#xD;
      the month prior to beginning the study and four study visits during the 8-week study.&#xD;
      Assessments will include medical interviews and physical exams, sigmoidoscopy with mucosal&#xD;
      biopsy, and blood tests.&#xD;
