  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to deterimine if the new orally active iron chelator, ICL670, is&#xD;
      as effective and as safe as deferoxamine in preventing accumulation of iron in the body while&#xD;
      a patient is undergoing repeated blood transfusions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who require repeated blood transfusions to live accumulate iron in the body as blood&#xD;
      cells contain iron and there is no natural body mechanism to eliminate it. After a while the&#xD;
      iron levels get high enough to be toxic to the body. The current therapy of choice is&#xD;
      deferoxamine, which does a good job of removing excess iron, but is difficult to administer.&#xD;
      Deferoxamine requires subcutaneous (under the skin) infusions over 4 to 8 hours nightly 3 to&#xD;
      7 nights per week. In addition to the need to wear an infusion pump nightly, adverse&#xD;
      reactions around the site of the injection are frequent.&#xD;
