  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with renal failure need chronic dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Most&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients must take medicines indefinitely to prevent their immune systems&#xD;
      from rejecting the kidney. Long-term exposure to these anti-rejection medicines can damage&#xD;
      the transplanted kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving patients cells from the donor's bone&#xD;
      marrow will reduce or eliminate the need for long-term use of these anti-rejection drugs. In&#xD;
      addition to the donor's bone marrow cells, patients will receive the drugs thymoglobulin and&#xD;
      sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 patients will participate in this five-year study.&#xD;

      This protocol will evaluate the combination of Thymoglobulin (Sangstat), sirolimus and donor&#xD;
      bone marrow infusion for its ability to induce a state of donor specific hematopoietic&#xD;
      chimerism and immune hyporesponsiveness within the context of renal transplantation.&#xD;
      Thymoglobulin (Sangstat), a FDA-approved polyclonal rabbit-IgG antithymocyte preparation,&#xD;
      will be given for up to ten days at the time of transplantation to effect lymphocyte&#xD;
      depletion. This will be combined with sirolimus (rapamycin, Wyeth-Ayerst), an oral&#xD;
      immunosuppressant agent recently approved by the FDA. Sirolimus allows for antigen specific T&#xD;
      cell activation but prevents T cell clonal expansion by interrupting IL-2 receptor beta-chain&#xD;
      signal transduction. Donor bone marrow will be administered seven days following transplant.&#xD;
      Patients demonstrating six months of rejection free graft survival will have their sirolimus&#xD;
      withdrawn over three months beginning at the sixth month anniversary of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty people will be evaluated in this pilot protocol. Approximately ten will receive living&#xD;
      donor kidney allografts and the remaining patients will receive cadaveric kidney allografts.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with Thymoglobulin beginning prior to graft implantation and&#xD;
      continuing for approximately ten days. Glucocorticosteroids will be given during the first&#xD;
      Thymoglobulin treatment to limit monocyte activation and prevent the cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome associated with the initial administration of this antibody preparation. Patients&#xD;
      will be given sirolimus orally beginning the day after transplantation and continuously&#xD;
      thereafter. Donor bone marrow will be administered seven days following transplantation.&#xD;
      Patients will then be monitored for evidence of allograft rejection using standard functional&#xD;
      parameters and protocol allograft biopsies. In addition, patients will be followed for&#xD;
      specific desired effects, including a transient state of donor hematopoietic mixed&#xD;
      microchimerism and allospecific AICD. Both of these are expected to promote the development&#xD;
      of allospecific graft tolerance. This will be accomplished by assaying peripheral blood and&#xD;
      allograft biopsies for apoptosis and the peripheral blood for evidence of alloreactive T cell&#xD;
      clone depletion and donor chimerism.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates for a kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 12 through 60 at the time of transplant for the first 10 patients transplanted. Age 12&#xD;
        through 75 for subsequent patients. Patients younger than age 12 are better served being&#xD;
        transplanted in a center with more extensive pediatric medical and nephrology support.&#xD;
        Patients less than 12 years of age are also at higher risk for post transplant&#xD;
        lymphoproliferative disorder following transplant than adults and intensive induction&#xD;
        immunosuppression increases the risk further. The use of aggressive induction&#xD;
        imunosuppression in this population would be inappropriate. Patients over the age of 75&#xD;
        generally require less immunosuppression than younger patients. The use of aggressive&#xD;
        induction immunosuppression in this population would be inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Availability of donor tissue for testing. This could include splenic or peripheral blood&#xD;
        lymphocytes from a cadaveric donor or a willing living donor enrolled on the Clinical&#xD;
        Center Living Donor Protocol who consents to periodic phlebotomy for peripheral blood&#xD;
        lymphocyte isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Availability of adequate donor bone marrow for infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Immunosuppressive drug therapy at the time of or 2 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
        Specifically, candidates may not be taking prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus,&#xD;
        azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, antilymphocyte agents, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,&#xD;
        or other agents whose therapeutic effect is immunosuppressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with a nucleoside analogue chemotherapeutic agent (i.e. fludarabine phosphate,&#xD;
        cladribine, or pentostatin) within 12 months of kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute lymphocyte count less than 1000/mm(3) prior to first dose of Thymogobulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any active malignancy or any history of a hematologic malignancy or lymphoma. Patients with&#xD;
        primary, cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell cancers may be enrolled providing the&#xD;
        lesions are appropriately treated prior to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donor/recipient combinations in which there are 0 HLA mismatches or in which the donor is&#xD;
        homozygous for a shared HLA haplotype. Serologic HLA typing to be conducted at the Walter&#xD;
        Reed Army Medical Center Tissue Typing Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sensitization as defined by historical or current PRA less than 20 percent in patients&#xD;
        receiving their first kidney allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        First kidney graft survival less than 3 years as a consequence of acute/chronic rejection&#xD;
        or positive T or B cell crossmatch in patients receiving second kidney allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Historical or current positive T cell cross match between donor and recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant coagulopathy or requirement for anticoagulation therapy that would&#xD;
        contraindicate protocol allograft biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelet count less than 75,000/mm(3) at the time of transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any known immunodeficiency syndrome such as HIV, Chronic Granulomatous Disease, Severe&#xD;
        Combined Immunodeficiency, DiGeorge Syndrome, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of uncorrected cardiac insufficiency (either valvular or vascular) or major&#xD;
        vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects unwilling/unable to practice birth control if potentially fertile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of active or chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition that would likely increase the risk of protocol participation or confound&#xD;
        data interpretation such as inability or unwillingness to comply with protocol monitoring&#xD;
        and therapy, including, among others, a history of noncompliance, circumstances where&#xD;
        compliance with protocol requirements is not feasible due to living conditions, travel&#xD;
        restrictions, access to urgent medical services, or access to anti-rejection drugs after&#xD;
        the research protocol is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any history of allergy or anaphalaxis to rabbit proteins.&#xD;
