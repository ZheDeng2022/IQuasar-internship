    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a combination kidney and bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant from a relative with the same (or nearly the same) blood cell type as the&#xD;
      transplant recipient. An investigational medication will be given prior to and after the&#xD;
      transplant to help protect the transplanted kidney from attack by the body's immune system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the two currently available treatments for kidney failure, long-term dialysis and kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, only kidney transplantation provides a potential cure. After a kidney&#xD;
      transplant, the body's immune system recognizes the kidney as foreign and tries to attack and&#xD;
      destroy it in a process called rejection. To avoid rejection, participants must take&#xD;
      medications called immunosuppressants or anti-rejection drugs. It is believed that by&#xD;
      transplanting bone marrow at the same time as a solid organ such as a kidney, a state of&#xD;
      &quot;mixed chimerism&quot; (a mixing of the donor and recipient's immune system) can be achieved.&#xD;
      Mixed chimerism may prevent rejection without the need for anti-rejection drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive a simultaneous bone marrow and kidney transplant from&#xD;
      the same living related donor in an attempt to establish mixed chimerism. Prior to&#xD;
      transplantation, participants will undergo a &quot;conditioning regimen&quot; involving&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, radiation to the thymus gland, and four immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications: cyclosporine A, a man-made antibody known as rituximab to suppress B cells, a&#xD;
      short course of steroids, and a T-cell depleting antibody known as MEDI-507. MEDI-507 is an&#xD;
      investigational medication that has not been approved by the FDA. The primary goal of the&#xD;
      study is to investigate the safety of the conditioning regimen and its ability to promote&#xD;
      mixed chimerism so that the transplanted kidney is not destroyed. The study will also&#xD;
      determine whether participants with mixed chimerism can eventually be safely removed from&#xD;
      long-term immunosuppressive therapy following transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed before and after transplantation and will be followed â‰¤36&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

Hemodialysis was performed before and 14 hours after each dose of cyclophosphamide.Kidney transplantation was followed by IV infusion of donor bone marrow. Oral cyclosporine A was administered daily postoperatively, with target trough blood levels of 250 to 350 ng per milliliter; the dose was tapered and discontinued over a period of several months.&#xD;
