      low-income families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontic treatment has become a widely accepted procedure in dentistry. The benefits&#xD;
      include improved oral health, function, esthetics and quality of life. Significant&#xD;
      disparities exist among income strata regarding access to orthodontic services. The sources&#xD;
      of these disparities are complex and may reflect differences in the disease prevalence,&#xD;
      gender, cultural biases, perception of problems by this population, economic imperatives and&#xD;
      negative perceptions of these patients by orthodontists. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to examine the usefulness of early orthodontic intervention as a means of increasing&#xD;
      access to orthodontic services for children of low-income families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To compare orthodontic outcomes, facial body image, and quality of life between&#xD;
      Medicaid participants who receive early orthodontic treatment and those who do not. 1.a To&#xD;
      compare the level of understanding and compliance between early treatment subjects given&#xD;
      information about the goals, risks and benefits of the planned treatment one-on-one by an&#xD;
      orthodontist, with subjects who also use an interactive CD-ROM to provide this information.&#xD;
      This will be referred to as the Informed Consent Study and should not be confused with the&#xD;
      routine informed consenting process used to enroll subjects into the overall study.Aim 2. To&#xD;
      compare orthodontic outcomes, facial body image, and quality of life between Medicaid-funded&#xD;
      and private-pay patients who receive full orthodontic treatment at adolescence.Aim 3. To&#xD;
      compare orthodontic outcomes, facial body image, and quality of life between Medicaid-funded&#xD;
      patients who receive early orthodontic treatment only and Medicaid-funded participants who&#xD;
      receive full orthodontic treatment at adolescence. Relationship of this project with the&#xD;
      Disparity Center theme. Two of the goals of the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health&#xD;
      Disparity are met by this study. The first is to conduct clinical research to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of interventions to prevent and treat oral diseases and conditions in children. The&#xD;
      second is to develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new&#xD;
      information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions&#xD;
      that hold promise for reducing disparities. Today, children of low-income families have very&#xD;
      limited access to orthodontic treatment. We also know that some relatively simple&#xD;
      interventions done during the mixed dentition can be effective at reducing the severity of&#xD;
      malocclusion. This study is designed to examine how effective these early orthodontic&#xD;
      interventions are in a Medicaid population. It will also examine how outcomes from early&#xD;
      treatment in Medicaid patients compare to the more complex approach of complete orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment in the permanent dentition. Many orthodontists perceive that Medicaid patients are&#xD;
      at risk for poor outcomes, and limit access as a consequence. The follow-up component of this&#xD;
      study will address this issue by making a comparison between Medicaid and private-pay&#xD;
      patients treated in similar environments. We expect that significantly greater access to&#xD;
      orthodontic services could be provided for Medicaid patients by the more widespread use of&#xD;
      simpler, more timely interventions. This study will provide data on the trade-off between&#xD;
      simple, timely partial treatments, versus complete full treatments. In response to the second&#xD;
      theme of the Disparity Center, the use of interactive CD-ROMs that provide treatment&#xD;
      information at the comprehension level of young patients and their parents, and in a&#xD;
      culturally appropriate manner, will be examined. We expect this approach will improve patient&#xD;
      and parent understanding of the proposed treatment, as well as enhancing compliance with&#xD;
      treatment procedures in order to assure successful outcomes.&#xD;
