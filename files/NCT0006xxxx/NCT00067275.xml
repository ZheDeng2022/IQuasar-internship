      This study will examine how dopamine, a brain chemical, affects motor training. Taken by&#xD;
      mouth, dopamine can enhance motor training, especially during rehabilitation after brain&#xD;
      damage. The study will also examine whether Sinemet, a drug containing a precursor of&#xD;
      dopamine, can improve motor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and stroke patients between 18 and 80 years of age may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Healthy volunteers must be right-handed. Stroke patients must have had a&#xD;
      stroke that caused weakness in one hand, from which they have recovered enough to be able to&#xD;
      move the thumb in different directions. Participants will have up to three study sessions, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prestudy 1 (MRI, TMS with motor training)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 1: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This procedure uses a strong&#xD;
           magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues.&#xD;
           During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic&#xD;
           field. He or she can communicate with the staff administering the test at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 2: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - The subject sits in a comfortable&#xD;
           chair with the right forearm held still at the side and the head held still by an&#xD;
           aluminum frame. A magnetic coil is placed over the head, and a small probe is attached&#xD;
           to the thumb to measure thumb movement. Magnetic pulses are occasionally delivered over&#xD;
           the scalp, likely inducing a mild thumb movement. After this test, the subject takes a&#xD;
           tablet of either Sinemet or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient). Fifty&#xD;
           minutes after taking the pill, the subject undergoes motor training that involves&#xD;
           performing brisk thumb movements at a rate of 1 movement per second. At the end of the&#xD;
           training, TMS is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 3: Identical to session 2, except subjects who took Sinemet in session 2 now&#xD;
           take placebo, and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prestudy 2 (MRI, PET without motor training, no TMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 1: MRI of the brain if the subject has not had one within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 2: Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning - This procedure provides&#xD;
           information on brain chemistry and function. First, the subject is given either Sinemet&#xD;
           or placebo. The subject lies on a bed in a doughnut-shaped machine with a custom-molded&#xD;
           plastic mask placed over the face and head to support the head and hold it still during&#xD;
           the scanning. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in each arm-one to inject&#xD;
           [11C]raclopride-a radioactive substance that competes with dopamine for binding in&#xD;
           certain parts of the brain and can be detected by the PET scanner-and one to draw blood&#xD;
           samples for measuring the level of Sinemet in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 3: Identical to session 2, except subjects who took Sinemet in session 2 now&#xD;
           take placebo, and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study (MRI, TMS, PET with motor training)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 1: MRI of the brain, if one has not been done within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 2: TMS, followed by administration of Sinemet or placebo and PET scanning with&#xD;
           motor training. The subject lies quietly during the first half of the PET session and&#xD;
           performs brisk thumb movements during the second half. After completing the PET scan,&#xD;
           the subject undergoes TMS again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 3: Identical to session 2, except subjects who took Sinemet in session 2 now&#xD;
           take placebo, and vice versa.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It has been proposed that the nigrostriatal and cortical dopaminergic systems are involved in&#xD;
      motor learning in health and disease. However, it is not known to which extent dopamine&#xD;
      influences use-dependent plasticity (UDP), one of the crucial functions that mediate recovery&#xD;
      of motor function after stroke. Understanding the role of dopamine on UDP in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and patients with stroke may impact the development of rationale strategies to&#xD;
      promote functional recovery after this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present protocol is to provide evidence for the influence of dopaminergic&#xD;
      function on UDP in health and disease. We plan to address this issue in two different,&#xD;
      complementary ways (main experiment): (a) determine if UDP is positively correlated with the&#xD;
      decrease in raclopride binding potential (RAC-BP) in the contralateral dorsal striatum&#xD;
      (primary outcome measure), and (b) determine if administration of a dopaminergic drug will&#xD;
      enhance UDP and elicit a decrease in RAC-BP in the contralateral dorsal striatum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the main experiment, we will assess the ability of a dopaminergic drug to enhance UDP&#xD;
      (prestudy 1, motor training only), and the effects of a dopaminergic drug on RAC-BP during&#xD;
      resting condition (prestudy 2, RAC-PET during resting condition only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      UDP will be assessed using a technique developed in our lab, in which we have extensive&#xD;
      experience. In short, we will evaluate TMS-evoked thumb movement directions after a period of&#xD;
      motor training consisting of performance of voluntary thumb movements for 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Striatal and cortical dopamine release will be assessed with positron emission tomography&#xD;
      using the dopamine-D2 receptor radioligand [(11)C]raclopride, after administration of&#xD;
      placebo, and after administration of a dopaminergic drug. The study will be initially done in&#xD;
      a group of healthy volunteers and then in a group of patients with chronic subcortical stroke&#xD;
      who experienced good motor recovery.&#xD;
