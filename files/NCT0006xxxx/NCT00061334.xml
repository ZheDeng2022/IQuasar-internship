      The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms&#xD;
      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the&#xD;
      human prefrontal cortex. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during&#xD;
      functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral and&#xD;
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will&#xD;
      ascertain the relationship between so-called cold cognition such as event knowledge and &quot;hot&quot;&#xD;
      social cognition such as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex. We will also attempt to determine the relationship between non-frontal neural&#xD;
      structures involved in emotional expressions, such as amygdala, and those frontal neural&#xD;
      structures involved in executive functions that may modulate emotion. The data that we&#xD;
      collect in this protocol will be of value in (1) identifying a set of neural regions and&#xD;
      distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge representation stored in the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex and (2) developing functional MRI screening measures for subjects at-risk for&#xD;
      developing a neurological disorder. We will also use the data obtained in these studies with&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers to constrain theories of frontal lobe function based on the study of&#xD;
      patients with focal or diffuse frontal lobe lesions and to provide convergent evidence for&#xD;
      the role of specific frontal cortex sectors in specific cognitive functions.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms&#xD;
      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the&#xD;
      human prefrontal cortex. We suspect that political attitudes can also be viewed as a type of&#xD;
      stored knowledge. Religious attitudinal and event knowledge are also expected to be similarly&#xD;
      represented and stored. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during&#xD;
      functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral and&#xD;
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will&#xD;
      ascertain the relationship between so-called &quot;cold&quot; cognition such as event knowledge and&#xD;
      &quot;hot&quot; social cognition such as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal adult volunteers will participate in experiments dealing with processing of event&#xD;
      knowledge, general attitudes, political stereotypes and attitudes, and religious attitudes,&#xD;
      using fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the experiments will employ within-subject event-related fMRI design to determine whether&#xD;
      activations of different cortical areas correspond to different kind of stored knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data that we collect in this protocol will consist of fMRI activation images&#xD;
      corresponding to varying neuropsychological tasks. The will be of value in (1) identifying a&#xD;
      set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge&#xD;
      representation stored in the prefrontal cortex and (2) developing functional MRI screening&#xD;
      measures for subjects at-risk for developing a neurological disorder.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The healthy normal controls recruited into these studies will be determined by Section&#xD;
        staff phone and in-person interviews to be free of psychiatric, neurological, or other&#xD;
        medical disorders that would constrain interpretation of their performance during&#xD;
        functional neuroimaging studies. In addition, all normal volunteers must undergo a&#xD;
        neuroexam performed by the medically responsible investigator, an NINDS physician, once a&#xD;
        year before undergoing MRI scanning. The neurological exam will be done in the neurology&#xD;
        outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will be native English-speakers and right-handed, as measured by the Edinburgh&#xD;
        Handedness Inventory, due to the association between language lateralization and&#xD;
        handedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, all subjects in Study 3 (that addresses political stereotypes) will be&#xD;
        American and will be screened for political affiliation using several measures prior to&#xD;
        participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Political affiliation will be assessed by obtaining (1) self-reported political orientation&#xD;
        of the subject on a scale of 1 to 7 (where 1 is extremely liberal and 7 is extremely&#xD;
        conservative, Wyer et al., 1991), (2) political party preference of the subject on a scale&#xD;
        of 1 to 7 (where 1 is strongly Democratic and 7 is strongly Republican, Wyer et al., 1991),&#xD;
        and (3) scores on the Conservatism-Liberalism Scale (Mehrabian, 1996). Subjects rating&#xD;
        their orientation and preference (measures 1 and 2) as 3 or lower or 5 or higher and also&#xD;
        scoring higher than 20 or lower than -20 (maximum scores are plus or minus 28) on the&#xD;
        Conservatism-Liberalism Scale will be included in the study. American citizenship and the&#xD;
        political screening is necessary to enable the classification of conditions as&#xD;
        stereotype-congruent and - incongruent (as this is determined by their status as 'Democrat'&#xD;
        or 'Republican'). Subjects in Study 4 (that addresses political psychological structures)&#xD;
        will be screened to be American citizens prior to participating to the study. Party&#xD;
        affiliation, political orientation and adjunctive demographical data will be collected at&#xD;
        the end of the fMRI scan to be eventually considered as a potential source of variability&#xD;
        in the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with a neurological or psychiatric history or medical condition that would&#xD;
        compromise our interpretation of the fMRI results will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria are: medical contraindications to MRI procedures (e.g. pacemakers,&#xD;
        cochlear devices, surgical clips); technical contraindications to MRI procedures (e.g. no&#xD;
        braces); CNS active medications; and claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women will also be excluded from participation due to the unknown effects of the&#xD;
        high magnetic field on a developing fetus; to ensure compliance with this criterion, all&#xD;
        women will undergo a pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the scan. The results of the&#xD;
        pregnancy test must be negative in order for the women to be scanned.&#xD;
