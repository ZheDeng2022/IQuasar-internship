      To identify genes contributing to hypertension in African Americans by focusing on the&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the mid 1990s, the investigators have extensively characterized African Americans for&#xD;
      phenotypes related to cardiovascular and renal function. Based on recently completed genome&#xD;
      scans, they have identified several chromosomal regions likely to contain genes influencing&#xD;
      hypertension-related phenotypes in hypertensive, African American sib pairs. For several&#xD;
      phenotypes, overlapping QTLs have also been identified in related studies in a genetically&#xD;
      isolated French Canadian population and/or in homologous chromosomal regions in the F2 cross&#xD;
      of Dahl-salt sensitive x normotensive Brown Norway rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will extensively phenotype 500 hypertensive and 500 normotensive African&#xD;
      American subjects to conduct a genetic association study, using a single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism (SNP) genomic scan approach. To achieve a clear separation of blood pressures&#xD;
      from hypertensive subjects, normotensive subjects will be selected from the lower third of&#xD;
      the population-based blood pressure distribution. Hypertensive (BMI), and age. Inclusion of&#xD;
      phenotypes is based on their relevance to the pathophysiology of hypertension and prior&#xD;
      evidence of &quot;heritability.&quot; Candidate genes for SNP analysis will be selected within&#xD;
      chromosomal regions of two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that they have previously&#xD;
      demonstrated to be linked to hypertension-related phenotypes--a QTL for body mass index on&#xD;
      chromosome 1 and a QTL for microalbuminuria on chromosome 18. SNP analyses will be carried&#xD;
      out in 15 percent of the genes within each of these QTLs, and genes will be selected on the&#xD;
      basis of their relevance to hypertension, including documented sequence conservation for&#xD;
      blood pressure related QTLs with rat or mouse. The final goal of the project is to determine&#xD;
      if distinct clusters of blood pressure related phenotypes can be identified that will permit&#xD;
      stratification of hypertensive individuals into distinct subgroups to facilitate the analysis&#xD;
      of the genetic determinants of hypertension and/or provide mechanistic leads to genes&#xD;
      contributing to these traits.&#xD;
