  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the high risk of weight gain associated with smoking cessation in women.&#xD;
      The obesity prevention pilot study is designed for the primary prevention of weight gain that&#xD;
      can lead to overweight in normal-weight women, that can progress to obesity in women who are&#xD;
      already overweight, and for the prevention of additional weight gain in obese women with BMI&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 30.0. Fat and other macronutrient intake, specifically, sugar,&#xD;
      complex carbohydrates, and protein, are analyzed as a target for individually tailored,&#xD;
      weight control intervention following smoking cessation in Caucasian and African American&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Middle-aged women, especially African Americans, who quit smoking are at high risk for weight&#xD;
      gain, overweight, and obesity. Postcessation weight gain has been attributed to increased&#xD;
      food intake, which in turn, has been ascribed to a selective increase in high-sugar and other&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate foods with a high-fat content. This study compares the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness, for postmenopausal Caucasian and African American women, of following an&#xD;
      empirically validated smoking cessation program with either 1) a group cessation maintenance&#xD;
      program with standard exercise advice and food pyramid instructions for healthy eating or 2)&#xD;
      an individually tailored, dietary-control, exercise, weight-management and&#xD;
      cessation-maintenance program. Effectiveness is assessed by weight change from baseline to&#xD;
      postcessation months 6, 12, and 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to assess overall fat and other specific macronutrient intake (sugar,&#xD;
      complex carbohydrates, and protein) and total caloric intake with the use of a novel&#xD;
      macronutrient self-selection paradigm in Caucasian and African-American postmenopausal women&#xD;
      at baseline prior to smoking cessation, after being abstinent for one week, and again at 6,&#xD;
      12, and 20 months postcessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim is to assess whether there is differential responsiveness on the above measures&#xD;
      in postmenopausal Caucasian vs. African-American women.&#xD;
