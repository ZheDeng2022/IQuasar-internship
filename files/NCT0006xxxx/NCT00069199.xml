      This study, conducted at the NIH Clinical Center and the University of Wisconsin University,&#xD;
      will compare measurements obtained using older and newer models of a machine called an&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanner. This instrument uses a beam of light to measure&#xD;
      the thickness of the retina, the light-sensitive inner lining of the back of the eye. OCT&#xD;
      measurements will be done in multicenter clinical trials of new treatments for disorders that&#xD;
      cause vision loss, such as macular edema. Because some centers in these studies will use the&#xD;
      older OCT model and some the newer one, it is necessary to determine whether the two models&#xD;
      give comparable results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older in the following categories may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with diabetes, with or without macular edema;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with other retinal disease, such as uveitis or vein occlusion in the retina;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with no history of eye disease who have a normal retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess vision and eye pressure and to evaluate the retina. The pupils&#xD;
           are dilated with drops for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereoscopic color fundus photography to examine the back of the eye. Eye drops are used&#xD;
           to enlarge the size of the pupils to allow for a through examination and photographs of&#xD;
           the eye using a special camera that flashes a bright light into the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OCT to measure retinal thickness. For this procedure, the subject sits in front of a&#xD;
           small screen and looks at a target in the center of the screen while a dim red light&#xD;
           moves across the subject's retina. This test is done first with one model of the OCT&#xD;
           scanner, then the other. Finally, the test is repeated in both eyes with whichever model&#xD;
           was used first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are being treated for macular edema will repeat the same tests at their 3-month&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has increased markedly over the recent&#xD;
      years for clinical research. It is a promising new method for imaging the retina, measuring&#xD;
      its thickness, and displaying some features of this structure. It is useful in assessing&#xD;
      several eye diseases, including macular edema from various causes and abnormalities of the&#xD;
      vitreoretinal interface. There is a broad clinical consensus that OCT is superior to&#xD;
      stereoscopic color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and clinical biomicroscopic&#xD;
      examination in measuring retinal thickness and is capable of documenting fairly small changes&#xD;
      in thickness. OCT is becoming an important part of clinical trials of new treatments for&#xD;
      macular edema. A number of models of the OCT device are commercially available, models 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3. A number of models of OCT have been used in clinical centers involved in such clinical&#xD;
      research. Comparisons of these models 2 and 3 as well as the reproducibility of these&#xD;
      measurements have not been conducted. The main research questions to be answered in this&#xD;
      protocol are the following, in patients with normal retina, diabetic macular edema, macular&#xD;
      edema from other causes, or other vitreoretinal abnormalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the standard deviation of the differences of sequential measurements of retinal&#xD;
           thickness in normal retinas using OCT 3 similar to those measured with the OCT 2?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there systematic differences between thickness measurements using OCT 2 and OCT 3 in&#xD;
           the same eyes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are there differences in the ability of each machine to image abnormalities within the&#xD;
           vitreoretinal interface?&#xD;
