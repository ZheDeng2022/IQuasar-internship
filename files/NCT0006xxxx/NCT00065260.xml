  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow, is&#xD;
      effectively treated by immunosuppressive therapy, usually a combination of antithymocyte&#xD;
      globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA). Survival rates following this regimen are equivalent&#xD;
      to those achieved with allogeneic stem cells transplantation. However, approximately 1/3 of&#xD;
      patients will not show blood count improvement after ATG/CsA. General experience and small&#xD;
      pilot studies have suggested that such patients may benefit from further immunosuppression.&#xD;
      Furthermore, analysis of our own clinical data suggest that patients with poor blood count&#xD;
      responses to a single course of ATG, even when transfusion-independence is achieved, have a&#xD;
      markedly worse prognosis than patients with robust hematologic improvement. The management of&#xD;
      such cases is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll patients who are either refractory to h-ATG (continued severe&#xD;
      pancytopenia) or who have only modest improvement in blood counts (weak hematologic&#xD;
      responders) to receive a further immunosuppressive therapy, delivered either as rabbit ATG&#xD;
      (Thymoglobulin, r-ATG) or a humanized monoclonal antibody to T-cells, alemtuzumab (Campath-1H&#xD;
      ). Primary endpoint will be response rate at 3 months defined as no longer meeting criteria&#xD;
      for severe aplastic anemia. Relapse, robustness of hematopoietic recovery at 3 months,&#xD;
      survival and clonal evolution to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplasia&#xD;
      and acute leukemia will be the secondary endpoints.&#xD;
