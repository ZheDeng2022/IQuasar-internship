    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Chromium on glucose tolerance and&#xD;
      endothelial function in people at risk for type II diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and insulin resistance (IR)&#xD;
      are precursors to type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and its sequelae, and are cardiac risk&#xD;
      factors in their own right. The worsening epidemic of DM in the US, along with the increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and IGT, render the identification of promising&#xD;
      interventions for these states a matter of some urgency. While lifestyle interventions based&#xD;
      on dietary pattern and physical activity can delay or prevent the onset of diabetes, and&#xD;
      reduce cardiovascular risk, adherence at the population level is severely limiting.&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy offers promise for diabetes prevention, but with associated high costs,&#xD;
      unacceptability to many patients, and potential toxicity. In this context, the potential role&#xD;
      of chromium (Cr), an insulin co-factor, in IGT is of great interest. Chromium use is&#xD;
      widespread, but evidence of any therapeutic effect is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed, therefore, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled pilot trial conducted&#xD;
      at the Yale Prevention Research Center, to investigate the effects of daily Cr for 6 months&#xD;
      at two dose levels on serum measures of glucose tolerance, and on endothelial function, in&#xD;
      adults with IGT, IFG, and IR. A modified crossover design will allow for paired and unpaired&#xD;
      analyses including comparison of both 500 mcg and 1,000 mcg of Cr daily to placebo;&#xD;
      comparison between 500 mcg and 1000 mcg of chromium; and evaluation of Cr washout time. The&#xD;
      study is powered to detect a clinically meaningful effect of Cr supplementation at either&#xD;
      dose on glucose control, and to compare the two doses for equivalence. The study will&#xD;
      investigate effects of Cr on both measures of glucose tolerance (glucose, insulin, OGTT) and&#xD;
      brachial artery endothelial function, thus combining serum measures with a physiologic test&#xD;
      of Cr effects on the vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will generate much needed data regarding the efficacy of Cr in those at&#xD;
      risk for type II diabetes and offers the promise of guiding practice, as well as directing&#xD;
      future study. By contributing to knowledge related to potential diabetes prevention&#xD;
      strategies, this study addresses one of the more pressing public health issues in the US&#xD;
      today. Risk to human subjects in this study is a minor increment over minimal due to the&#xD;
      administration of nitroglycerin as a control in BARS testing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified to have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG),&#xD;
             or insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        According to the 1999 World Health Organization (WHO) report, IGT is diagnosed if the&#xD;
        following two criteria are met: 1) Plasma glucose two hours after consuming 75g glucose&#xD;
        (OGTT) is at least 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) but below 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) and 2) Fasting&#xD;
        plasma glucose level is less than 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl). IFG is diagnosed by a fasting&#xD;
        plasma glucose concentration of 5.6 mmol/l (100 mg dl/l) or greater, but less than 7.0&#xD;
        mmol/l (126 mg dl/l). NCEP ATP III guidelines define 5 components of insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least 3 of the 5 criteria are required for the diagnosis. These components are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Abdominal obesity determined by waist circumference &gt;102cm(&gt;40in) in men or &gt;88cm(&gt;35in) in&#xD;
        women; triglyceride level ≥150mg/dL; HDL-C &lt;40mg/dL in men or &lt;50mg/dL in women; blood&#xD;
        pressure ≥ 130/≥85mm Hg; and fasting glucose ≥ 100mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Connecticut residents willing to travel to Griffin Hospital in Derby, CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diabetes (Fasting Plasma Glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl; 2-hour 75-g OGTT plasma glucose &gt;&#xD;
             200 mg/dl;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes diagnosed by a physician and confirmed by other clinical data);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported hospitalization for treatment of heart disease in past 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired renal function as measured by labwork at initial screening (serum creatinine&#xD;
             greater than 2.0 Serum creatinine and urine albumin excretion will be tested every six&#xD;
             months throughout the study). Significant changes from baseline or to outside of&#xD;
             threshold will be reported to the DSMB for appropriate action, including removal from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported pancreatitis. In the instance that potential subjects report that they&#xD;
             are unsure whether they have been diagnosed with this condition, a primary medical&#xD;
             doctor's note will be obtained confirming non-diagnosis before inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported recent or significant abdominal surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported pregnancy and/or intention become pregnancy during the study. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing age will consent to pregnancy testing at baseline, and will agree to&#xD;
             avoiding pregnancy by reliable means throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported polycystic ovarian syndrome or irregular menses will be excluded from&#xD;
             the study. (In the future, people with self-reported polycystic ovarian syndrome or&#xD;
             irregular menses may be allowed in the study, however, because their conditions have&#xD;
             the potential of affecting the outcome of BARS testing (a secondary outcome), they&#xD;
             will be treated as a subset of the population during data analysis).&#xD;
