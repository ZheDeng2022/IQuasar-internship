    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as carboplatin and etoposide use different ways to&#xD;
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Thalidomide may stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known if combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy is more effective with or without thalidomide in treating small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying carboplatin, etoposide, and thalidomide&#xD;
      to see how well they work compared to carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with&#xD;
      limited- or extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the survival of patients with limited or extensive stage small cell lung cancer&#xD;
           treated with carboplatin and etoposide with vs without thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the time to disease progression in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the response rates of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients&#xD;
      are stratified according to disease stage (limited vs extensive), ECOG performance status (0&#xD;
      and 1 vs 2), and alkaline phosphatase (no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal [ULN]&#xD;
      vs greater than 1.5 times ULN). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and etoposide* IV over&#xD;
           1-2 hours on days 1 and 2 and orally on day 3. Patients also receive oral thalidomide&#xD;
           daily beginning on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin and etoposide as in arm I and oral placebo daily&#xD;
           beginning on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients who are unable to receive etoposide IV on day 2 may receive oral etoposide on&#xD;
      days 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6&#xD;
      courses. Patients receive thalidomide or placebo continuously for up to 2 years. Treatment&#xD;
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who&#xD;
      experience disease progression may continue to receive thalidomide or placebo provided the&#xD;
      patient is clinically and symptomatically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during each course of chemotherapy, at 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of chemotherapy, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years after the completion of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 372 patients (186 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
