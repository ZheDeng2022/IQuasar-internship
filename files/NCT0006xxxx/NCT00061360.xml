  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder characterized&#xD;
      by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA) have&#xD;
      dramatically changed the natural course of this illness, with 5 year survival of 75% in&#xD;
      patients undergoing either treatment. Since most patients are not suitable candidates for&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to advanced age or lack of a&#xD;
      histocompatible sibling, efforts at NHLBI have focused on improving immunosuppression&#xD;
      treatment in order to improve response rates, survival, and to decrease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our experience of 122 patients treated at NHLBI with the combination of ATG and&#xD;
      cyclosporine, one quarter to one third did not respond; about 50% of responders relapsed; and&#xD;
      5 year survival was correlated with the robustness in blood cell count improvement at 3&#xD;
      months (reticulocyte or platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000 /uL). Why some&#xD;
      patients do not respond initially while others relapse is unclear. Autoreactive T cells may&#xD;
      be resistant to the effect of ATG/CsA (nonresponders), while in others residual autoreactive&#xD;
      T cells expand post-treatment leading to hematopoietic stem cell destruction and recurrent&#xD;
      pancytopenia (relapse). Therefore, novel immunosuppressive regimens to increase response&#xD;
      rates and hematologic recovery at 3 months and to decrease relapse rates are needed. An&#xD;
      ongoing NHLBI trial, which is close to completing accrual, has added mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      (MMF) for a total of 18 months to standard ATG + CsA in an attempt to reduce the relapse rate&#xD;
      after cyclosporine is discontinued. Preliminary results have been disappointing, with no&#xD;
      marked reduction in relapse among patients who received MMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune , RAPA) is a novel immunosuppressive agent, which acts&#xD;
      synergistically with cyclosporine by blocking T cell activation through CsA-resistant&#xD;
      pathways. The potentiation of the combination of CsA-RAPA has been established in vitro and&#xD;
      in the clinical setting, mainly in islet cell and solid organ transplantation. The&#xD;
      significant increase in response rate seen with the addition of CsA to ATG indicated that an&#xD;
      inhibitory effect on T lymphocytes is important in blocking autoreactive T cells in aplastic&#xD;
      anemia. The combination of CsA-RAPA may further block activated autoreactive T cells and&#xD;
      therefore lead to improved response rates (and survival) and decreased relapse rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized phase II study will investigate two different immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimens in patients with severe aplastic anemia who have not received prior&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy. One arm will receive ATG + CsA in addition to sirolimus for 6&#xD;
      months, and the second arm will receive standard ATG + CsA for 6 months followed by a slow&#xD;
      taper of CsA with a 25% dose reduction every 3 months for the subsequent 18 months. This&#xD;
      trial will determine the effectiveness of sirolimus in patients with aplastic anemia as well&#xD;
      as the role of a cyclosporine taper in preventing relapses. Primary endpoint will be no&#xD;
      longer meeting criteria for severe aplastic anemia while secondary endpoints are relapse,&#xD;
      robustness of hematologic recovery at 3 months, survival, clonal evolution to PNH,&#xD;
      myelodysplasia and acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10/11/2005. The Sirolimus (Rapamune) arm of the trial was stopped for lack of efficacy. The&#xD;
      study will continue as a single arm study to establish if slow taper of CsA prevents relapse&#xD;
      rates after initial standard treatment with ATG followed by CsA for six months.&#xD;
