      BACKGROUND Sudden cardiac death (SCD) affects 400,000 individuals each year in the U.S.&#xD;
      alone. Over half have no evidence of heart disease prior to death, and our ability to&#xD;
      identify those at risk and, therefore prevent SCD, is poor. Mutations in cardiac ion channel&#xD;
      genes including SCN5A, KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, KCNE2 and RyR2 have been implicated in monogenic&#xD;
      traits with high risk of SCD, such as the long-QT, Brugada, sudden infant death syndrome&#xD;
      (SIDS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Alterations in ion channel&#xD;
      function can result in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in diverse disease states.&#xD;
      Therefore, sequence variants in these genes that alter function or transcription of these ion&#xD;
      channels may confer a predisposition to ventricular arrhythmia and SCD in broader&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE This research program proposes to determine if sequence variants in the&#xD;
      above and other candidate genes are associated with an increased risk of SCD in&#xD;
      apparently-healthy populations. Cases of SCD will be assembled from 5 NIH-funded prospective&#xD;
      cohorts with a total of 106,314 individuals with existent blood samples. All cohorts are&#xD;
      exceptionally well-characterized with respect to environmental exposures and have collected&#xD;
      medical records on cardiovascular endpoints. We will characterize all coding sequence&#xD;
      variation and selected non-coding sequence variation among 100 cases and controls from these&#xD;
      cohorts for the 6 genes. We will then employ a nested case-control design and conditional&#xD;
      logistic regression to test for associations between haplotypes (haplotype tag SNPs) in both&#xD;
      coding and non-coding regions of candidate genes and SCD risk. We will also test directly for&#xD;
      associations between single loci that may have functional significance and SCD risk. An&#xD;
      estimated 600 cases of well-documented SCD will be confirmed over the first 3 years of the&#xD;
      grant period, and these cases will be matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic location&#xD;
      to two control subjects from the same cohort. In addition, based upon known sex difference in&#xD;
      the phenotypic expression of the candidate genes in the primary arrhythmic disorders, we will&#xD;
      specifically examine sex difference in the risk of SCD associated with sequence variation in&#xD;
      these genes. The findings generated will have substantial implications for our understanding&#xD;
      of the SCD syndrome and risk stratification in the general population.&#xD;
