      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic syndrome is a common disorder posing a significant major risk for coronary&#xD;
      heart disease and early mortality in the Western hemisphere. Central to its cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications is the association of the syndrome with the specific abnormalities in plasma&#xD;
      lipid and lipoprotein profiles including increased plasma triglycerides, decreased HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, and predominance of dense lipoprotein particles. In search for the genetic&#xD;
      etiology of this lipid disorder, the investigators identified a quantitative trait locus&#xD;
      (QTL) on human chromosome 7q36 strongly linked to variation in plasma lipid levels. They&#xD;
      hypothesize that this QTL contains genetic variants that contribute to alterations in&#xD;
      biologic pathways underlying the genesis of the lipid disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will search for the genetic cause of the metabolic syndrome, a lipid disorder that&#xD;
      poses a major risk for coronary heart disease. The investigators have identified a&#xD;
      quantitative trait locus (QTL) on human chromosome 7q36 strongly linked to variation in&#xD;
      plasma lipid levels. The investigators hypothesize that this QTL contains genetic variants&#xD;
      that contribute to alterations in biologic pathways underlying the genesis of the lipid&#xD;
      disorder. To test for this hypothesis, they propose a comprehensive approach utilizing&#xD;
      established resources and expertise to identify the functional sequence variants within this&#xD;
      QTL. Specifically, they will 1.) identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their&#xD;
      haplotype and linkage disequilibrium structure across the entire QTL region; 2.) Analyze&#xD;
      association of informative SNPs with plasma triglyceride levels, LDL levels, and lipoprotein&#xD;
      density fractions using variance component linkage/disequilibrium analyses; and 3.) Identify&#xD;
      potentially functional sequence variants in associated genes or genomic regions using&#xD;
      Bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide analysis. This comprehensive application of newly&#xD;
      available genomic technologies, novel statistical approaches, the DNA and phenotypic&#xD;
      information available, and the consortium of expertise assembled behind this project will&#xD;
      ensure the successful elucidation of the genetic etiology of this lipid disorder and&#xD;
      consequently the development of effective means for prevention and/or treatment of&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
