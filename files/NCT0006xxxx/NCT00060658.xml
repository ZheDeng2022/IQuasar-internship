  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify brain regions involved in&#xD;
      solving algebraic math problems. It will examine brain activation according to the level of&#xD;
      difficulty and the number of steps required to solve the problem. This information will help&#xD;
      identify a possible correlation between problem-solving strategies and patterns of brain&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undergraduate or graduate students between 19 and 36 years of age who have completed at least&#xD;
      2 years of college, have had at least one college course in integral calculus, and who have&#xD;
      no history of neurological disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, including psychiatric and neurological information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to mentally solve a variety of integral calculus problems while&#xD;
      undergoing MRI scanning, a procedure that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
      produce images of structural and chemical changes in the brain. During the scan, the subject&#xD;
      lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) containing a magnetic field. A problem and&#xD;
      possible solution are presented to the subject, who presses a button to verify if the answer&#xD;
      is correct. At the end of the test, the participant completes a follow-up questionnaire to&#xD;
      determine the problem-solving strategies used.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the&#xD;
      forms of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in&#xD;
      the human prefontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing experimental neuropsychological tasks during functional MRI on healthy, adult&#xD;
      volunteers, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex in mathematical cognition in a population of normal controls recruited among college&#xD;
      and graduate students. We will also attempt to determine the relationship of mathematical&#xD;
      cognition between non-frontal neural structures, such as left parietal lobe, and frontal&#xD;
      neural structures involved in mechanistic plans, actions and mental sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will consist of behavioral measures of cognitive performance and&#xD;
      corresponding fMRI images. The data that we collect in this protocol will be of value in&#xD;
      identifying a set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge&#xD;
      representation stored in the prefrontal cortex. We will also use the data obtained in these&#xD;
      studies to constrain theories of frontal lobe function and to provide evidence for the role&#xD;
      of specific frontal cortex sectors in specific cognitive functions.&#xD;
