        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed malignant melanoma that is advanced or metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received up to 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens (including&#xD;
             dacarbazine, and alternative dosing schedule of temozolomide). The last chemotherapy&#xD;
             must have been at least 4 weeks prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy will be allowed. Radiotherapy must have been completed at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior surgery. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed and&#xD;
             patients must have recovered from all side effects associated with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with measurable disease. At least one bidimensionally measurable lesion with&#xD;
             clearly defined margins documented by: medical photograph for skin and oral lesions,&#xD;
             plain X-ray with at least one diameter 0.5 cm or greater, CT, MRI, or palpation with&#xD;
             both diameters 2 cm or greater. A radiated bony lesion may not be considered an&#xD;
             evaluable lesion, unless there is evidence of disease progression at that site prior&#xD;
             to administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical parameters: Life expectancy &gt; 2 months, Age &gt;18 years, ECOG performance&#xD;
             status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have adequate organ function related to the following: White count &gt;&#xD;
             3000/ul, Platelet count &gt; 70,000/ul, Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/l, Bilirubin WNL, AST and ALT &lt;&#xD;
             2.5 x ULN, and Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or 24 hour creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There should be no acute infection requiring systemic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent: Each patient must be completely aware of the nature of his/her&#xD;
             disease process and must willingly give consent after being informed of the procedure&#xD;
             to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential&#xD;
             benefits, side-effects, risks, and discomforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy within four weeks prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy to greater than or equal to 50% of the bone marrow. Patients must&#xD;
             not have had prior radiotherapy to areas of measurable disease unless they have&#xD;
             clearly progressive disease in this site or there is measurable disease outside the&#xD;
             area of prior radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insufficient recovery from all active toxicities of prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are poor medical risks because of active nonmalignant systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frequent vomiting or medical condition that could interfere with oral medication&#xD;
             intake (e.g. partial bowel obstruction).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior malignancy other than curatively treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or&#xD;
             skin cancer. If in the opinion of the treating physician, sufficient time has elapsed,&#xD;
             such that it is extremely likely that the patient has been cured of a prior&#xD;
             malignancy, the patient may be eligible for the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or intensive&#xD;
             treatment (e.g. serious infection). HIV status or other severe illnesses will be&#xD;
             assessed using medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women. Both women and men must take adequate precautions to&#xD;
             prevent pregnancy during treatment.&#xD;
