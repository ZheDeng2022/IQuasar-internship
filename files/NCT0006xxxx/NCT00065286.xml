  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Akathisia is a movement disorder that is often a side effect of certain psychiatric drugs.&#xD;
      People with akathisia are unable to sit or keep still, complain of restlessness, fidget, rock&#xD;
      from foot to foot, and pace. Akathisia is sometimes called &quot;restless legs syndrome.&quot; The&#xD;
      drugs that can cause akathisia are most often used to treat patients with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      mental retardation (MR). This study will evaluate akathisia in both schizophrenic and MR&#xD;
      patients who either have long-term akathisia or who are starting treatment with psychiatric&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Akathisia is a relatively common side effect of neuroleptic medication that occurs within 1&#xD;
      week to 6 months after the initiation of medication. Akathisia is characterized by a variety&#xD;
      of movement manifestations, such as fidgeting, irritability, inability to sit or stand still,&#xD;
      marching in place, continuous trunk motions, sleeplessness, and a subjective sense of&#xD;
      restlessness. Akathisia has been studied primarily in schizophrenic patients, although&#xD;
      reports on individuals with mental retardation suggest that akathisia also occurs in this&#xD;
      population. This study will characterize the movement dynamics of akathisia in schizophrenic&#xD;
      and mentally retarded adults using two experimental series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first experimental series will compare chronic akathisia in schizophrenic and MR&#xD;
      patients. Four groups of MR patients and four groups of schizophrenic patients will be&#xD;
      studied: young (age 18 to 38) with chronic akathisia, older (age 40 to 60) with chronic&#xD;
      akathisia, young on neuroleptics without akathisia, and older on neuroleptics without&#xD;
      akathisia. Two control groups will include healthy individuals with normal intelligence who&#xD;
      are not on neuroleptic medication. Assessments will include videotaped recordings and&#xD;
      kinematic analysis of naturally occurring akathisia restlessness movements as well as&#xD;
      cognitive and psychiatric tests. Demographic factors (age and sex) and medication factors&#xD;
      (type and duration) will also be assessed to determine their relation to and possible impact&#xD;
      on chronic akathisia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second experimental series will compare schizophrenic and MR patients who are initiating&#xD;
      neuroleptic therapy. Institutionalized MR patients will be age matched with schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients. Tests will occur at baseline (prior to drug initiation) and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      16, 24, and 52. Those who enroll in the protocol early will be tested for more than 12 months&#xD;
      where possible and useful. The same analyses as in the first experimental series will be used&#xD;
      to allow for comparison of acute and chronic akathisia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria for Experimental Series I&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic akathisia for at least 3 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Control Group&#xD;
