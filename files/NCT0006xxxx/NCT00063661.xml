  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease patients usually have difficulty making automatic movements. Automatic&#xD;
      movements are movements people often make without conscious thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate regions of the brain that affect automatic&#xD;
      movements and to understand the movements of Parkinson's patients. Investigators hope this&#xD;
      knowledge will lead to better treatment for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty participants will be enrolled in this study. Each will give a medical history and&#xD;
      undergo a brief physical exam. Participants will have two MRI scans, each lasting&#xD;
      approximately 1.5 hours. During these scans, they may be asked to move their right or left&#xD;
      hands or to remember some letters that they have been shown. Before undergoing the second&#xD;
      scan, participants will be asked to practice the tasks until they can perform them correctly.&#xD;

      Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are deficient in making automatic movements. The&#xD;
      underlying neural correlates of the problem are not understood. In the present study, to&#xD;
      investigate the brain activity contributing to this disorder, we will use specially designed&#xD;
      dual-task paradigm and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Thirty&#xD;
      patients with PD will be asked to perform sequential finger-tapping movement with the right&#xD;
      hand; results will be analyzed from 20 patients who achieve automaticity as defined in the&#xD;
      study. In addition, we will use a dual-task paradigm to evaluate automaticity by having&#xD;
      subjects perform either a distraction task (involving visual memory) or an interference task&#xD;
      (tapping with the left hand) simultaneously with the sequential movements. Patients will&#xD;
      practice to achieve automaticity. fMRI will be obtained before and after achieving&#xD;
      automaticity. By analyzing fMRI results, we will explore the brain regions associated with&#xD;
      deficiency of automatic movements in PD patients.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thirty patients with PD will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of PD is based on medical history, physical and neurological examinations,&#xD;
        response to levodopa or dopaminergic drugs, and laboratory tests and MRI scans to exclude&#xD;
        other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and&#xD;
        Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Only patients with mild to moderate motor disability (UDRS&#xD;
        less than or equal to 40) and without cognitive impairment (MMT score greater than or equal&#xD;
        to 25) will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be studied only after their medication has been withdrawn for at least 12&#xD;
        hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects participating in the study should have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record&#xD;
        Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The fMRI experiment will follow the standard operating procedures of the HMCS Neuroimaging&#xD;
        Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with psychiatric disorders or severe motor disabilities will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with pacemakers, cardiac or neural defibrillators, intracranial aneurysm clips,&#xD;
        intraorbital metallic structures, insulin pumps, cochlear implants, and other metallic&#xD;
        objects will not be scanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are pregnant are excluded from MRI because the safety of the fetus in the&#xD;
        presence of high magnetic fields is not established. Therefore, all women of childbearing&#xD;
        potential will have a pregnancy test performed, which must be negative, before proceeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects under age 18 will be excluded.&#xD;
