      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug rosiglitazone for improving&#xD;
      heart function in patients with heart failure and glucose intolerance or type II&#xD;
      (adult-onset) diabetes, or both. Because of a lowered sensitivity to the hormone insulin,&#xD;
      patients with type II diabetes or glucose-intolerance do not regulate glucose (sugar)&#xD;
      effectively. Rosiglitazone is used to treat type II diabetes, but it is not commonly given to&#xD;
      patients with heart failure because it can cause leg swelling and, rarely, pulmonary edema.&#xD;
      However, patients with heart failure who also have glucose intolerance or type II diabetes&#xD;
      generally fare worse than those with heart failure alone, and therapies that decrease insulin&#xD;
      resistance may be beneficial to these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older with heart failure and type II diabetes or glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, or both, may be eligible for this study. Patients must be stable on current&#xD;
      therapy for heart failure and must not have any planned surgeries for coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. Candidates will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for from 2 to 7 days for&#xD;
      screening procedures, which include a medical history and physical examination, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), exercise&#xD;
      testing, and echocardiography (ultrasound test of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either rosiglitazone or placebo (an&#xD;
      identical-looking pill with no active ingredient). They will take one tablet a day for the&#xD;
      first month, one tablet twice a day for the second month, and then two tablets twice a day&#xD;
      from the third month to the end of the study at 6 months. During the treatment period,&#xD;
      patients will have a history, physical examination, and blood tests every 4 weeks, exercise&#xD;
      testing and echocardiography at 3 and 6 months, and urinalysis, electrocardiogram and MRI at&#xD;
      6 months. To check for fluid accumulation in the legs or lungs, patients will report their&#xD;
      weight and symptoms every 2 weeks throughout the study. After the 6-month treatment period,&#xD;
      patients will be put back on the diabetes medicines they were taking before the study. Their&#xD;
      physicians will be notified of possible modifications in treatment for maintaining optimum&#xD;
      glucose tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after completing treatment (one year after beginning the study), patients will&#xD;
      return to the Clinical Center for blood tests to measure the long-term effects of&#xD;
      rosiglitazone and to evaluate progress. They will then be invited to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      annual checkups, if possible, or for yearly follow-up by mail or telephone to review their&#xD;
      health status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current medical management for heart failure invariably employs a 'one treatment fits&#xD;
      all' approach. The failure to appreciate specific genotypic/phenotypic features in heart&#xD;
      failure subjects is postulated to be a reason recent heart failure studies evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy of tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists and endothelin receptor blockers showed&#xD;
      no overall benefit. This experience suggests that the future improvement in the medical&#xD;
      management of patients with heart failure may require pre-prescription genotyping/phenotyping&#xD;
      to tailor drug therapy to the underlying mechanistic processes orchestrating the development&#xD;
      and progression of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the insulin-resistance syndrome has been recognized as a significant&#xD;
      associated factor with the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. A novel&#xD;
      class of agents has been developed that increase insulin sensitivity via the activation of&#xD;
      the transcription factor-peroxisomal proliferators activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma).&#xD;
      These drugs, known as the thiazolidinediones are currently licensed for the treatment of type&#xD;
      II diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, at the preclinical level, PPAR gamma appears to play a&#xD;
      regulatory role in attenuating the development of cardiac hypertrophy and thiazolidinedione&#xD;
      therapy has been shown to attenuate the development of contractile dysfunction in mice&#xD;
      following myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis intrinsic to this proposal is that insulin resistance is commonly associated&#xD;
      with the development/progression of heart failure and that improving insulin sensitivity will&#xD;
      be of clinical benefit in this select group of patients with heart failure. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of thiazolidinedione therapy&#xD;
      in insulin-resistant heart failure subjects. The study is designed as a phase II, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study. The primary outcomes will be the&#xD;
      safety of administration, and the evaluation of the modulation in contractile function in&#xD;
      heart failure subjects treated with thiazolidnediones. Moreover, changes in functional&#xD;
      capacity and the determination of the biochemical and genomic modification of heart failure&#xD;
      and insulin-resistance will be measured in response to thiazolidnedione therapy in heart&#xD;
      failure subjects.&#xD;
