  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a risky procedure. If doctors could reduce the&#xD;
      complications, BMT would be safer to use for a wider range of conditions. The purposes of&#xD;
      this study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to prevent graft rejection by increasing the amount of immunosuppression and by giving&#xD;
           some lymphocytes from the donor before transplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by transplanting T-cell depleted stem cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to improve the immune effect against residual leukemia by the add-back of donor&#xD;
           lymphocytes before transplant and six or more weeks after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the standard transplant protocol, study participants will undergo additional&#xD;
      procedures. First, along with total body irradiation, patients will receive two drugs (a high&#xD;
      dose of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) to suppress immunity and prevent rejection of the&#xD;
      transplant. Second, four days before the transplant, patients will be given donor lymphocytes&#xD;
      that have been irradiated to make them incapable of causing GVHD. On the day of the&#xD;
      transplant, patients will receive an infusion of T-cell depleted bone marrow stem cells.&#xD;
      Finally, patients will receive two doses of add-back donor T-cells (45 and 100 days post&#xD;
      transplant) and the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine starting on day 44 until about six&#xD;
      months after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants must be between the ages of 10 and 56 and have a family member who is a&#xD;
      suitable stem cell donor match.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stem cell transplant studies carried out by the NHLBI BMT Unit have focused on approaches to&#xD;
      optimize the stem cell and lymphocyte dose in order to improve transplant survival and&#xD;
      increase the graft-vs.-leukemia effect. The aim is to create the transplant conditions that&#xD;
      permit rapid donor immune recovery without causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by using&#xD;
      no post-transplant immunosuppression in conjunction with a transplant depleted of T cells to&#xD;
      a fixed low dose, below the threshold known to be associated with GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found that the outcome from transplant is improved by controlling the stem cell&#xD;
      (CD34+ cell) and T lymphocyte (CD3+ cell) dose. In the last study, in this series, we used&#xD;
      the Nexell Isolex 300i system to obtain high CD34+ doses depleted of lymphocytes to a fixed&#xD;
      CD3+ T cell dose of 2 x 10(4)/kg. The use of the cell separator and the monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      was covered by IDE 8139. The study measured the incidence of acute GVHD and used chimerism&#xD;
      assays to determine the percentage of donor and recipient cells circulating at different&#xD;
      time-points after transplant. We found that in the first six weeks donor T cell chimerism&#xD;
      varied widely reaching 100% only in 10/22 patients. Thus the goal or rapid donor immune&#xD;
      recovery was achievable only in about half the patients. Patients with mixed donor-recipient&#xD;
      T cell populations are known to be at higher risk for late graft rejection and leukemic&#xD;
      relapse after transplant. Therefore the achievement of full donor chimerism is an important&#xD;
      therapeutic goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve donor T cell chimerism we will test whether the addition of irradiated donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes during the preparative regimen of the transplant can increase the chance of&#xD;
      achieving 100% donor T cell chimerism within six weeks of transplant. It is known that&#xD;
      irradiated lymphocytes do not cause GVHD and that they can suppress residual host immunity,&#xD;
      thus promoting donor lymphocyte engraftment. The end point of the study will be the&#xD;
      proportion of patients achieving full donor chimerism six weeks after transplant. Apart from&#xD;
      this addition of irradiated lymphocytes and some minor modifications, this protocol will be&#xD;
      identical to the predecessor protocol 02-H-0111. This involves the continued use of the&#xD;
      Isolex 300i cell separator and the monoclonal antibodies provided by CTEP (anti CD 6, anti&#xD;
      CD2, anti CD7). This is covered by a continuing IND for the selection of CD34+ and CD3+ cells&#xD;
      for T cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
