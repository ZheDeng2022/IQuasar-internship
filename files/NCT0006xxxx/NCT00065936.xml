  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-injurious behavior is behavior in which a person hurts or harms himself. This behavior&#xD;
      sometimes occurs in people with mental retardation or autism. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      self-injurious behavior in people with mental retardation or autism and will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of new treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown why some people with mental retardation and/or autism repeatedly and&#xD;
      persistently injure themselves, some to the point of tissue damage and permanent scarring.&#xD;
      Unraveling this mystery poses paradoxical biomedical and behavioral science questions and&#xD;
      creates deeply troubling problems for practitioners and family members of affected&#xD;
      individuals. Over the past decade, many cases of self-injurious behavior (SIB) have been&#xD;
      treated successfully using behavioral interventions that teach communication and other&#xD;
      functional skills. However, practical problems of implementation, costs associated with&#xD;
      long-term treatment, and cases with no clear social profile suggest that there is still much&#xD;
      to be learned about why people self-injure. Some forms of self-injury may involve intense&#xD;
      stimulation of body sites sufficient to elicit the release and receptor binding of endogenous&#xD;
      opioid peptides. This study will evaluate variables common to SIB and the neurophysiology of&#xD;
      pain regulation. The study will also clarify the role of the endogenous opioids and pain&#xD;
      mechanisms in self-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with mild to profound mental retardation and/or autism will be observed for&#xD;
      frequency of self-injury, duration and intensity of self-injurious behavior, and where on the&#xD;
      body that behavior is directed. Following this characterization, participants' saliva will be&#xD;
      noninvasively examined for substance P, met-enkephalin, and cortisol as markers for altered&#xD;
      pain transmission and predictors of response to treatment. After screening and SIB subtyping&#xD;
      (i.e., social, nonsocial, or mixed), 37 participants whose self-injury is primarily nonsocial&#xD;
      or mixed will be evaluated over 16 weeks. Participants will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS, an opioid agonist treatment) or naltrexone&#xD;
      (an opioid antagonist treatment). Participants whose self-injury is primarily socially&#xD;
      motivated will be evaluated with TENS and will receive behavioral interventions through a&#xD;
      technical assistance service delivery model. Follow-up evaluations will occur at Months 3 and&#xD;
      6.&#xD;
