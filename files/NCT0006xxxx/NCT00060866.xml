      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug propranolol in preventing fainting in&#xD;
      patients with sympathoadrenal imbalance (SAI). SAI is a particular pattern of nervous system&#xD;
      and chemical responses in which the blood vessels in skeletal muscles do not remain&#xD;
      constricted appropriately during standing for a long time. This can lower blood pressure and&#xD;
      cause fainting. Propranolol Inderal (registered trademark) is a Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration-approved drug that belongs to a class of drugs called beta-blockers. These&#xD;
      drugs slow the heart rate and maintain blood pressure in certain situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with SAI may be eligible for this study. Screening&#xD;
      includes a tilt table test, described below, to determine if the patient has a particular&#xD;
      chemical pattern in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study take propranolol pills in increasing doses during the first&#xD;
      week of the study to determine the proper dose for the individual. Then, the drug is stopped&#xD;
      until the experimental phase of the study begins. In this phase, patients are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to take either propranolol or placebo (look-alike pill with no active ingredient)&#xD;
      for 4 days. On the fourth day, the patient undergoes a tilt table test to determine whether&#xD;
      the treatment affects the patient's ability to tolerate tilt. For this test, the patient lies&#xD;
      on a padded table with a motorized tilt mechanism that can move the patient from a flat&#xD;
      position to an upright position in about 10 seconds. The patient remains upright for up to 45&#xD;
      minutes while the following measurements are taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial blood pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. A catheter (thin,&#xD;
           plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the elbow crease area of the arm or the&#xD;
           wrist. This catheter allows continuous blood pressure monitoring and sampling of&#xD;
           arterial (oxygenated) blood during the tilt test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venous blood sampling and measurement of epinephrine and norepinephrine release. A&#xD;
           catheter is inserted into a vein in each arm, one to collect venous (deoxygenated) blood&#xD;
           samples, and the other to inject radioactive epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine&#xD;
           (noradrenaline). These radioactive drugs, or ,tracers, allow measurement of the rate of&#xD;
           release of the body's own norepinephrine and epinephrine into the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiologic measurements. Blood pressure, heart rate, and EKG are measured continuously&#xD;
           during the tilt test session, and blood flows and skin electrical conduction are&#xD;
           measured intermittently. Blood flow is measured using sensors applied to the skin and a&#xD;
           blood pressure cuff around the limb. For skin blood flow measurements, a laser beam&#xD;
           scans the skin surface. The skin electrical conduction test measures how well the skin&#xD;
           conducts electricity. This is measured through sensors placed on the fingers or other&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the test drug are allowed to wear off for 1 week, after which the entire tilt&#xD;
      test procedure is repeated. Patients who were given propranolol for the first test session&#xD;
      take placebo for the repeat session, and those who were given placebo take propranolol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is to evaluate treatment with oral propranolol for a particular form of&#xD;
      neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), characterized by a neuroendocrine pattern called,&#xD;
      sympathoadrenal imbalance, (SAI). In SAI, plasma epinephrine levels increase progressively&#xD;
      and to a greater extent than do plasma norepinephrine levels, before development of NCS. The&#xD;
      SAI pattern is associated with skeletal muscle vasodilation, which also precedes NCS. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that increased occupation of beta-2 adrenoceptors in skeletal muscle by high&#xD;
      circulating epinephrine levels precipitates a neurocirculatory positive feedback loop leading&#xD;
      to NCS. In this protocol we test this hypothesis using the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor&#xD;
      blocker, propranolol. We predict that in patients with previously documented SAI and&#xD;
      tilt-evoked NCS, propranolol treatment will improve orthostatic tolerance during follow-up&#xD;
      tilt table testing, in a randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      trial. The main department measures are occurrence of tilt-induced NCS, duration of tilt&#xD;
      tolerance, hemodynamic and neurochemical indices of SAL, and patient questionnaire reports.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are patients referred for evaluation of chronic orthostatic intolerance. Patients&#xD;
        enter into the therapeutic trial after they are determined to have NCS with SAI in a&#xD;
        screening evaluation. Participation in this protocol is offered to individuals 18 years old&#xD;
        or older, independently of gender, race, advanced age, ethnicity, religion, or any&#xD;
        demographic or sociopolitical classifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Minors younger than 18 years old are excluded. Advanced age does not constitute an&#xD;
        exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgement of the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
        Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at subject at&#xD;
        substantially increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air&#xD;
        travel to the NIH. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
        Investigator or Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential scientific&#xD;
        benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying&#xD;
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are history of asthma or chronic&#xD;
        obstructive pulmonary disease requiring bronchodilators, hepatic or renal failure,&#xD;
        atrioventricular block of any degree, bradycardia, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
        severe anemia, psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, symptomatic coronary heart&#xD;
        disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and&#xD;
        peripheral vascular disease. Patients with known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity&#xD;
        to propranolol are excluded from this study. A positive HIV test result does not&#xD;
        necessarily exclude a patient from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the&#xD;
        patient continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.&#xD;
        Patients who must take medications daily in the following categories are excluded:&#xD;
        anticoagulants, tricyclic, antidepressants, barbiturates, aspirin, acetaminophen, insulin,&#xD;
        bronchodilators. Patients unable to discontinue nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol temporarily&#xD;
        are excluded. Patients with chronic alcohol intake are excluded. Patients are not to&#xD;
        discontinue any medications before the patient or the patient's doctor discusses this with&#xD;
        the Principal Investigator, an Associate Investigator, or Research Nurse. If it is decided&#xD;
        that discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements&#xD;
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal&#xD;
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. For&#xD;
        many herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the&#xD;
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish&#xD;
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the&#xD;
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to&#xD;
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Practical Limitations: Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to technically to&#xD;
        carry out the testing procedures are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating women are excluded. A blood test for pregnancy will be&#xD;
        conducted on women of childbearing potential, before intake evaluation and also before each&#xD;
        drug treatment phase. During the course of the protocol, subjects who are women of&#xD;
        childbearing potential will be advised to practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Termination of Participation: Subjects may refuse certain tests or procedures, or may&#xD;
        terminate participation early, without loss of benefits to which they were previously&#xD;
        entitled. The Investigators may also exclude a subject from further participation, such as&#xD;
        in the event of known or suspect falsification of medical history information or refusal to&#xD;
        undergo planned tests or procedures, without loss of benefits to which the subject was&#xD;
        previously entitled.&#xD;
