  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcium is important for healthy bone growth in children. Poor bone growth and development&#xD;
      during childhood can lead to osteoporosis later in life. This study will evaluate a nutrition&#xD;
      education program designed to increase the amount of calcium children receive. The study will&#xD;
      determine whether the program will result in long-term dietary changes and healthier bones in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Increased calcium intake is effective in increasing bone mineral density in children, but the&#xD;
      effect disappears when calcium supplements are discontinued. Increased dietary calcium from&#xD;
      daily food sources may have a greater impact on bone density than that achieved by calcium&#xD;
      supplements. However, studies have not yet demonstrated sustained achievement of increased&#xD;
      calcium from food sources. In addition, the effects of baseline calcium intake, bone density,&#xD;
      and puberty status may influence bone response to increased dietary calcium. This study will&#xD;
      develop, implement, and evaluate a Behavioral Modification-Nutrition Education (BM-NE)&#xD;
      Intervention Program designed to promote sustained increases in dietary calcium. The study&#xD;
      will quantify the impact of increased dietary calcium on bone density during growth and&#xD;
      development and will determine whether the presence of risk factors for low bone density&#xD;
      influences compliance with the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited into two groups: a group of healthy children with no known&#xD;
      risk factors for low bone density (i.e., no known chronic disease or previous oral steroid&#xD;
      exposure), and a group of healthy children with potential risk factors for low bone density&#xD;
      (previous fracture from usual childhood activities, daily dietary calcium refusal, lactose&#xD;
      intolerance, family history of osteoporosis). Children with and without risk factors will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to participate in an intensive BM-NE intervention group or a usual care&#xD;
      group that will receive counseling on bone health. The BM-NE Program will consist of five&#xD;
      group sessions for parents and children over 6 weeks. The program will use individualized&#xD;
      plans to increase children's calcium intake to 1500 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be followed for 3 years. Primary outcome measures will include daily calcium&#xD;
      intake and bone mineral density. Data on height, weight, sexual and skeletal maturation, and&#xD;
      physical activity will also be collected.&#xD;
