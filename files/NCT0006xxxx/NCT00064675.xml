      To evaluate individual differences in cardiovascular responses to acute stress in Black&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence and severity of essential hypertension (EH) are greater among Black Americans&#xD;
      than other ethnic groups in the U.S. Blacks are at increased risk for target organ damage&#xD;
      from elevated blood pressure, including heart disease, stroke, and endstage renal failure.&#xD;
      There are significant ethnic differences in cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to stress, which&#xD;
      is a risk factor for elevated blood pressure. Studies have shown that CVR to stress is stable&#xD;
      over time, heritable, and predictive of future elevations in blood pressure and the&#xD;
      development of essential hypertension. These properties make measures of CVR a valuable&#xD;
      intermediate for genetic studies of hypertensive risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic epidemiology study will test the hypothesis that individual differences in CVR to&#xD;
      acute stress in Black youth are associated with well defined polymorphisms in candidate genes&#xD;
      related to blood pressure including: 1) alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor genes; 2) genes&#xD;
      involved in catecholamine metabolism; 3) genes involved in endocrine function; 4) genes&#xD;
      involved in the renin angiotensin system. By focusing on normotensive youth at risk for&#xD;
      developing essential hypertension, the investigators hope to identify genes associated with&#xD;
      the onset, rather than the sequelae, of hypertension. Moreover, given that CVR to acute&#xD;
      stress is defined as a change in cardiovascular function evoked by an environmental&#xD;
      manipulation of stress, the research is inherently a study of gene-environment interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 500 unrelated Black adolescents and young adults (equal numbers of males and&#xD;
      females), 15-21 years of age will be studied. Buccal cell samples will be collected for DNA&#xD;
      extraction from all subjects for genetic association analyses. Impedance cardiography and&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring will be used to assess components of CVR to stress during video&#xD;
      game, mental arithmetic, cold pressor, and whole body cold exposure tasks, all of which have&#xD;
      been utilized or developed in the laboratory. Various methods will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      genetic associations with CVR to acute stress, including analyses of single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms and haplotypes. Supplementary analyses will evaluate potential gene-gene&#xD;
      interactions and additional gene-environment interactions involving chronic environmental&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
