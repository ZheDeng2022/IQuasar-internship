      Daily parathyroid hormone (PTH) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PTH when given once a week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In osteoporosis, skeletal bone mass and strength are so reduced that fractures occur after&#xD;
      only modest levels of mechanical stress that would not harm normal bone. Fractures of the&#xD;
      hip, spine, and wrists are most typical, though fractures of the ribs, pelvis, and humerus&#xD;
      also occur. Research has shown that hip fractures cause a 10% to 20% increase in mortality,&#xD;
      and the cost of all osteoporotic fractures is estimated to be $6.14 billion in health care&#xD;
      costs and lost earnings per year. The most common form of osteoporosis is postmenopausal&#xD;
      osteoporosis. A reduction in bone mineral density of approximately 1% to 2% per year is&#xD;
      observed for the first 3 to 5 years after the onset of menopause, then 0.5% to 1% per year&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTH was recently approved by the FDA as a daily treatment for osteoporosis. However, PTH must&#xD;
      be self-injected, is very expensive, and has been associated with worrisome side effects. The&#xD;
      currently approved formulation of daily PTH self-injections is practical for only a small&#xD;
      proportion of people with osteoporosis. A once weekly formulation could significantly&#xD;
      decrease cost, difficulty of administration, and risks and side effects associated with daily&#xD;
      use of PTH. A once weekly injection by a caregiver would also make PTH accessible to&#xD;
      populations for whom daily self-injection may not be practical, such as the very elderly or&#xD;
      those in assisted living or nursing homes. This study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of once weekly PTH dosing for women with osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be randomized to receive either PTH or placebo. Women will self-administer&#xD;
      injections daily for 4 weeks, then once weekly for 48 weeks. All women will receive calcium&#xD;
      and vitamin D supplements daily. Women will visit the clinic six times over the course of a&#xD;
      year and will provide urine and blood samples at each visit. Bone mineral density will be&#xD;
      measured at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
