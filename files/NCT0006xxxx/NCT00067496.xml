      This study, conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the National Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital, and the National Institutes of Health, will examine whether the drug Modafinil can&#xD;
      decrease fatigue in patients with post-polio syndrome. Many people who have had polio develop&#xD;
      weakness and severe fatigue several years after their recovery from the acute disease.&#xD;
      Modafinil is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to improve wakefulness in patients&#xD;
      with narcolepsy (disease in which patients have excessive daytime sleepiness) and has been&#xD;
      used to treat patients with fatigue related to other medical conditions, such as multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. This study will compare the effects of two doses of Modafinil and of a placebo (a&#xD;
      pill with no active ingredient) on fatigue in patients with post-polio syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop fatigue, weakness, muscle pain or atrophy, and functional loss at least&#xD;
      15 years after recovering from polio and whose symptoms cannot be attributed to another cause&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      and neurological examinations, fatigue rating scales, electrocardiogram, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, drowsiness and depression evaluations, and an electroymogram (EMG) to diagnose nerve&#xD;
      or muscle problems. For the EMG, electrodes (small metal discs) are taped to the skin and a&#xD;
      needle is inserted into a muscle to record the electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will also undergo a sleep study to exclude abnormal sleep patterns as the cause of&#xD;
      the fatigue. For this study, patients stay overnight at the NIH hospital. Electrodes are&#xD;
      placed on the throat, on a finger, and on the chest (for an electrocardiogram), and a&#xD;
      respiratory belt is placed around the chest-abdomen area. During sleep (from 10:30 p.m. to 6&#xD;
      a.m.), brain waves, eye and leg movements, muscle tone, respiration, and heart rate are&#xD;
      recorded. Beginning at 8 a.m. the following morning, the patient takes 20-minute naps to&#xD;
      measure the level of daytime sleepiness, using a recording technique similar to that of the&#xD;
      all-night study. When five naps are completed, the sleep study ends. Candidates may also&#xD;
      undergo a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for certain chemicals in the spinal fluid&#xD;
      that might be related to fatigue and to look for possible causes of post-polio syndrome. This&#xD;
      procedure is optional. For the lumbar puncture, a local anesthetic is given and a needle is&#xD;
      inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will complete a sleep diary during the entire study period.&#xD;
      They will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups-Modafinil or placebo-for 6&#xD;
      weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period with no medication, and then a crossover phase, in&#xD;
      which patients who took Modafinil for the first 6 weeks now take placebo, and those who took&#xD;
      placebo now take Modafinil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first study visit, patients will be given a supply of study medication and have blood&#xD;
      drawn. They will take one pill twice a day during both study phases. In both study phases,&#xD;
      evaluations will be done 3 and 6 weeks after starting the medication. The evaluations include&#xD;
      filling out the same forms completed at the screening visit, a review of drug side effects,&#xD;
      and a review of medical problems since the last study visit. At the 6-week visit, blood is&#xD;
      also drawn.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine if the drug Modafinil is effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of fatigue in patients with post-polio syndrome (PPS). PPS is a motor neuron&#xD;
      disease experience by more than 400,000 Americans, characterized by new weakness and intense&#xD;
      fatigue. The cause of fatigue, the most common and disabiling symptom in these patients, is&#xD;
      unknown and there is no effective treatment. In the present study, selected PPS patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive two different doses of Modafinil or placebo. After six weeks, the&#xD;
      patients will enter a two-week wash out period, and then will be crossed over to the other&#xD;
      arm. The sample size has been powered to reflect a significant difference in the scales of&#xD;
      fatigue. Secondary exploratory studies will include investigation of sleep patterns as a&#xD;
      cause contributing to fatigue and a search for upregulation of fatigue-associated cytokines&#xD;
      in the patient's serum and CSF.&#xD;
