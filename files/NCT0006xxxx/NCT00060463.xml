  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of easy access to emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) on&#xD;
      the rates of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECPs are a back-up contraceptive method indicated for prevention of pregnancy after sexual&#xD;
      intercourse if a primary contraceptive method fails or is not used. This trial will determine&#xD;
      how increased access to ECPs affects the probability of pregnancy and three STIs. The STIs&#xD;
      tested in the study are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas. The trial will also evaluate&#xD;
      how ready access to ECPs influences contraceptive or STI-prevention behaviors, particularly&#xD;
      use of ECPs themselves, use of condoms, and use of other contraceptive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted among about 1,490 young women in the United States at high risk&#xD;
      for pregnancy and STIs. Sexually active women aged 14 to 24 years who use barrier methods of&#xD;
      contraception, oral contraceptive pills, or no contraception will be enrolled. Each woman&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either an Advance Provision group or a Standard Care group. In&#xD;
      the Advance Provision group, women will be given a supply of ECPs free of charge to keep at&#xD;
      home in case of need. In the Standard Care group, women will be counseled about ECPs and&#xD;
      invited to come to the clinic to obtain them at usual clinic charges when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen for follow-up at Months 6 and 12. At each visit, participants will&#xD;
      be asked about pregnancies, STIs, sexual activity, self-assessed STI and pregnancy risk, and&#xD;
      use of ECPs and other contraceptive methods. A specimen will be obtained for chlamydia,&#xD;
      gonorrhea, and trichomonas testing.&#xD;
