      This study will determine the maximum safe dose of the experimental drug E-selectin that can&#xD;
      be given to stroke patients. E-selectin causes white blood cells called lymphocytes to change&#xD;
      so that they prevent clots from forming in the vessels that supply blood to the brain. The&#xD;
      drug has been shown to be effective in animal models of stroke. This study will look at the&#xD;
      safety of using this experimental drug in nasal instillation form in patients who have had a&#xD;
      stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 45 years of age or older who have had a recent stroke or TIA (30 to 120 days before&#xD;
      entering the study) due to a clot forming in a vessel that supplies blood to the brain may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. They must be taking at least one medication to prevent clots, such&#xD;
      as coumadin, aspirin, ticlopidine, or others. Candidates will be screened with a physical and&#xD;
      neurological examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram&#xD;
      (ultrasound test of the heart), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive E-selectin at a dose level of 5, 15, or 50&#xD;
      micrograms or a placebo (nasal drops with no active ingredient). They will instill a small,&#xD;
      carefully premeasured amount (one dose) of fluid in their nose every other day for 10 days&#xD;
      (total of 5 doses). This course of treatment will be repeated two times at 3-week intervals.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at 1 month and 3 months with a neurologic examination and blood and&#xD;
      urine tests. They will be contacted by phone, fax, or email in between these two visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of&#xD;
      disability. Despite the use of antithrombotic drugs for the secondary prevention of stroke,&#xD;
      10% of patients who experience a cerebral ischemic event will go on to have a stroke within&#xD;
      90 days (Claiborne Johnston et al. 2003). The development of new treatment strategies for the&#xD;
      secondary prevention of stroke is an important issue for modern medicine. There is increasing&#xD;
      evidence that inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation plays an important role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of stroke. Control of molecular inflammation at the sites of endothelial&#xD;
      activation can be achieved by induction of mucosal tolerance. The induction of mucosal&#xD;
      tolerance with repeated low-dose intranasal administration of antigen causes a shift of&#xD;
      immune response from proinflamatory T helper type 1(T(H)1) effects to anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      immunmomodulatory regulatory T cell (Treg) or T helper type 2 (T(H)2) effects at the sites of&#xD;
      inflammation. E-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed only on activated endothelium in&#xD;
      response to proinflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. The goals of the study are: (a) to test whether repeated administration of&#xD;
      low-dose intranasal E-selectin is safe and tolerable and (b) to test whether it can induce&#xD;
      mucosal tolerance to this compound causing a shift of immune response from TH1 to TH2 type&#xD;
      with production of Treg cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. The study population will include 3-50 patients (depending on dose&#xD;
      escalation events) plus 0-8 replacement patients (depending on the number of drop outs) with&#xD;
      recent (&gt;30 and &lt;120 days) occurrence of any type or location of stroke documented by CT or&#xD;
      MRI. The final number of patients will be determined by a dose escalation plan described&#xD;
      below that may stop early in the accrual process should adverse events arise. Since patients&#xD;
      will be required to make serial visits to the NIH clinical center, a functional recovery&#xD;
      score of 0-2 on the modified Rankin Scale (i.e. 0 = no symptoms at all; 2 = slight&#xD;
      disability: unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs&#xD;
      without assistance) is required for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. This is a single center, Phase 1, open label, dose escalation trial assessing&#xD;
      safety profile of four doses of intranasal recombinant human E-selectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. The primary goal of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      intranasal instillation of recombinant human E-selection as described I the Study Medications&#xD;
      and Drug Administration section. The secondary goal is to determine doses that generate Treg&#xD;
      cells or induce immune deviation from TH1 to TH2 type response. The tertiary goals are to&#xD;
      determine the presence or absence of antibody to human E-selectin, P- selectin, and&#xD;
      L-selectin and the level of endothelial activation markers including von Willebrand factor,&#xD;
      soluble E-selectin, VCAM-1, and Thrombomodulin.&#xD;
