      psychosocial treatments for TMD have been developed, but the mechanisms by which these&#xD;

      TMD is a widespread chronic pain condition. Successful psychosocial treatments for TMD have&#xD;
      been developed, but the mechanisms by which these treatments achieve their effects are not&#xD;
      well known. The goal of this project is to evaluate the possible mechanisms responsible for&#xD;
      treatment gains in TMD treatment. Men and women (N=106) with complaints of chronic facial&#xD;
      pain for at least 3 months' duration will be recruited from the University Dental Clinics and&#xD;
      from the community via advertisements and randomly assigned to either a Standard Conservative&#xD;
      Treatment (STD) employing an intraoral splint plus anti-inflammatory agents, or to a Standard&#xD;
      Treatment + Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment Program (STD+CBT), that will include standard&#xD;
      treatment but also focus on changing self-efficacy and decreasing catastrophization. Both&#xD;
      treatments will entail 6 clinic visits. Dispositional and situational variables derived from&#xD;
      a comprehensive model of pain coping will be measured before and after treatment. The&#xD;
      situational variables, including coping responses, mood states, situational appraisals and&#xD;
      self-efficacy, will be measured in an experience sampling paradigm four times daily using a&#xD;
      hand-held computer. This will be done to minimize retrospective biases that may have hampered&#xD;
      earlier studies of treatment process. Dependent variables will be self-report measures of&#xD;
      distress, pain, and interference with activities, as well as blood plasma levels of cortisol&#xD;
      and selected cytokines, measured at the end of the 6-week treatment period, and at follow-up&#xD;
      points thereafter up to a 12-month follow-up. It is expected that the STD+CBT treatment will&#xD;
      result in measurable changes in constructs such as self-efficacy and catastrophization, and&#xD;
      that these changes will be related to improved outcomes compared to the STD controls. It is&#xD;
      also expected that outcome differences between groups will be associated with changes in&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators (cytokine levels). Finally, it is suggested that changes in&#xD;
      situational treatment process variables will be associated with changes in cytokine levels.&#xD;
      The results may indicate the true active mechanisms of successful TMD treatment. If these&#xD;
      mechanisms can be successfully identified it would have important implications for the&#xD;
      development of more effective treatment programs.&#xD;
