  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the four million trauma cases each year that will require hospitalization, 200,000 will be&#xD;
      classified as severe trauma. During the hospital stay, malnutrition is a major complication&#xD;
      in about 50% of the patient population. The result is muscle wasting which is a major risk&#xD;
      factor for increased morbidity and mortality. In this study we postulate that supplementation&#xD;
      with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine and glutamine (HMB/Arg/Gln)or HMB alone&#xD;
      to these severely traumatized patients can stem the loss of muscle tissue and whole body&#xD;
      nitrogen and in turn decrease morbidity and mortality. This hypothesis is based on two recent&#xD;
      studies showing the same nutritional mixture of HMB/Arg/Gln can reverse the muscle wasting&#xD;
      associated with AIDS and Cancer. The hypermetabolic state seen in AIDS and cancer have a&#xD;
      similar multifactorial etiology as seen in trauma. There is an increase in the mobilization&#xD;
      of fat and muscle, increased or normal metabolic rate, increased protein breakdown, and an&#xD;
      increased or normal glucose turnover. In addition, HMB alone has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      nitrogen loss, decrease muscle proteolysis and muscle damage within the first 48 hours to&#xD;
      three weeks after initiating supplementation during a strenuous exercise program. Male and&#xD;
      female patients (n=100) will be recruited at the time of admittance to the Trauma ICU with an&#xD;
      ISS of greater than 18. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either 1) standard tube feed plus HMB/Arg/Gln, 2) standard tube feed plus HMB&#xD;
      alone, or 3)standard tube feed (control) in a double-blinded fashion. Clinical outcomes&#xD;
      measures will be assessed through out the hospital stay and on an outpatient basis at weeks 4&#xD;
      and 12. Muscle proteolysis and nitrogen economy will be evaluated on daily basis while in the&#xD;
      hospital and after 4 weeks on an out patient basis. If as expected, Phase I results confirm&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the nutrient mixture in trauma patients, expanded multicenter studies&#xD;
      will be proposed in Phase II.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effectiveness of immediate nutritional intervention with either HMB, arginine,&#xD;
      and glutamine or HMB alone with that of a placebo supplement in critically ill trauma&#xD;
      patients on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreasing muscle protein turnover and nitrogen loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improving nutritional status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improving clinical outcomes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preventing total body weight and skeletal muscle loss and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improving immune status&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical study. After receiving&#xD;
      informed consent for participation in the study from the next of kin, patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Standard tube feed plus a nutritional supplement supplying 3 grams of HMB, 14 grams of&#xD;
      arginine and 14 grams of glutamine per day. The supplement will be divided into two equal&#xD;
      dosages with one dose being given in the morning and one dose given in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Standard tube feed plus a nutritional supplement supplying 3 grams of HMB. This&#xD;
      nutritional supplement will contain gelatin and non-essential amino acids to be&#xD;
      isonitrogenous with the supplement in Arm 1. The supplement will also be divided into two&#xD;
      equal dosages with one dose being given in the morning and one dose given in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Standard tube feed plus a nutritional supplement supplying a mixture of gelatin and&#xD;
      amino acids to be isonitrogenous with the supplement in Arm 1. The supplement will again be&#xD;
      divided into two equal dosages with one dose being given in the morning and one dose given in&#xD;
      the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the nutritional supplements for a period of 4 weeks. If a patient&#xD;
      leaves the hospital or ICU before that time and/or discontinues the enteral nutrition&#xD;
      support, the supplements will be continued orally for the full 4-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical outcome measures will be followed such as hospital length of stay, ICU&#xD;
      length of stay, mortality, number of ventilator days, and incidence of infectious&#xD;
      complications. Clinical outcomes will be assessed during the hospital stay and at 4 and 12&#xD;
      weeks. Muscle protein metabolism will be measured during the hospital stay and at 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Nutritional status while hospitalized will be assessed by serum pre-albumin levels on days&#xD;
      0,1, 3, 7, and 14. White blood count, number of confirmed infections and C-Reactive Protein&#xD;
      levels will serve as proxies for immune status.&#xD;
