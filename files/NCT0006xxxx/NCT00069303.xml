      This study will examine how West Nile virus (WNV) infection affects the body. Some people&#xD;
      infected with WNV have no symptoms. In others, symptoms may vary from fever and headache to a&#xD;
      polio-like syndrome with paralysis, to coma and brain changes like those of a stroke. Many&#xD;
      patients recover with no lasting effects, while a few can have long-lasting neurological&#xD;
      damage or may die. This study will collect clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and radiographic&#xD;
      information on people thought to have WNV to better understand the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older diagnosed with or suspected of having West Nile virus&#xD;
      infection may be eligible for this study. Patients will be hospitalized until they are well&#xD;
      enough to go home and will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination: A thorough history and physical examination&#xD;
           will be done on the first day of the study. Then, brief physical exams, including&#xD;
           measures of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature, will be done&#xD;
           during each day of hospitalization and at every follow-up clinic visit (at 2 weeks and&#xD;
           at 1, 3, and 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: Blood samples will be collected on the first day of the study, at day 7, at&#xD;
           hospital discharge, and at follow-up visits to determine if virus remains in the blood&#xD;
           and how it is affecting the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scans will be done within 72 hours of beginning&#xD;
           the study and 1 month after that. This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           to produce images of the brain that might show abnormalities in the brains of patients&#xD;
           with WNV and reveal whether the abnormalities can predict how an individual will&#xD;
           recover. For the procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved into the narrow&#xD;
           tunnel-like scanner. During the procedure, a contrast agent that brightens the images is&#xD;
           injected through a catheter placed in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examination and neurological function tests: Participants will be tested to&#xD;
           see if the West Nile virus has affected their thinking and ability to perform normal&#xD;
           daily activities. These tests will be done at the start of the study, on days 3 and 7&#xD;
           (also days 2, 4, 5, and 6 if patients are still in the hospital), at discharge, and at&#xD;
           follow-up visits. The tests involve answering a number of questions and performing&#xD;
           simple tasks, such as squeezing a hand or lifting a foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who develop weakness in their arms or legs will also have the following&#xD;
           studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Electromyography (EMG) to study the electrical activity of the muscle. For this&#xD;
                test, needles are placed into a muscle to record the electrical activity at that&#xD;
                site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Nerve conduction studies to measure how well the nerves are working. A small charge&#xD;
                of electricity is delivered to a nerve in the affected limb, triggering a muscle to&#xD;
                tighten or bend. Small wire electrodes are attached to the skin to measure the time&#xD;
                is takes for the nerve to move the electrical current from one part of the limb to&#xD;
                another.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Spinal MRI to see if the virus is affecting the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of other tests done by the patient's local doctor (such as lumbar puncture,&#xD;
      electroencephalogram, x-rays, etc.) will be requested. If a lumbar puncture is done, a small&#xD;
      amount of cerebrospinal fluid will be requested for testing for WNV.&#xD;

      Investigation of the Natural History of West Nile Virus Infection in Patients with Recently&#xD;
      Acquired West Nile Fever or Neuroinvasive Disease is a descriptive natural history study.&#xD;
      Since the first reports of WNV disease in North America in 1999, geographic range has&#xD;
      expanded, a trend that is expected to continue for the near future. There are few&#xD;
      sequentially collected clinical, radiologic and laboratory data from patients with WNV&#xD;
      disease. Standardized data collection tools to measure neurologic outcome have not been&#xD;
      developed. Prospectively collected data on laboratory and clinical events associated with WNV&#xD;
      infection are needed to bridge gaps in current knowledge of this disease and to assist with&#xD;
      the design of better treatments. The objectives of this study are to identify and describe&#xD;
      the mortality and morbidity, specifically the neurologic and functional outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with confirmed WNV disease in order to characterize the clinical course and diverse&#xD;
      manifestations, and to assess kinetics of humoral immune responses to WNV infection,&#xD;
      correlating these responses with clinical outcomes. Eligible patients fall into two&#xD;
      categories: those with neuroinvasive disease caused by WNV infection, and those with WNV&#xD;
      fever who received medical attention for their illness. All subjects must have had illness&#xD;
      onset within four months prior to enrollment and must have laboratory confirmation of the&#xD;
      diagnosis. There will be study visits at Days 1, 14, 30, 90, 180, and 365. Evaluations will&#xD;
      include serum and cerebrospinal fluid for determination of WNV IgM/IgG levels and PCR for&#xD;
      WNV, urine PCR for WNV, physical examination, serial neurologic examinations, a baseline MRI&#xD;
      scan, and four functional and cognitive assessments that have been validated in neurologic&#xD;
      illness in adults: the Barthel Index (BI), the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), the Glasgow&#xD;
      Outcome Score (GOS) and the modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (3MS). The subset of&#xD;
      study participants who develop motor weakness of an extremity (ies) will have&#xD;
      electromyograms, nerve conduction studies and spinal MRI performed. Results from selected&#xD;
      clinically indicated tests (done by study participants' physicians, not mandated for the&#xD;
      study) will be recorded in the Case Record Forms (CRFs).&#xD;
