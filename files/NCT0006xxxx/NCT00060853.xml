  <brief_summary>

      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify brain regions involved in&#xD;
      social and emotional reasoning. It will identify differences in brain activity during task&#xD;
      performance between people who have a nervous system illness and those who do not. MRI is a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of&#xD;
      structural and chemical changes in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 55 years of age who are right-handed and are native&#xD;
      English speakers may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, including psychiatric and neurological information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to perform social and emotional reasoning tasks, such as sorting&#xD;
      and judging rules and rule violations, while undergoing MRI scanning. Some tasks may simply&#xD;
      involve viewing items on a screen. Others may involve solving complex problems and responding&#xD;
      by pressing buttons. During the scan, the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the&#xD;
      scanner) containing a magnetic field. The scan will last about 2 hours, with subjects asked&#xD;
      to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time.&#xD;

      The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms&#xD;
      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the&#xD;
      human prefrontal cortex. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during&#xD;
      functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex in planning, problem solving, economic exchange and reasoning; and the role&#xD;
      of ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will&#xD;
      ascertain the relationship between so-called [cold] cognitive processes such as planning and&#xD;
      [hot] social processes such as mate choice and specific brain regions within the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex. We will also attempt to determine the relationship between non-frontal neural&#xD;
      structures involved in emotional expression, such as the amygdala, and those frontal neural&#xD;
      structures involved in executive functions that may modulate emotion. In addition, we will&#xD;
      attempt to determine the requirements for frontal-parietal versus frontal-temporal network&#xD;
      involvement in spatial landmark tasks. The data that we collect in this protocol will be of&#xD;
      value in identifying a set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of&#xD;
      knowledge representation stored in the prefrontal cortex. These questions will be addressed&#xD;
      over seven separate studies with healthy, normal adult volunteers. The studies will employ&#xD;
      within- and between-subject, event-related fMRI designs. The data collected will consist of&#xD;
      behavioral measures of cognitive and emotional performance/judgment and corresponding fMRI&#xD;
      images.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In all the studies, subjects will consist of healthy, native English-speaking, right-handed&#xD;
        volunteers, as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Subjects will range in age&#xD;
        from 21 to 55 years old and they will be included regardless of race.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In studies 4 and 5, equal numbers of males and females will be recruited owing to previous&#xD;
        findings of significant sex differences on such tests. In all other studies subjects will&#xD;
        be recruited indiscriminately on the basis of sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-native English speakers and non-right handers will be excluded as mentioned above, as&#xD;
        will non-neurologically normal volunteers. Subjects younger than 21 and older than 55 will&#xD;
        be excluded. A pregnancy test will be employed with all women of childbearing age. The&#xD;
        results must be negative in order to proceed with the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any of the following: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted&#xD;
        cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body, e.g. metal&#xD;
        shavings; insulin pump; or irremovable body piercing will be excluded from the study due to&#xD;
        the possible dangerous effects of the magnet upon metal objects in the body.&#xD;
