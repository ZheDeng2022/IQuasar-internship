      The purpose of this study is to attempt to identify the immune response of healthy adults to&#xD;
      an investigational dilution of the Dryvax smallpox vaccine. In addition, we will try to&#xD;
      determine whether certain genetic characteristics influence the size of the sore around the&#xD;
      vaccination site, and use blood samples from subjects in the study to make a new form of&#xD;
      antibody that could be given to people with vaccine side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Smallpox is a very serious disease that is fatal in about 1 in 3 patients. Smallpox does not&#xD;
      exist naturally in the world, and there have been no cases of smallpox in the world since&#xD;
      1980. Smallpox can be prevented through the use of a very effective vaccine called vaccinia&#xD;
      virus (Dryvax). After the world was considered free of smallpox, the production of smallpox&#xD;
      vaccine was discontinued, but due to the recent concern that the smallpox virus may be used&#xD;
      as a means of bioterrorism, the production of the smallpox vaccine may be restarted. Although&#xD;
      Dryvax is known to be an effective vaccine for the prevention of smallpox, very little is&#xD;
      known about the ability of the body to develop defenses to prevent disease (immune responses)&#xD;
      with this vaccine. As new vaccines for preventing smallpox are developed, it will be&#xD;
      important to compare the immune responses they cause to the responses that occur with the&#xD;
      standard vaccine, Dryvax.&#xD;
