  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy and to see&#xD;
      how well it works in preventing cancer in patients with premalignant carcinoma of the oral&#xD;
      cavity or pharynx. Inserting the p53 gene into a person's tumor cells may improve the body's&#xD;
      ability to kill the tumor cells&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the acute toxic effects of Ad5CMV-p53 gene administered as an oral rinse and as&#xD;
      an intramucosal injection in patients with diffuse premalignant carcinoma of the oral cavity&#xD;
      or oral pharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the&#xD;
      topical transduction efficiency of adenoviral-mediated wild type p53 gene transfer in&#xD;
      patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the efficacy of this drug in reversing the histology of oral premalignancies in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the distribution of transgenic protein within the area of the premalignant&#xD;
      lesion in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of Ad5CMV-p53 gene administered as an&#xD;
      oral rinse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Patients receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene by intramucosal injection into the area of the&#xD;
      lesion followed at least 2 hours later by Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse on day 1. Patients&#xD;
      then receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse twice daily on days 2-5. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Patients receive treatment with intramucosal Ad5CMV-p53 gene as in phase I and&#xD;
      Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse at the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years. Patients then receive long-term&#xD;
      follow-up annually for an additional 10 years.&#xD;
