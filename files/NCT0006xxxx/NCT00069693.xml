      This study will conduct tests with patients with primary chronic orthostatic intolerance&#xD;
      (COI) to learn more about this disorder of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients 18 years of age and older with COI may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Participants undergo one or more of the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood studies, including arterial catheter insertion to measure blood pressure and&#xD;
           collect arterial blood samples, blood flow studies using sensors applied to the skin and&#xD;
           a pressure cuff around a limb, blood volume studies using injection of radioactively&#xD;
           labeled human serum albumin and gene studies to look for genetic abnormalities&#xD;
           associated with certain proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies, including CT scan of the adrenal glands, heart ultrasound, and PET&#xD;
           scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microdialysis to measures levels of chemicals in the body fluid of certain tissues. A&#xD;
           thin tube is inserted into the skin and a solution is passed through it. Chemicals in&#xD;
           the body tissues enter the solution in the tube. The solution is collected and the&#xD;
           chemical levels are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neck suction. Neck suction is applied to test a reflex the brain uses to regulate blood&#xD;
           pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perometry. Limb volume is measured using an infrared light that moves up the limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test to evaluate an aspect of autonomic nervous&#xD;
           system function. A small amount of a brain chemical (acetylcholine) is applied to the&#xD;
           skin with a tiny amount of electricity, and the sweat in a nearby patch of skin is&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin electrical conduction test using sensors on the skin to measure sweat production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin and core temperature measurements using sensors on the skin and in the ear canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tilt table test. The subject lies on a table, secured with straps around the chest and&#xD;
           legs. Sensors are placed on the arms and chest to monitor blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
           and heart rhythm. A catheter is placed in a vein in each arm to collect blood samples&#xD;
           and give drugs. Another catheter is placed in an artery to draw blood and monitor blood&#xD;
           pressure. The subject is given an infusion of norepinephrine and epinephrine, and&#xD;
           baseline measures and blood samples are taken. The table is tilted upright and more&#xD;
           measurements and blood samples are taken at intervals for up to 30 minutes. The table is&#xD;
           returned to a horizontal position and additional measurements and samples may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs may be administered during the tests, including acetylcholine, epinephrine, and&#xD;
      norepinephrine, radioactive chemicals used in imaging studies, and drugs that affect blood&#xD;
      vessels, heart rate, and force of heart contractions.&#xD;

      This protocol is to identify and characterize distinct types of chronic orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance (COI). COI can be a manifestation of primary chronic autonomic failure, which is&#xD;
      covered under a separate protocol. The present protocol concerns patients with COI who under&#xD;
      resting conditions have intact sympathetic neurocirculatory function. COI can reflect&#xD;
      different pathophysiologic mechanisms; until now, few studies have attempted to distinguish&#xD;
      these mechanisms in individual patients. We hypothesize that results of clinical assessment&#xD;
      and physiologic, chemical, pharmacologic, and imaging tests will reveal internally consistent&#xD;
      patterns that distinguish particular forms of COI. We wish to determine the relative&#xD;
      frequencies of these forms in a referral population. The first phase of testing is to&#xD;
      identify sympathetic neurocirculatory failure, baroreflex failure, and secondary causes of&#xD;
      COI (hypovolemia, excessive orthostatic venous pooling, or excessive orthostatic&#xD;
      extravasation). In a subsequent inpatient phase, tilt table testing is done, with concurrent&#xD;
      hemodynamic and chemical measurements, to confirm subtypes of postural tachycardia syndrome&#xD;
      and neurocardiogenic syncope. The results of these evaluations will be used for&#xD;
      stratification of specific, pathophysiologically defined diagnostic groups for therapeutic&#xD;
      protocols. In an off-site study, we will evaluate members of a large family where COI seems&#xD;
      to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects are patients with COI and adult healthy volunteers of similar age, gender, and&#xD;
        body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation in this protocol is offered to people 18 years old or older, independently of&#xD;
        gender, race, age, ethnicity, religion, or any other demographic or sociopolitical&#xD;
        classifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects in the second off-site study are family members of the identified proband.&#xD;
        Participation in this protocol is offered to people 18 years old or older, independently of&#xD;
        gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other demographic or sociopolitical&#xD;
        classifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the second off-site study, participation is also offered to subjects 10 to 17 years old,&#xD;
        provided that appropriate informed consent/assent has been given by the subject and his/her&#xD;
        parent or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Minors younger than 18 years old are excluded, except for the off-site study. Advanced&#xD;
        age does not constitute an exclusion criterion. For subjects more than 55 years old,&#xD;
        carotid Doppler studies are done, and subjects with significant carotid disease (stenosis&#xD;
        by atherosclerosis) are excluded. In the off-site study, minors younger than 10 years old&#xD;
        are excluded. For the second off-site study, minors younger than 10 years old are excluded.&#xD;
        Advanced age does not constitute an exclusion criterion. Except for the second off-site&#xD;
        study, people less than 18 years old are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
        Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at substantially&#xD;
        increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air travel to the&#xD;
        NIH. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
        Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential scientific benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying&#xD;
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are hepatic or renal failure, a history of&#xD;
        tachyarrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe anemia, psychosis,&#xD;
        refractory ventricular arrhythmias, symptomatic coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
        hyperthyroidism, and allergy or sensitivity to iodinated contrast media or any of the&#xD;
        planned drugs. A positive HIV rest result does not necessarily exclude a patient from&#xD;
        participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the&#xD;
        patient continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.&#xD;
        Examples are tricyclic antidepressants, anticoagulants, beta-adrenoceptor blockers,&#xD;
        phenothiazines, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, acetaminophen, and&#xD;
        alpha-adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists. Patients on one or more of these drugs are not&#xD;
        excluded, if the drugs are tapered and discontinued before undergoing the clinical&#xD;
        laboratory testing. Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the patient or&#xD;
        the patient's doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator. If it is decided that&#xD;
        discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the study.&#xD;
        Patients with known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any test drug are excluded.&#xD;
        Patients unable to discontinue nicotine or alcohol for 24 hours prior to evaluation are&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance often take several medications that could&#xD;
        interfere with the scientific results of this protocol. Temporary discontinuation of&#xD;
        medications as outpatients, even with the approval of the referring physician, introduces&#xD;
        some risk. To maximize patient safety, we may admit patients for monitoring as inpatients&#xD;
        while medications are tapered or stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the second off-site study, subjects are tested while on their usual medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements&#xD;
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal&#xD;
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. In&#xD;
        cases where the subjects wish to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements&#xD;
        while on study, and search of the available medical literature fails to identify effects&#xD;
        that are known or expected to interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects&#xD;
        may participate. Subjects in the off-site study may continue their herbal medicines or&#xD;
        dietary supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Practical Limitations: Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to insert a catheter&#xD;
        into a vein are excluded. Subjects who are not expected clinically to tolerate lying still&#xD;
        during the procedures are excluded. In the second off-site study, if an i.v. cannot be&#xD;
        placed, or the subject refuses to have an i.v. placed then a DNA sample may be obtained by&#xD;
        buccal smear or obtaining saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating women are excluded. In the second off-site study,&#xD;
        pregnancy is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Investigators may also exclude a subject from further participation, such as in the&#xD;
        event of known or suspect falsification of medical history information or refusal to&#xD;
        undergo planned tests or procedures, without loss of benefits to which the subject was&#xD;
        previously entitled.&#xD;
