    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) implant placed in&#xD;
      the eye to allow the release of CNTF directly on the retina. The results of this study may&#xD;
      lead to a larger investigation of CNTF implants to treat retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a&#xD;
      progressive degenerative eye disease that begins with loss of peripheral vision and night&#xD;
      blindness and often leads to blindness in later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no effective treatments for RP. Researchers have found, however, that&#xD;
      certain proteins, called ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), can partially protect cells in&#xD;
      the eye if given directly inside the eye. A major challenge in treating RP is to deliver&#xD;
      medicine directly into the eye. One way to ensure that CNTF gets into the eye is to&#xD;
      surgically place an implant inside the eye to release the protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with retinitis pigmentosa whose visual acuity is 20/100 or&#xD;
      worse may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, eye examinations, and eye photographs. The eye examination includes&#xD;
      measurement of visual acuity and eye pressure, examination of the pupils and eye movements,&#xD;
      and examination of the lens and back of the eye. In addition, patients will have the&#xD;
      following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual field test: Patients look at a central spot on a white screen and tell the&#xD;
           examiner whenever they see a small light appear at other places on the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram (ERG): Electrodes are taped to the patient's forehead. Special contact&#xD;
           lenses are placed on the eyes, similar to normal contact lenses, after the eye has been&#xD;
           numbed with drops. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the&#xD;
           retina. The ERG measures the electrical activity of the retina when it is stimulated by&#xD;
           light. For the ERG recording, the patient looks inside a large, hollow, dark sphere, and&#xD;
           sees flashes of light, first in the dark, and then with a light turned on in the sphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography: This test, done with the machine used to examine the eye,&#xD;
           measures retinal thickness by producing cross-sectional pictures of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo surgery at the NIH Clinical Center in a 30-minute operation to place the&#xD;
      implant in one eye. The surgery is done under local anesthetic. Before the procedure,&#xD;
      patients are given a steroid injection along side the eye to minimize inflammation after&#xD;
      surgery. Following the procedure, patients return for follow-up visits once a month for 6&#xD;
      months. At these visits, several of the exams described above are repeated to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment effects and check for adverse side effects. After 6 months, the implant is&#xD;
      surgically removed. Post-surgical care for both implant and explant surgeries include&#xD;
      examinations the day and week after surgery to examine the wound, a high dose of steroid&#xD;
      immediately after surgery, oral antibiotics for 7 days, and eye drops for 1 week to prevent&#xD;
      infection and inflammation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of incurable degenerative diseases of the retina that&#xD;
      have a complex molecular etiology. Approximately 100,000 Americans suffer from inherited&#xD;
      retinal degenerative RP. More than 100 RP-inducing mutations have been identified in several&#xD;
      genes including: rhodopsin, the rod visual pigment; peripherin, a membrane structure protein;&#xD;
      and PDEB, the beta subunit of rod cyclic GMP (cGMP) phosphodiesterase. However, the genotype&#xD;
      is unknown for the majority of patients. Despite this genetic heterogeneity, there tends to&#xD;
      be a common pattern of visual loss in patients with RP. Typically, patients experience&#xD;
      disturbance in night vision early in life due to the degeneration of rod photoreceptors. The&#xD;
      remaining cone photoreceptors become their mainstay of vision, but over the years and&#xD;
      decades, the cones slowly degenerate, leading to blindness. These two phases of degeneration&#xD;
      in the visual life of an RP patient may involve different underlying pathogenic mechanisms.&#xD;
      Regardless of the initial causative defects, the end results are photoreceptor degeneration.&#xD;
      This common pathogenesis pathway provides a target for therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are few available, effective treatments for retinal degenerative disorders.&#xD;
      One major challenge is to deliver potential therapeutic agents to the back of the eye, in&#xD;
      particular to the retina. The blood-eye barrier prevents the penetration of a variety of&#xD;
      molecules to the neurosensory retina in a similar manner to the action of the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier, which exists between the central nervous system and systemic circulation. To&#xD;
      overcome this challenge, Neurotech USA, Inc. (Neurotech) developed encapsulated cell&#xD;
      technology (ECT), specifically the NT-501-10 and NT-501-6A.02 devices, to enable controlled,&#xD;
      sustained delivery of therapeutic agents directly into the intra-ocular fluids and thus&#xD;
      providing direct access to the retina. ECT utilizes cells encapsulated within a&#xD;
      semi-permeable polymer device that secretes therapeutic factors directly into the vitreous.&#xD;
      In addition, ECT devices can be retrieved, providing an added level of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathologic studies have demonstrated the possibility of growth factors, neurotrophic&#xD;
      factors, and cytokines as therapeutics for RP. Specifically, ciliary neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (CNTF) has proven to be the most effective in reducing retinal degeneration. Therefore, the&#xD;
      use of implanted NT-501-10 and NT-501-6A.02 devices, which secrete CNTF into the retina, may&#xD;
      be beneficial in patients with RP and other retinal degenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will assess the ophthalmic and systemic safety, and to some extent efficacy,&#xD;
      of the novel intra-ocular NT-501-10 and NT-501-6A.02 implants in patients with RP and poor&#xD;
      visual acuity in one eye. The main purpose of the study is to assess the safety of the&#xD;
      NT-501-10 and NT-501-6A.02 implants. Secondary outcomes will include the anterior chamber&#xD;
      cell scale and vitreous haze grading to measure inflammation, which may be caused by the&#xD;
      implant. Other secondary outcome measures related to potential product performance are visual&#xD;
      acuity, visual fields, electroretinograms (ERG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT3) to&#xD;
      determine retinal thickness.&#xD;
