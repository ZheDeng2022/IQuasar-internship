      This study will examine the effect of iron buildup in the hearts of patients with hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis (HH), a genetic disease that causes the body to accumulate excess amounts of&#xD;
      iron. The excess iron can damage the heart, liver, pancreas, skin, and joints. Generally,&#xD;
      early treatment with phlebotomy (periodic removal of a unit of blood), and in some cases&#xD;
      chelation (using a drug to remove iron from the body) slows down organ damage in HH patients.&#xD;
      This study will try to elucidate the effect of iron buildup in the heart and determine if&#xD;
      phlebotomy and chelation help keep the heart healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HH and healthy volunteers 21 years of age and older may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. (Normal volunteers will provide normal values of heart function that will be used to&#xD;
      verify abnormalities detected in HH patients.) Patients must have a gene abnormality of Hfe&#xD;
      gene Cys282Try homozygote. They may or may not be receiving treatment for HH and they must&#xD;
      have no heart symptoms or serious organ damage due to HH. Candidates will be screened with a&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), Holter EKG&#xD;
      (24-hour EKG monitoring, see description below), and chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures over 2 to 5 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise test: The participant exercises on a treadmill while wearing a mouthpiece,&#xD;
           which is used to measure how much oxygen is used. Electrodes placed on the chest and&#xD;
           arms monitor the heartbeat during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography: This ultrasound test uses sound waves to take pictures. A small probe&#xD;
           is held against the chest to allow a technician to take pictures of the heart and assess&#xD;
           its function. A drug called Optison may be injected in an arm vein if needed to enhance&#xD;
           the ultrasound images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise stress echocardiography: The participant exercises on a stationary bike while&#xD;
           heart function is measured with an echocardiogram, EKG, and blood pressure cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour Holter EKG: The participant wears a small machine that records heart rhythm&#xD;
           continuously for 24 hours. The recorder is connected by cables to electrodes placed on&#xD;
           the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging: This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
           detailed images of the heart and blood vessels. The participant lies flat on a table&#xD;
           that slides inside the scanner, which is a large hollow tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests are performed once in normal volunteers and in patients who have received standard&#xD;
      treatment for HH. Untreated patients repeat the tests 6 months after beginning phlebotomy or&#xD;
      chelation. Additional time points for these tests might be added if further evaluation is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common hereditary metabolic abnormality among&#xD;
      Caucasians. Homozygosity for the Cys282Tyr mutation, which is the most common known mutation&#xD;
      with a predisposition to iron overload, occurs with an estimated frequency of 8 per 1000 in&#xD;
      the Caucasians. Hemochromatosis in its advanced stages is associated with severe cardiac&#xD;
      complications including congestive heart failure, premature coronary artery disease, and&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmias. The clinical manifestations of HH are due to increased iron absorption&#xD;
      and abnormal iron cycling with excessive iron deposition in various organs. Mutations of the&#xD;
      Hfe gene on chromosome 6 have been recently identified. Although the pathophysiology remains&#xD;
      incompletely understood, a homozygote mutation in Cys282Tyr is present in 84 to 100% of&#xD;
      clinically confirmed HH cases. This discovery permits the early diagnosis of this disease and&#xD;
      could be used for screening to identify asymptomatic cases. Therefore, the NHLBI in January&#xD;
      2000 launched a 30 million dollar project named HEIRS (HEmochromatosis and IRon overload&#xD;
      Study) to screen 1,000,000 adults for HH, and recently completed enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased left ventricular wall thickness and mass has been found to be early cardiac&#xD;
      manifestations of HH appearing before the onset of contractile dysfunction. Interestingly, a&#xD;
      report also indicates that functional abnormalities of the heart can be seen in predominantly&#xD;
      asymptomatic HH patient group. Such abnormalities of diastolic function are detected by&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography. Observations support the theory that asymptomatic cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction is detectable with non-invasive cardiac imaging in patients with HH. &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in HH has not been well characterized, it&#xD;
      is speculated that enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be responsible&#xD;
      for tissue damage. Therefore, biochemical and/or genetic markers of oxidant stress might be&#xD;
      helpful in determining whether this mechanism is involved in producing cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we propose a retrospective pilot study with a small-sized nested&#xD;
      prospective study of cardiac function in patients with HH. The intention is to utilize&#xD;
      obtained results to design a larger definitive study if results are warranted. The following&#xD;
      hypotheses will be tested: Cardiac abnormalities 1) can be diagnosed with conventional&#xD;
      non-invasive cardiac imaging in HH patients with New York Heart Association Functional Class&#xD;
      I (asymptomatic), 2) limit patients' exercise capacity, 3) are associated with an elevated&#xD;
      oxidant stress level, and 4) are improved by phlebotomy and its efficacy correlated with a&#xD;
      reduction in oxidant stress.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited from the North American continent and United States possessions.&#xD;
        The patients currently followed at the Transfusion Medicine Department under IRB protocol #&#xD;
        01-CC-0045 will be informed of our study protocol. Also, subjects referred to IRB protocol&#xD;
        # 01-CC-0045 from the ongoing genotyping study by the NHLBI (HEIRS trial) will be&#xD;
        considered for the potential subjects. Advertisements of our study both on the Web and the&#xD;
        NIH newsletters will be planned through the NIH @@@Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison&#xD;
        to recruit additional patients if necessary. There will be no exclusion from participation&#xD;
        in the study on the basis of ethnicity/race/gender. Since HH is predominantly seen in&#xD;
        Caucasian origins and the exact frequency in African, Asian, Hispanic population is too low&#xD;
        to estimate, we assume that the study population will not be the same as the demographic&#xD;
        representation of ethnic groups in this country because of the inheritance nature of this&#xD;
        disease.&#xD;
