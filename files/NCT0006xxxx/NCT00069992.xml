  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to participate in this study because they have a malignant blood&#xD;
      disease such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Myeloproliferative Disorder (MPD), Acute&#xD;
      Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). We feel that patients could&#xD;
      benefit from an allogeneic (meaning the cells come from a donor other than themself) stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. The donor would be a family member or an unrelated person that is felt to be&#xD;
      a good match for the patient. Stem cells are cells that are made in the bone marrow (spongy&#xD;
      material that fills the middle of the bones). As the stem cells grow, they change into&#xD;
      different types of blood cells that they need. This includes red blood cells that carry&#xD;
      oxygen around the body, white blood cells that help to fight infections, and platelets that&#xD;
      help to prevent and stop bleeding. Usually, patients are given high doses of chemotherapy&#xD;
      before a stem cell transplant. High doses of chemo destroy the bone marrow. Healthy stem&#xD;
      cells from a donor are then given to replace the patient's unhealthy cells. However, because&#xD;
      of complications with the patient's disease, they have a high risk of having life-threatening&#xD;
      side effects. These include serious damage to organs such as the lung, liver, kidney and&#xD;
      heart. There is also an increased risk of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. The other&#xD;
      major problem is when a donor's stem cells (also called the graft) find that the patient's&#xD;
      cells ( the host cells) are not the same. The donor cells may try to destroy the host's&#xD;
      cells. The cells at high risk are those of the skin, liver and intestines. This is called&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) and it can be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, doctors have been able to use less toxic chemotherapy treatments before patients&#xD;
      receive their transplants. This less toxic treatment helps reduce some of the treatment&#xD;
      related problems mentioned above. Patient's are being asked to be involved in a research&#xD;
      study that uses this approach. One major risk of this low dose treatment is that the&#xD;
      patient's body may reject the donor cells. This is called graft rejection. This study is&#xD;
      designed to see if this low dose treatment is safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment plan adds CAMPATH 1H (a special protein called an antibody) to a low dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. After chemo, the patient will receive an allogeneic (cells come from a&#xD;
      donor) stem cell transplant. Adding CAMPATH 1H to the transplant medicines may help in&#xD;
      treating the disease. CAMPATH 1H may reduce life-threatening and treatment related side&#xD;
      effects like GVHD. CAMPATH 1H stays active in the body for a long time which means it may&#xD;
      work longer to prevent GVHD. CAMPATH 1H destroys lymphocytes, a type of white cells that help&#xD;
      fight infection, and this helps prevent graft rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to see if the addition of CAMPATH 1H to the patient's pre-transplant low dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy will decrease the side effects from an allogeneic stem cell transplant, while&#xD;
      providing a curative treatment for patients with blood disorders.&#xD;

      We expect that the patient's participation in this study will last approximately 18 months to&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment begins, they will be evaluated to confirm they meet the requirements of this&#xD;
      study. The evaluation includes HIV testing, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus&#xD;
      that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). If the patient is HIV positive, they&#xD;
      will not be able to be treated on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will need to have a central line. This is a thin plastic catheter or tube that is&#xD;
      placed during surgery into one of the large veins in the chest or neck. Central lines are&#xD;
      used to give medications IV (intravenous, by vein) or to take blood samples without having to&#xD;
      endure frequent needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After admission to the hospital the subject will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -6: a single dose of total body irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -5 to Day -2 Chemotherapy: Fludarabine plus Campath 1H through a catheter inserted into a&#xD;
      vein (IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -2: FK506 given IV over a 24 hour period until the patient can take medication by mouth.&#xD;
      When they can take oral medication they will take this medication by mouth every 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -1 : a day of rest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: the stem cell transplant (infusion) will be given&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day +7: G-CSF will be given by subcutaneous injection until your white blood cells&#xD;
      (granulocytes) are greater than 1000/ul.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After transplantation, they will be evaluated as follows. Routine history, physical&#xD;
      examination, blood tests and radiology studies will be done as needed for clinical care. Bone&#xD;
      marrow aspirate and biopsy will be done on or about day 30, 60 and 100, 180 and then yearly&#xD;
      and as needed.&#xD;
