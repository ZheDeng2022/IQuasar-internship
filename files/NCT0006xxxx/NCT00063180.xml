  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stroke sometimes have a condition called diaschisis, a loss of function in a&#xD;
      part of the brain located some distance from the original stroke-injury site. Doctors do not&#xD;
      know why this happens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding as to why diaschisis occurs by&#xD;
      studying people who have experienced a stroke and people who have aged in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-four participants who are older than 40 year of age will be enrolled in this study-18&#xD;
      healthy people and 26 stroke patients. They will have 3 to 4 study visits. The first visit&#xD;
      will involve a medical history and a physical and neurological exam. Participants will then&#xD;
      have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, either on the first visit or on a later day. On&#xD;
      the next visit, they will undergo a position emission tomography (PET) scan. Finally, they&#xD;
      will return for another MRI scan.&#xD;

      Objective: Following a stroke, not only is there dysfunction of the lesioned area, but there&#xD;
      is also remote functional depression of non-lesioned areas. This functional depression,&#xD;
      called diaschisis, likely contributes to the functional deficit of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      diaschisis with the integrated methods of neuroimaging (positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We will recruit patients with subcortical stroke in the subacute state and&#xD;
      in the chronic state, and normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The stroke lesion will be the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, or&#xD;
      cerebellum. The frontal cortex, including the motor cortex, is chosen as a remote area.&#xD;
      Neurochemical changes in the diaschitic area will be investigated by measuring the glucose&#xD;
      metabolic rate with PET, and concentrations of neurochemically important metabolites, such as&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, with H-MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Metabolic change in the diaschitic areas relative to the contra-lateral&#xD;
      unaffected side will be calculated as a laterality index. First, this index will be compared&#xD;
      among patient groups and control group. As a second analysis, the relationship of glucose&#xD;
      metabolism measured by PET and concentrations of the metabolites detected by H-MRS will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will have a clinically and radiologically documented stroke in the subacute (2&#xD;
        weeks to 6 months to after onset) or the chronic state (more than 6 months after onset),&#xD;
        having a lesion in subcortical regions including the basal ganglia, thalamus, internal&#xD;
        capsule, or a combination of these structures, or cerebellum unilaterally. These lesions&#xD;
        can extend to the surrounding areas, however not including the cerebral areas where H-MRS&#xD;
        ROI will be located. Both ischemic infarction and hemorrhage will be included; however, in&#xD;
        cases of hemorrhage, we will exclude cases with deformation in the cerebral hemisphere due&#xD;
        to mass effect of the hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or extension to the ventricles. Patients&#xD;
        will be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy controls entering the study must be free of serious somatic disease as determined&#xD;
        by a standard physical and neurological examination. Controls will be aged over 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients and controls of child bearing potential will have a pregnancy test and&#xD;
        specific interview prior to the study to ensure that pregnant patients will not participate&#xD;
        in the study. Both patients and controls will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week&#xD;
        before each of the PET and H-MRS scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Patients with MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, trauma or AVMs will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients with multiple stroke lesions will be excluded, except for prior asymptomatic&#xD;
        lacunar infarctions or stroke lesions which are not known to cause diaschisis in the&#xD;
        frontal cortex (occipital cortex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Patients with severe stenosis (greater than 70%) or occlusion in internal cervical&#xD;
        arteries and in the proximal portions of middle or frontal cerebral arteries detected by&#xD;
        angiography or MRA will be excluded. Subjects with medical disorders which can affect the&#xD;
        concentration of cerebral metabolites, including renal failure, hepatic failure and&#xD;
        untreated electrolyte abnormality will be excluded. Subjects with poorly controlled&#xD;
        diabetes mellitus (casual plasma glucose concentration greater than or equal to 200 mg per&#xD;
        dL (11.1 mmol per L) or fast plasma glucose concentration greater than or equal to 126 mg&#xD;
        per dL (7.0 mmol per L) will be excluded. Subjects who are taking sleeping drugs or&#xD;
        tranquilizers will be asked to stop taking them for two days prior to each of the PET and&#xD;
        H-MRS scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Subjects with a pre-stroke history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorders will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Subjects with implanted devices such as pacemakers, medication pumps or defibrillators,&#xD;
        metal in the cranium except mouth, intracardiac lines, history of shrapnel injury or any&#xD;
        other condition/device that may be contraindicated or prevent the acquisition of MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Subjects with cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Patients not capable of giving an informed consent will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
        H. Ethnic origin and race will not be biased for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be excluded from the study because we need to study a homogeneous group of&#xD;
        subjects by age and developmental changes in metabolites will complicate this study.&#xD;
        Additionally, young children will not be sufficiently cooperative for the long periods of&#xD;
        testing. Moreover, the radiation dose of the PET studies would subject them to relatively&#xD;
        greater risk than the adults.&#xD;
