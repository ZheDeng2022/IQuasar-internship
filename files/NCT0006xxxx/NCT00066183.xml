      Phosphorus and phosphate irons play critical roles in bone structure and essential cellular&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the factors and hormones that regulate&#xD;
      phosphorus in the body by collecting blood and urine samples from patients with disorders of&#xD;
      phosphate control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both children and adults will be enrolled in this study. Researchers will collect blood and&#xD;
      urine samples from participants on multiple occasions (2 to 6 times). Some blood specimens&#xD;
      will be taken after an overnight fast and participants may be asked to collect all their&#xD;
      urine during a 24-hour period. Researchers will analyze these blood and urine samples to&#xD;
      better understanding how the body handles phosphorus.&#xD;

      Phosphorus and phosphate ions play an important role in cellular metabolism as well as bone&#xD;
      structure. Scientific evidence suggests that, in addition to Vitamin D and PTH systems, novel&#xD;
      factors, such as Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) and Matrix extracellular&#xD;
      phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), may play an important role in phosphorus regulation. These&#xD;
      factors have been best studied in rare genetic and acquired phosphate wasting disorders such&#xD;
      as tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO), X linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and autosomal dominant&#xD;
      hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR). Patients with other abnormal phosphate regulating states&#xD;
      such as hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism etc. undergoing&#xD;
      phosphorus-altering interventions may provide important insight into the role of these&#xD;
      hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing an observational study with collection of blood and urine samples to study&#xD;
      both established (e.g. mineral ions, bone markers, PTH-Vit D system, TMP-GFR) and novel (e.g.&#xD;
      FGF-23 and MEPE) constituents of the phosphorus metabolism pathway. Patients with abnormal&#xD;
      phosphorus regulating states will be enrolled and we will study the natural history of their&#xD;
      disease and the effects of specific interventions that are likely to change phosphorus&#xD;
      balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome will potentially aid understanding of this new field of mineral regulating&#xD;
      hormones and generate both interest and research in phosphorus metabolism. It is hoped that&#xD;
      this will also encourage clinical trials in treatment of phosphate wasting disorders.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of any age, gender or ethnicity who will help fulfill the objectives laid out in&#xD;
        Section II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We propose to study patients primarily enrolled in other clinical center protocol(s). They&#xD;
        will continue to receive treatment/ interventions per the original protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with significant cognitive impairment who are unable to give informed consent or&#xD;
        patients having other significant mineral disturbances that could confound the parameters&#xD;
        being studied will be excluded.&#xD;
