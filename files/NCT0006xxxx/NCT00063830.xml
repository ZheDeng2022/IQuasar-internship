  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center trial in the US and Europe to test the safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of alicaforsen (ISIS 2302), a new type of drug called an antisense drug, in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate active Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Alicaforsen is designed to&#xD;
      reduce the production of a specific protein, called ICAM-1, a substance that plays a&#xD;
      significant role in the increase of inflammation and is likely to be involved in inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis. The ISIS 2302-CS27 study will compare four dosing&#xD;
      regimens and determine the minimum effective dose of alicaforsen enema in UC patients over&#xD;
      six weeks as compared to a placebo enema. (The probability of receiving active formulation is&#xD;
      4:1). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the percentage reduction in DAI at&#xD;
      Week 6.&#xD;
