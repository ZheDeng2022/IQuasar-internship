  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a collective term for a group of inherited retinal dystrophies&#xD;
      that are a major cause of irreversible blindness. RP of some type occurs in approximately 1&#xD;
      out of 3500 persons in the United States(1). Gene mutations are responsible for the majority&#xD;
      of RP. To date, mutations have been identified in 30 different genes linked to RP(2). The&#xD;
      visual prognosis of RP is poor, since the gradual but relentless visual field loss leads&#xD;
      eventually to some degree of blindness(3). Although no effective treatment for RP has been&#xD;
      identified, participants supplemented with a daily oral dose of 15,000 IU vitamin A palmitate&#xD;
      have shown, on average, a slower rate of deterioration of retinal function when the&#xD;
      intervention is continued over several years(4). The purpose of this research is to determine&#xD;
      whether administration of high oral doses of vitamin A can acutely improve cone photoreceptor&#xD;
      function in RP participants as measured by electroretinography (ERG). In this interventional,&#xD;
      non-randomized, prospective, pilot study, 5 participants will receive a daily oral dose of&#xD;
      50,000 IU of vitamin A palmitate for 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 15,000 IU&#xD;
      daily for the subsequent 2 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome is a relative percentage&#xD;
      change in ERG response amplitude subsequent to vitamin A supplementation. A secondary&#xD;
      efficacy outcome is a relative percentage change in implicit time from pre- to post- vitamin&#xD;
      A supplementation, with improvement specified as a shorter response implicit time. Other&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be improvements in visual field (Humphery, 10-2; sum of thresholds).&#xD;
      Safety outcomes include visual fields, ETDRS visual acuity, intraocular pressure, serum&#xD;
      vitamin A level and liver function tests.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must meet the following criteria to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women age 18 years of age and older. (Children will be excluded since there is&#xD;
             a higher incidence of vitamin A toxicity in the pediatric population.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnoses of typical RP of all genetic subtypes (simplex, autosomal dominant,&#xD;
             autosomal recessive, and X-linked), as determined primarily by abnormally reduced ERG&#xD;
             rod response amplitudes that are relatively more affected than cone ERG amplitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Mutation in the RHO1 gene as determined by genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants in whom flicker ERG can be measured reliably (standard flicker ERG&#xD;
             amplitude greater than 2 microV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness to use contraception for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Understood and signed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with the following conditions will be excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with syndromic RP (i.e., Ushers syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have abnormal liver function (greater than ULN ALT, AST, Alkaline Phosphate, or Total&#xD;
             Bilirubin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hematocrit greater than 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have abnormal kidney function (greater than1.5 mg/dL serum creatinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently or has taken greater than 15,000 IU/day vitamin A supplementation within 6&#xD;
             months of the first screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is pregnant or lactating (due to evidence that sugests excessive intake of vitamin A&#xD;
             could be tertogenic in humans and affect the content of breast milk).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently or has taken greater than 400 IU/day of vitamin E supplementation within 6&#xD;
             months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Vitamin A serum level exceeding 150 microg/dL.&#xD;
