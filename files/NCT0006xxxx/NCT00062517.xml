    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase researchers understanding of the biological basis of&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. They will investigate how the brain&#xD;
      activity associated with specific thoughts and feelings may play a role in these anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. This knowledge will be used to design interventions to help those with these&#xD;
      illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify for this study, participants must be evaluated via an initial telephone screening&#xD;
      interview and material sent through the mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be required to make three visits to NIH. During the first visit, they&#xD;
      will be asked questions about their general mood, degree of nervousness, thinking skills, and&#xD;
      behavior. They will undergo a thorough physical exam, including an EKG, blood work,&#xD;
      urinalysis, and a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. During the second&#xD;
      visit, participants will spend about 2.5 hours doing various tasks while sitting and looking&#xD;
      at a computer screen. These tasks will guide them to experience specific kinds of thoughts&#xD;
      and emotions. Researchers will attach electrodes to the participants hands to monitor the&#xD;
      amount of electricity conducted by the skin. The third visit will be similar to the second&#xD;
      visit, but participants will perform the tasks while lying in a MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be compensated up to $400 for their involvement in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There have been suggestions that the threshold for amygdala activity is lower in individuals&#xD;
      with anxiety disorders than in healthy individuals. However, despite it's immediate&#xD;
      plausibility, there have been relatively few tests of this hypothesis. Specifically, there&#xD;
      have been very few explorations of the performance of patients with anxiety disorders on&#xD;
      measures known to implicate the amygdala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the high co-morbidity of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder (SAD) complicates the issue, the fact that the disorders doubly dissociate suggests&#xD;
      that they are due to dysfunctional activity in separable neurocognitive systems. We would&#xD;
      suggest that the hyper-responsive amygdala hypothesis is more likely to be linked to the&#xD;
      explanation of GAD. In contrast, SAD may be due to reduced activation thresholds for units in&#xD;
      a system that responds to social threat and which recruits lateral orbital frontal cortex.&#xD;
      Thus, the current project will determine the performance of patients with GAD and SAD on&#xD;
      measures in which the amygdala is known to play a role and also measures that recruit lateral&#xD;
      orbital frontal cortex and the system for social response reversal. In addition, two proposed&#xD;
      neuro-imaging studies will directly assess neural responses in these two systems in both&#xD;
      patient populations. The project should provide clear data that will constrain future&#xD;
      theorizing on the pathology implicated in these two disorders.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Participants will be males and females, 18-50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        IQ: IQ, as measured by 4 subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised&#xD;
        (WAIS-R), must be &gt; 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medication status: No regular use of psychotropic medication within 2 weeks of the study&#xD;
        (or fluoxetine within 8 weeks of the study). No regular use of any benzodiazepine. We&#xD;
        intend to identify patients whose GAD/SAD is currently untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because factors such as psychiatric disease, or CNS disease, can influence functional brain&#xD;
        activity, and pregnancy precludes participation in fMRI studies, these factors are&#xD;
        exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Psychiatric history: Participants will be assessed using DSM-IV criteria via&#xD;
             standardized psychiatric interviews conducted by trained examiners (i.e., SCID). Any&#xD;
             current suicidal ideation will be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Healthy comparison individuals (Group 1): All participants will be free of any&#xD;
                  current psychiatric disorder as well as lifetime history of psychosis, pervasive&#xD;
                  developmental disorder, major affective disorder, panic disorder, obsessive&#xD;
                  compulsive disorder, conduct disorder, ADHD, anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with GAD (Group 2): Any history of an axis I diagnosis excluding SAD but&#xD;
                  not including adjustment disorder, simple phobia or dysthymia is exclusionary.&#xD;
                  There must be no current mood disoder (MD) though patients with past MD, which&#xD;
                  occurred after the onset of GAD, will be admitted to the study. We recognize the&#xD;
                  difficulty of recruiting patients with GAD without co-morbid SAD and will&#xD;
                  therefore allow patients who are comorbid into the study in this group. We have&#xD;
                  faced difficulties with our studies of children with psychopathic tendencies&#xD;
                  where, although it is possible to identify populations who only meet criteria for&#xD;
                  ADHD most children who meet criteria for psychopathic tendencies are co-morbid&#xD;
                  for ADHD. We will adopt a similar strategy to our work with children; i.e., in&#xD;
                  contrasts of patients with GAD with comparison individuals, we will use SAD&#xD;
                  symptomatology as a covariate to reduce, and evaluate, the impact of pathology&#xD;
                  associated with SAD on the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients with SAD (Group 3): Any current history of an axis I diagnosis including&#xD;
                  GAD, but excluding adjustment disorder, simple phobia or dysthymia is&#xD;
                  exclusionary. There must be no current mood disorder (MD) though patients with&#xD;
                  past MD, which occurred after the onset of SAD, will be admitted to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of Drug Abuse: Axis I diagnoses of substance use disorders will be&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe acute and chronic medical illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. CNS disease: History of brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasms, subarachnoid cysts),&#xD;
             cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), or other neurological&#xD;
             disease, or history of head trauma (defined as loss of consciousness &gt; 3 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metal or electronic objects: Metal plates, certain types of dental braces, cardiac&#xD;
             pacemakers, etc., that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields contraindicate MRI&#xD;
             scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Claustrophobia: Participants will be questioned about potential discomfort in being in&#xD;
             an enclosed space, such as an MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy status: Because of the potential effects of hormonal changes on brain&#xD;
             function as well as the unknown effects of electromagnetic field on the fetus, known&#xD;
             pregnancy is an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
