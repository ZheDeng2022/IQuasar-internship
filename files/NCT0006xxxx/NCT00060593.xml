      This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine loss of balance in&#xD;
      the elderly. Falls due to balance problems are a major health issue in older people, often&#xD;
      resulting in bone fractures and other bodily injuries, and in functional decline. Risk&#xD;
      factors for falling in the elderly include some standing positions in which older people&#xD;
      usually experience balance problems, such as leaning forwards or backwards. Functional MRI&#xD;
      records brain function while the subject performs a task, such as moving a limb or speaking,&#xD;
      and detects changes in the brain regions involved in those tasks. This study will look at&#xD;
      different brain areas to see which areas might control what people see around them while they&#xD;
      are standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 20 and 90 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates must be in good health, have no difficulties in performing activities of daily&#xD;
      living, and be able to walk for at least 400 meters (1/4 mile). They will be screened with a&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo functional MRI while performing visual recognition tasks in two&#xD;
      experiments, described below. For the MRI procedure, the subject lies in the MRI scanner, a&#xD;
      narrow metal cylinder containing a strong magnet, for 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans&#xD;
      lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. The experiments are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      During MRI scanning, the subject watches computer-generated movies of a person leaning&#xD;
      forwards and backwards. When the subject recognizes an unstable body position in the&#xD;
      movements, he or she presses a computer mouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      During MRI scanning, the subject watches still pictures of people leaning in stable and&#xD;
      unstable postures and presses a button as soon as he or she recognizes that the posture is&#xD;
      unstable.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A number of studies have explored the role of visual, vestibular and somatosensory systems in&#xD;
      the control of upright posture. However, the cortical control of postural stability, in&#xD;
      general, and the role of higher cognitive function in assessment of postural stability, in&#xD;
      specific, has not been studied extensively. It is well established that certain features of&#xD;
      postural control change during the advancing years of life so that the stability of posture&#xD;
      can be a problem in the elderly. However, neural mechanisms of postural stability that&#xD;
      decline with age and make older adults more prone to falling have not been identified&#xD;
      specifically. To characterize specific causes of falling in the elderly is problematic,&#xD;
      because human posture is a product of an extremely complex dynamical system and like any&#xD;
      other physical activity undergoes dramatic changes in organization throughout the life-span.&#xD;
      In our previous research we showed the neural activation patterns embodied in the&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) were associated with recognition of unstable postures in young&#xD;
      healthy subjects. In another protocol, we propose that these patterns will systematically&#xD;
      change with aging, and will result in difficulty to discriminate relevant from irrelevant&#xD;
      information in the control of upright posture. The present study focuses on the evaluation of&#xD;
      neural activation patterns underlying recognition of unstable postures in 15 young controls&#xD;
      and 15 elderly subjects using both the block and event-related functional MRI (fMRI) designs.&#xD;
      We will first analyze how the frontal-parieto-occipital circuits play a role in perception of&#xD;
      postural stability in young subjects and then perform similar studies using elderly subjects.&#xD;
      After the fMRI measurements a detailed evaluation of the haemodynamic response (BOLD) signals&#xD;
      will be performed. Further analysis will look at the functional connectivity between the&#xD;
      motion-selective cortical area (V5), the posterior parietal cortex (PP) and the frontal&#xD;
      cortex (FC), using correlation methods. It is expected that from the study will uncover&#xD;
      important insights in neural mechanisms as it relates to the self-perception of postural&#xD;
      stability and its deterioration as a result of aging.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will be 20 subjects in each aforementioned age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be enrolled in this study if they are within the range of 20-50 (young group)&#xD;
        and 70-90 (old group) years old, in good health, report no difficulties or need for help in&#xD;
        performing self-care or instrumental activities of daily living, are able to walk for at&#xD;
        least 400 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects and patients participating in this study will have a valid Clinical Center&#xD;
        Medical Record Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will be unable to study people who have substantial cognitive impairment based on mental&#xD;
        status screening tests, history of cardiovascular disease (including angina, myocardial&#xD;
        infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebro-vascular disease), cancer, neurological&#xD;
        diseases, birth defects, kidney or liver disease, gastrointestinal (G.I.) disease,&#xD;
        musculo-skeletal disorder (if they cause pathological weakness and/or chronic pain),&#xD;
        important sensory deficits and any conditions that precludes them from being tested with&#xD;
        standard neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MRI experiments will not be performed in subjects or patients who have pacemakers, brain&#xD;
        stimulators, dental implants or metallic braces, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of&#xD;
        a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and&#xD;
        cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner, insulin pump, or shrapnel fragments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will not scan pregnant women because of the safety of high magnetic fields to the fetus&#xD;
        is not established.&#xD;
