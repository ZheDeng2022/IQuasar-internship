      RATIONALE: Stimulant drugs such as dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate may help&#xD;
      improve memory, attention, and thinking problems caused by central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      treatment for cancer, and may help decrease depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying dextroamphetamine-amphetamine to see how&#xD;
      well it works compared to methylphenidate in treating depression and problems with memory,&#xD;
      attention, and thinking in children who have undergone CNS treatment for cancer. This trial&#xD;
      will also study how often depression is seen and if these medications might help.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the response rates in pediatric cancer patients with treatment-related&#xD;
           neurocognitive sequelae treated with dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall-XR®) vs&#xD;
           methylphenidate (Concerta®).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the durability of response at 12 weeks in patients who show a response at 3&#xD;
           weeks after treatment with these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether patients who have no response to one of these study drugs can respond&#xD;
           to the other study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the prevalence of depression and possible response to neurostimulant therapy&#xD;
           in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dextroamphetamine-amphetamine once daily for 3 weeks.&#xD;
           Patients who achieve response (based on neurocognitive testing) continue treatment for a&#xD;
           total of 12 weeks. Patients with no response after 3 weeks cross over to arm II after a&#xD;
           48-hour washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral methylphenidate once daily for 3 weeks. Responding&#xD;
           patients continue treatment for a total of 12 weeks. Patients with no response after 3&#xD;
           weeks cross over to arm I after a 48-hour washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and neurocognitive function are assessed at baseline, 3 weeks, and end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 177 patients (approximately 88 per treatment arm) will be&#xD;
      accrued for this study within 3 years.&#xD;
