      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential hypertension affects at least 25 percent of American adults, and it is a primary&#xD;
      risk factor for heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. Many, but not all, studies have&#xD;
      shown that variants of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT) affect the risk of hypertension, but&#xD;
      association studies conducted to date have been compromised by genetic heterogeneity and by&#xD;
      the inherent complexity of hypertension as a phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive study of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene will be conducted in data collected&#xD;
      from several large groups of individuals. The investigators will sequence or genotype a 14.4&#xD;
      kb region including AGT in more than 1,600 individuals sampled from populations throughout&#xD;
      the world. This will permit them to explore fully the extent of allelic heterogeneity,&#xD;
      haplotype variation, and potential for population stratification in the AGT gene.&#xD;
      Approximately 600 of these individuals are clinically uncharacterized and will represent a&#xD;
      broad range of worldwide human variation. Another 500 subjects are members of 40 Utah&#xD;
      pedigrees that are part of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) collection.&#xD;
      These unique families have been heavily characterized genetically, and they are now being&#xD;
      phenotyped for variables that include anthropometrics, blood chemistries, blood pressure&#xD;
      measures, and plasma and urinary angiotensinogen. They will address the issue of genetic&#xD;
      heterogeneity by testing associations between multi-SNP AGT haplotypes, angiotensinogen&#xD;
      levels, and blood pressure. In addition, linkage disequilibrium patterns will be assessed to&#xD;
      determine the density and nature of SNPs best suited for localizing a gene underlying a&#xD;
      complex trait. They will address the issue of phenotypic heterogeneity in hypertension by&#xD;
      performing extensive SNP typing on a set of 400 hypertensives and 100 normotensives collected&#xD;
      by Dr. Gordon Williams. These clinically well-characterized subjects have been tested for&#xD;
      their response to infused angiotensin-II under high and low sodium intake. This direct probe&#xD;
      provides a hypertension endophenotype that is closer to the function of the AGT gene,&#xD;
      yielding a more realistic and informative assessment of the relationship between AGT&#xD;
      haplotype variation and hypertension risk. A phylogenetic analysis of AGT sequence variation&#xD;
      in the worldwide sample will help to assess population stratification in association studies.&#xD;
      In addition, this sample will allow testing the hypothesis that the ancestral T235 AGT allele&#xD;
      provided a selective advantage in the sodium-poor environment of sub-Saharan Africa. The&#xD;
      results of this analysis may help to explain why African-Americans have elevated rates of&#xD;
      hypertension. In summary, the extensive analysis of AGT variation in more than 1,600 subjects&#xD;
      will clarify the role of this gene in essential hypertension and will test specific&#xD;
      hypotheses about the evolution of AGT.&#xD;
