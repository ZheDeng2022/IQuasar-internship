  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colectomy with creation of an ileal pouch (IPAA) is now the treatment of choice for patients&#xD;
      with ulcerative colitis that is resistant to existing medical therapies. The development of&#xD;
      inflammation in these ileal reservoirs, a clinical entity referred to as pouchitis, is the&#xD;
      most common long-term complication of this procedure and can affect 50-60% of adults and&#xD;
      children. We have previously demonstrated that clotrimazole (delivered as a rectal&#xD;
      suppository) is generally safe, effective, and displays poor systemic absorption when used in&#xD;
      pediatric and adults with active pouchitis. We saw clinical benefit in patients with pouch&#xD;
      disease that had previously failed to respond to standard antibiotic, steroid, or&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies. The clinical trial outlined here will define the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of topical clotrimazole therapy (delivered as a rectal enema) in pediatric (aged&#xD;
      greater than two years) and adult patients with pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo (no active drug, 4&#xD;
      subjects) or one of two clotrimazole therapy groups: 2500 mg/day (8 subjects) or 4000mg/day&#xD;
      (8 subjects). No washout period is required, and subjects will be allowed to continue their&#xD;
      existing anti-inflammatory medications during their participation in the study. Clotrimazole&#xD;
      will be delivered nightly in the form of an enema. Subjects will undergo flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy (pouchoscopy) prior to and again after completing one month of study therapy,&#xD;
      and pouch disease activity will be graded at after each procedure using the Pouchitis Disease&#xD;
      Activity Index (PDAI). Clinical improvement will be defined as a drop in PDAI score. If the&#xD;
      drop in PDAI scores between placebo and either active clotrimazole treatment group is not&#xD;
      significant, and no subject experiences what are determined to be study-related adverse&#xD;
      effects, a second cohort of subjects will be recruited and studied after receiving one month&#xD;
      of either placebo (4 subjects), 6000 mg/day clotrimazole (8 subjects), or 7500mg/day&#xD;
      clotrimazole (8 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for adverse effects at the midpoint of the study. Clotrimazole&#xD;
      blood levels will be measured during the first and last day of study participation. In&#xD;
      addition, adults will complete a health related quality of life assessment at baseline and&#xD;
      after completing study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be eligible for one month of open-label study drug therapy after completing&#xD;
      one month of study drug therapy.&#xD;
