      This study, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and at the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health in Bethesda, Maryland, will examine deficits in brain structure and function in people&#xD;
      exposed to trauma who developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to see if these&#xD;
      deficits change after treatment. It also will investigate whether there is a genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility to PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates 18 years of age and older in the following categories will be included in this&#xD;
      study: 1) women who have PTSD of at least 1 year's duration following sexual or non-sexual&#xD;
      assault; 2) healthy women (controls) who were previously assaulted but did not develop PTSD;&#xD;
      and 3) healthy women (controls) who were never traumatized. Candidates will be screened with&#xD;
      a medical history and physical examination, psychiatric evaluation, electrocardiogram (EKG),&#xD;
      and routine blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with PTSD will be assigned to receive either: 1) 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      psychotherapy either immediately upon enrollment or after a 3-month waiting period; or 2) 10&#xD;
      weeks of drug treatment with paroxetine (PaxilÂ® (Registered Trademark)). Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated before and after treatment with the procedures outlined below. Control subjects&#xD;
      will undergo the same procedures, also with a 10- to 12-week interval between evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing: Subjects will take paper and pencil and computer tests to&#xD;
           evaluate memory, learning, attention and concentration, vocabulary and naming.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Subjects will have MRI scans of the brain to examine&#xD;
           brain structure and blood flow while they perform two tasks. In the first task, they&#xD;
           will be shown a series of faces and asked to press one button for a male face and&#xD;
           another button for a female face. In the second task they will hear loud noises and see&#xD;
           colored squares. During the scan, subjects lie on a bed that slides into a narrow tunnel&#xD;
           (the scanner). They will wear a headset to block the noise of the scanner and through&#xD;
           which they will receive instructions for the tasks. Heart rate and skin conductance&#xD;
           (sweating) will be measured during the scan to evaluate physiologic changes in response&#xD;
           to the tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eyeblink air puff test: Subjects will hear tones and will have a light puff of air&#xD;
           delivered to the eye. Changes in heart rate, sweat, and eyeblink will be measured with&#xD;
           electrodes taped to the skin on two fingers, on each side of the rib cage, and under one&#xD;
           eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential air puff delivery: This experiment has three parts. During each of the three&#xD;
           parts of this experiment, subjects will see colored lights and may or may not receive a&#xD;
           puff of air to the neck. Before each part they will be told that they will, will not, or&#xD;
           may receive an air puff to the neck. Each part will be repeated several times. During&#xD;
           the test, electrodes will be taped to the arms and chest to monitor skin conductance and&#xD;
           heart rate responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for genetic evaluation: Subjects' DNA will be examined to try to determine if&#xD;
           the risk of developing PTSD is inherited. The DNA will be examined for cortisol receptor&#xD;
           gene evaluation, to see if a form of this gene is found more often in patients with PTSD&#xD;
           than in healthy controls. The receptor for cortisol determines the activity of the&#xD;
           stress hormone cortisol, and genetic variations in the structure of this receptor may be&#xD;
           related to vulnerability to PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taking paroxetine will be offered up to 3 months of additional drug therapy&#xD;
      following completion of the study and will be offered participation in other NIH studies for&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment of PTSD.&#xD;

      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive recollections, avoidant&#xD;
      behavior, anxiety and exaggerated fear response. The pathophysiology of PTSD is largely&#xD;
      unknown. Neurophysiological testing in PTSD reveals deficits in memory and attention.&#xD;
      Neuroimaging studies report increased amygdala and decreased anterior cingulate activation&#xD;
      and reduced hippocampal volume. Clinical observations, psychophysiological measures and&#xD;
      animal studies suggest that facilitated fear conditioning, delayed extinction, inescapable&#xD;
      shock, sensitization and protracted habituation may contribute to the onset and persistence&#xD;
      of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to use fMRI and the psychophysiology lab to examine the effect of treatment with&#xD;
      paroxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in brain&#xD;
      regions conceivably involved in evolution and maintenance of PTSD: Amygdala, anterior&#xD;
      cingulate and hippocampus. We will use emotional tasks that have elicited differences in&#xD;
      perfusion or metabolism between patients with PTSD and trauma exposed and healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Tasks performed in the fMRI will include 'masked' and 'unmasked' emotional faces paradigms&#xD;
      and differential delay conditioning. Contextual fear provocation and eyeblink trace&#xD;
      conditioning will be done in the psychophysiology lab. This evaluation will be performed&#xD;
      before and after a 10-week period of treatment with paroxetine and a 10-session course of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will comprise the following matched groups: Patients with PTSD; previously&#xD;
      traumatized healthy subjects who have not suffered from PTSD and non-traumatized healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects from the 1st group will either be treated with paroxetine for 10 weeks,&#xD;
      undergo a 10-week 'prolonged exposure' (PE) CBT course, or will be put on the 'waiting list'.&#xD;
      It is assumed that variability in outcome will be observed in both treatment modes, which&#xD;
      will enable us to seek treatment response predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether cerebral abnormalities in PTSD are state or trait phenomena. In&#xD;
      depression and OCD, functional imaging research shows improvement in malfunctioning brain&#xD;
      regions after clinically effective psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions&#xD;
      and after administration of placebo in depression. An increase in hippocampal volume was&#xD;
      found in patients with PTSD after treatment with paroxetine and after correction of the&#xD;
      endocrine abnormality in Cushing's disorder. These findings support our expectation that at&#xD;
      least some brain abnormalities in PTSD are state related, and that change in these&#xD;
      abnormalities is demonstrable by fMRI.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men and women aged 18-65, suffering from PTSD, healthy trauma survivors and never&#xD;
        traumatized healthy subjects. PTSD diagnosis will be determined using the structured&#xD;
        clinical interview for DSM IV (SCID)(155).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Capable of providing informed consent, obtained prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Free of all psychotropic medication for at least 2 weeks, excluding short-term hypnotics.&#xD;
        Patients who were treated with fluoxetine will only be included after a medication free&#xD;
        period of at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Good physical health, confirmed by a complete physical exam (including normal vital signs),&#xD;
        electrocardiogram, neurological exam, and routine laboratory tests of blood and urine.&#xD;
        However, if patients have participated in other research studies or have had blood work&#xD;
        through their primary MD within the last 6 months, these results will be used instead of&#xD;
        repeating blood draws for inclusion into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Right handed, as determined by a handedness questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Past head trauma involving loss of consciousness, or amnesia greater than 24 hours. This&#xD;
        magnitude of head trauma could contribute to psychopathology and brain structure in a&#xD;
        manner different than PTSD thereby confounding results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Substance abuse (alcohol or drugs) or dependence within 3 months prior to screening. The&#xD;
        effect of abuse/dependence on phenomenology and biology could mask and exceed PTSD effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All additional DSM IV Axis I comorbidity, excluding secondary diagnoses of major depressive&#xD;
        disorder (MDD) or anxiety disorders (AD). Given the high comorbidity of these disorders in&#xD;
        PTSD, and since excluding such patients would not provide the full spectrum of the&#xD;
        disorder, only patients in whom axis I diagnoses of MDD and AD preceded onset of PTSD will&#xD;
        be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mental retardation or another pervasive developmental disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk of homicide or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        When the trauma involves assault, a continuing intimate relationship with the perpetrator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current or intended pregnancy. If a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the&#xD;
        study, her data will be removed from the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are doing well on medication. Although we will only recruit non-medicated&#xD;
        patients, the decision to stop medication will be taken purely on clinical grounds. No&#xD;
        subject will be taken off medication solely to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Deafness will NOT exclude patients or healthy controls from participation. Accomodations&#xD;
        and protocol adjustments (e.g., abbreviation of neuropsychological battery to eliminate&#xD;
        tests which would be subjected to known or expected normalization violations) will be made&#xD;
        as necessary for this population.&#xD;
