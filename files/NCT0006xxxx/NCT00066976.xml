  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some babies have difficulty breathing, sucking, and swallowing at birth. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine (before birth) the variables that will predict whether a newborn will&#xD;
      experience these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be pregnant women with a single fetus who are 18 years or older and&#xD;
      who are scheduled to receive a standard prenatal ultrasound. Researchers will use the&#xD;
      ultrasound to observe fetal motions associated with breathing, sucking, and swallowing on&#xD;
      digital videotape. They will then review these tapes and take measurements that will help&#xD;
      them document how breathing and swallowing develop.&#xD;

      The aerodigestive tract is a complex system of integrated anatomical structures supporting&#xD;
      ingestive and respiratory functions. The developmental origins of this system begin in utero&#xD;
      where the prenatal growth of morphologic structures and their associated emerging behaviors&#xD;
      form key physiologic foundations necessary to sustain life at birth. The quality of&#xD;
      aerodigestive development is thus inextricably related to both the structural integrity of&#xD;
      its growing anatomy and the emergence of processes that promote aerodigestive functioning.&#xD;
      Our past research (NIH CC-00-99; NNMC #B99-089) focused specifically on emerging&#xD;
      oropharyngeal, and laryngeal movements of neonatal swallowing and phonation. Through&#xD;
      innovative sonographic techniques, this work documented ingestive development in the living&#xD;
      fetus; however, respiratory aspects were not explored. Intuitively, disruptions to the&#xD;
      fetal-maternal environment also influence respiratory development and, thus an arrest,&#xD;
      disorder, or delay in maturation of upper airway mechanisms may directly affect subsequent&#xD;
      postnatal respiratory function. Thus, the purposes of this protocol are to: 1) continue&#xD;
      exploration of human fetal development by elucidating the association between upper airway&#xD;
      growth and emerging prenatal respiratory function and, 2) determine identifiable patterns of&#xD;
      normal respiratory maturation that may provide indicators of postnatal airway performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initiative is based on the premise that amniotic fluid volumes are influenced by the&#xD;
      integrity of upper airway mechanisms and thus are important for aerodigestive-related&#xD;
      development and fetal well being. In a collaborative effort with National Naval Medical&#xD;
      Center, this project will use a novel standardized 4-axis sonographic examination to quantify&#xD;
      growth and respiratory-related fluid flow mechanics in the upper airway of the living human&#xD;
      fetus. The use of this noninvasive ultrasound technique as part of the clinical prenatal&#xD;
      examination will not only discriminate function at four upper airway sites (perinasal, oral,&#xD;
      pharyngeal, and tracheal), but provide estimates of amniotic fluid flow volumes,&#xD;
      inspiratory-expiratory fluid flow velocities and durations, and Doppler waveform patterns&#xD;
      associated with fetal breathing and ingestive processes. This provides a method from which we&#xD;
      can begin to explore how deviations in amniotic fluid regulation may be associated with&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality and, the predictive utility of these indices in understanding&#xD;
      conditions such as oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios. This germinal database will include&#xD;
      healthy fetuses 16.0 to 39.6 weeks' gestational age and cases with&#xD;
      polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios. By elucidating how developing structures integrate with&#xD;
      emerging upper respiratory behaviors, this work will document the maturational events&#xD;
      underlying normal function at birth that in turn may facilitate future clinical strategies&#xD;
      for successful postnatal care.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both normal controls and test cases will be openly recruited from referrals to the NNMC&#xD;
        PAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy mother's 18 years of age and over with uneventful, singleton pregnancies dated at&#xD;
        16.0 to 39.6 weeks gestation (based on last menstrual period) are the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mothers with pregnancies outside this dating and under 18 years of age are an exclusion&#xD;
