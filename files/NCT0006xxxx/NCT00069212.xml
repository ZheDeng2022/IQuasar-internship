      This study will evaluate brain changes and psychological characteristics of people who are&#xD;
      resilient to trauma. It will examine and compare responses in three categories of subjects:&#xD;
      1) people who have been exposed to a significant traumatic event and suffer symptoms of&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severe enough to interfere with their ability to&#xD;
      function; 2) people who have been exposed to a significant traumatic event and do not suffer&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms severe enough to interfere with their ability to function; and 3) people who&#xD;
      have never been exposed to a significant traumatic event. Most people who are exposed to&#xD;
      trauma recover well from the adversity. Some may even benefit from it by, for example,&#xD;
      gaining greater self-confidence of strengthening personal relationships. Others, however,&#xD;
      develop PTSD and may have repeated thoughts, images, and dreams of the trauma; feel upset&#xD;
      when reminded of the traumatic event; avoid places or people that remind them of the trauma;&#xD;
      feel detached from others; have difficulty sleeping and concentrating; or startle easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People in the three categories listed above may be eligible for this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with a medical and psychiatric interview, evaluation of emotional intelligence&#xD;
      (sensitivity to feelings of others), physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following additional tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection and three urine drug screens over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection every 2 hours on the day of the urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain: Subjects will have three MRI&#xD;
           scanning sessions to show brain structure and changes in blood flow in different regions&#xD;
           of the brain that are responsible for emotion. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and&#xD;
           radio waves to produce images of body tissues. During the scan, the subject lies on a&#xD;
           table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field and may wear earplugs to muffle&#xD;
           loud sounds that occur during the scanning process. While in the scanner, the subject is&#xD;
           shown pictures of faces, houses, or words and performs tasks that involve making&#xD;
           decisions about the pictures Subjects are also shown pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral&#xD;
           pictures; and they are asked to play two games of chance - one that evaluates social&#xD;
           cooperation; the other evaluating decision-making. Heart rate, blood pressure and&#xD;
           respiration are measured during the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing: These tests are designed to evaluate memory, learning,&#xD;
           attention and concentration, and naming.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aversive conditioning: This procedure examines how the body reacts to unpleasant&#xD;
           stimuli, such as a mildly unpleasant electrical stimulation to the wrist or a loud&#xD;
           sound, over time. During the test, heart rate, electrodermal activity (sweat),&#xD;
           respiration, finger pulse volume, and eyeblink responses will be measured. A small blood&#xD;
           sample will be drawn every 5 minutes to evaluate plasma levels of various stress&#xD;
           hormones, including cortisol, neuropeptide Y, norepinephrine, and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic and biological testing: Patients who agree to genetic testing will have a blood&#xD;
           sample drawn for DNA studies to better understand the biology and pharmacology of PTSD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since the majority of research studies in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have focused&#xD;
      on the pathological consequences of exposure to trauma, there is a paucity of information on&#xD;
      the psychobiology of subjects who are resilient to severe stress. The proposed study will&#xD;
      comprehensively evaluate the neural circuits that mediate fear, reward, social cooperation,&#xD;
      memory, and emotional regulation in traumatized men and women with and without PTSD and&#xD;
      healthy subjects. Subject groups will include prisoners of war, active duty special&#xD;
      operations forces, returning Iraqi veterans (approval pending), and men and women exposed to&#xD;
      non-combat traumas including sexual and or physical abuse. Comparison groups will include men&#xD;
      and women exposed to trauma without PTSD (resilient subjects), and healthy men and women who&#xD;
      have never been exposed to trauma. Changes in neural circuitry associated with resilience&#xD;
      will be evaluated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Relationships and&#xD;
      interactions among the neural circuits mediating fear, reward, social cooperation, memory,&#xD;
      and emotional regulation will be assessed and correlated with clinical, neuroendocrine, and&#xD;
      neuropsychological findings. Identification of biological and psychosocial correlates of&#xD;
      resilience could help predict illness vulnerability following exposure to trauma and could&#xD;
      assist in the selection of &quot;hardy&quot; subjects for high-risk professions.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give written informed consent prior to participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-Combat Veterans: Not currently on medications for PTSD or other medications that&#xD;
             would interfere with cognitive function. Patients will not be discontinued from&#xD;
             effective medication for purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combat Veterans: Some OIF/OEF veterans may not be medication free at the time of&#xD;
             scanning. However, they will meet criteria for PTSD according to DSM IV and meet a&#xD;
             severity score of greater than or equal to 50 on the CAPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be in good physical health as confirmed through the screening&#xD;
             session (under screening protocol 01-M-0254). If subjects participated in other&#xD;
             research studies or had blood work through their primary MD within the prior 6 months,&#xD;
             these results will be used instead of repeating blood draws for inclusion into the&#xD;
             study. Subjects with stable medical problems will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resilient subjects or trauma controls will be defined as those subjects who met&#xD;
             criteria for significant trauma according to &quot;A&quot; criteria for PTSD (DSM-IV) but did&#xD;
             not develop PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinically significant or unstable medical disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol and/or substance abuse or substance dependence within&#xD;
             6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently on fluoxetine (justification: washout from fluoxetine could take up to six&#xD;
             weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently at high risk for homicide or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A current or past history of other Axis 1 disorders such as schizophrenia,&#xD;
             schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder. However, those with a comorbid history of&#xD;
             other Axis 1 disorders such as major depression, dysthymia, or panic disorder will be&#xD;
             included. (Justification: approximately 70% of subjects with PTSD have comorbid&#xD;
             depression and or alcohol abuse (Breslau 2001). Restricting the sample to PTSD&#xD;
             patients without depression would not accurately reflect the biology of this&#xD;
             disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For WRMAC study: Have donated a Red Cross unit of blood within 60 days prior to study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
