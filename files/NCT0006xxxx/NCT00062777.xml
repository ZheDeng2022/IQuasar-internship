  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1948, residents of Framingham, Massachusetts, have participated in a program that&#xD;
      collects blood samples and clinical data to provide a rare and valuable database for&#xD;
      scientific research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to support this national resource by aiding in its research&#xD;
      capacity. Specifically, researchers in this study will (1) investigate heart, lung, and blood&#xD;
      diseases; stroke; memory loss; joint disease; bone loss; deafness; cancer; blood vessel&#xD;
      diseases and other health conditions, and (2) examine DNA and its relationship to risk of&#xD;
      developing these disease and health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 330 families have participated in the Framingham Study. Participants will be&#xD;
      required to undergo a four-hour exam and to take that exam every two years thereafter. During&#xD;
      the exam, the Framingham investigators will (1) interview participants about medical status,&#xD;
      health issues, and lifestyles; (2) perform a regular physical exam; (3) obtain blood and&#xD;
      urine samples and administer a glucose-tolerance test; (4) supervise a brisk six-minute&#xD;
      treadmill walk; (5) administer an ultrasound procedure; and (6) review and obtain copies of&#xD;
      medical and hospital records. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire at&#xD;
      home regarding dietary and health habits.&#xD;

      Many studies have shown that hematocrit (HCT) levels are associated with cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), peripheral vascular disease, as well as all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. Twin studies have shown that HCT variation is largely determined by genetic&#xD;
      factors with heritability estimated as 40% - 65%. So far, no linkage analysis in humans&#xD;
      between HCT and DNA markers have been reported. The purpose of this protocol is to identify&#xD;
      chromosome regions that contain quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in controlling HCT&#xD;
      levels. In the Framingham Study, a 10cM genome scan (about 400 markers) has been conducted in&#xD;
      330 families. HCT was measured in the original cohort and Framingham offspring. These data&#xD;
      provide us the opportunity to undertake linkage analyses using variance component method to&#xD;
      map quantitative trait loci (QTL) of HCT.&#xD;
