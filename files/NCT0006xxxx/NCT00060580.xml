  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ease and reliability of Raman scattering spectroscopy, a new&#xD;
      technique to measure the amount of the pigment lutein in the retina, the light-sensitive&#xD;
      tissue lining the back of the eye. The highest concentrations of lutein are in the center of&#xD;
      the retina, called the macula, which is the area most important for fine, detailed vision.&#xD;
      The functions of lutein are not fully known. Besides absorbing blue light, it may help&#xD;
      protect against abnormal changes in the retina, such as age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
      Until recently, lutein was measured using long, cumbersome, and difficult tests. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate a new instrument that provides faster measurements. It will be tested under&#xD;
      different conditions, such as wearing or not wearing glasses or contact lenses, or dilating&#xD;
      or not dilating the pupil of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 20 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study,&#xD;
      which involves two visits to the NIH Clinical Center, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination, including measurement of vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate), and examination of the head and neck,&#xD;
           heart and lungs, and arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, including eye chart test, eye pressure measurement, examination of&#xD;
           pupils and eye movements, and examination of the retina (back part of the eye) using a&#xD;
           strong light and magnifying lens after dilation of the pupils.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Raman scattering spectroscopy to measure lutein. For this test, the subject looks with&#xD;
           one eye at a brief, bright flash of bluish light (similar to a flashbulb light) from a&#xD;
           laser. This is repeated several times. Subjects who wear glasses or contact lenses for&#xD;
           distance vision will be tested without them and then again with a lens in front of the&#xD;
           eye. Subjects who do not wear glasses or contact lenses will be tested before and after&#xD;
           dilation of the pupil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast sensitivity to assess ability to identify an object from the background and to&#xD;
           see everyday objects. The subject looks at and identifies a variety of objects of&#xD;
           different shapes and sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Color vision to determine the ability to identify different shades of color. The subject&#xD;
           arranges a line of colorful discs, similar to checkers, in order of similar shades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Repeat Spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects return 1 week after the screening visit for a repeat Raman scattering spectroscopy&#xD;
      to evaluate the precision of the measurements.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the degree of variability in retinal&#xD;
      measurements of lutein, a carotenoid macular pigment of human retina in normal volunteers,&#xD;
      with a new and novel technique of resonant Raman scattering spectroscopy. This technique is&#xD;
      generally more objective than psychophysical techniques used for lutein measurements, such as&#xD;
      heterochromatic flicker photometry. Raman scattering spectroscopy is non-invasive and the&#xD;
      levels of ocular exposure to argon laser light used in this technique are well below the&#xD;
      safety limits recommended by the American National Standards Institute.&#xD;
