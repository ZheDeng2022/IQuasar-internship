  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to enhance the mother's role in promoting avoidance of sexual risks&#xD;
      and problem behaviors in 6- to 12-year-old children. Consenting mothers will attend a&#xD;
      10-session program designed to enhance the quality of mother-child communication, identify&#xD;
      sexual risks, and increase parental monitoring and self-efficacy.&#xD;

      This study will identify personal, parental, peer, and community factors that predispose&#xD;
      children ages 6 to 12 to early initiation of sexual behavior or that foster resilience to&#xD;
      sexual risk taking. The study will then evaluate an intervention designed to enhance&#xD;
      resilience factors and reduce risk factors among 6- to 12-year-old children. The study will&#xD;
      focus on the mother's role in promoting resilience to sexual risk taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first phase of the study, 300 children and their mothers will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a one-time interview that includes an assessment of risk and resilience factors. Information&#xD;
      from the interviews will be used to modify an intervention currently being used in another&#xD;
      study of parent-adolescent pairs. The modified intervention will then be tested to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of the intervention in reducing risk and enhancing resilience among children in&#xD;
      this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, 296 children and their mothers will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the intervention or control group. All mothers will complete a baseline interview. Mothers in&#xD;
      the intervention group will attend 10 group sessions that include short presentations,&#xD;
      discussions, media presentations (videotapes), and interactive exercises, including&#xD;
      self-assessments, role plays, and games. The group sessions include content and skill&#xD;
      development related to parenting, communication, sexuality, peer pressure, and school&#xD;
      involvement. Mothers in the control group receive written information on diet and physical&#xD;
      activity. The written materials are presented in a self-help format to increase physical&#xD;
      activity; a cookbook contains low fat recipes designed especially for African American men&#xD;
      and women living in the Atlanta, GA, area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants complete follow-up interviews at 6 and 12 months after the baseline&#xD;
      interview. Primary outcomes for mothers include measures of resilience and communication&#xD;
      related to sexual issues. For children, outcomes include measures related to possible sexual&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
