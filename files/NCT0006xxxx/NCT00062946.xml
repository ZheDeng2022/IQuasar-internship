  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure molecules on or in cells that interact with a&#xD;
      chemical in the nervous system, called dopamine. Investigators will obtain two kinds of&#xD;
      images of the brain-a position emission tomography (PET) scan and a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-eight participants aged 18 to 45 will be enrolled in this study. They must have no&#xD;
      history of medical or psychiatric illness, including substance abuse. Participants will have&#xD;
      four appointments at NIH. On the first visit, they will undergo a physical exam, a medical&#xD;
      history, and lab tests. The second and third visits will involve PET scans and the fourth&#xD;
      visit will involve an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be compensated up to $430 for their involvement in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abnormalities of dopaminergic function have been implicated in a number of neurological and&#xD;
      psychiatric illnesses, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and psychostimulant&#xD;
      dependence syndromes. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single&#xD;
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo&#xD;
      measurement of the distribution and the density of dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors in&#xD;
      humans. Besides simple measurement of receptor density, it has been shown that the&#xD;
      competition between endogenous neurotransmitters and radiolabeled tracers might provide a&#xD;
      tool to estimate extracellular levels of neurotransmitters. However, most of those studies&#xD;
      have been confined to the striatum. In this protocol using a PET tracer (18F)fallypride, we&#xD;
      will estimate both stimulant-induced DA release and baseline DA levels in the striatum and&#xD;
      extrastriatal regions by comparing baseline scans and those after d-amphetamine or&#xD;
      alpha-methyl-para-tryosine (AMPT) adminstration. In addition, to explore genetic factors that&#xD;
      determine synaptic DA levels, allelic variations of two genes that regulate DA levels,&#xD;
      catechol-O-methyltransferase and dopamine transporter, will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study showed that oral administration of d-amphetamine induced displacement of (11C)&#xD;
      raclopride in a similar way as the commonly used method of i.v. administration. The current&#xD;
      protocol will be performed in two steps. First, the method of d-amphetamine administration&#xD;
      will be determined by studying effects of oral d-amphetamine on the binding of (18F)&#xD;
      fallypride binding. If oral administration effectively displaces the radioligand binding,&#xD;
      this method will be applied in the subsequent study of examining effects of each of&#xD;
      d-amphetamine and AMPT in individual subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study successfully detects the influence of DA levels on (18F)fallypride binding, the&#xD;
      same design will be applied to the studies of patients with psychiatric and neurological&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
