      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent epidemiologic studies have found that living in socioeconomically disadvantaged&#xD;
      neighborhoods is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, even after controlling for measures of personal income, education, and occupation.&#xD;
      Although this suggests that features of neighborhoods may be relevant to cardiovascular risk,&#xD;
      important questions remain regarding whether the associations observed reflect causal&#xD;
      processes. Two important unresolved issues are the role of selection factors in generating&#xD;
      these associations and the need to identify the specific characteristics of neighborhoods&#xD;
      that are relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses publicly available and newly collected neighborhood data linked to the&#xD;
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to: (1) examine the relationship between&#xD;
      neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and the prevalence and progression of subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerosis; (2) examine associations of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics with&#xD;
      specific individual-level factors which may mediate neighborhood differences in disease risk;&#xD;
      (3) develop measures of specific characteristics of neighborhood environments (such as&#xD;
      measures of resource availability, neighborhood social cohesion and neighborhood stress) and&#xD;
      examine their relation to selected individual-level risk factors; (4) determine if these&#xD;
      specific neighborhood characteristics explain differences in cardiovascular risk between&#xD;
      socioeconomically advantaged and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; and (5)&#xD;
      examine if neighborhood characteristics contribute to race/ethnic differences in&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. Measures of neighborhood attributes will be based on Year 2000 Census&#xD;
      data, surveys of area residents, and the use of GIS methods to link data on area resources to&#xD;
      MESA neighborhoods. The examination of subclinical disease as outcomes avoids problems&#xD;
      related to selection of persons into neighborhoods based on their health status. The project&#xD;
      will use two innovative approaches (residential surveys and ecometric techniques and&#xD;
      GIS-based methods) to develop direct measures of specific neighborhood attributes in order to&#xD;
      test their relationship to disease risk. Confirming that specific features of neighborhoods&#xD;
      are causally related to disease would have important implications for prevention.&#xD;
