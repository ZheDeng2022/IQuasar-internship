  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various forms of the plant extract Tripterygium wilfordi Hook F (TwHF) have been used in&#xD;
      China as a remedy for inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate how tolerable, safe, and effective TwHF is for patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. Investigators will compare the therapeutic effects of TwHF with&#xD;
      Sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved drug for arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this 24-week study must have had active rheumatoid arthritis for at least six&#xD;
      months. Approximately 120 patients will participate. Participants will be assigned to one of&#xD;
      two drug-treatment groups, TwHF or Sulfasalazine. They will be given the study drug at each&#xD;
      of six clinic visits and will be asked to take two capsules three times each day with meals&#xD;
      and water. During the clinic visits, investigators will obtain multiple blood samples; give&#xD;
      physical exams; assess swollen, tender, and painful joints; and administer x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be compensated up to $260 for their involvement in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, active treatment controlled phase II study in patients&#xD;
      with either new onset or therapy resistant rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will be&#xD;
      conducted at 7 sites with NIAMS being the coordinating center and 6 external centers.&#xD;
      Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is a traditional medicinal plant that is and has been&#xD;
      used in China for many years to treat inflammatory conditions including RA. This study we&#xD;
      will be testing if a standardized plant extract from the roots of TwHF is superior to&#xD;
      Sulfasalazine in improving the signs and symptoms in subjects with RA, as assessed by the ACR&#xD;
      20 criteria. Those subjects, who qualify for the study, will be allowed to continue on stable&#xD;
      doses of NSAID therapy and/or low dose corticosteroids but will discontinue any DMARDs, or&#xD;
      biologicals prior to the start of the study. Study subjects will then be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either TwHF or Sulfasalazine and subjects will remain on double blind medication for&#xD;
      24 weeks. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter using a&#xD;
      standardized joint exam, questionnaires and laboratory measures for inflammation. ACR 20&#xD;
      responses will be calculated at each visit and compared in both groups at the end of&#xD;
      evaluation at 24 weeks. Safety will be monitored throughout the trial. This is the first&#xD;
      study that compares the extract of TwHF to a currently used DMARD in treating patients with&#xD;
      RA and will help to define the role of new anti-inflammatory and possibly disease modifying&#xD;
      agents in treating patients with RA.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and female outpatients between 18 and 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females must be of non-childbearing potential (post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or&#xD;
        post hysterectomy) or using a double-barrier method of birth control for the duration of&#xD;
        the study. A protocol acceptable method of double barrier method of birth control includes&#xD;
        any combination of two or three of the following: condom, spermicidal and diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Documented diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis of at least six (6) months duration, as&#xD;
        defined by the American Rheumatism Association 1987 Revised Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        American Rheumatism Association Functional Class I, II, or III&#xD;
&#xD;
        Meet the criteria for (active disease) at both screening and baseline visits by achieving&#xD;
        all of the criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6 or more painful/tender joints&#xD;
&#xD;
        6 or more swollen joints&#xD;
&#xD;
        Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain of at least 3 (on scale of 1-10, where 1 is mild)&#xD;
&#xD;
        C-reactive protein (CRP) greater than or equal to 0.6 mg/dl or ESR greater than 25 mm/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior/Current Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Subjects must be either DMARD or biological anti-RA agent naive or have failed a&#xD;
        DMARD/biological RA agent, other than sulfasalazine, and have stopped this DMARD/biological&#xD;
        one (1) month prior to randomization unless they have a flare in disease activity upon&#xD;
        discontinuing DMARD/biological therapy as part of this protocol. DMARDs include but are not&#xD;
        limited to methotrexate, leflunomide, minocycline, hydroxychloroquine, gold, cyclosporine,&#xD;
        and biologics include anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Subjects may be taking NSAIDs, provided the dose and frequency have been stable for 30&#xD;
        days prior to randomization. However if the patient meets the flare criteria they can be&#xD;
        enrolled even if they have not fulfilled the criteria of being on a stable dose of NSAIDs&#xD;
        and steroids for 30 days prior to randomization. At the time of flare neither steroids nor&#xD;
        NSAIDs can be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;

        study. Note section 9.3 of the protocol, Concomitant Medication, has been amended to read:&#xD;
        If it is medically necessary a one joint steroid injection is acceptable. This must be&#xD;
        noted on the CRF and the joint excluded from the joint count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Subjects may not be taking other complementary and/or alternative medications for RA for&#xD;
        the last 1-month prior to randomization.&#xD;
