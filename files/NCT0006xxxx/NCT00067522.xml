      Prevention of unplanned pregnancies among HIV infected couples decreases the rate of&#xD;
      maternal-child virus transmission and the number of children orphaned when parents die of&#xD;
      AIDS. This study will evaluate two programs for reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies&#xD;
      among HIV infected couples in Zambia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty percent of the world's HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa. In Lusaka, the&#xD;
      capital of Zambia, 85% of pregnant women are married and 47% are in couples with at least one&#xD;
      HIV infected partner (26% concordant positive, 21% discordant). It will be years before&#xD;
      short-course antivirals are widely implemented, and many children who escape infection will&#xD;
      be left orphaned. There are 360,000 AIDS orphans in Zambia, a country of 9 million people,&#xD;
      and 35,000 HIV infected women deliver each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An essential component of any HIV prevention strategy must include the prevention of&#xD;
      unplanned pregnancies among couples with HIV. Promotion of 'dual method' contraception&#xD;
      (condoms for HIV/STD prevention plus a longer acting method for pregnancy prevention) is&#xD;
      ideal, but unfortunately not widely promoted. Ultimately, the prevention of unplanned&#xD;
      pregnancy in couples with HIV can reduce pediatric HIV, AIDS orphans, and the family&#xD;
      consequences of parental illness and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate two interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of unplanned&#xD;
      pregnancies in HIV infected couples. The first intervention will promote more effective&#xD;
      contraception by placing user-independent methods (IUD and Norplant) first in the educational&#xD;
      message hierarchy (currently, family planning education highlights oral contraceptives) and&#xD;
      employing positive message framing. The second intervention will help couples plan for the&#xD;
      consequences of their illness and death. This will include assisting couples to work together&#xD;
      to prepare a will, choose a guardian, and make a financial plan. By focusing on the cost of&#xD;
      educating existing children and on the need to plan for their future care, couples are&#xD;
      encouraged to reflect on the implications of future childbearing. The interventions will be&#xD;
      compared with a standard family planning program with respect to impact on incident&#xD;
      pregnancy, contraceptive choice and pattern of use, psychosocial and behavioral variables,&#xD;
      and future planning actions. Cost-effectiveness will be determined with methods developed&#xD;
      jointly by experts in the fields of HIV therapy in Africa and contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomized to either the user-independent contraception&#xD;
      intervention, the future planning intervention, the contraception plus planning intervention,&#xD;
      or the standard family planning control. Couples will be followed for 1 to 4 years. Women&#xD;
      will have study visits every 3 months; men will have a study visit every year. The primary&#xD;
      study outcome will be comparison of time to pregnancy across intervention groups.&#xD;
