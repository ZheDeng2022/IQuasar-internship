      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine and compare changes in blood&#xD;
      flow and blood volume in the brains of normal volunteers and patients with multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS). Patients with MS-an inflammatory disease that attacks the brain and spine-may have new&#xD;
      blood vessel formation (called angiogenesis) within the brain that may or may not contribute&#xD;
      to the disease or help in repairing the brain. It is not known if these new vessels behave in&#xD;
      the same way as the naturally occurring vessels. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio&#xD;
      waves to generate brain images that provide information on brain chemistry, function, and&#xD;
      blood flow. The results of this study may lead to a better understanding of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with multiple sclerosis 18 years of age and older may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Normal volunteers must have no history of signs or symptoms of&#xD;
      central nervous system disease. Patients with MS will be recruited from the NIH&#xD;
      Neuroimmunology MS clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo MRI. For this procedure, the subject lies still on a table that&#xD;
      slides into a narrow metal cylinder (the MRI scanner). Scanning varies from 20 minutes to 3&#xD;
      hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan, the subject wears&#xD;
      earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises caused by electrical switching of the radio frequency&#xD;
      circuits. The subject can communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the scan, the subject wears a mask and breathes in room air or air containing 6%&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (CO2). (Room air contains approximately 0.04% CO2, which is about 150 times&#xD;
      less than the 6% CO2. Air that is normally breathed out contains about 5% CO2.) Breathing 6%&#xD;
      CO2 increases the amount of blood flow in the brain that can be measured using MRI. The total&#xD;
      duration of a single 6 percent CO2 inhalation will not exceed 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A catheter (thin plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the subject's arm before he or she&#xD;
      enters the scanner. At some point during the scan, a contrast agent called gadolinium DTPA is&#xD;
      injected into the vein through the catheter. This agent enables clearer images of the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in MR perfusion imaging have provided clinical researchers with the opportunity to&#xD;
      quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). Recently, new vessel proliferation and formation&#xD;
      (angiogenesis) has been observed in autopsy and biopsy specimens from patients with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS). Newly formed MS lesions, showed strikingly increased numbers of new vessels&#xD;
      and similar patterns were observed in and around older lesions, areas of remyelination (new&#xD;
      myelin formation on axons, shadow plaques) and normal-appearing brain tissue. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to compare CBF of MS patients, to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. CBF&#xD;
      will be measured while subjects are inhaling room air and the increase in CBF while inhaling&#xD;
      a mixture of room air and a known concentration of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) will be&#xD;
      compared. If significant new vessels growth has occurred in the brains of MS patients then&#xD;
      this new vessel formation (neovascularization) may be reflected by a change in CBF. Comparing&#xD;
      the CBF response to hypercapnia will determine if the newly formed vasculature includes&#xD;
      properly functioning blood vessels. Normal cerebral blood vessels are exquisitely sensitive&#xD;
      to the carbon dioxide in arterial blood and an increase in carbon dioxide causes CBF to&#xD;
      increase through dilatation or relaxation of the muscles surrounding the blood vessels. In&#xD;
      the future, changes in the hypercapnia-induced CBF response between MS patients and controls&#xD;
      may help to monitor the treatment of the disease.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (NORMAL VOLUNTEERS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any healthy volunteer above the age of 18 who is capable of giving informed consent&#xD;
        recruited or self referred through the NIH Volunteer office will be eligible for this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All healthy normal volunteers will be required to fill out the questionnaire in Appendix B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers will be included as long as they have no recorded or documented signs or&#xD;
        symptoms of CNS disease, contraindications to an MRI and have a 'normal age-appropriate'&#xD;
        MRI of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients seen in the Neuroimmunology MS clinic with a confirmed diagnosis of Multiple&#xD;
        Sclerosis based upon previous history of two clinical neurological attacks separated in&#xD;
        time and in spatial location or combination of Clinical and MRI findings of a single&#xD;
        enhancing lesion in the brain or spine along with multiple T2 hyperintensities in the&#xD;
        juxtacortical, periventricular or infratentorial white matter according to the McDonald&#xD;
        criteria will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who have had more than one relapse within&#xD;
        18 months preceding study enrollment will be recruited from the MS 7th floor clinic in the&#xD;
        NINDS at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MS patients EDSS score between 1.0 - 6.5, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Give written informed consent prior to any testing under this protocol, including&#xD;
        screening/pre-treatment tests and evaluations that are not considered part of the patient's&#xD;
        routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Controls and MS patients will be excluded if they have contraindications to MR&#xD;
        scanning, such as the following:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. brain stimulators&#xD;
&#xD;

             fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware. You will be screened for these&#xD;
             conditions prior to the study, and if you have any of these conditions, you will not&#xD;
             receive an MRI scan. If you have a question about any metal objects being present in&#xD;
             your body, you should inform the physician.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subjects who have a history of a reaction to MR contrast agents specifically&#xD;
             gadopentetate dimeglumine will be excluded from participating in the contrast agent&#xD;
             administration part of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects will also be excluded from the study if they are presently taking&#xD;
             indomethacin or acetazolamide which effects the carbonic anhydrase system of&#xD;
