  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some voice disorders are caused by uncontrolled muscle actions that affect the larynx or&#xD;
      voice box.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to understand 1) how the brain controls voice production; 2) how&#xD;
      changes in sensation within the voice box affect brain control of the voice box; 3) how the&#xD;
      central nervous system is affected when people have motor or sensory abnormalities that&#xD;
      affect the voice box; and 4) whether patients with voice disorders differ from people without&#xD;
      voice disorders in the way the brain controls the voice box. By better understanding these&#xD;
      concepts, researchers hope to develop improved treatments for patients with voice disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-five healthy adult volunteers and 90 patients with voice disorders will participate in&#xD;
      this study. Participants must be between the ages of 20 and 70. The study will involve two&#xD;
      visits to the Clinical Center. During the first visit, participants will undergo a medical&#xD;
      history and physical exam. During the second visit, investigators will perform the following&#xD;
      procedures on study participants: 1) look at the voice box with a nasolaryngoscope, a fine&#xD;
      tube through the nose; 2) use MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] to record brain activity while&#xD;
      participants use their voice to speak; 3) changing sensation in the voice box by dripping a&#xD;
      topical anesthetic onto the vocal folds; and 4) using MRI to again record brain activity&#xD;
      during speech immediately after applying the topical anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive up to $700 in compensation for their involvement in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The neural organization of laryngeal motor and somatosensory function will be investigated in&#xD;
      adults with idiopathic voice disorders using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Brain&#xD;
      activation will be compared in normal volunteers and patients with spasmodic dysphonia (SD),&#xD;
      muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) and vocal tremor. While each voice disorder is characterized&#xD;
      by strained vocalization, the disorders are distinguished by other differences in voice&#xD;
      symptoms. Accordingly, the brain correlates of vocalization in these disorders may both&#xD;
      differ from each other and that of normal vocal function. Because sensory feedback has been&#xD;
      identified as a factor in SD, the role of afferent input in vocalization will be investigated&#xD;
      by comparing brain activation before and after topical anesthesia of the laryngeal mucosa.&#xD;
      The afferent blockade is expected to significantly suppress dysphonic symptoms in SD patients&#xD;
      for the duration of the block. The change in symptomatology may be associated with a&#xD;
      temporary but significant change in central sensorimotor patterns in these patients. The&#xD;
      block is not expected to alter MTD, vocal tremor or normal vocal function. The brain&#xD;
      activation changes that accompany symptom relief in SD patients will determine alterations in&#xD;
      central neural control that have a role in symptom generation in SD. Identifying these&#xD;
      differences in central sensorimotor control between the disorders will provide insight into&#xD;
      their differences in pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if emotional vocalization and linguistic vocalization involve different&#xD;
           cortical and sub-cortical functional networks in normal adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if only the brain activation network active for linguistic vocalization&#xD;
           network differs between normal controls and dysphonia patients during equivalent voice&#xD;
           production effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if patients with dysphonia differ from controls during the performance of&#xD;
           non-vocal laryngeal gestures when patients are asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if a reduction in sensation during topical anesthesia alters linguistic&#xD;
           vocalization in dysphonia but not in controls.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for normal volunteers are normal vocal function and average health&#xD;
        as determined by the staff otolaryngologist. Normal vocal function refers to normal voice&#xD;
        quality, a negative history for voice or laryngeal disorders. Persons with significant&#xD;
        pulmonary, neurological and psychiatric function will not be recruited. The primary&#xD;
        inclusion criteria for the voice disordered groups are a current diagnosis of spasmodic&#xD;
        dysphonia (abductor or adductor type), muscular tension dysphonia or voice tremor. These&#xD;
        persons will not have pulmonary, neurological or psychiatric disorders or exclusion&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - for Patients with Spasmodic Dysphonia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intermittent strained hoarseness, uncontrolled voice breaks or changes in pitch are present&#xD;
        during vowels, liquids (r &amp; l) and semi-vowels (w &amp; y), during speech for adductor SD or&#xD;
        prolonged voiceless consonants producing breathy breaks for abductor SD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Less prominent symptoms during whisper, singing or falsetto,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal voice and vocal fold movement for protective and emotional laryngeal function, such&#xD;
        as cough, laugh or cry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        A diagnosis of adductor or adductor spasmodic dysphonia based on voice testing and&#xD;
        fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy by a board certified otolaryngologist and Speech-Language&#xD;

        palpation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        A consistent hypertonic laryngeal posture for phonation, such as either an&#xD;
        anterior-posterior squeeze (pin-hole posture) or ventricular hyper adduction and an absence&#xD;
