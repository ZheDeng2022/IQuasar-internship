  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of and immune response to a new HIV vaccine. The vaccine&#xD;
      in this trial uses pieces of HIV DNA and HIV proteins. The vaccine itself cannot cause HIV&#xD;
      infection or AIDS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unlike other viruses for which effective vaccines have been developed, HIV-1 has evolved&#xD;
      mechanisms to evade immune control over virus replication. These mechanisms include the&#xD;
      extraordinary genetic diversity of the virus, viral latency, and targeting of the immune&#xD;
      system. Evolutional variations of the envelope gene have not only resulted in the development&#xD;
      of different groups (M, N, and O) and subgroups (clades) in diverse geographic regions of the&#xD;
      world, but also significant genomic variations within clades. These clade variants of HIV&#xD;
      will require novel vaccine approaches to elicit population-based protective immunity. Viral&#xD;
      latency is the ability of the virus to remain dormant for long periods through integrating&#xD;
      its viral DNA into the host genome. Viral latency requires vaccines to produce immune&#xD;
      response that are robust enough to kill the virus and that can be maintained over extended&#xD;
      periods of time to produce lasting immunity. Finally, HIV-1 targets CD4 cells and thus&#xD;
      compromises the immune surveillance mechanisms critical to maintaining both cellular and&#xD;
      humoral immunity to HIV-1. Therefore, an effective vaccine against HIV-1 must bolster the&#xD;
      development of broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies against genetic variants of HIV-1, as&#xD;
      well as induce an effective HIV-specific CTL response to eliminate virus-infected cells. The&#xD;
      ideal vaccine approach will produce long-term responses within these arms of host immunity.&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a novel&#xD;
      prophylactic vaccine consisting of DNA priming followed by a protein boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first vaccine component administered in this study is a DNA vaccination; the second&#xD;
      component is a recombinant protein vaccination. This combination will be used to determine&#xD;
      whether the vaccine strategy can induce a balanced humoral and cell mediated immune responses&#xD;
      to HIV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two HIV antigens, Gag and Env, are included in this study's vaccine formulation. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that HIV-1 Gag is a potent inducer of cell mediated immune responses, while Env is the&#xD;
      target of neutralizing antibody responses. The vaccine used in this study contains a 5-valent&#xD;
      Env design (Env derived from one of 5 clades of HIV) in order to examine if a polyvalent Env&#xD;
      formulation may expand the breadth of neutralizing antibody responses induced in human&#xD;
      volunteers. For both DNA priming and protein boosting, a set of Env antigens from clades A,&#xD;
      B, C, and E of HIV-1 M group will be produced (2 Env antigens from clade B and 1 Env each&#xD;
      from the other three clades). All 5 Env antigens are selected from the primary HIV-1 viral&#xD;
      isolates with the hope of producing broad antibody responses against the primary viruses&#xD;
      circulating in the worldwide human population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six healthy volunteers will be randomized to one of five groups. Groups 1, 2, and 3&#xD;
      will receive different doses of the vaccine to determine the optimal dose. Groups 4 and 5&#xD;
      will receive the vaccine through either intradermal or intramuscular administration. Each&#xD;
      group will receive 3 doses of DNA vaccination at weeks 0, 4, and 12, and 2 doses of protein&#xD;
      vaccination at weeks 20 and 28. Blood sampling throughout the duration of the study will&#xD;
      provide an assessment of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      It is expected that volunteers will be enrolled in this study for 1 year.&#xD;
