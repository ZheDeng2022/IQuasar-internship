      No universally successful therapy exists that promotes recovery of motor function after a&#xD;
      stroke, the main cause of long-term disability among adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop strategies to improve recovery of lost motor&#xD;
      function. It will combine motor skills training with a brain-stimulating technique called&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers and adult stroke patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will come to NIH for a clinical and neurological exam, and, if necessary, an MRI&#xD;
      [magnetic resonance imaging] examination. Participants will return for 4 sessions; each&#xD;
      lasting approximately 3 hours. The first will be a practice session during which participants&#xD;
      will become familiar with the motor skills required of them in this study, such as performing&#xD;
      finger movements on a keyboard, pinching, tapping, making wrist movements, and lifting small&#xD;
      items. In sessions 2 and 3, participants will perform the motor skills they practiced in&#xD;
      session 1 while receiving tDCS. During session 4, they will receive tDCS only, with no&#xD;
      performance of motor skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During tDCS, investigators will place electrodes with a gel on participants' heads and pass&#xD;
      the tDCS current between these two electrodes. tDCS is a painless procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive up to $420 in compensation for their involvement in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is no universally accepted strategy to promote recovery of motor function after chronic&#xD;
      stroke, the main cause of long-term disability among adults. It is desirable to develop&#xD;
      strategies to accelerate motor learning in this patient group. Previous studies in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers demonstrated that cortical stimulation in association with training leads to&#xD;
      improvements of motor learning and use-dependent plasticity. The purpose of this protocol is&#xD;
      to apply a painless stimulation technique to the motor cortex of the affected hemisphere of&#xD;
      patients with subcortical stroke (transcranial DC stimulation, tDCS) to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that tDCS of the motor cortex of the affected hemisphere in association with motor training&#xD;
      will improve motor learning of a finger sequence in the paretic hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that the unaffected hemisphere exerts&#xD;
      abnormally high inhibitory influence over the affected hemisphere. This abnormality might&#xD;
      adversely influence motor recovery. Therefore a further purpose of the study is to apply tDCS&#xD;
      to the unaffected hemisphere to test the hypothesis that reduction of the inhibitory&#xD;
      influence of the unaffected hemisphere over the affected in association with motor training&#xD;
      will improve motor learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has been so far applied in several hundred subjects worldwide in the absence&#xD;
      of undesirable side effects reported to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study patients with chronic strokes and healthy age- and gender matched normal&#xD;
      volunteers. Primary outcome measure will be the number of correct keyboard piano sequences&#xD;
      played in a specific time-period (30 seconds). Secondary outcome measures are speed of&#xD;
      tapping with only one finger; simple reaction times; pinch force; and a functional measure of&#xD;
      activities of daily life (ADL): Jebsen-Tailor-Test. To better understand the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the proposed behavioral gains, we will use TMS to identify changes in corticomotor&#xD;
      excitability.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will include patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions at least 3&#xD;
        months after the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will choose Patients who initially had a severe motor paresis (below MRC grade 2), which&#xD;
        subsequently recovered to the point that they have a residual motor deficit but can perform&#xD;
        the required tasks. Assessment of the initial functional state will be taken either from&#xD;
        patient report or medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As the control group, we will include age- and gender matched Normal Volunteers with&#xD;
        matched non-dominant/dominant hand (to the affected hand of the stroke patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with more than one stroke in the medical cerebral artery territory.&#xD;
&#xD;

        MRC grade 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or Normal Volunteers with severe alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric illness like&#xD;
        severe depression, poor motivational capacity, or severe language disturbances,&#xD;
