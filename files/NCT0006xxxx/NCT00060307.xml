  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic papillary renal cell (kidney) cancer. Erlotinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response (confirmed complete and partial response) of patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic papillary histology renal cell cancer treated with OSI-774.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the overall survival and 6-month probability of treatment failure of this group&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen. IV. To&#xD;
      investigate in a preliminary manner the association of tumor response with tumor expression&#xD;
      of epidermal growth factor receptor and status of von Hippel Lindau gene mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-20&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed papillary histology renal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma which is metastatic (M1); patients with unresectable primary tumor (but&#xD;
             M0) are also eligible; patients who have undergone a prior nephrectomy should have&#xD;
             histologic confirmation of the metastatic nature of at least one distant site of&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have available and be willing to submit representative slides for&#xD;
             central pathology review; these must be sent within 28 days of registration; failure&#xD;
             to submit these materials will make the patient ineligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension; soft tissue disease that has been&#xD;
             radiated in the 2 months prior to registration is not assessable as measurable&#xD;
             disease; soft tissue disease within a prior radiation field that was radiated greater&#xD;
             than 2 months prior to registration must have progressed to be considered assessable,&#xD;
             and patients also must have measurable disease outside of the irradiated field;&#xD;
             X-rays, scans or physical examinations used for tumor measurement must have been&#xD;
             completed within 28 days prior to registration; X-rays, scans or physical examinations&#xD;
             for non-measurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior to&#xD;
             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic disease who have a resectable primary tumor and are deemed a&#xD;
             surgical candidate may have undergone resection and have recovered from surgery; at&#xD;
             least 28 days must have elapsed since surgery and patient must have recovered from any&#xD;
             adverse effects of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of brain metastases or who currently have treated or untreated&#xD;
             brain metastases are not eligible; patients with clinical evidence of brain metastases&#xD;
             must have a brain CT or MRI negative for metastatic disease within 56 days prior to&#xD;
             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have available and be willing to submit archived tumor tissue that will&#xD;
             yield sixteen 5 micron unstained slides for molecular correlative studies related to&#xD;
             the EGFR and vHL pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior radiation therapy, but must have measurable disease&#xD;
             outside the radiation port; at least 21 days must have elapsed since completion of&#xD;
             prior radiation therapy; patients must have recovered from all associated toxicities&#xD;
             at the time of registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0 - 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WBC ≥ 3,000/μl obtained within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC ≥ 1,500/μl obtained within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μl obtained within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limits of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum transaminase (SGOT or SGPT) must be ≤ 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal unless the liver is involved with the tumor, in which case serum transaminase&#xD;
             (SGOT or SGPT) must be ≤ 5 x the institutional upper limit of normal; these tests must&#xD;
             be obtained within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine must be ≤ 2 X the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known history of the following corneal diseases are not eligible: dry&#xD;
             eye syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, exposure keratopathy,&#xD;
             Fuch's dystrophy or other active disorders of cornea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be HIV-positive and receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy&#xD;
             are not eligible due to possible pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-774&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to&#xD;
             take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures&#xD;
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease; patients must either be able to&#xD;
             swallow and/or receive enteral medications via gastrostomy feeding tube; patients with&#xD;
             intractable nausea or vomiting are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate on this study because OSI-774 is an&#xD;
             epidermal growth factor inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects based on the data suggesting that EGFR expression is important for normal&#xD;
             organ development; there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with OSI-774; women/men of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated&#xD;
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any&#xD;
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If day 14, 21, 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to&#xD;
             the next working day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or&#xD;
             measurement is done is considered to be day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a&#xD;
             Monday, the Monday two weeks later would be considered day 14; this allows for&#xD;
             efficient patient scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xD;
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the&#xD;
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study&#xD;
             has been entered into the data base&#xD;
