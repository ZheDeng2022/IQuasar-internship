      This study will use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to study brain&#xD;
      nicotine receptors (proteins on the surface of brain cells) in healthy subjects and in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia. Autopsy findings in patients with schizophrenia show changes in&#xD;
      their nicotine receptors. This study will use SPECT to look at these receptors in living&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients and compare them with those in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following individuals between 21 and 50 years of age (or between 21 and 80 years of age&#xD;
      for Group 1 only) are eligible for this study: healthy non-smokers (Group 1); schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients who smoke (Group 2); schizophrenia patients who do not smoke (Group 3); healthy&#xD;
      smokers (Group 4); healthy non-smokers (Group 5). Patients with schizophrenia must be taking&#xD;
      olanzapine (Zyprexa) or risperidone (Risperdal) for at least 6 months. All candidates will be&#xD;
      screened at the first visit. Group 1 participants will have three more visits; Groups 2&#xD;
      through 5 will have two more visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened with physical and neurological examinations; blood and&#xD;
      urine tests; and neuropsychological tests to assess their ability to learn and remember words&#xD;
      and numbers, to pay attention, and to quickly perform motor tasks, such as putting pegs into&#xD;
      a piece of wood. In addition, they will have an eye movement test and event-related potential&#xD;
      testing. For the eye test, the subject sits in a chair and leans forward with the chin on a&#xD;
      chin rest. A band is tied around the head and very small amounts of invisible (infrared)&#xD;
      light are shined into the eyes. The light is reflected back and measured. Wire electrodes are&#xD;
      placed around the area of the eye and cheek to monitor eye blinks and eye movements. Subjects&#xD;
      are asked to follow a light with their eyes and to look away from a light. For event- related&#xD;
      potential testing, electrodes are placed on the scalp, forehead and cheeks, and brain&#xD;
      activity is recorded while the subject identifies particular pictures and sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (and Visit 3 for Group 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a SPECT scan. On the night before the scan, the day of the scan, and&#xD;
      for 4 days after the scan, subject take an oral dose of potassium iodide to protect the&#xD;
      thyroid gland from the radioactive tracer used in the SPECT procedure. (Individuals allergic&#xD;
      to potassium iodide will take potassium perchlorate instead.) For the SPECT scan, small&#xD;
      radioactive markers containing 99mTc are glued to the subject's head. Two catheters (thin,&#xD;
      flexible tubes) are placed in veins in the arms to inject the radioactive tracer&#xD;
      [123I]5-I-A-85380 and to draw blood samples. During the scan, the subject lies on a bed with&#xD;
      his or her head held still with a headholder. The scans are taken over a 9-hour period after&#xD;
      injection of the tracer injection. An electrocardiogram, respiration, and blood pressure&#xD;
      measures are taken before injection of [123I]5-I-A-85380, then 5 minutes after the injection,&#xD;
      and again 30 to 60 minutes after the injection. Breath samples are collected every 60&#xD;
      minutes. Blood and urine samples are collected 5 to 6 hours after starting the scan. Group 1&#xD;
      subjects will have a second SPECT scan within 4 weeks of the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Visit 4 for Group 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. For this procedure, the&#xD;
      subject lies on a table that slides into a narrow metal cylinder with a strong magnetic field&#xD;
      for the scan. The scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images that show&#xD;
      structural and chemical changes in tissues. The test lasts up to 1 hour.&#xD;

      Abnormalities of nicotinic acetylcholine system in schizophrenia are implied by the high&#xD;
      prevalence of cigarette smoking. Because animal and human studies have shown that nicotinic&#xD;
      acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in cognitive function, cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in schizophrenia also suggest abnormalities in these receptors. Postmortem studies&#xD;
      showed abnormalities in high affinity nAChRs in these patients but the direction of the&#xD;
      abnormalities (increase or decrease) were not consistent probably because it is difficult to&#xD;
      control the effects of cigarette smoking and neuroleptics in such studies. In vivo imaging&#xD;
      studies are necessary to study relationship between nAChRs and psychiatric symptoms including&#xD;
      cognitive impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use a new single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer,&#xD;
      [(123)I]5-I-A-85380, which appears suitable for imaging the high affinity Alpha 4 Beta 2&#xD;
      subtype of nAChRs. We plan to compare four groups, 1) schizophrenia smokers, 2) schizophrenia&#xD;
      non-smokers, 3) healthy smokers, and 4) healthy non-smokers. All patients will be on stable&#xD;
      doses of olanzapine or risperidone. In addition to comparing [(123)I]5-I-A-85380 binding&#xD;
      among these groups, relationship will be studied between psychiatric symptoms or cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction and the SPECT measurement of the receptors. Further, to study the reliability of&#xD;
      the SPECT measurement, a test retest study will be preformed in healthy subjects with a wide&#xD;
      range. The proposed study will explore the roles of nAChRs in the psychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
      particularly the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which is the central impairment of this&#xD;
      disorder. New findings in this research will lead to enhanced treatment of the cognitive&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;
