  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BufferGel is a new contraceptive gel designed to be used with a diaphragm. In addition to&#xD;
      preventing pregnancy, BufferGel may also prevent some types of sexually transmitted diseases&#xD;
      (STDs). This study will compare BufferGel to Gynol II, a currently available contraceptive&#xD;
      gel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal acidity is thought to be one means by which the vagina prevents overgrowth or&#xD;
      colonization by harmful microbial flora. Sperm and many STD pathogens, including HSV-1 and&#xD;
      HSV-2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, Haemophilus ducreyi, and a variety of&#xD;
      bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, are inactivated at pH less than 5 in vitro.&#xD;
      BufferGel, a vaginal spermicide and microbicide, is an acidic buffer that maintains the&#xD;
      vagina at or near its natural state of mild acidity. Formulated at vaginal pH (pH 3.9),&#xD;
      BufferGel prevents or limits the semen-induced rise in vaginal pH. Carbopol 974P, the&#xD;
      buffering agent in BufferGel, is a high molecular weight, cross-linked, polyacrylic acid used&#xD;
      as a gelling or tableting agent in many pharmaceuticals; it has a well-documented record of&#xD;
      mucosal safety in animals and humans. This study will determine the safety and contraceptive&#xD;
      efficacy of BufferGel spermicide used with a diaphragm compared to Gynol II spermicide used&#xD;
      with a diaphragm. The study will also measure the frequency of bacterial vaginosis, urinary&#xD;
      tract infections, and cervical lesions in women using BufferGel compared with Gynol II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be fitted for a diaphragm and randomized to receive either&#xD;
      BufferGel or Gynol II. All participants will be instructed on the use of the test product&#xD;
      with the diaphragm. Participants will be followed through 6 menstrual cycles (approximately 7&#xD;
      months) and will have 4 study visits and one study phone call. Some participants may enroll&#xD;
      in an extended version of the study and be followed for an additional 6 cycles and 2&#xD;
      additional study visits. Study visits will include a gynecologic exam, Pap smear, and blood&#xD;
      and urine tests. Participants will be asked to keep a diary to record information on product&#xD;
      use. Some participants may also be asked to enroll in a colposcopy substudy. These&#xD;
      participants will undergo colposcopy at study entry and after cycles 1, 3 and 6.&#xD;
