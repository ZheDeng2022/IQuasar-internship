  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective memory (PM) is memory to complete future tasks, such as recalling to give a note&#xD;
      to someone when you next see them, pick up milk on the way home, or remembering to keep an&#xD;
      appointment. This study will evaluate PM in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While much has been learned about how children with TBIs learn and recall stories, word&#xD;
      lists, and pictures, little is known about how they perform PM tasks. Impairment in PM could&#xD;
      have serious implications for academic and vocational pursuits. This study will investigate&#xD;
      PM in children with mild or severe TBI. The study will focus on three major themes: 1)&#xD;
      strategies that may help children with TBI overcome or minimize their PM deficits; 2) how&#xD;
      specific areas of cognition can be impaired following TBI and in turn impair PM; and 3) the&#xD;
      impact of PM deficits on a child's daily functioning, both at school and at home. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate children without TBI (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child will participate in one study evaluation. The evaluation will last approximately 4&#xD;
      hours, with a lunch break and other rest breaks as necessary. Assessments will include&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests of attention, memory, and general intellectual functioning.&#xD;
      Experimental tasks will include measures of metacognition for prospective memory, elucidation&#xD;
      of strategic versus automatic processes involved in PM, and the effect of motivation&#xD;
      manipulations in overcoming PM deficits with varying working memory loads. The child's parent&#xD;
      or guardian will also be asked to complete some tests to measure the impact of PM deficits on&#xD;
      the child's daily home life.&#xD;
