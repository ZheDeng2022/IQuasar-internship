      COX-2 is an enzyme that is found in several different tissues in the body. COX-2 appears to&#xD;
      produce a substance called prostaglandins, mainly at sites of inflammation. Several drugs&#xD;
      have been approved by the FDA that inhibit COX-2 such as celecoxib, or brand name CelebrexÂ®.&#xD;
      These drugs are primarily used in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis to&#xD;
      decrease inflammation and pain. COX-2 inhibitors have been developed because they are more&#xD;
      selective in treatment of inflammation and pain and tend to have fewer gastrointestinal side&#xD;
      effects than NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen,&#xD;
      naproxen, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal adult kidney expresses COX-2 in various regions. Prostaglandins, which are&#xD;
      produced in the kidney by COX-2, may contribute to glomerular and tubulointerstitial&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases (types of kidney diseases due to inflammation). In some animal studies,&#xD;
      COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to be potentially beneficial in reducing the amount of&#xD;
      protein spilled in the urine and preserving kidney function with these inflammatory kidney&#xD;
      diseases. This study will compare the effects of COX-2 inhibitor to placebo (an inactive&#xD;
      substance) in patients with diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease due to diabetes) and&#xD;
      proteinuria (spilling protein in the urine) on 24-hour urinary protein excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to see whether COX-2 inhibitors are useful in treating diabetic&#xD;
      patients with kidney disease. The purpose of this study is a short-term pilot study that will&#xD;
      allow the gathering of important data such as the ability to carry out the study and carry it&#xD;
      out safely. Subjects with proteinuria and diabetic kidney disease already on ACE&#xD;
      (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) inhibitor or ARB (Angiotensin Receptor Blocker) therapy&#xD;
      (types of blood pressure medicines) will be randomized to a type of study in which each&#xD;
      subject will serve as their own control. The study is set up so that each subject will&#xD;
      receive either the COX-2 inhibitor or placebo for a period followed by a period of no drug&#xD;
      and then followed by a period of receiving either the COX-2 inhibitor or placebo (whichever&#xD;
      they did not receive the first period).&#xD;

      The study is designed with a screening period, a baseline period and a treatment period. The&#xD;
      purpose of screening is to identify eligible subjects and to exclude ineligible subjects. A&#xD;
      careful history and physical examination will be conducted to ensure that the subject meets&#xD;
      all the inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria. The screening&#xD;
      period lasts from 2 days to 2 months in duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline period is from 2 - 3 months in duration. During the first baseline visit, there&#xD;
      is withdrawal of previously used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor antagonists (if any) and the initiation of quinapril 20 mg daily therapy (or&#xD;
      irbesartan --150 - 300 mg daily). The subject will then be seen as frequently as determined&#xD;
      by the investigator for subject's safety. The purpose of the second baseline visit is to&#xD;
      determine safety after the initiation of therapy quinapril 20 mg po per day (or irbesartan&#xD;
      150 - 300 mg per day). The purpose of third baseline visit is to insure that the subject&#xD;
      meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria prior to randomization. In&#xD;
      addition, it will be assured that the subject's blood pressure is at a safe level to proceed&#xD;
      with randomization and the laboratory and urinary collections will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only those subjects who fulfill all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will proceed&#xD;
      to randomization. Also, in order to proceed to the randomization phase of the study, the&#xD;
      subject must have a blood pressure of less than or equal to 135/85mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase will consist of 18 weeks. During the treatment phase, the subject will be&#xD;
      followed for safety and efficacy. The subjects will be randomly assigned to COX-2 inhibitor&#xD;
      for 6 weeks (1st 6 week cycle), washout 3 weeks, placebo 6 weeks (2nd 6 week cycle), washout&#xD;
      3 weeks or to placebo 6 weeks (1st 6 week cycle), washout 3 weeks, COX-2 inhibitor 6 weeks&#xD;
      (2nd 6 week cycle), washout 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During baseline and treatment periods, interim visits will be held in order to address blood&#xD;
      pressure control or other problems that the patient or the PI deems necessary for protocol&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
