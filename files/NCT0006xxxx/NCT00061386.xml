    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a community-based program to improve diet and physical activity in&#xD;
      women during the first 12 months following the birth of a child. The program is designed to&#xD;
      complement existing federal programs for low-income families and is directed toward&#xD;
      low-income, postpartum, multi-ethnic women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The postpartum period is a window of opportunity to promote behaviors that reduce the risk of&#xD;
      chronic disease and benefit reproductive health. The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education&#xD;
      Program (EFNEP) is an educational program delivered by community-based paraprofessional's&#xD;
      that aims to improve dietary and activity patterns among low income, multi-ethnic women&#xD;
      during the postpartum period. This study will evaluate the efficacy of the EFNEP to impact&#xD;
      the diet and activity patterns of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women were recruited through the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and&#xD;
      Children (WIC) and randomized to either the EFNEP group or a usual care group. Women in both&#xD;
      groups will receive standard WIC care consisting of nutrition-risk and breastfeeding&#xD;
      educational messages at postpartum and follow-up visits. Women in the EFNEP group&#xD;
      participated in an additional two component intervention that included five home visits and&#xD;
      motivational telephone calls from project staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study outcomes were assessed at Months 1 and 12. Primary outcomes included fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable intake, saturated fat intake, and physical activity. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include Body Mass Index and indicators of fat mass and distribution. The study will also&#xD;
      analyze mediating and modifying factors, including social support and norms, perceived health&#xD;
      status, smoking, television viewing, food insecurity, food and activity access, and&#xD;
      utilization of federal programs and health care.&#xD;
