  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the relationship between susceptibility to hypnosis and&#xD;
      regulation of the autonomic nervous system (nerves that control involuntary body functions,&#xD;
      such as heart rate and sweating).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnosis is a state of mind in which the individual is highly focused, relatively unaware of&#xD;
      his or her surroundings, and possibly more able to accept and use therapeutic suggestions.&#xD;
      People vary in their responsiveness, or susceptibility, while in hypnosis. People with&#xD;
      certain conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), chronic pain, posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have altered hypnotic&#xD;
      susceptibility. Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance (COI) often have symptoms&#xD;
      similar to those of individuals with CFS, chronic pain, PTSD, and GAD, and this study will&#xD;
      examine how patients with COI respond to hypnosis as compared with healthy normal volunteers.&#xD;
      COI is a group of disorders characterized by intolerance to prolonged standing. Among them&#xD;
      are neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), in which patients have recurrent episodes of sudden loss&#xD;
      of consciousness, and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), in which patients have a&#xD;
      sustained increase in heart rate after standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the comparison of COI and normal volunteer responses to hypnosis, the study&#xD;
      will examine how hypnotic susceptibility is related to the ability to control autonomic&#xD;
      functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating. The autonomic nervous system is&#xD;
      activated when the body is stressed, not only from physical stimuli such as cold temperature,&#xD;
      but also from mental stimuli, such as seeing a rattlesnake up close. Hypnosis may, therefore,&#xD;
      be a useful tool to understand how the mind controls the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with NCS or POTS who are 18 years of age or older may&#xD;
      be eligible for this two-part study. In part 1, participants complete a questionnaire and are&#xD;
      then tested for hypnotic susceptibility. For this test, a professionally trained physician&#xD;
      guides the subject through a procedure to achieve a hypnotic state. The subject is asked to&#xD;
      perform several simple tasks and is then guided back to a normal state of being. In part 2,&#xD;
      the subject undergoes hypnosis again, during which the physician offers various suggestions&#xD;
      while monitoring activity of the subject's autonomic nervous system. The subject is connected&#xD;
      to various sensors that continuously monitor blood pressure, heart rate, blood flow, sweat&#xD;
      response, skin electrical conduction, and brain wave activity. An intravenous catheter is&#xD;
      inserted into an arm vein to collect blood samples. At the end, the subject is guided back to&#xD;
      a normal state of being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypnosis session in part 1 is videotaped in order to: 1) permit review by a scientist who&#xD;
      is unaware of the subject's condition and whose judgment will not, therefore, be biased; and&#xD;
      2) have a record of the experimental data. Only qualified investigators will view the&#xD;
      videotape.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a study to investigate the relationship between susceptibility to&#xD;
      hypnosis and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that individuals with particular conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),&#xD;
      have altered hypnotic susceptibility. Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance (COI), a&#xD;
      general category of autonomic dysfunction that includes neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) and&#xD;
      postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), often present with symptoms that are similar to those&#xD;
      seen in CFS, PTSD, chronic pain, or GAD. These observations led to the hypothesis tested in&#xD;
      this protocol that patients with COI may also have altered hypnotic susceptibility. We also&#xD;
      hypothesize that increased hypnotic susceptibility will correlate with increased ability to&#xD;
      modulate autonomic function appropriately in response to suggestions during hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes normal volunteers and patients with NCS or POTS. The design is&#xD;
      blinded and correlative. Primary outcome measures are hypnotic susceptibility as measured by&#xD;
      standardized scales; self-report inventory scores of psychobehavioral variables; physiologic&#xD;
      parameters such as hemodynamics, sweating, skin electrical conductance, body temperature,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, and bispectral analysis; and plasma catechol levels. The results of this&#xD;
      study may lead to novel therapeutic strategies using hypnosis for COI.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are patients with COI (POTS or NCS) identified in existing diagnostic protocols of&#xD;
        the Clinical Neurocardiology Section (CNCS) and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers.&#xD;
        Patients with COI must be evaluated first through these diagnostic protocols prior to being&#xD;
        offered enrollment in this protocol. Participation in this protocol is offered to subjects&#xD;
        independently of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or creed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The studies in this protocol can be performed on an outpatient basis. Inpatients may also&#xD;
        participate as long as participation does not interfere with the protocol(s) under which&#xD;
        they have been admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are excluded based on: age less than 18 years, unwillingness to be hypnotized or&#xD;
        videotaped; religious or other beliefs that would prevent engagement in hypnosis; psychosis&#xD;
        or psychotic depression; non-fluency in spoken English; and inability to participate&#xD;
        adequately in the tasks of the hypnotic susceptibility scale. In addition, patients are&#xD;
        excluded if they are being treated with, and cannot discontinue, a drug likely to interfere&#xD;
        with the scientific results. An example would be treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor&#xD;
        blocker. Patients unable to discontinue nicotine or alcohol temporarily are excluded.&#xD;
        Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the patient or the patient's doctor&#xD;
        discusses this with the Principal Investigator, or the Research Nurse. If it is decided&#xD;
        that discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the&#xD;
        study. Finally, subjects are excluded if there are technical limitations in placing an i.v.&#xD;
        or monitoring devices.&#xD;
