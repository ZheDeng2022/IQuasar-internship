      This study will compare the side effects of two laser treatments for diabetic macular edema,&#xD;
      a common condition in patients with diabetes. In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina,&#xD;
      a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye, become leaky and the retina swells.&#xD;
      The macula, the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision, may also swell&#xD;
      and cause vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green, or yellow) for&#xD;
      macular swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of&#xD;
      vision. A different laser technique, the mild macular grid, uses lighter laser burns through&#xD;
      the macula and may be less damaging to the eye, but this is not known. This study will&#xD;
      compare the two techniques and the information on side effects will be used to design a&#xD;
      larger study of whether one laser is more effective than the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and eye pressure, and to&#xD;
           examine pupils, lens, retina and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops&#xD;
           for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure cholesterol levels, hemoglobin A1C (a measure of diabetes&#xD;
           control), and creatinine (measure of kidney function).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye photography to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in&#xD;
           the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that&#xD;
           flashes a bright light into the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected&#xD;
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina&#xD;
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if&#xD;
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography to examine retinal thickness. The eye is examined with a&#xD;
           machine that produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These measurements will be&#xD;
           repeated during the study to determine whether retinal thickening is getting better,&#xD;
           worse, or staying the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two laser therapies in the eye with&#xD;
      macula edema. (Patients with macular edema in both eyes will receive both treatments-one in&#xD;
      each eye.) For these procedures, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface, and a&#xD;
      contact lens is placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be&#xD;
      required for additional laser treatments. The number of treatments depends on how well they&#xD;
      are working. Patients will return for follow-up visits 4, 8, and 12 months after the first&#xD;
      treatment, and then every year until year 3. During the follow-up visits, the response to&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated with repeat tests of several of the screening exams.&#xD;

      The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCRnet) was formed to conduct clinical&#xD;
      trials and epidemiological studies for diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the establishment of the network, it is necessary to standardize data collection&#xD;
      methods, testing procedures, and treatment techniques for use in the anticipated multiple&#xD;
      protocols to be conducted by the network. One of the treatment techniques requiring&#xD;
      standardization is laser photocoagulation treatment of diabetic macular edema. To accomplish&#xD;
      this goal, a protocol has been developed to enroll patients with diabetic macular edema who&#xD;
      require laser treatment. Procedures to be conducted by standardized protocols include&#xD;
      refraction, visual acuity testing, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) and laser photocoagulation. One of the benefits from having a&#xD;
      structured protocol will be that the outcome data using the standardized techniques can be&#xD;
      used for sample size estimations in future protocols. This is particularly true for OCT for&#xD;
      which we need to develop standard methods to assess changes in groups of patients and for&#xD;
      which there are limited longitudinal data, especially in groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conduct of this study provides the opportunity not only to collect data on a standardized&#xD;
      laser protocol commonly used in current clinical practice but also to collect pilot data&#xD;
      evaluating a new laser technique. The 'current practice' laser protocol, modified from the&#xD;
      ETDRS treatment protocol, involves focal/grid photocoagulation to areas of macular thickening&#xD;
      with leaking MA, diffuse leakage or nonperfusion (modified-ETDRS technique). There is&#xD;
      extensive evidence supporting the efficacy of ETDRS laser photocoagulation technique for the&#xD;
      treatment of macular edema. The alternative technique, called mild macular grid (MMG)&#xD;
      photocoagulation, provides mild grid treatment using small, widely separated burns to the&#xD;
      retina from 500 to 3000 microns (3500 microns temporally) from the macular center. This&#xD;
      technique may potentially have fewer side effects, different edema resolution rate or&#xD;
      prevention of future development of macular edema as discussed below. The study will use&#xD;
      randomization to assign each patient to receive one of the two treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this protocol, participation will be open to all clinical sites that have the requisite&#xD;
      equipment needed for the study and to all ophthalmologists who meet criteria to be a DRCR.net&#xD;
      investigator. The sample size for the study will be dictated by the number of participating&#xD;
      sites, with each site limited to the enrollment of a maximum of four patients or one patient&#xD;
      per certified investigator, whichever is greater.&#xD;

               2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Any one of the following will&#xD;
                  be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is present:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Current regular use of oral antihyperglycemia agents for the treatment of&#xD;
                       diabetes.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. No history of renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. No condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation&#xD;
                  in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic&#xD;
                  control). Patients in poor glycemic control who recently initiated intensive&#xD;
                  insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in the&#xD;
                  next 3 months should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Ability and willingness to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. No expectation that subject will be moving out of the area of the clinical center&#xD;
                  to an area not covered by another clinical center during the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA - STUDY EYE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least one eye must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Best corrected ETDRS visual acuity score greater than or equal to 19 letters&#xD;
             (approximately 20/400 or better).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema based on clinical exam at or&#xD;
             within 500 microns of the macular center for which the investigator believes laser&#xD;
             photocoagulation is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A thickness of 250 microns or more in the central subfield OR a thickness of 300&#xD;
             microns or more in any one of the four subfields directly adjacent to the central&#xD;
             subfield on OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No prior focal/grid laser photocoagulation in the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No prior medical treatment for DME (e.g., intravitreal/peribulbar steroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within prior 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No anticipated need for PRP within next 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, any other intraocular surgery,&#xD;
             scleral buckle, glaucoma filter, cornea transplant, etc.) within prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy within prior 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Macular edema is not considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular&#xD;
             edema. An eye should not be considered eligible (1) if the macular edema is considered&#xD;
             to be related to cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or OCT suggests that&#xD;
             vitreoretinal interface disease (eg. vitreo-retinal traction or epriretinal membrane)&#xD;
             is the primary cause of the macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Media clarity, papillary dilation, and patient cooperation sufficient for adequate&#xD;
             fundus photos.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. No ocular condition (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the first 12 months of the&#xD;
             study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular&#xD;
             glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome). Glaucoma per se is not an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient may have two &quot;study eyes&quot; only if both are eligible at the time of randomization.&#xD;
        An eye that becomes eligible after randomization will not be considered a study eye for&#xD;
        purposes of data analyses or treatment decisions although information is being gathered on&#xD;
        all eyes.&#xD;
