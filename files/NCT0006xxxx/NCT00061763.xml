  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the oral iron chelator Deferasirox&#xD;
      on liver iron content after one year of treatment in patients with iron overload from&#xD;
      repeated blood transfusions. Beta-thalassemia patients unable to be treated with deferoxamine&#xD;
      or patients with rare chronic anemias such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Fanconi's Syndrome,&#xD;
      Blackfan-Diamond Syndrome, and Pure Red Blood Cell Anemia are eligible for this study. Liver&#xD;
      iron content will be measured by liver biopsy at the beginning of the study and after one&#xD;
      year of treatment. However, those patients living in the San Francisco/Oakland area may have&#xD;
      a SQUID in place of the liver biopsy if the biopsy is not medically possible for them. The&#xD;
      SQUID is a non-invasive magnetic means to measure liver iron content.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Beta-thalassemia patients with documented non-compliance to deferoxamine, defined as&#xD;
             taking less than 50% of prescribed doses in year prior to study, and having a liver&#xD;
             iron content at least 14 mg iron/gm dry weight liver tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Beta-thalassemia patients unable to take deferoxamine because of documented side&#xD;
             effects or contra-indication, or documented poor response despite proper compliance,&#xD;
             with liver iron content at least 2 mg iron/gm dry weight liver tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chronic anemias with a liver iron content at least 2 mg/gm dry weight&#xD;
             liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Beta-thalassemia or other chronic anemia patients having previously taken deferiprone,&#xD;
             provided that they stop the deferiprone at least 28 days before the study and have a&#xD;
             liver iron content at least 2 mg/gm dry weight liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients: Regular transfusions indicated by a requirement of at least 8 blood&#xD;
             transfusions per year.&#xD;
