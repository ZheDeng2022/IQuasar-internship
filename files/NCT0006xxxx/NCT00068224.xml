  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients ciliopathies. People with ciliopathies develop fibrocystic&#xD;
      disease of the kidneys and liver, retinal degeneration, obesity, structural and functional&#xD;
      defects of the central nervous system and the eyes, abnormal bone growth, abnormal sidedness&#xD;
      of internal organs and polydactyly. The goal of the study is to better understand the medical&#xD;
      complications of these disorders and identify characteristics that can help in the design of&#xD;
      new treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human diseases caused by defects of the primary cilium (ciliopathies) are a group of distinct&#xD;
      disorders with overlapping features. Clinical features of ciliopathies include fibrocystic&#xD;
      disease of the kidneys and liver, retinal degeneration, obesity, structural and functional&#xD;
      defects of the central nervous system and the eyes, abnormal bone growth, abnormal sidedness&#xD;
      of internal organs and polydactyly. Human ciliopathies characterized by variable combinations&#xD;
      of these features include autosomal recessive (ARPKD) and dominant (ADPKD) polycystic kidney&#xD;
      diseases, nephronophthisis (NPHP), Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD),&#xD;
      Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Meckel-Gruber (MKS), Oral-Facial-Digital-type 1 (OFD1), and Alstrom&#xD;
      syndromes (AS) and skeletal disorders such as Jeune syndrome (JS) and cleidocranial&#xD;
      dysplasia. ARPKD, the most common pediatric ciliopathy, is characterized by cystic&#xD;
      degeneration of the kidneys and congenital hepatic fibrosis of the liver. JSRD are a&#xD;
      heterogenous group of syndromes characterized by a distinctive cerebellar and brainstem&#xD;
      malformation (molar tooth sign), intellectual disability, abnormal eye movements, and&#xD;
      abnormal respiratory pattern in infancy. Other common features seen in subsets of JSRD&#xD;
      patients include, fibrocystic renal disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis, retinal&#xD;
      degeneration, retinal colobomas, occipital encephalocele, and polydactyly. AS and BBS are&#xD;
      ciliopathies characterized by obesity and retinal degeneration and hepatorenal disease in&#xD;
      most cases. BBS patients also exhibit postaxial polydactyly, cognitive impairment, male&#xD;
      hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and female genitourinary malformations. Additional features in&#xD;
      AS include metabolic syndrome associated with insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and sensorineural deafness. OFD-I is characterized by polycystic kidney&#xD;
      disease and oral, digital and brain anomalies including cerebellar hypoplasia with or without&#xD;
      Dandy-Walker malformation. JS is a skeletal ciliopathy characterized by small thorax,&#xD;
      short-limbed short stature, fibrocystic renal disease and retinal degeneration. The frequency&#xD;
      and characteristics and natural history of specific organ/system disease in ciliopathies are&#xD;
      either unknown or poorly defined, mostly because of the limited data available from&#xD;
      retrospective reports of small numbers of patients.&#xD;

        end-stage renal disease (uncontrolled hypertension, severe electrolyte imbalances), hepatic&#xD;
        disease (current variceal bleeding, overt encephalopathy, intractable recurrent&#xD;
        cholangitis), severe cardiomyopathy as seen in some AS patients, or severe respiratory&#xD;
