  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental anti-cancer drug IL13-PE38QQR, which is being developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      malignant brain tumors, is composed of parts of two proteins: the immune system cytokine IL13&#xD;
      and a toxin from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The IL13 part of the drug binds to&#xD;
      another protein, the IL13 receptor, when this receptor is displayed on the outside surface of&#xD;
      cells. Cells with drug bound to the IL13 receptor take up the drug, and the toxin part of the&#xD;
      drug then kills those cells. Since brain tumor cells display the IL13 receptor, they are&#xD;
      potential targets that may be killed by this drug. This is a pilot study to visualize the&#xD;
      distribution of IL13-PE38QQR infused into and around brain tumor tissue before and after&#xD;
      surgical removal of the tumor in adult patients with recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored tumor tissue will be tested for presence of the receptor protein, which is required&#xD;
      for study entry. Eligible patients will then undergo biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of&#xD;
      recurrent malignant glioma. IL13-PE38QQR will be infused for 96 hours into and around tumor&#xD;
      tissue through catheters that have been placed surgically. For the first 48 hours the drug&#xD;
      will be mixed with a radioactive tracer, so that the distribution of the drug can be followed&#xD;
      by a type of scanning called SPECT. Surgery to remove the tumor will be performed&#xD;
      approximately 15 days after the end of the infusion. Catheters will again be placed&#xD;
      surgically, and IL13-PE38QQR will be infused a second time for 96 hours. Radioactive tracer&#xD;
      will be included in the infusion for the first 48 hours. For both infusions, SPECT scans will&#xD;
      be taken at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the start of infusion. MRI scans will be taken within&#xD;
      90 minutes of the 24 and 48 hour SPECT scans. Patients will be followed closely with further&#xD;
      scans and laboratory tests until completion of the study approximately 58 days after&#xD;
      completion of the second infusion.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR following continuous infusion via catheter(s)&#xD;
           into recurrent malignant glioma prior to surgical resection and a continuous infusion&#xD;
           via catheter(s) into brain tissue adjacent to tumor resection site after surgical&#xD;
           resection. 123I-HSA tracer will be used as a surrogate for study drug distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicities associated with administration of IL13-PE38QQR as described&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the effect on distribution of IL13-PE38QQR of varying the catheter type (up to 3)&#xD;
           and flow rate per catheter, keeping the total flow rates constant, for the pre- and&#xD;
           post-resection infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study to assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR delivered by&#xD;
      intratumoral infusion prior to surgical resection and by interstitial infusion into tissue&#xD;
      surrounding the resection site (peritumoral) after surgical resection. Prior to resection,&#xD;
      catheters will be placed in the region of the solid contrast-enhancing tumor component. The&#xD;
      volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR in the&#xD;
      infusate will be fixed. For the post-resection infusion, catheters will be placed&#xD;
      peritumorally into areas at greatest risk for residual or infiltrating tumor. The&#xD;
      post-resection volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of&#xD;
      IL13-PE38QQR in the infusate will be fixed. For the first 48 hours of each infusion,&#xD;
      IL13-PE38QQR will be prepared with 123I-HSA tracer as the surrogate for distribution of study&#xD;
      drug. The type and number of catheters utilized to deliver the pre- and post-surgery&#xD;
      infusions will vary. To maintain a fixed total volume of infusate over 96 hours, the rate of&#xD;
      infusion will vary depending upon the number of catheters utilized. Up to three different&#xD;
      catheter types will be tested. However, only the same, single type of catheter will be&#xD;
      utilized for the pre- and post-resection infusions for a given patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow assessment of the distribution of the infused material, the first 48 hours of both&#xD;
      the pre- and post-resection infusions will utilize 123I-HSA in the infusate. For the last 48&#xD;
      hours of both infusions, the 123I-HSA will be replaced by non-labeled HSA. The distribution&#xD;
      of the 123I-HSA tracer will be measured by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)&#xD;
      scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 18 patients will be enrolled at a single site.&#xD;
