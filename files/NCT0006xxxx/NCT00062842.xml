  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The medicine being offered in this study is called Irinotecan. Irinotecan has been effective&#xD;
      against many animal cancers. It has been given to both adults and children. We are now&#xD;
      attempting to determine how much of the drug can be given to children when Irinotecan is&#xD;
      given weekly for four weeks in a row every 6 weeks and the toxicities (bad side effects) that&#xD;
      occur when irinotecan is administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the highest dose of Irinotecan that can safely be given to children whose&#xD;
           cancer no longer responds to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the toxicities of Irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine what studies (laboratory or x-rays) need to be done to evaluate the&#xD;
           toxicities of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if irinotecan is beneficial to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To understand how the drug Irinotecan works in the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irinotecan will be given intravenously (into the vein) over 90 minutes for four weeks in a&#xD;
      row. This cycle may be repeated in six weeks as long as the cancer is not getting worse and&#xD;
      there are no serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one cycle patients will be evaluated to decide if the treatments should continue. If&#xD;
      the disease is no worse or better additional courses may be given. If treatment continues,&#xD;
      evaluations will be done after the second cycle and then every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients choose to participate in this study we would request that they remain in the&#xD;
      study for one full cycle. During the first cycle of treatment we would like to draw special&#xD;
      blood samples to help us learn how much drug is in the blood. These special studies are&#xD;
      called pharmacokinetics. On the first day the drug is given, fourteen blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn. Each blood sample will be about 1/2 teaspoon, for a total of about 3 tablespoons.&#xD;
      These samples will only be drawn during the first cycle of therapy. The total amount of blood&#xD;
      drawn will be less than 5% of the total blood volume, an amount safe even for small children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations and other blood tests will be done twice a week initially, then weekly to look&#xD;
      for side effects of the drug. Patients will have an additional one teaspoon of blood drawn at&#xD;
      each of these visits.&#xD;
