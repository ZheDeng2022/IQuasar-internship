      The primary objective is to determine the tolerability and safety, from days 0 to 210, of&#xD;
      escalating doses of rPA either with or without Alhydrogel (an adjuvant; used to increase the&#xD;
      action of the principle drug) given in a two-dose, intramuscular regimen to health adults.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate antibody responses to rPA, from days 0 to 210,&#xD;
      following one of four escalating doses of vaccine given with and without Alhydrogel given in&#xD;
      a two-dose series to healthy adults, and to compare immune responses following rPA with those&#xD;
      following BioThrax (tm) given by either the intramuscular or SQ route. The tertiary objective&#xD;
      is to describe the antibody kinetics following vaccination. This information will be used to&#xD;
      determine the most probable optimal dose of rPA and/or Alhydrogel that is safe, well&#xD;
      tolerated, and maximally immunogenic for use in future phase II trials.&#xD;

      This Phase I, Dose-Escalating clinical study is designed to examine the immunologic response&#xD;
      to rPA in the presence and absence of Alhydrogel at the 2 lowest dose levels. The study will&#xD;
      investigate whether use of an aluminum-based adjuvant results in an increase in the magnitude&#xD;
      or the duration of the antibody response, thus providing information on the necessity of&#xD;
      aluminum-based adjuvants in formulations used in the phase II clinical trials. The rationale&#xD;
      for the use of BioThrax by two administration routes in this trial is to allow for&#xD;
      preliminary comparisons of the immune response following the currently available vaccine to&#xD;
      the response following the new recombinant product. Approximately 80 outpatient community&#xD;
      volunteers from the Baltimore-Washington area aged 18-40 years will be recruited on the basis&#xD;
      of good health, expressed interest in the study, and availability for follow-up as determined&#xD;
      at a preliminary interview. Each eligible subject will be enrolled in 1 of 4 study groups,&#xD;
      each with three arms, for 7 months. The subjects' randomly assigned and double-masked to Arms&#xD;
      A and B will have a 30 day screening period in which they will receive two doses of IM rPA or&#xD;
      IM rPA+Alhydrogel or IM BioThrax one month apart, with follow up days on 1, 2, 7, 14, 28, 29,&#xD;
      30, 35, 42, 120, and 210. The subjects randomly assigned, but unmasked, to arms 1-C or 2-C&#xD;
      will receive 3 doses of SQ BioThrax at 14 day intervals with follow up on days 1, 2, 7, 14,&#xD;
      15, 16, 21, 28, 29, 30, 35, 42, 120 and 210. The information gathered from the study&#xD;
      objectives will be used to determine the most probable optimal doses of rPA +/- Alhydrogel&#xD;
      that are safe, well tolerated, and maximally immunogenic for use in future phase II trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18 to 40 years, inclusive. Good health as evidenced by screening evaluation within the&#xD;
        30 days prior to immunization. Expressed interest and availability to fulfill the study&#xD;
        requirements. Signed, informed consents: screening, HIV antibody testing, stored specimen,&#xD;
        HIPAA authorization, and protocol-specific consents. Agreement to avoid pregnancy for the&#xD;
        30 days following each vaccination by use of highly effective birth control methods. A&#xD;
        highly effective birth control method is defined as one which results in a failure rate&#xD;
        less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. These methods include tubal&#xD;
        ligation, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUD's (All commonly&#xD;
        used copper and hormone implanted IUD's in the US are highly effective including the&#xD;
        following types: TCu-380A, TCu-220C, MLCu-375, Nova-T, and LNG-20. The less effective IUD's&#xD;
        include the Lippes loop and the stainless steel ring), sexual abstinence, and a&#xD;
        vasectomized partner. Agreement to refrain from taking any experimental drug or vaccine&#xD;
        from day -30 to day 90.&#xD;

        are derived from the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) developed by the Addiction&#xD;
        Research Foundation and recommended by the National Institute for Drug abuse as a tool for&#xD;

        study vaccine. Receipt of a subunit or killed vaccine within the 14 days prior to receipt&#xD;
        of the study vaccine. Receipt of a blood product, including immunoglobulin, in the 90 days&#xD;
        prior to receipt of the study vaccine. Anything that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
