      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading causes of death&#xD;
      in the Western world. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated the impact of&#xD;
      various risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. While these risk factors are partly under genetic control, a positive family&#xD;
      history remains an additional independent predictor of CAD, suggesting the presence of as yet&#xD;
      unidentified susceptibility loci. Given the enormous public health burden of CAD, there is&#xD;
      significant interest in identifying its specific genetic foundations. As intensive&#xD;
      experimental investigations continue, the inflammatory component of the disease process&#xD;
      leading to atherosclerosis evolves as a key aspect in the disease process. Recent evidence&#xD;
      demonstrates that systemic markers of inflammation such as C reactive protein (CRP) can&#xD;
      predict those at high risk of coronary events. CRP emerges with much attention as both a&#xD;
      diagnostic marker and therapeutic target with serum levels determined to a significant extent&#xD;
      by genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elucidate the genetic basis of the inflammatory component of myocardial infarction and the&#xD;
      regulation of C reactive protein, a gene function oriented evaluation of candidate genes will&#xD;
      be conducted. Therefore the specific aims are as follows, 1. Identify positional candidate&#xD;
      genes within regions identified for MI and CRP which are functionally related to inflammation&#xD;
      and inflammatory processes. Sequence variation in selected candidate genes will be&#xD;
      identified. 2. Evaluate the effect of these variants with regard to MI and CRP in two&#xD;
      different ethnic populations: a family set of European Caucasians and a population-based,&#xD;
      Hispanic family dataset. The role of CRP will be evaluated as a predictor of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events in the study populations. Since clinical follow up data are available on both study&#xD;
      populations, the extent to which CRP contributes to an increased risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      events will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>In conjunction with collaborators in Germany, we have established one of the largest collections of families with MI, comprising 1,406 individuals in 513 Western-European families. Based on this collection, our total genome scan and linkage analysis has identified a region on chromosome 14 with a significant linkage signal for myocardial infarction (LOD = 3.9, pointwise P = 0.00015, genome-wide P &lt; 0.05)5. Preliminary results from an association study in a subset of these families has identified a small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes in this region as being suggestively associated with MI.&#xD;

  <biospec_descr>

      i.) Blood: A blood sample (30 cc, ~2 tablespoons) will be drawn. This will take place in the&#xD;
      catheterization lab at the end of the catheterization procedure or by using standard&#xD;
      venipuncture technique during a clinic visit or at community outreach events when feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii.) Buccal Swab: The participant uses specially prepared cotton swabs (called buccal swabs)&#xD;
      to rub in a circular motion on the inside of both cheeks. The swabs collect cheek cells that&#xD;
      can be processed to obtain DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii.) Saliva: A saliva sample is obtained by having the participant spit in a special vial&#xD;
      specifically designed for genetic testing. The participant will continue to spit into the&#xD;
      vial until it contains 2 ml (about 1 teaspoon) of saliva.&#xD;
