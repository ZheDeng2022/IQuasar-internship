      This study will evaluate how HIV infection, including CD4 cell count and viral load, affects&#xD;
      the patient's ability to produce antibodies in response to vaccination with the influenza&#xD;
      (flu) vaccine. Earlier studies have shown that people with HIV infection do not respond as&#xD;
      well as healthy subjects to flu vaccine; that is, they don't make as many antibodies in&#xD;
      response to the vaccine. Before the use of current anti-HIV medications, antibodies made to&#xD;
      flu vaccination in HIV-positive individuals was related to their CD4 cell count. This trial&#xD;
      will examine how CD4 counts and the amount of virus in the blood affect how much and what&#xD;
      kind of antibodies the body makes to the flu vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients and healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Healthy subjects will serve as controls to make sure the flu vaccine&#xD;
      works (i.e., stimulates production of enough antibody to protect against the flu), and to&#xD;
      compare the amount of antibodies made by HIV-positive and HIV-negative people. Candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical history and blood tests (see below). Women who are able to&#xD;
      have children will have a pregnancy test. Pregnant women are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood drawing for the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver functions, electrolyte&#xD;
                levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD4 cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HLA typing (a genetic marker of the immune system) if it has not already been done&#xD;
                at the NIH. This test may be used to try to identify factors associated with the&#xD;
                rate of progression of HIV disease or related conditions. Determining HLA type is&#xD;
                necessary to be able to perform certain research studies. Some HLA types have been&#xD;
                associated with an increased risk of certain diseases like arthritis and other&#xD;
                rheumatologic problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Viral load (HIV-infected patients only).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Influenza antibody levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  B cell levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Flu vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up visits on days, 7, 28, and 54 after vaccination for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Review of any illnesses or fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Review of medications, if any changes were made.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Repeat blood tests.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the effect of HIV viral load and CD4 counts on&#xD;
      the generation of influenza-specific antibodies and influenza-specific B cell responses in&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults. HIV-infected subjects will be enrolled to receive the influenza vaccine&#xD;
      appropriate to the on-going USA influenza season (Oct-March). Laboratory studies (including&#xD;
      influenza titers, influenza-specific B cell frequencies, CD4 counts, and HIV viral loads)&#xD;
      will be obtained at baseline (day of vaccination), day 7, 28, and 54 post-vaccination.&#xD;
      HIV-negative healthy volunteers will serve as controls. Although there are some risks to&#xD;
      influenza vaccine, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunizations recommends influenza&#xD;
      vaccination for HIV-infected patients. The primary study risks are those of phlebotomy and&#xD;
      the inconvenience of multiple visits. Subjects will be compensated for participation in the&#xD;
      study. Total enrollment of the study is a maximum of 165 subjects (132 HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals and 33 HIV-negative controls).&#xD;
