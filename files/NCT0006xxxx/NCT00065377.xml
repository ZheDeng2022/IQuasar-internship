      This study will examine whether glucosamine affects the way the body responds to insulin.&#xD;
      Insulin is a hormone that causes the body to use glucose (sugar). Insulin does not work as&#xD;
      well in overweight people, causing a condition called insulin resistance. Insulin also&#xD;
      increases the flow of blood into muscle by opening inactive blood vessels. This study will&#xD;
      test whether glucosamine, a nutritional supplement that many people take to treat arthritis,&#xD;
      can cause or worsen insulin resistance or change how blood vessels react to insulin in normal&#xD;
      weight and overweight people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal weight and overweight volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief physical examination,&#xD;
      medical history, and blood and urine tests. After screening, participants will have three&#xD;
      additional outpatient clinic visits for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose clamp test to measure the body's response to insulin: For this procedure, a&#xD;
           needle is placed in a vein of each arm, one for drawing blood samples, and one for&#xD;
           infusing glucose and a potassium solution. The glucose is infused continuously during&#xD;
           this 4-hour test and blood is drawn frequently to monitor glucose and insulin levels.&#xD;
           After the test, blood glucose levels are monitored for another 2 hours to make sure they&#xD;
           remain at an adequate level to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood flow measurement: Blood flow in the brachial artery of the arm is measured to&#xD;
           assess how many capillaries (very small blood vessels) are being used to supply&#xD;
           nutrients and oxygen to the muscle in the forearm. This test is done at the same time as&#xD;
           the glucose clamp test. Blood flow is measured using a technique called contrast&#xD;
           ultrasound. A small amount of contrast agent consisting of gas-filled bubbles the size&#xD;
           of red blood cells is infused over 10 minutes through one of the catheters placed in the&#xD;
           vein for the glucose clamp test. The contrast agent is infused twice, once at the&#xD;
           beginning of the glucose clamp test and once at the end of the test. The contrast&#xD;
           material creates a signal in response to ultrasound that provides information about the&#xD;
           distribution of capillaries in the forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assignment to medication group: Participants are randomly assigned to take either&#xD;
           glucosamine or placebo three times a day by mouth for 6 weeks. At the end of the 6&#xD;
           weeks, no study drug is taken for 1 week, and then participants &quot;cross-over&quot;&#xD;
           medications, those who took glucosamine for the first 6 weeks take placebo for the next&#xD;
           6 weeks and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these visits, the glucose clamp test and blood flow measurements are repeated. Visit 2 is&#xD;
      scheduled at the end of the first 6-week treatment period, and Visit 3 is scheduled at the&#xD;
      end of the second 6-week treatment period.&#xD;

      Glucosamine is a popular over-the-counter nutritional supplement that many people use for the&#xD;
      treatment of osteoarthritis. Intravenous administration of glucosamine to animals or humans&#xD;
      causes significant metabolic insulin resistance and vascular endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
      Moreover, experiments with various cell lines have implicated elevated glucosamine levels in&#xD;
      the development of insulin resistance. However, there are no published studies examining the&#xD;
      potential effects of oral glucosamine administration to modulate insulin sensitivity or&#xD;
      capillary recruitment in humans. This is a significant concern because insulin resistance and&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction contribute importantly to major public health problems including&#xD;
      diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Normal healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      obese insulin resistant subjects will be enrolled in a randomized double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the effects of oral glucosamine to modulate&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment. The reference standard&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp technique will be used to assess insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity before treatment, after placebo or oral glucosamine (500 mg p.o. TID for 6&#xD;
      weeks), and after completion of the crossover. In addition, insulin-stimulated capillary&#xD;
      recruitment will be measured at the same time as the glucose clamp studies by using the&#xD;
      ultrasound microbubble contrast technique to assess blood flow in the brachial artery and&#xD;
      capillary recruitment in forearm skeletal muscle in response to hyperinsulinemia. Finally,&#xD;
      plasma glucosamine levels will be measured just prior to each glucose clamp study using an&#xD;
      HPLC method. The results of this study will determine if oral glucosamine administration&#xD;
      causes significant insulin resistance and impairment in insulin-stimulated capillary&#xD;
      recruitment in healthy volunteers or worsens insulin resistance and capillary recruitment in&#xD;
      obese subjects. In addition, our study will provide important information about how plasma&#xD;
      glucosamine levels change with commonly used oral doses of glucosamine.&#xD;

        years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OBESE SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males or females in good general health with no significant underlying illnesses, on no&#xD;
        medication, between the ages of 21-65 years of age with HbA1C less than 6.5, fasting blood&#xD;
        glucose less than 110 mg/dl, blood pressure less than 130/85, and BMI between 30-40&#xD;
        kg/m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have diabetes, hypertension, pregnancy, liver disease,&#xD;
        pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral&#xD;
        vascular disease, coagulopathy, actively smoking within last two years, in treatment for&#xD;
        any form of cancer, positive tests for HIV, hepatitis B or C, or take systemic&#xD;
        corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if they have an allergy to shellfish since glucosamine is&#xD;
        derived from shellfish. Subjects will be excluded if they have taken glucosamine within the&#xD;
        last three months. Subjects with allergies to blood products or eggs or known&#xD;
        hypersensitivity to albumin will also be excluded from participating because of potential&#xD;
        adverse effects from microbubble contrast agent. Subjects will be excluded from this study&#xD;
        because children do not typically take glucosamine or have osteoarthritis.&#xD;
