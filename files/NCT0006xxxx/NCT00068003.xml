    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood&#xD;
      cells from patients' tumor or from their blood, growing them in the laboratory in large&#xD;
      numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect white blood cells from normal volunteers and white blood cells and/or&#xD;
      tumor cells, from patients who have been screened for and are eligible for a NCI Surgery&#xD;
      Branch treatment protocol. The cells collected from normal volunteers will be used as growth&#xD;
      factors for the cells during the period of laboratory growth. The cells and/or tumor from&#xD;
      patients will be used to make the cell treatment product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be eligible for a NCI Surgery Branch Treatment Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Volunteers must meet the criteria for blood donation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients and normal Volunteers will undergo apheresis. Patients will then undergo&#xD;
      further testing as required by the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no required follow up for normal volunteers.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous clinical trials underway in the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch&#xD;
      (NCI-SB) in which patients are administered autologous lymphocytes with anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      generated from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or tumor-infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TIL). All adoptive cell therapy protocols require that certain cell criteria be&#xD;
      evaluated and met prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is also designed to serve as a biorepository for samples and associated data&#xD;
      collected on patients enrolled on NCI-SB protocols, which are now closed. Patients who were&#xD;
      enrolled prior to 2003 were not enrolled on this protocol. Their tissue and data will now be&#xD;
      retained on this protocol for long-term storage. The protocol is concerned with the retention&#xD;
      of serum, CSF, bone marrow, ascites fluid, PBMCs, tumor, healthy tissue samples, and CD34&#xD;
      purified HSCS samples collected from patients with cancer to support basic science and&#xD;
      clinical research activities of the NCI-SB at the NIH Clinical Research Center and Center for&#xD;
      Cancer Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain autologous blood, stem cells, and/or tumor tissue from patients currently with&#xD;
      cancer for laboratory analysis and ex vivo generation of autologous anti-tumor lymphocytes&#xD;
      for future enrollment on an NCI-SB adoptive cell therapy clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain allogeneic PBMC via apheresis, whole blood, or other blood products from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, for use in generating anti-tumor patient lymphocytes ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct genomic, proteomic, and immunologic research studies on samples collected from&#xD;
      patients with a current diagnosis of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cancer must be &gt;= 18 years of age and meet the laboratory safety testing for&#xD;
      infection included in all the cell therapy treatment trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers for PBMC donation must meet the safety evaluation criteria established by&#xD;
      the FDA for donation of blood products including HBsAg, HBc, HCV, HIV, HTLV, Trypanosoma&#xD;
      cruzi, West Nile Virus, and syphilis. They must also meet the strict behavioral and medical&#xD;
      history requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers for whole blood donation must meet the safety evaluation criteria&#xD;
      established by the NIH Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) Blood Bank&#xD;
      for screening of allogeneic whole blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a cancer patient is determined to be a potential candidate for one of the NCI-SB&#xD;
      clinical trials, they will undergo an apheresis and/or tumor resection for future treatment&#xD;
      and/or research purposes. In addition, this protocol will allow for the apheresis of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers for allogeneic PBMC or donation of whole blood for processing into serum for use&#xD;
      in generating autologous anti-tumor lymphocytes in the laboratory, or for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No treatments, investigational or standard therapy, will be administered on this protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a form of cancer currently being studied with adoptive cell&#xD;
             therapies in the NCI-SB.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant because of the potentially dangerous&#xD;
