  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether massage therapy is effective in reducing&#xD;
      pain and distress and improving quality of life among cancer patients at life's end.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relieving physical and emotional symptoms is a key component of end-of-life care. Despite&#xD;
      care, terminally ill patients are still significantly burdened by unrelieved symptoms.&#xD;
      Therapies that have potential to alleviate these symptoms deserve thorough investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 3 weeks. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      six sessions of either moving or nonmoving touch therapy, in addition to usual hospice care,&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. Moving touch therapy consists of massage therapy in which a trained therapist&#xD;
      continually touches a person's body. The nonmoving touch therapy will be conducted by&#xD;
      volunteers who have no previous experience in massage. Participants in this group will have a&#xD;
      volunteer rub specific body parts for 3-minute intervals. Because current evidence suggests&#xD;
      that thoughts of healing may influence the effectiveness of touch therapy, volunteers in the&#xD;
      nonmoving therapy group will distract their minds to avoid thinking of healing processes. In&#xD;
      both groups, the person administering the touch therapy will note all interruptions during a&#xD;
      session, including talk, music, and television. Interviews about medication use, pain, and&#xD;
      quality of life will be used to assess participants; these interviews will be conducted at&#xD;
      study start, immediately before and after each therapy session, and at Weeks 1, 2, and 3.&#xD;
