      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout their lifetime, men are at higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) than women,&#xD;
      however, after menopause this difference is attenuated. This observation suggests that&#xD;
      endogenous sex hormones could be associated with CHD risk. There is some evidence indicating&#xD;
      that the effect of sex hormones on CHD risk could be mediated, in part, by alterations in&#xD;
      lipid levels or other CHD risk factors. However, other evidence supports an independent&#xD;
      relationship of circulating hormone levels with CHD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, which is ancillary to MESA, will examine the associations of serum sex hormone&#xD;
      concentrations with the presence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in 3,259 male&#xD;
      and 2,802 postmenopausal female participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis&#xD;
      (MESA). Subclinical atherosclerosis will be identified using both coronary artery calcium&#xD;
      (CAC) and carotid intimal-medial wall thickness (IMT). Progression will be identified by the&#xD;
      change in CAC over 3.5 years. Circulating concentrations of total (and free) testosterone&#xD;
      (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and sex hormone binding globulin&#xD;
      (SHBG) in stored serum samples collected at the MESA baseline exam will be assessed.&#xD;
      Laboratory results will be merged with existing demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, CHD&#xD;
      risk factor, and subclinical disease data collected in MESA. Cross-sectional and prospective&#xD;
      methods of statistical analysis will be used to assess the proposed associations. MESA is&#xD;
      particularly well suited for disentangling the effects of hormonal factors and CHD risk&#xD;
      factors on subclinical atherosclerosis because of the availability of high-quality data,&#xD;
      serum samples, and CAC and IMT measurements in a large multi-ethnic population of men and&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
