    <textblock>
      Dyslexia is a common reading disorder. Specialized instructional programs can improve reading&#xD;
      ability in children with dyslexia. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) to examine changes in the brains of children who have taken part in these programs.&#xD;

      Reading is a uniquely human endeavor and failure to develop this skill can lead to serious&#xD;
      educational and emotional consequences. Reading more slowly or less accurately, as is the&#xD;
      case in developmental dyslexia, occurs in between 5% and 15% of individuals in the United&#xD;
      States. Developmental dyslexia significantly interferes with academic achievement and with&#xD;
      activities of daily living that require reading skills. Although dyslexia is considered a&#xD;
      reading disorder, dyslexia's clinical signs are varied and include deficits in the sensory&#xD;
      domain, abnormal phonological awareness, and problems in related linguistic skills.&#xD;
      Phonological awareness training and visual perceptual training can improve reading ability in&#xD;
      children with dyslexia. Recent functional imaging studies on sensory and language processing&#xD;
      in dyslexia have demonstrated involvement of the posterior temporal and inferior parietal&#xD;
      cortical systems of the brain. However, how these brain areas are changed as a result of&#xD;
      dyslexia treatment has not been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the neurophysiologic changes before and after treatment in 11- to&#xD;
      14-year-old children immersed in Lindamood-Bell training utilizing either phonological (LiPS)&#xD;
      or visual (Seeing Stars) strategies. These training programs have successful behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes, but neurophysiologic changes have not been evaluated. The study will determine&#xD;
      whether behavioral changes in reading skills result in physiological differences in the brain&#xD;
      identifiable with functional brain imaging and whether initial physiological observations are&#xD;
      indicative of the degree of success of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be randomized to receive either Lindamood-Bell training, a math intervention&#xD;
      (active control), or no intervention (passive control). The intervention will last 6 weeks;&#xD;
      children will have both pre- and post-intervention behavioral testing and fMRI scans.&#xD;
