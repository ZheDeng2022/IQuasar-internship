    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) for treating&#xD;
      patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). ATL is caused by a virus called human&#xD;
      T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) that infects lymphocytes (white blood cells)&#xD;
      called T-cells. Cancerous cells can be found not only in the blood, but also in the skin,&#xD;
      lungs, lymph nodes, liver, bone, bone marrow, spleen, and meninges (tissues covering the&#xD;
      brain). There are four categories of ATL, based on the aggressiveness of disease-smoldering,&#xD;
      chronic, lymphoma, and acute. Campath-1H is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to and kills&#xD;
      normal and cancerous lymphocytes, including T cells. Although Campath-1H is an experimental&#xD;
      drug for treating ATL, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with any type of ATL except smoldering may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, photos&#xD;
      of skin lesions, measurement of lesions such as lymph nodes and skin nodules, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound of&#xD;
      the abdomen, skin biopsy, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, skin test, and lumbar puncture&#xD;
      (spinal tap). Participants undergo treatment in two phases, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation phase: Patients receive an infusion of Campath-1H daily for three days.&#xD;
           The initial dose is low and is increased daily as long as there are no side effects, or&#xD;
           only mild reactions, until the patient is receiving the maximum dose of 30 milligrams&#xD;
           per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable dose phase: Patients receive infusions of Campath-1H 30 mg three times a week for&#xD;
           up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to treatment, patients are evaluated with the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans to measure the size of the tumors every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsies (if skin disease is present) and lymph note aspirates: Up to five biopsies&#xD;
           and five aspirates may be taken to help diagnose the disease and evaluate the effect of&#xD;
           Campath-1H on the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy: This procedure may be done to document or monitor disease progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive treatment for up to 12 weeks. Treatment may stop earlier if the patient&#xD;
      achieves a complete response before the end of 12 weeks. Patients completing the study are&#xD;
      followed periodically with a history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, tumor&#xD;
      evaluation, skin biopsy and skin testing. They are seen monthly at first and then at 3-month&#xD;
      intervals the first year; every 4 months the second year, every 6 months for the third&#xD;
      through fifth years, and then yearly.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder caused by&#xD;
      an infection with the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-1 (HTLV-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATL is characterized by rapidly rising peripheral blood leukemia cell counts,&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy, lytic bone lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin and solid organ involvement&#xD;
      by tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy has shown modest activity and the treatment of ATL has remained largely&#xD;
      undefined and the survival of ATL patients poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CD52 surface glycoantigen is overexpressed on ATL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a humanized rat monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52 and is&#xD;
      cytotoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical models, Campath-1H inhibited tumor growth and improved the survival of&#xD;
      Non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice injected with human&#xD;
      MET-1 ATL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of Campath-1H in the treatment of ATL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the time course of Campath-1H saturation in patients with ATL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the toxicity of Campath-1H in patients with ATL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 10% of the malignant cells must express CD52 and CD25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must have a granulocyte count of at least 1000/mm(3) and a platelet count of&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 50,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single institution non-randomized open-label Phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will recruit a maximum of 30 eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive antimicrobial and antiviral prophylaxis while on-study due to the known&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effects of Campath-1H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive I.V. Campath-1H 3 mg on day 1, 10 mg on day 2, and 30 mg day 3 followed&#xD;
      by maintenance Campath-1H 30 mg I.V. three time per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for response and continuation of Campath-1H therapy after weeks 4&#xD;
      and 8 of maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible to receive a maximum of 12 weeks of maintenance Campath-1H treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have serum antibodies directed to Human T-lymphotropic Virus Type 1&#xD;
             (HTLV-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of adult T- cell&#xD;
             leukemia/lymphoma and more than 10% of the malignant cells must express CD52 and CD25.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All stages of Tac-expressing adult T-cell leukemia except smoldering are eligible:&#xD;
             patients with chronic, lymphoma or acute Acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease. All patients with greater than 10% abnormal&#xD;
             (i.e. Tac homogeneous strongly expressing) peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)in&#xD;
             the peripheral blood will be deemed to have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a granulocyte count of at least 100/mm(3) and a platelet count&#xD;
             of greater than or equal to 50,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a creatinine of less than 3.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Omission of cytotoxic chemotherapy for ATL for 3 weeks prior to entry into the trial&#xD;
             is required. However patients receiving a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least&#xD;
             three to four weeks without evidence of tumor response will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old. There is no upper age&#xD;
             limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic&#xD;
             pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) value less than or equal to 2.5-fold greater than the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal and bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0/dl. If a liver function&#xD;
             test is judged to be elevated due to the underlying ATL, this parameter will be&#xD;
             considered an unevaluable parameter for toxicity determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and sign an Informed Consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must use adequate contraception during participation in this trial and&#xD;
             for three months after completing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic leukemic meningitis will be excluded. However patients that&#xD;
             have both ATL and another HTLV-1-associated disease, tropical spastic paraparesis&#xD;
             (TSP) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing patients are not eligible for the study. Because the effects of&#xD;
             CAMPATH-1H on the developing fetus are unknown pregnant women will be excluded.&#xD;
             Breast-feeding in patients with HTLV-1 infection is contraindicated because of the&#xD;
             risk of transmission of the virus to the child. In addition, CAMPATH-1H may be present&#xD;
             in breast milk and produce adverse events in the breast-feeding child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients are excluded from the study.&#xD;
             CAMPATH-1H may produce a different pattern of toxicities in patients with HIV&#xD;
             infection and in addition the depletion of T cells produced by CAMPATH-1H may have&#xD;
             adverse effects on HIV positive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with smoldering ATL are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously received Campath-1GH are ineligible.&#xD;
