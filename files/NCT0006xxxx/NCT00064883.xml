      This study will: 1) provide standard non-experimental radiation therapy to children who have&#xD;
      a form of cancer or similar disease process that is of scientific interest, importance, or&#xD;
      educational value; 2) determine the effects of radiation on childhood cancers; and 3) allow&#xD;
      for the education of nurses, medical students, residents, clinical fellows, and physicians in&#xD;
      the management and care of this specialized group of cancer patients. Patients in this study&#xD;
      will not receive experimental therapy, but will be given standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for this study include: 1) children with cancer or a precancer syndrome,&#xD;
      such as aplastic anemia or other myelodysplastic syndrome, who are between 3 years and 21&#xD;
      years of age and whose disease will be treated or has been treated with radiation therapy in&#xD;
      the NCI's Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB); 2) patients with cancer or a precancer syndrome&#xD;
      who have disease manifestations of special interest to ROB investigators; and 3) patients&#xD;
      with cancer or a precancer syndrome who offer an important educational benefit to radiation&#xD;
      oncology trainees and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests, and&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Before beginning treatment, medical information such as pathology reports,&#xD;
      laboratory results, diagnosis and treatment history, scan results, and so forth, will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient's medical records. Additional procedures that may need to be done&#xD;
      include scans, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET), lung function tests, arteriogram, or tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then have a (simulation) treatment planning session for radiation therapy&#xD;
      during which measurements are taken, CT images are taken, and markings are placed on the body&#xD;
      to help determine the treatment area. The radiation will be delivered to the body by a&#xD;
      machine called a linear accelerator, which produces x-rays. Radiation therapy is generally&#xD;
      given once or twice a day 5 days a week. Each treatment takes about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the course of treatment is completed, patients return to the Radiation Oncology clinic&#xD;
      for follow-up visits that include blood tests, a physical examination, and review of&#xD;
      symptoms, if any. Visits are kept to a minimum, but continue for a prolonged period to watch&#xD;
      for any late effects of treatment that may occur over a period of decades.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Children with cancer represent relatively rare disorders that are of unique scientific&#xD;
      importance and educational value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This protocol will allow follow-up of these patients for determination of the effects of&#xD;
      radiation on overall survival, as well as relapse-free/ disease-free survival, local control,&#xD;
      and the late sequelae of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Children with cancer and who require radiation are referred to the Radiation Oncology Branch&#xD;
      primarily from Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. and from other Branches&#xD;
      of the NCI/NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This protocol is designed to provide the radiation component of therapy in children with&#xD;
      cancer that have diseases that are of unique scientific interests, importance, and/or&#xD;
      educational value.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
