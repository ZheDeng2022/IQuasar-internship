      Purpose: To evaluate two approaches to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes in young girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Need: We are experiencing an epidemic of childhood obesity. Rates of obesity have doubled&#xD;
      to tripled in the past two decades, with the highest rates among poor and ethnic minority&#xD;
      girls. Type 2 diabetes (what used to be called adult-onset diabetes) is now showing up in&#xD;
      overweight children, and more children are manifesting precursors of heart disease and&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Two Approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A state-of-the-art nutrition education program with monthly newsletters mailed to girls&#xD;
           and their parents and quarterly evening lectures/educational events at school sites,&#xD;
           including cooking demonstrations and games to improve nutrition and increase physical&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After-school dance classes held five days per week all year long at school sites from&#xD;
           the time school lets out until 6PM. Dance classes will include a 1-1.5 hour supervised&#xD;
           homework study hall each day, and emphasize both traditional ethnic dances and popular&#xD;
           dance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Second, third and fourth grade girls and their families will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate. All activities are free of charge. To be able to perform a valid evaluation, to&#xD;
      be able to accommodate all girls at their own school, and to be fair about which girls&#xD;
      receive which program, families who wish to participate will be randomly selected to&#xD;
      participate in either one program or the other (nutrition education or dance classes). Each&#xD;
      family will participate for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation: Trained Stanford staff will perform all evaluation procedures with participating&#xD;
      families in their own homes at the beginning and every six months. Families will be&#xD;
      compensated for their participation.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Second-, third- and fourth-grade girls, aged 7-10 years of age enrolled in one of the&#xD;
        participating schools will be eligible. Our goal is to be as inclusive as possible.&#xD;
        However, girls will not be eligible to participate if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have been diagnosed with a chronic illness that affects their growth and/or weight&#xD;
             (e.g., type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are taking medications potentially affecting their growth and/or weight (e.g.,&#xD;
             methylphenidate HCl, systemic steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have Asthma (not exclusionary alone) but have taken systemic steroids (oral,&#xD;
             intravenous, or intramuscular) for a period of more than 21 days in the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a condition that limits their participation in physical activity enough that they&#xD;
             are not able to participate in Physical Education at school (e.g., significant&#xD;
             structural heart disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are unable to complete the informed consent process.&#xD;
