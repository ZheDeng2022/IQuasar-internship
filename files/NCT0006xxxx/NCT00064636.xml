  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe VELCADE (PS-341) is when given with&#xD;
      Taxotere (Docetaxel) to patients with non-small cell lung cancer or other solid tumors, and&#xD;
      also to see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study, which means that the first group of patients who enter the&#xD;
      study will receive a low dose of VELCADE and Docetaxel. If the low dose of VELCADE and&#xD;
      Docetaxel appears to be safe, then the next group of patients will receive a higher dose of&#xD;
      VELCADE and docetaxel.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Adults with advanced and/or metastatic NSCLC or other solid tumors who are treatment-naïve&#xD;
        or previously received up to two anti-neoplastic treatment regimens and for whom there is&#xD;
        no known curative therapy may be enrolled in this study. The actual number of patients&#xD;
        enrolled depends on the dosing cohort in which dose-limiting toxicity is seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has histologically-confirmed advanced and/or metastatic NSCLC or other solid&#xD;
             tumors, for which the patient is treatment-naïve or previously received up to two&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic treatment regimens and for whom there is no known curative therapy.&#xD;
             Patients enrolled at the Low- and High- Dose Expanded Cohorts must have a diagnosis of&#xD;
             NSCLC in order to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with carboplatin or paclitaxel does not preclude enrollment in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has measurable or evaluable disease. Patients enrolled at the expanded cohorts&#xD;
             must have measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
             Tumors (RECIST) guidelines [1] presented in Table 3 and Table 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status of 60% or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a life expectancy of three months or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has all of the following pretreatment laboratory data within 21 days of the&#xD;
             first study drug dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x the ULN:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient is post-menopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use acceptable&#xD;
             methods of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device,&#xD;
             diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) from the Screening&#xD;
             visit through 90 days after the last study drug dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patient agrees to use an acceptable barrier method for contraception from the&#xD;
             Screening visit through 90 days after the last study drug dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
