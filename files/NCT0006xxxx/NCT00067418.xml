  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) to analyze brain tissue removed from&#xD;
      patients during brain surgery to determine if this new technology can be used to&#xD;
      differentiate between normal and cancerous cells. LSS focuses light on cells or tissues, and&#xD;
      the way that light is reflected back from the tissues provides information about the size of&#xD;
      cells and the density of the cell nuclei (the part of the cell that contains the genes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with a known or suspected brain tumor and patients&#xD;
      with temporal lobe epilepsy that does not respond to medication may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. (Examination of tissue from patients with epilepsy will allow comparison of tumor and&#xD;
      non-tumor brain cells.) All patients must require surgery to treat their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for 3 to 10 days for physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations, blood and urine tests, and other tests needed to prepare for&#xD;
      surgery. They will then undergo surgery. A small amount of tissue removed during surgery for&#xD;
      pathological review will be collected for use in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the tissue will be examined using LSS to help determine the size of the cell and its&#xD;
      nucleus. Studies will be done to measure how many of the cells are actively dividing and&#xD;
      which proteins are expressed more often in tumor cells compared with normal cells. This&#xD;
      information may shed light on how tumor cells are different from normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted for up to 3 years to follow their health status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Optical spectroscopy for detection of brain tumors and tumor margins has been shown to be of&#xD;
      use in distinguishing gliomas and metastatic tumor cells from surrounding white matter.&#xD;
      Optical spectroscopy has the potential to provide immediate and accurate diagnostic&#xD;
      information about the nature and quantity of neoplastic cells, in a minimally-or non-invasive&#xD;
      fashion. We propose to use a new method of optical spectroscopy, polarized light-scattering&#xD;
      spectroscopy (LSS), which permits discrimination of malignant cancer cells from normal brain&#xD;
      cells by virtue of alterations in the cytoplasmic and nuclear ratios of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s); those with metastatic brain tumor; or patients with&#xD;
      medically-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy with a presumed hippocampal source of seizures,&#xD;
      who are seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be considered for entry into this&#xD;
      study. Tissue samples of tumor or normal lateral temporal neocortex resected as part of&#xD;
      standard care will be collected at surgery and utilized for research.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Radiographic evidence of primary glial neoplasm of the CNS (WHO grade II-IV) or any&#xD;
             patient with a known primary neoplasm of the CNS; patients with a known or with&#xD;
             radiographic evidence of resectable metastatic brain tumor(s); or patients with&#xD;
             temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in whom resective surgery, which will include the lateral&#xD;
             termporal neocortex, is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Informed consent from patients age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No racial or ethnic group or gender is excluded.&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Inability to provide informed consent prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medical conditions that cannot be corrected prior to surgery that would be standard&#xD;
