      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib when given&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine and radiation therapy in treating patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      unresectable pancreatic cancer. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the&#xD;
      enzymes necessary for their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining erlotinib with gemcitabine&#xD;
      may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy and may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib given concurrently with gemcitabine and&#xD;
      radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine, preliminarily,&#xD;
      the antitumor efficacy of this regimen, in terms of response rate, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the time to tumor progression and overall survival of patients treated with&#xD;
      this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study of erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Beginning on&#xD;
      day 1 and continuing concurrently with radiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes twice weekly and oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10&#xD;
      patients receive treatment at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are radiologically restaged 3-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Patients&#xD;
      with stable or responsive disease proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients whose imaging&#xD;
      studies suggest a potential for curative resection are referred for a surgical evaluation&#xD;
      before initiating maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy: Beginning 4-7 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients&#xD;
      receive maintenance chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8&#xD;
      and oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-28 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
