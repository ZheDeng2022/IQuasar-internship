  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Super rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (srTMS) is a method of brain stimulation that&#xD;
      may be able to change the electrical activity of the nerve cells of the brain. It has been&#xD;
      proposed and tested as a treatment for brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use a device called the magnetic stimulator to investigate&#xD;
      the safe limit of srTMS, such as intensity of stimulation and the number of magnetic pulses&#xD;
      that may lead to excessive brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with Parkinson's disease-whose main problems are slowness of movement and&#xD;
      difficulty walking-will participate in this study. They will be asked to come to the&#xD;
      laboratory for one experiment. Before and after srTMS treatment, investigators will test&#xD;
      participants' brain function with a series of psychological tests and an EEG&#xD;
      (electroencephalogram). The srTMS treatment is performed by placing an insulated coil of wire&#xD;
      on the scalp and passing a very brief electrical current through the wire coil. The&#xD;
      experiment will last 2 to 4 hours.&#xD;

      The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) needs further improvement, particularly in the&#xD;
      areas of gait and freezing. A promising technique is repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) that, so far, has produced small effects on bradykinesia in drug free&#xD;
      patients in limited trials. The relevant rTMS parameters for the therapeutic effect are&#xD;
      unknown. Use of very high rTMS frequency (50 Hz, maximum output of the modern TMS machines,&#xD;
      super rapid TMS [srTMS] with circular coil design [vs. a figure eight shape]) may further&#xD;
      improve the therapeutic effect in people who have PD. The 50 Hz srTMS frequency proposed here&#xD;
      is in a range that exceeds the currently established guidelines since such high frequencies&#xD;
      have not been investigated. We will look for acute srTMS effects of the primary motor cortex&#xD;
      (M1) stimulation (60% to 100% motor threshold [MT] intensity, 0.5 seconds to 2 seconds train&#xD;
      duration). A multi-channel electromyography (EMG) record will be visually controlled for&#xD;
      signs of increasing time-locked EMG activity, EMG correlates of the spread of excitation&#xD;
      through M1, or an increase of M1 excitability to establish the safe superrapid transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (srTMS) limit. The electroencephalogram (EEG) Record, Folstein&#xD;
      Mini-Mental Exam, CFL and FAS Letter Production Test (words beginning with letters 'C', 'F'&#xD;
      etc), Serial Reaction Time, Grooved Pegboard Test, and Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) will&#xD;
      be done before and after the srTMS session to control possible srTMS side effects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be men and women aged 40 to 80 years with DOPA-responsive, akinetic-rigid PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        After obtaining the informed consent, patients will be interviewed and examined by either&#xD;
        the prinicipal investigator (PI) or a Brain Stimulation Unit (BSU) or an HMCS physician to&#xD;
        establish the diagnosis of PD and rule out any other neurologic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients with a Hoehn and Yahr grade of 2 to 4 while 'off' will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be on a regimen including L-DOPA, and they must have a total dose of&#xD;
        medication equal to more than 300 mg of L-DOPA equivalent, including their dopamine agonist&#xD;
        agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any patient whose record does not contain a neurological examination from the past year&#xD;
        will be reexamined before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any significant medical or psychiatric illness (other than PD), pregnancy, history of&#xD;
        epilepsy, or concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptic agents, or any other&#xD;
        licit or illicit drugs other than antiparkinsonian agents that could lower the seizure&#xD;
        threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons with surgically or traumatically implanted foreign bodies such as a pacemaker, or&#xD;
        any implanted stimulators, an implanted medication pump, a metal plate in the skull, or&#xD;
        metal inside the skull or eyes (other than dental appliances or fillings) that may pose a&#xD;
        physical hazard during magnetic stimulation will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Most of these exclusions also come under the category of significant medical illness.&#xD;
        Patients for whom participation in the study would, in the opinion of the investigators,&#xD;
        cause undue risk or stress for reasons such as tendency to fall, excessive fatigue, general&#xD;
        fatigue, general frailty, or excessive apprehensiveness will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A urine sample for the pregnancy test will be obtained from any women of childbearing&#xD;
        potential prior to the start of srTMS, on the day of the initial interview and signing of&#xD;
        the consent form. Pregnant women will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mentally impaired patients who have no capacity to provide their own consent will be&#xD;
        excluded from the study.&#xD;
