  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that cells in the bone marrow-endothelial precursor cells (EPCs)-can&#xD;
      provide a blood supply to cancerous tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to collect brain tumor and blood samples to look for these EPCs&#xD;
      in the samples and analyze the growth signals that may help blood vessels to grow in tumors.&#xD;
      Researchers will study the following in the samples: 1) the number of blood vessels in the&#xD;
      tumor; 2) the levels of growth factors in the tumor and blood; 3) the levels of circulating&#xD;
      EPCs in the blood; and 4) the changes in the genes and proteins in the blood and tumor that&#xD;
      influence growth factor levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 18 years of age or older and have evidence of a brain tumor that&#xD;
      requires surgery. From this surgery they will donate blood and tumor samples. Participants&#xD;
      will have follow-up visits 4 to 8 weeks after surgery, then at 3-month intervals for&#xD;
      two-and-one-half years, then at 6-month intervals thereafter. At these visits, participants&#xD;
      will undergo a physical exam, a brain scan, and blood work.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis, or the development of new blood vessels, appears to be one of the keys to tumor&#xD;
      survival. Areas of new blood vessel growth, or neovascularization, such as with trauma or&#xD;
      tissue ischemia, appear to release factors that stimulate production of endothelial cells&#xD;
      from progenitor stem cells located in the bone marrow. Endothelial cells for the inside&#xD;
      lining of blood vessels are important in the formation of viable and functional blood vessel&#xD;
      conduits. Recent work suggests that tumors-including primary brain tumors-secrete many of the&#xD;
      same stimulatory growth factors as normally incite endothelial cells to be produced and&#xD;
      turned out into the circulation. Initial evidence suggests that these circulating endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the impressive neovascularization seen with tumors. In&#xD;
      this study, we wish to investigate the interaction of gliomas and EPCs to elucidate a&#xD;
      potential role for EPCs in tumor formation, response to therapy, progression, and overall&#xD;
      survival, as well, to identify potential new targets for anti-tumor and/or anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      therapies using genomic and proteomic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s) seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be&#xD;
      considered for entry into this study. Tissue samples of tumor resected as part of standard&#xD;
      care will be collected at surgery and preserved for research. Blood samples will also be&#xD;
      collected. Blood will also be collected from anonymous normal volunteers who donate blood at&#xD;
      the NIH Blood Bank; these anonymous donors will serve as controls.&#xD;
