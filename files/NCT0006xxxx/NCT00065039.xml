  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in four Catholic schools with children enrolled in Grades 2&#xD;
      through 6. Girls and boys and children of all racial types are eligible for participation in&#xD;
      the study. We anticipate that approximately 1,000 to 1200 children will volunteer for the&#xD;
      study. We request enrollment of 1200 children. To participate, parents must grant written&#xD;
      consent and the child must assent by signing a consent form that is attached. Two of the four&#xD;
      schools that volunteer for participation in the study and are approved by the research team,&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to a health promotion program called &quot;Wise Mind for Diet and&#xD;
      Physical Activity. The other two schools will be randomly assigned to a program called &quot;Wise&#xD;
      Mind for Avoidance of Alcohol, Drugs, and Tobacco.&quot; Students will receive the program in the&#xD;
      school that they attend. They will not be allowed to select one of the programs and will&#xD;
      receive only one program, i.e., the program in their school. Both health promotion programs&#xD;
      will last for two academic years. Each year, every child that is a research participant will&#xD;
      be tested on two occasions, once during the first two months of school (Sept and Oct), and&#xD;
      once during the last two months of school (March and April). Testing will not be conducted&#xD;
      during May in order to avoid interference with school activities at the end of the academic&#xD;
      year. All children (in all four schools) will have the same testing. The testing will involve&#xD;
      confidential measurement of eating habits, food intake, physical activity habits, attitudes&#xD;
      about alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, body weight and height, body fatness, body image, mood,&#xD;
      and self-esteem. The measurement techniques that will be used for this measurement will&#xD;
      include: questionnaires, weighing, measurement of height, and photography of foods before and&#xD;
      after eating. All measurements will be confidential and will not be released to anyone that&#xD;
      is not involved in the management of the study, including school personnel. The total time&#xD;
      requirement for each testing period is expected to be approximately three hours, spread over&#xD;
      four testing periods during a two-week period. The testing periods will be conducted in&#xD;
      conjunction with school administrators and will not be scheduled to conflict with important&#xD;
      school activities, classes, or academic tests. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will&#xD;
      be organized to provide oversight for the conduct of the study.&#xD;
