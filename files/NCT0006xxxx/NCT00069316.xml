  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will assess whether Omr-IgG-am(Trademark), an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)&#xD;
      containing antibodies specific for West Nile virus (WNV), is safe and well-tolerated in&#xD;
      patients with suspected or laboratory diagnosed WNV disease. An initial estimation of&#xD;
      efficacy will also be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I/II study will enroll hospitalized adults with a presumptive diagnosis of West&#xD;
      Nile encephalitis and/or myelitis or those with a positive laboratory test for diagnosis of&#xD;
      WNV infection who are at high risk for progressing to severe neurologic disease based on age&#xD;
      or immunosuppression. Patients will be randomized in blocks of five to receive either&#xD;
      Omr-IgG-am(Trademark), Polygam(Registered Trademark) S/D (IVIG containing minimal anti-WNV&#xD;
      antibodies) or normal saline in a ratio of 3:1:1. Patients and investigators will be blinded&#xD;
      to treatment assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single intravenous dose of study medication or one of two placebos.&#xD;
      The study participants will receive 0.5 grams/kg of Omr-IgG-am(Trademark) or&#xD;
      Polygam(Registered Trademark) S/D or a comparable volume of normal saline. All patients will&#xD;
      be followed for safety, natural history endpoints, and efficacy. A subset of patients will&#xD;
      have pharmacokinetic measurements of specific anti- WNV antibodies assessed following&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability following Omr-IgG-am(Trademark)&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics of specific anti-WNV antibodies, mortality in&#xD;
      confirmed WNV positive patients, and the combination of mortality and functional status at&#xD;
      three months in both confirmed WNV-infected patients and all patients by intention to treat.&#xD;
      This combined endpoint will be measured using four standardized measures of cognitive and&#xD;
      functional status: the Barthel Index; the Modified Rankin Scale; the Glasgow Outcome Score;&#xD;
      and the Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination. A comparison of outcomes will be made for&#xD;
      the group receiving Omr-IgG-am(Trademark) versus those receiving either placebo, and between&#xD;
      the two placebo groups. Other secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients in each&#xD;
      group returning to pre-morbid baseline and each subject's improvement at 3 months as compared&#xD;
      to that subject's worst (of any previous) evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural history endpoints will also be assessed. They will include the duration of intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, development and persistence of WNV-specific IgG and IgM&#xD;
      antibodies, combined functional score and mortality at 3 months between the group with&#xD;
      encephalitis and/or myelitis at baseline versus the group with a positive WNV test only,&#xD;
      outcomes in patients treated late in coma and correlation of outcome with time-to-treatment&#xD;
      following symptom onset.&#xD;
