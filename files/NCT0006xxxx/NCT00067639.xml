  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years PBPC have replaced bone marrow as the source of hematopoietic stem cells for&#xD;
      autologous transplantation. One of the cited advantages of this procedure is the avoidance of&#xD;
      bone marrow harvest, which frequently requires general anesthesia. Other advantages include&#xD;
      faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment times, faster immune recovery, decrease in the&#xD;
      amount of tumor contamination and technical ability to obtain stem cells from patients&#xD;
      previously considered unharvestable because of marrow fibrosis or because of prior&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the pelvis. Filgrastim has emerged as the preferred cytokine for stem cell&#xD;
      mobilization based on its safety profile and the positive experience in granulocyte donors&#xD;
      however, the number of circulating CD34+ cells does not occur until the third day after&#xD;
      starting filgrastim injections. Pegfilgrastim stimulates the production and maturation of&#xD;
      neutrophil precursors and enhances the functions of mature neutrophils in the same manner as&#xD;
      filgrastim. Data form normal volunteers and in studies of patients with cancer have shown&#xD;
      prolonged serum levels of the cytokine, with &quot;self-regulation&quot; of pegfilgrastim levels as a&#xD;
      function of the neutrophil count. This confers a therapeutic advantage in clinical settings&#xD;
      by allowing a less frequent dosing.&#xD;

      Stem cells are a special type of blood cell, which are able to grow and divide. Stem cells&#xD;
      are given to patients after high dose chemotherapy to help restore blood production and&#xD;
      immunity. For an autologous stem cell transplant, stem cells are collected from a patient&#xD;
      before they have chemotherapy, then they are &quot;transplanted&quot; back to the same patient after&#xD;
      treatment. Circulating blood contains a very small number of stem cells. It is often&#xD;
      necessary to use the drug NeupogenTM, by injection under the skin twice a day for three days,&#xD;
      before stem cells are collected to help move the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into&#xD;
      the circulating blood. When the stem cells are in the blood, they can be collected more&#xD;
      easily. The study drug pegfilgrastim is very similar to NeupogenTM, however, it is longer&#xD;
      lasting. Therefore, treatment can be given as a single injection rather than several&#xD;
      injections over many days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, you will receive a single injection of pegfilgrastim under the skin. Starting&#xD;
      3 days after the injection, you will have blood tests (1-2 tablespoons) once a day. These&#xD;
      blood tests will be used to learn if there are enough stem cells circulating in the blood to&#xD;
      start the collection procedure and for tests to check for any side effects of the drug. These&#xD;
      once a day blood tests will continue up to 10 days after the completion of the stem cell&#xD;
      collection procedure. When the stem cell count reaches a certain level (usually 4 or 5 days&#xD;
      after the injection), stem cell collection will be started and done once a day until enough&#xD;
      cells have been collected for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the collection starts, you will have blood (1-2 tablespoons) and urine samples&#xD;
      collected for routine tests. You will also have a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram (ECG -&#xD;
      a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). These tests are being done to&#xD;
      make sure you can handle the collection process. You will then have a central venous line&#xD;
      (CVL) placed. For this procedure, you will have a catheter (small flexible tube) placed in a&#xD;
      large vein under the collar bone. The CVL will be used to collect the stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have your stem cells collected by a procedure called apheresis. This procedure is&#xD;
      similar to donating platelets in a blood bank. In this process blood is collected through the&#xD;
      CVL and is passed through a cell separator machine. White cells (that contain the stem cells)&#xD;
      are collected and frozen and the remaining blood is given back to you. During the apheresis&#xD;
      procedure blood is kept from clotting by a continuous injection of ACD-A (sodium citrate&#xD;
      solution). This may cause some loss of calcium from the blood. To help with this side effect,&#xD;
      a calcium containing solution is continuously injected during the process of stem cell&#xD;
      collection. The procedure takes around 4-6 hours. If sufficient numbers of stem cells are not&#xD;
      collected in a single procedure, the procedure is repeated until the required number of stem&#xD;
      cells can be collected. The maximum number of procedures will be 5. If enough stem cells&#xD;
      cannot be collected after 5 procedures you will be taken off the study and your doctor will&#xD;
      discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stem cells that are collected will be &quot;transplanted&quot; back to you after you have high-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy as part of your standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pegfilgrastim is FDA approved and is commercially&#xD;
      available. It is approved to increase white blood cell count after chemotherapy. However, its&#xD;
      use in the collection of stem cells for transplantation is experimental. Up to 48&#xD;
      participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.&#xD;
