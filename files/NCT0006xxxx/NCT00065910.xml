  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toddlers with autism have poor joint attention skills. Joint attention skills include&#xD;
      pointing to objects, following another person's gaze, and responding to invitations to join&#xD;
      in a social interaction. Improved joint attention skills may lead to better verbal ability as&#xD;
      the child ages. This study teaches caregivers how to help their toddlers with autism develop&#xD;
      joint attention skills.&#xD;

      Young children with autism show impairment in joint attention. The impairment affects their&#xD;
      ability to sustain a shared interest in social interaction and to use specific joint&#xD;
      attention skills, such as pointing and showing. The importance of joint attention is&#xD;
      underscored by data suggesting these skills are important to later language skills. Targeting&#xD;
      joint attention deficits in developmentally young children using familiar caregivers may&#xD;
      result in better child language outcomes. This study will teach caregivers how to initiate&#xD;
      and maintain episodes of joint engagement with their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or to a wait list control&#xD;
      group. Each caregiver and child in the intervention group will participate in 24 1-hour&#xD;
      sessions, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. In these sessions, caregivers will be taught 10&#xD;
      different modules for teaching joint attention skills to their children. Outcome measures&#xD;
      will include language and joint attention skills in the child and caregiver adherence to the&#xD;
      intervention protocols. Children and caregivers will be assessed at baseline, during the&#xD;
      course of the 8-week intervention, and 10 weeks after the end of the intervention.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the wait list group will begin the intervention at Week 12.&#xD;
