  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open label study of ILX651 in patients with inoperable&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study that is expected to last 18 months. All patients will be treated with ILX651&#xD;
      administered IV daily for 5 consecutive days once every 21 days. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the overall response rate for all patients who are treated with&#xD;
      ILX651. The secondary objectives are to determine the progression free survival at 18 weeks,&#xD;
      duration of response, time to tumor progression, survival, safety/tolerability of ILX651 and&#xD;
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease. Measurable lesions should be outside the field of radiation. Where&#xD;
             measurable lesions are within a previously irradiated field, there must be objective&#xD;
             evidence of progression of the lesion prior to patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have adequate organ and immune system function as indicated by the following&#xD;
             laboratory values, obtained less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to registration: A.&#xD;
             Absolute neutrophil count(ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 1,000,000,000.&#xD;
             B.Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/Dl. C. Platelet count greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 100 x 1,000,000,000/L. E. Serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance&#xD;
             less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or greater than or equal to 60 mL/min. F. Serum total&#xD;
             bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL. G. AST and ALT less than or equal to 3&#xD;
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN) OR less than 5 times the ULN if secondary to&#xD;
             liver metastases. H. Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 5 times the ULN&#xD;
             (unless bone metastases are present in the absence of liver metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-cancer therapy, major surgery, or irradiation must have been completed at least 4&#xD;
             weeks before enrollment in this study. Patient must have recovered from the acute side&#xD;
             effects incurred as a result of previous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within&#xD;
             7 days of study enrollment. Men and women of reproductive potential must use an&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method while enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent (includes HIPAA authorization).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure or angina, patients with a history&#xD;
             of myocardial infarction within 2 months of enrollment, or patients with cardiac&#xD;
             functional capacity Class III or IV as defined by the New York Heart Association&#xD;
             Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously treated with systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to the only site of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to study drug or its analogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active ocular melanoma. Patients with a primary diagnosis of ocular melanoma will not&#xD;
             be excluded provided the primary ocular melanoma is no longer present and the&#xD;
             recurrence is distal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of investigational agents within previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known, active infection, or known HIV positive or presence of an AIDS related illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active secondary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of symptomatic active brain metastases, including leptomeningeal involvement.&#xD;
             Prior evidence of brain metastasis is permitted only if the patient has been in&#xD;
             clinical complete remission for at least 1 month after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension. Patients with hypertension must have their blood pressure&#xD;
             controlled on antihypertensive medications as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

             whole pelvic irradiation is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant concurrent disease or illness, or psychiatric disorders or alcohol or&#xD;
             chemical abuse that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise patient&#xD;
             safety or compliance, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
