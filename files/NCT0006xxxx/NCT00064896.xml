      The goal of this study is to develop advances in cardiovascular diagnostic and treatment&#xD;
      methods using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a test that uses a strong magnetic field and&#xD;
      radio waves to show anatomic detail. For the scan, the patient lies on a table in a cylinder&#xD;
      containing a magnetic field. He or she can communicate with a staff member at all times&#xD;
      during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older who require 1) catheterization of the leg arteries for&#xD;
      diagnosis or treatment of blocked arteries, or 2) heart catheterization for diagnosis or&#xD;
      treatment of coronary artery disease or other heart problems may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo one of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Flow Measurement Using Standard Techniques and MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with blockage in a leg artery, blood flow will be measured before and after&#xD;
      successful catheter-based treatment (angioplasty or stenting) using standard venous occlusion&#xD;
      plethysmography and a newer MRI technique. (Patients whose treatment is not successful will&#xD;
      not undergo follow-up blood flow measurements in this study.) For venous occlusion&#xD;
      plethysmography, a large pressure cuff is placed around the upper or lower legs. Thin elastic&#xD;
      bands called a strain gauge are placed around the calves to measure blood blow to the legs.&#xD;
      The pressure cuffs are inflated for 5 minutes, preventing blood from flowing to the legs, and&#xD;
      are then deflated, allowing the blood to rush to the legs. A smaller cuff is inflated to a&#xD;
      low pressure, and the strain gauge measures this maximum blood flow to the legs for 1 or 2&#xD;
      more minutes. For the new MRI technique, blood flow is measured while the patient is in the&#xD;
      MRI scanner. Flow is first measured with the patient at rest. Then, the large pressure cuff&#xD;
      is inflated for 5 minutes. The cuff is deflated and additional images are taken. Before the&#xD;
      cuff is deflated, a dye called gadolinium contrast is injected into an arm vein to brighten&#xD;
      the images. Patients may undergo six to eight cuff inflations on four to six different days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fusion of X-Ray and MRI Images of Peripheral Arteries&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with blockage in a leg artery Participants will undergo catheterization and MRI&#xD;
      of the legs. Special plastic beads are taped to the leg(s) to help compare the MRI and x-ray&#xD;
      pictures. For the catheterization procedure, x-rays of the blood vessels are taken to guide&#xD;
      placement of the catheters. Contrast dye is injected to brighten the images of the blood&#xD;
      vessels. These injections work well in normal and partly blocked arteries, but not in&#xD;
      arteries that are completely blocked. For this study, patients first have an MRI scan of&#xD;
      their legs. During the scan, gadolinium contrast dye is injected into an arm vein. Then,&#xD;
      during the catheterization procedure, a computer aligns the MRI pictures with the x-ray&#xD;
      pictures to see if the combined images allow the doctor to better see where to place the&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fusion of X-ray and MRI Images of the Heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients undergoing heart catheterization will undergo MRI and heart catheterization.&#xD;
      Special plastic beads are taped to the chest to help compare the MRI and x-ray pictures.&#xD;
      Patients first have an MRI scan of their heart. During the scan, gadolinium contrast dye is&#xD;
      injected into an arm vein. Then, during the catheterization procedure, a computer aligns the&#xD;
      MRI pictures with the x-ray pictures to see if the combined images allow the doctor to learn&#xD;
      more about the pattern of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rhythm, blood pressure, heart function, and breathing will be monitored during all the&#xD;
      MRIs.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular interventional procedures are minimally-invasive, catheter-based treatments&#xD;
      such as coronary artery angioplasty and stenting. These procedures generally can be conducted&#xD;
      on awake patients with few complications, and were developed as alternatives to conventional&#xD;
      open surgery. Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedures are conducted by&#xD;
      physicians manipulating medical devices inside patients under the guidance of fluoroscopic&#xD;
      x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are developing minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedures using real-time&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging, also known as MR Fluoroscopy. These procedures have the advantage&#xD;
      of excellent imaging without surgery and without radiation exposure or toxic contrast agents&#xD;
      (dyes). Moreover, because MR Fluoroscopy can produce excellent images of soft tissue, blood,&#xD;
      and of three-dimensional structures, it may be possible to guide minimally-invasive&#xD;
      procedures not possible even with invasive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to develop and test incremental technical advances in patients.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL ARMS OF THE PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with known or suspected cardiovascular disease will be eligible for participation&#xD;
        in this protocol. The subject is eligible under the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject's age is greater than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Expected to undergo, or having undergone, a clinically-indicated diagnostic or therapeutic&#xD;
        catheterization procedure or MRI angiogram procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Section #4: Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Peripheral&#xD;
        Arterial Atherosclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Known or suspected peripheral artery occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL ARMS OF THE PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with absolute contraindications to MRI scanning will be excluded. These&#xD;
        contraindications include subjects with the following devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central nervous system aneurysm clips&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted neural stimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cochlear implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insulin pump&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metal shrapnel or bullet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        When subjects can provide evidence that their implanted device is labeled compatible with&#xD;
        MRI, exceptions to the above exclusions can be made and recorded in the note. Furthermore,&#xD;
        the FOLLOWING SUBJECT GROUPS WILL BE EXCLUDED because of the administration of MRI CONTRAST&#xD;
        AGENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women (Subjects who are uncertain as to whether they are pregnant will be&#xD;
             required to have a screening urine or blood pregnancy test) or Lactating Women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with hemoglobinopathies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with renal disease (eGFR[R] less than 30 mL/min/1.73m(2))&#xD;
&#xD;
        Glomerular filtration rate will be estimated using the MDRD 2005 revised study formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
        eGFR (mL/min/1.73m (2)) equal 175 x (standardized Scr) (-1.154) x (age) (-0.203) x 0.742&#xD;
        (if the subject is female) or x 1.212 (if the subject is black)&#xD;
&#xD;
        However, if the eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m(2) and gadolinium contrast exposure is&#xD;
        thought likely to reduce the overall risk of the medically necessary interventional&#xD;
        procedure in Specific Aim number 2, then with informed consent and the concurrence of the&#xD;
        attending physician, the patient may be enrolled in the study. This would be documented in&#xD;
        the medical record, and the IRB would be notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Section #2: Lower Extremity Perfusion Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patent autologous or prosthetic bypass graft that would require compression during&#xD;
        arterial occlusion to induce reactive hyperemia. This exclusion is intended to avoid graft&#xD;
        injury and possible thrombosis. If an old graft is known to be non-functional, from&#xD;
        radiocontrast or MRI angiography, then this exclusion does not apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patent intravascular stent in a territory that would be compressed during arterial&#xD;
        occlusion to induce reactive hyperemia. This exclusion is intended to avoid theoretical&#xD;
        stent crush or fracture. If the stented vessel is known to be completely occluded, from&#xD;
        radiocontrast or MRI angiography, then this exclusion does not apply. However, occlusive&#xD;
        cuffs may be placed above or below stent devices to avoid this theoretical complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity based on clinical findings.&#xD;
