      The purpose of this study is to determine whether PI-88 is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced melanoma.&#xD;

      PI-88 is an investigational drug that works by a novel mechanism which may reduce the rate of&#xD;
      growth of tumors, and also the spread of cancer cells around the body. It also has an effect&#xD;
      upon blood clotting. The purpose of this study is to assess if PI-88 has any benefit to&#xD;
      patients with advanced melanoma, as well as to gain further information on the safety of the&#xD;
      drug. All patients in the study will receive the study drug at the same dose level. The dose&#xD;
      of PI-88 that will be given is based on the dose that was found to be the best in the phase I&#xD;
      portion of this study. The drug will be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily&#xD;
      for 4 days every week. Patients will be treated with PI-88 for up to 6 months, but if the&#xD;
      drug is well tolerated and effective, patients may be offered further treatment with the&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

             lesions by physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged at least 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have voluntarily given written informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
