  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell cancer. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of a Southwest Oncology Group Phase II trial or oral&#xD;
      STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel&#xD;
      cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the objective response probability (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and&#xD;
      partial responses) of oral STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess qualitative and quantitative toxicities of oral STI-581/imatinib (Gleevec)&#xD;
      administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To analyze tumor samples for activating mutations of STI-571/imatinib-sensitive kinases&#xD;
      (KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB) by denaturing HPLC and direct DNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or symptomatic deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  The primary must be of skin origin; (patients with unknown primary are not&#xD;
                       eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  All patients must have immunohistochemical staining with c-kit (CD117)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The institution must plan to submit materials for pathology review&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Submission of additional specimens is strongly encouraged&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease; all measurable lesions must be assessed (by&#xD;
             physical examination, CT or MRI scan or plain X-ray) within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             registration; tests to assess non-measurable disease must be performed within 42 days&#xD;
             prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic, unstable or untreated brain metastases are not eligible;&#xD;

             treating investigator); patients whose only disease is within a previous radiation&#xD;
             therapy port must demonstrate clearly progressive disease prior to registration;&#xD;

             hepatic metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (or =&lt; 5 x the&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal if hepatic metastases is present)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC &gt;= 1,000/ul&#xD;

          -  Patient must not have class 3/4 cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart&#xD;
             Association criteria (e.g., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 2&#xD;
             months of study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have a sever and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease (e.g.,&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled chronic renal or liver disease, or active&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection, e.g., HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing; for women of reproductive potential, a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test must be done within 7 days prior to registration;&#xD;
             post-menopausal women who have not had their ovaries removed must be amenorrheic for&#xD;
             at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential; patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of study&#xD;
             drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: oral contraceptives may interact with the study drug and should be used&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be taking therapeutic doses of Coumadin (warfarin) as&#xD;
             anticoagulation at the time of registration; patients requiring therapeutic&#xD;
             anticoagulation may use low molecular weight heparin (e.g., Lovenox) or other agents,&#xD;

             next working day&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is&#xD;
                  dose is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday&#xD;
                  two weeks later would be considered day 14; this allows for efficient patient&#xD;
                  scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated&#xD;
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any&#xD;
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xD;
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the&#xD;
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study&#xD;
             has been entered into the data base&#xD;
