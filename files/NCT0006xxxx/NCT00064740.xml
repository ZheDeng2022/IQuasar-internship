  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in treatment has turned HIV/AIDS into a chronic illness. Relaxation response is a&#xD;
      state in which individuals evoke a bodily calm, effecting physiological changes that are&#xD;
      shown to be associated with improved immune functioning. Acupuncture and relaxation are&#xD;
      thought to both induce calm and deep relaxation in mind and body. This trial will study the&#xD;
      combined effects of acupuncture and relaxation response in HIV patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HIV/AIDS patients experience a range of symptoms associated with clinical manifestations of&#xD;
      the disease, opportunistic infections, and medication side effects, all of which are strongly&#xD;
      associated with quality of life (QoL). Many HIV/AIDS patients use complementary and&#xD;
      alternative medicine (CAM) to help alleviate their symptoms and to improve their QoL. Among&#xD;
      the various CAMs, acupuncture and relaxation response are commonly used regimens. These two&#xD;
      therapies are thought to share common features and can complement each other in that&#xD;
      acupuncture facilitates the effect of relaxation response and on the other hand relaxation&#xD;
      response prepares the body to be more accessible to acupuncture. This study will test the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a double blind 2-arm controlled trial and to collect pilot data in&#xD;
      preparation for a large-scale study to fully test the hypothesis that adding relaxation&#xD;
      response to acupuncture will have an enhanced effect in HIV+ patients. For this pilot study,&#xD;
      we will recruit 100 HIV+ patients who are currently receiving acupuncture. Study participants&#xD;
      in the intervention group will listen to tapes with instructions to elicit the relaxation&#xD;
      response as well as music routinely played while receiving acupuncture. Study participants in&#xD;
      the control group will receive usual care that is listening to music while receiving&#xD;
      acupuncture. Study participants in the intervention group will be given the relaxation&#xD;
      response tapes for home practice and they are asked to record the frequency of usage. We will&#xD;
      assess both groups' symptoms and quality of life at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and upon&#xD;
      completion of the intervention at 12 weeks. We will assess the feasibility using various&#xD;
      indicators, including patient evaluation of the study. Ultimately, the qualitative analysis&#xD;
      of patients' study evaluation as well as the longitudinal regression analysis results that&#xD;
      compare the outcomes between the intervention and control groups will be used to help design&#xD;
      a future large-scale study of the relaxation response intervention among HIV+ patients&#xD;
      treated with acupuncture.&#xD;
