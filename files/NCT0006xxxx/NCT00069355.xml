      This 10-week study will examine whether propranolol, a medication that blocks the activity of&#xD;
      the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, can relieve acute stress disorder (ASD) and&#xD;
      symptoms from persisting long-term. ASD is a condition that some people develop soon after&#xD;
      exposure to trauma. They may be anxious, depressed, have trouble sleeping, startle easily,&#xD;
      have difficulties concentrating, and feel as though the event is happening again. Propranolol&#xD;
      has been used for many years to treat high blood pressure and heart disease, and has been&#xD;
      found useful in treating anxiety states such as social phobia and migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women between 18 and 65 years of age who were recently exposed to trauma (between 1&#xD;
      and 3 weeks of evaluation in this study) may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be&#xD;
      diagnosed with ASD and must have been mentally healthy before the traumatic event. They will&#xD;
      be screened for the study with a medical and psychiatric interview, physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated with the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological tests using pen-and-paper and computer tests to evaluate cognitive&#xD;
           function, particularly memory, learning, attention and concentration, and vocabulary and&#xD;
           naming.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emotion-related performance tasks to determine if the study medication can weaken&#xD;
           emotionally arousing information by blocking the activity of adrenaline and&#xD;
           noradrenaline. Subjects perform emotion-related and neutral tasks, such as looking at&#xD;
           pictures with neutral, pleasant, or unpleasant content, both before and after treatment&#xD;
           with the study medication (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Traumatic script exposure: Subjects recount the traumatic event that caused them to&#xD;
           develop ASD. The description is summarized, recorded, and played back to the subject.&#xD;
           During the playback, physiological responses, such as heart rate and skin conductance&#xD;
           (sweating), are recorded using electrodes taped to the hand and chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fear conditioning to evaluate the response to an unpleasant stimulus: Several mild&#xD;
           electrical shocks are delivered to the wrists while the subject looks at colored&#xD;
           squares. Heart rate and skin conductance are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine brain structure. The subject lies on a table&#xD;
           that is moved into the MRI scanner (a narrow cylinder containing a strong magnetic&#xD;
           field) and must remain still during the actual scanning. Earplugs are worn to muffle&#xD;
           loud noises caused by electrical switching of radio frequency circuits used in the&#xD;
           scanning process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the evaluation, participants are randomly assigned to receive either propranolol or&#xD;
      placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient) for 8 weeks During this time they are&#xD;
      seen by a doctor once a week for 4 weeks and then once every other week for the rest of the&#xD;
      study. At the end of the 8-week treatment period, participants undergo the same evaluation&#xD;
      they had before beginning treatment (see above). The decision to continue treatment will then&#xD;
      be decided based on the individual's clinical condition and whether he or she received&#xD;
      propranolol or placebo.&#xD;

      The effects of exposure to severe stress differ between individuals. Still, a typical&#xD;
      response pattern consisting of increased anxiety and arousal, sleep difficulties,&#xD;
      preoccupation with and re-experiencing of the traumatic event is the rule. In most trauma&#xD;
      survivors the severity of this condition diminishes within days or weeks. Still, in some&#xD;
      cases psychopathology persists, and can lead to severe and chronic PTSD. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      &quot;Acute Stress Disorder&quot; (ASD) was introduced in DSM-IV, addressing psychopathology between 2&#xD;
      days and 1 month of exposure to trauma. It has been shown that 60%-80% of patients who meet&#xD;
      criteria for ASD will go on and suffer from PTSD. Nevertheless, pharmacological trials in&#xD;
      PTSD have only been performed, with few exceptions, in chronic populations. Chronic PTSD has&#xD;
      emerged as a treatment resistant condition, with only partial response to treatment with&#xD;
      antidepressant and anxiolytic agents. Therefore, the potential benefits of early treatment&#xD;
      intervention in this condition could be immeasurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A principal model proposed to explain the initiation and perpetuation of PTSD is the&#xD;
      fear-conditioning model. It assumes that intrusive, involuntary, repetitive, vivid&#xD;
      emotionally laden memories of the trauma are pivotal to the development of the disorder.&#xD;
      Although such memories are a part of the early trauma response, in healthy trauma survivors&#xD;
      these memories gradually lose their intrusive quality and much of their emotional charge,&#xD;
      allowing recovery. In PTSD this process does not occur. The impediment to recovery may result&#xD;
      from deeper encoding and consolidation of the traumatic memories inhibiting the normal&#xD;
      process of extinction that is part of the healthy processing of the traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal and human research has conclusively shown that emotionally charged stimulation is&#xD;
      remembered better than less emotionally arousing information. Animal and human data show that&#xD;
      catecholamines, particularly norepinephrine, augment consolidation of emotional memory.&#xD;
      Furthermore, administration of catecholamine receptor blockers cancels the enhanced memory&#xD;
      for emotional, compared to non-emotional, information. These data suggest that administration&#xD;
      of catecholamine receptor blockers soon after trauma may obstruct consolidation of emotional&#xD;
      memories, thereby preventing or alleviating posttraumatic symptomatology. Treatment&#xD;
      experience in humans is limited to the administration of propranolol in single case&#xD;
      descriptions and a pilot prevention study that was not sufficiently powered to allow a&#xD;
      definite inference. However, the overall impression from administration of propranolol in the&#xD;
      early time period after trauma is positive. In light of the neurophysiology and preliminary&#xD;
      data presented above, we propose a prospective, randomized placebo controlled study of&#xD;
      propranolol treatment in ASD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Exposure to trauma between 1 and 3 weeks of evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Traumatic event involving at most minor physical injury (i.e., release from the ER&#xD;
             within 12 hours of admission, without surgical intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Mentally healthy prior to trauma exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. DSM-IV diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. CAPS score equal or greater than 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eighteen-65 years old, in good physical health as confirmed by a complete physical&#xD;
             exam (including normal vital signs), electrocardiogram, neurological exam, and routine&#xD;
             laboratory tests of blood and urine. (However, if patients have had blood work through&#xD;
             the ER or their primary MD within the last 6 months, these results will be used&#xD;
             instead of repeating blood draws for inclusion into the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male and female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Capable of providing informed consent, obtained prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Free of all psychotropic medication for at least 1 week, excluding short-term&#xD;
             hypnotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any DSM IV Axis I diagnosis preceding exposure to trauma. In order to compare a&#xD;
             homogenous subject group we require all participants to be physically and mentally&#xD;
             healthy before exposure to trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment with psychotropic medication other than short acting hypnotic or sedative&#xD;
             medication since exposure to trauma. Allowing such treatment acknowledges patient&#xD;
             distress and ensures administration of minimal level of care. Short acting medications&#xD;
             enables having patients free of medication when absolutely necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of traumatic brain injury involving loss of consciousness for at least 20&#xD;
             minutes or anterograde amnesia for at least 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Blood pressure over 150/100 or under 100/60 (applicable for either systolic or&#xD;
             diastolic measures). Pulse over 100 or under 60 per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease or any cardiac dysfunction with a&#xD;
             potential to develop congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Bronchospastic pulmoray disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or any active&#xD;
             lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Raynaud phenomenon. Potential participants with other immune vasculitis will be&#xD;
             referred to internal medicine consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Risk factors for coronary artery disease: Family history, diabetes, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
             hypertension, peripheral vascular disease or physical signs suggestive of cardiac&#xD;
             compromise. Any questionable case will be referred to internal medicine consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with any adrenergic compound, prescription or over-the-counter (OTC; for&#xD;
             example, preparations containing yohimbine sold OTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unable to comply with study procedures or assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients at current risk for homicide or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Litigation before or during the study. Seeking compensation so soon after trauma,&#xD;
             before or during any treatment trial, may represent ambivalence in the true motivation&#xD;
             for cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse (alcohol or drugs) or dependence&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Women of childbearing potential who are not practicing a clinically accepted method of&#xD;
             contraception or who have a positive pregnancy test or who are lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients suffering from any major chronic physical disorder not specifically mentioned&#xD;
             here, even if stable, will have to be individually approved by the PI or another&#xD;
             participating MD.&#xD;
