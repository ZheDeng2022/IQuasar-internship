      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collaborative research project will address a major problem in genetic epidemiology,&#xD;
      namely the development of strategies to rationally identify and select sites or combinations&#xD;
      of sites for genotype-phenotype studies that will be most relevant for predicting and&#xD;
      understanding the role of genes in physiological phenotypes. Knowledge could be advanced in&#xD;
      both specific and general terms. The project will focus on the genetic architecture of 62&#xD;
      genes either known or hypothesized to have a role in cholesterol transport. The data and&#xD;
      conclusions generated by this project will enrich our understanding of both the extant&#xD;
      genetic variation in these genes and the functional or causative relationships between such&#xD;
      variation and phenotypes measured at a variety of organizational scales (pathway, systemic&#xD;
      and clinical outcome). The additional focus on environmental interaction terms will enhance&#xD;
      understanding of specific gene x environment interactions in the cholesterol transport&#xD;
      system. The project involves three collaborating grants: R01HL72810 to Eric A. Boerwinkle at&#xD;
      the University of Texas School of Public Health; R01HL72905 to Charles F. Sing at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan at Ann Arbor; and R01HL72904 to Andrew Clark at Cornell University in&#xD;
      Ithaca, New York.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Collaborative Research Project will model DNA diversity in Reverse Cholesterol Transport&#xD;
      (RCT) by exploring the genetic basis underlying this pathway and its contribution to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis risk and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given the progress of the Human Genome&#xD;
      Project and the development of laboratory and analytic resources, the delineation of a gene's&#xD;
      complete genetic architecture and contribution to individual differences within a population&#xD;
      becomes (theoretically) feasible. This study will explore the variation in 8 of 62 candidate&#xD;
      genes that will be screened using a battery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The&#xD;
      eight genes (and the 6-10 SNPs within each) will be chosen based upon association with a&#xD;
      surrogate quantitative trait (using a cholesterol efflux assay). The genes will be&#xD;
      exhaustively characterized by analysis of DNA sequence variation, linkage disequilibrium&#xD;
      (LD), and haplotypes in samples from the community-based CARDIA study. Genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      relationships will be determined using analytic methods that take advantage of&#xD;
      population/evolutionary history, underlying complexity, and other innovative approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 1 of this Collaborative Research Project under Eric Boerwinkle will generate a&#xD;
      large amount of new data on complex patterns of variation in a substantial number of genes. A&#xD;
      major objective is to develop methods for analyzing these data to find etiologically relevant&#xD;
      aspects of variation. For each of 62 candidate genes, the initial responsibility of Component&#xD;
      2 under Andrew Clark is to analyze the distribution of single DNA site and haplotype&#xD;
      variation in terms of the population processes responsible for that variation. The&#xD;
      investigators will develop systematic methods to identify subsets of sites that most fully&#xD;
      capture the haplotypic structure of the data and thereby reduce the dimensionality of the&#xD;
      variation. These methods will be applied to haplotype and genotype variation in a&#xD;
      population-based sample of 2007 African-Americans and 2139 European-Americans from the CARDIA&#xD;
      study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms frequency spectra, linkage disequilibrium and the&#xD;
      block-wise structure of haplotypes will be quantified and related to expectations of&#xD;
      population genetic theory. Novel approaches to genotype-phenotype associations will be&#xD;
      pursued, in close collaboration with Component 3, by testing the fit of the neutral site&#xD;
      frequency spectrum to data stratified by phenotypic measures.&#xD;
