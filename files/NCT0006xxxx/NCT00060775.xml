      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to examine brain changes that&#xD;
      occur in children when they are exposed to various kinds of emotional tasks and to determine&#xD;
      if these changes are related to the child's temperament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that the risk for developing mood and anxiety disorders in preschool children&#xD;
      may be linked to differences in temperament. The relationship between temperament and risk or&#xD;
      resilience may reflect the influences of brain activity on behavior at different stages of&#xD;
      childhood development. Behavioral inhibition and mood or anxiety disorders have been linked&#xD;
      to disturbances in the circuitry of several areas in the brain. However, the involvement of&#xD;
      this circuitry in temperament remains unclear. This study will use functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the function of different parts of the brain in children&#xD;
      who have previously undergone temperament studies and have had their temperaments classified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sets of studies will be performed in the current protocol. A small set of pilot studies&#xD;
      will be performed in infants, by staff at the University of Maryland. In terms of the studies&#xD;
      among infants, these subjects will initially be contacted by staff at Maryland and then will&#xD;
      be seen at the NIH for up to three visits lasting between 4- to 5- hours during the first&#xD;
      year of life. These subjects also will undergo visits at the University of Maryland&#xD;
      throughout the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will comprise up to four clinic visits. At Visit 1, children and their parents&#xD;
      will meet with study staff individually and together for psychiatric interviews. Children&#xD;
      will undergo a physical examination, medical history, a urine drug test, and practice in an&#xD;
      fMRI simulator. Saliva samples will be collected from the children and tests will be given to&#xD;
      assess stage of puberty, temperament, intelligence, feelings, experiences, and behavior.&#xD;
      Other visits include fMRI scans of the brain and other tasks.&#xD;

      Objectives: The goal of this proposal is to study temperament and risk-taking as&#xD;
      vulnerability factors for anxiety. Studies have documented that behaviorally inhibited (BI)&#xD;
      children are at risk for anxiety disorders. This vulnerability may be associated with neural&#xD;
      circuits underlying behavioral tendencies, such as components of the prefrontal cortex (PFC),&#xD;
      striatum, and amygdala. Regarding risk-taking behavior, certain high risk-taking adolescents&#xD;
      also carry enhanced vulnerability to anxiety. We use fMRI to examine local activity in PFC,&#xD;
      cingulate, amygdala, and striatum, and functional connectivity with resting state methodology&#xD;
      in two cohorts, one probing temperament and the other one risk-taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: A total of 1010 individuals/ infants (0-29 yo) will be studied. This sample&#xD;
      comprises 2 sets of study groups. First, the BI group includes individuals with (1) high&#xD;
      motor arousal/high negative affect in early infancy to novelty and sustained BI (BI), (2)&#xD;
      high motor arousal/high positive affect to novelty and sustained temperamental exuberance&#xD;
      (exuberant), (3) average levels of both reactivity/affect from infancy to childhood&#xD;
      (controls). Second, the risk-taking group includes 4 subgroups representing the interaction&#xD;
      of two levels of anxiety (low, high) and two levels of risk-taking (low, high). Finally, a&#xD;
      group of healthy individuals will be recruited as controls. Participants will be studied&#xD;
      through their 20 s because both the risk for and expressions of psychopathology continue to&#xD;
      change throughout early adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Assessments will include psychiatric, behavioral, and neuropsychological batteries.&#xD;
      The protocol uses fMRI paradigms targeting different emotional, social, cognitive,&#xD;
      motivational, and learning processes during activation studies, as well as the intrinsic&#xD;
      function of the brain measured during a resting state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures and Predictions: The main outcome measures are fMRI BOLD signal changes,&#xD;
      physiological, neuropsychological and behavioral variables. The proposed fMRI studies will&#xD;
      test 2 sets of hypotheses. The first refers to the BI cohort. BI subjects will exhibit (1)&#xD;
      enhanced amygdala activation to mild threats (e.g., angry facial), (2) PFC perturbations in&#xD;
      associative learning, (3) abnormal fronto-amygdala connectivity, (4) heightened striatal and&#xD;
      inferior PFC activation to reward stimuli, (5) unique neural patterns of attention bias and&#xD;
      social challenges, (6) differential changes with age as a function of BI status (7) infants&#xD;
      of differing temperaments will exhibit structural and functional differences in brain regions&#xD;
      associated with salience and ventral attention networks. The second set of hypotheses&#xD;
      pertains to the risk-taking cohort. (1) anxious adolescents will activate striatal regions in&#xD;
      response to reward more strongly than non-anxious adolescents; (2) risk-takers will also&#xD;
      activate striatal regions in response to reward more strongly than non-risk takers; (3) we&#xD;
      expect an interaction between risk-taking and anxiety-related factors, such as a potentiation&#xD;
      of striatal activation in anxious risk-takers, and a blunting of striatal activation in&#xD;
      non-anxious risk-takers. These effects will be uniquely altered by social stress. Finally,&#xD;
      repeat studies will be conducted with the BI cohort to examine stability/developmental&#xD;
      changes with time.&#xD;
