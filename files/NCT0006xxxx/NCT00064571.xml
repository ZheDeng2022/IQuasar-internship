  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) is caused by injury to the nerve to the affected vocal&#xD;
      fold. The injury to the vocal fold makes the affected person's voice sound &quot;breathy&quot;. Voice&#xD;
      therapy is usually tried first, and, if unsuccessful, surgical treatment is considered. The&#xD;
      standard surgical treatment is called vocal fold medialization and aims to bring the injured&#xD;
      cord to the midline. An alternative surgical treatment, vocal fold reinnervation, aims to&#xD;
      bring a new nerve supply to the injured vocal fold. The reinnervation operation, which has&#xD;
      some potential advantages over the medialization operation also requires several months for&#xD;
      final results to be gained. The goal of this multicenter, randomized clinical trial is to see&#xD;
      which of the two surgical treatments produces a better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to participate in this study patients with UVFP must meet all entry criteria and&#xD;
      must be released from voice therapy by a speech-language pathologist. Information collected&#xD;
      for the study (pre-surgery, and at 6 and 12 months after surgery) includes voice recordings,&#xD;
      movies made of vocal fold function, airflow and pressure measurements of the voicebox, and an&#xD;
      outcomes questionnaire.&#xD;

      Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) is caused by injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.&#xD;
      Patients with UVFP may have significant impairment of vocal fold function, including a&#xD;
      breathy paralytic dysphonia. There are several available approaches for the treatment of this&#xD;
      condition. Vocal fold medialization is currently used by most otolaryngologists and is&#xD;
      probably the standard of care for treating UVFP. An alternative approach is laryngeal&#xD;
      reinnervation, which has a number of potential advantages over medialization but which&#xD;
      requires several months before a final result is achieved. The primary goal of this&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial is to determine which approach produces a better&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with UVFP meeting all inclusion criteria and released from therapy by a&#xD;
      speech-language pathologist will be randomized into either the medialization arm or the&#xD;
      reinnervation arm. The data collection protocol consists of voice recordings, aerodynamic&#xD;
      measurements, electroglottography, videostroboscopy, and a clinical outcomes questionnaire&#xD;
      collected pre-treatment and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.&#xD;
