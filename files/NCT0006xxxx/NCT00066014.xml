    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three variable dental implant&#xD;
      attachment methodologies in conjunction with lower dental-implant retained/supported complete&#xD;
      overdenture treatment. These three methods are all presently used by dental practitioners,&#xD;
      but vary significantly in terms of added treatment cost and complexity. The study tests the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the least complex and costly method provides an equivalent treatment outcome&#xD;
      to other more complex and costly methods.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project utilizes 30 subjects in a prospective, randomly assigned clinical study that&#xD;
      uses a four-period, six sequence, three treatment crossover design to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that defined outcomes of variable implant overdenture treatments are equivalent. The project&#xD;
      tests three overdenture treatment modalities, (1) four-implant, bar/clip-attached treatment,&#xD;
      (2) two-implant, bar/clip-attached treatment, and (3) two-implant independently attached&#xD;
      (O-ring) treatment. Each subject has four dental implants placed into the anterior mandible&#xD;
      and new dentures are fabricated. After successful implant integration, subjects are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of six sequences of treatment. Each treatment is followed for data collection&#xD;
      for at least twelve months before the mandibular denture is modified to incorporate the next&#xD;
      treatment in the sequence. Equivalence is measured in terms of prosthesis retention,&#xD;
      stability, supporting and peri-implant tissue response, patient satisfaction/preference and&#xD;
      treatment complications/failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from this study will assist dental practitioners during treatment planning in&#xD;
      selecting appropriate and cost effective treatment choices. There is an inverse relationship&#xD;
      between edentulism in the U.S. population and socioeconomic status. If less costly and&#xD;
      simplified treatment methods are shown to provide an equivalent treatment outcome to more&#xD;
      costly/complex methods, these simplified treatments can be used to treat a larger percentage&#xD;
      of the edentulous population.&#xD;
