  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well tipifarnib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic malignant melanoma. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the&#xD;
      enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the clinical response rate in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma&#xD;
      treated with R115777 (tipifarnib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety of R115777 in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess RhoC expression in tumor samples pre- and post- therapy with R115777.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate Ftase levels in peripheral blood and tumor samples pre- and post-therapy with&#xD;
      R115777.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of R115777 treatment on T lymphocyte cytokine production, pre- and&#xD;
      post- therapy with R115777.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate time to treatment failure (TTF). Time to treatment failure is defined as time to&#xD;
      withdrawal for unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for at least 2 courses and for a maximum of 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) receive 2&#xD;
      additional courses beyond CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue therapy due to toxicity or complete response are followed every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years after study entry. Patients who discontinue therapy due to disease&#xD;
      progression are followed every 6 months for 2 years after study entry. Patients with stable&#xD;
      or partially responding disease who complete treatment are followed at 2 years after study&#xD;
      entry.&#xD;
