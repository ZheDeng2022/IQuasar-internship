      This study will test the safety of and immune response to an oral HIV vaccine in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The vaccine in this study uses a weakened bacterium called Salmonella typhi to&#xD;
      deliver an HIV gene into the body through the mouth. The body then produces an HIV protein&#xD;
      from the gene; this protein stimulates an anti-HIV immune response. The vaccine contains only&#xD;
      one of the many substances that HIV needs to make more copies of itself, so the vaccine&#xD;
      itself cannot cause HIV or AIDS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transmission of HIV-1 by both sexual and parenteral routes makes it likely that a&#xD;
      successful preventive vaccine against this virus will need to induce protective immunity in&#xD;
      both mucosal and systemic compartments. The long-term objective of this program is to develop&#xD;
      an HIV-1 vaccine that elicits protective immunity in both the mucosal and systemic&#xD;
      compartments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an oral recombinant Salmonella typhi&#xD;
      HIV-1 gp120 vaccine (SCBaL/M9) in healthy human volunteers. This will be the first study in&#xD;
      volunteers to use an intracellular bacterium to deliver a recombinant vector vaccine&#xD;
      mucosally. The study will also develop an Env immunogen that elicits a broader spectrum of&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies than gp120 and that can be delivered by Salmonella typhi or as a&#xD;
      soluble protein immunogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I dose-escalation study of two vaccine components that will be combined in a&#xD;
      larger prime-boost protocol should the desired safety endpoints be obtained. Both components&#xD;
      use a conformationally constrained gp120 that expresses epitopes recognized by broadly&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies. The priming immunogen will be the conformationally constrained gp120&#xD;
      gene delivered orally by live attenuated Salmonella typhi. The boosting immunogen will be a&#xD;
      soluble subunit protein comprised solely of the conformationally constrained gp120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in this study will receive the vaccine. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      different vaccine doses. Participants will have eight study visits over 20 weeks. Study&#xD;
      visits will include brief medical interview, physical exam, blood and urine tests, and&#xD;
      counseling on avoiding HIV infection and pregnancy. Participants will be tested for HIV&#xD;
      infection 3 times during the study.&#xD;
