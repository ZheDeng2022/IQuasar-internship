      This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of neurological&#xD;
      disorders that may require surgery. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments;&#xD;
      rather, patients will receive standard care. The study is designed to: 1) allow NINDS s&#xD;
      Surgical Neurology Branch staff to learn more about changes that cause nervous system&#xD;
      disorders, 2) train physicians in the evaluation and treatment of these disorders; and 3)&#xD;
      establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for other NINDS protocols. (Participants in&#xD;
      this protocol will not be required to join another study; the decision will be voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of all ages with a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or&#xD;
      pituitary gland that may require surgery for diagnosis or treatment may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. In some cases surgery will not be needed. Candidates will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo tests, medial treatment, or surgical treatment to help diagnose or&#xD;
      treat their condition. In most cases, care provided at the NIH will be limited to evaluation&#xD;
      and surgery. Procedures may include laboratory tests, imaging tests, such as magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, angiograms, and other procedures to&#xD;
      confirm the patient s diagnosis or help guide treatment. Patients who require surgery will be&#xD;
      offered standard surgical care at NIH. Those whose procedure includes removal of tissues or&#xD;
      fluids for diagnostic studies will be asked to allow a portion of the tissue to be used for&#xD;
      research purposes, including analysis for gene and protein abnormalities that may be involved&#xD;
      in causing the disorder or in influencing the patient s response to treatment. Blood samples&#xD;
      will also be drawn for research.&#xD;

      Objective: This protocol is designed to allow evaluation of participants neurosurgical&#xD;
      disorders that receive care within the Surgical Neurology Branch. The participants will&#xD;
      receive standard-of-clinical-care evaluation and treatment. The clinical data and samples&#xD;
      generated during standard of care treatment will be collected as a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Participants 4 years of age and older with neurosurgical-related conditions&#xD;
      seeking care from, or referred to the Surgical Neurology Branch for evaluation are eligible&#xD;
      for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is an observational study. Participants will receive standard-of-&#xD;
      clinical-care evaluation and treatment for their neurosurgical condition. Clinical evaluation&#xD;
      may include laboratory and radiological studies designed to aid in diagnosis or differential&#xD;
      diagnosis of the participant s condition or to facilitate treatment. The evaluations may take&#xD;
      place in the outpatient clinic areas or in the inpatient units. Some participants will&#xD;
      receive standard-of-care medical or surgical treatment for their disorder. Clinical data,&#xD;
      tissue samples or body fluids obtained during standard of care treatment, may be used for&#xD;
      research. Additional genetic testing may be performed on subjects and their blood relatives&#xD;
      if a genetic mechanism underlying the neurological disorder is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: No additional research outcome measures will be tracked in this study, as&#xD;
      this study is collecting data for potential future use. All outcomes will be those of&#xD;
      standard clinical evaluation and treatment. A clinical and research database will be kept of&#xD;
      patient s diagnosis, progression, and treatment. Clinical database information may be&#xD;
      reported or be used in other studies.&#xD;
