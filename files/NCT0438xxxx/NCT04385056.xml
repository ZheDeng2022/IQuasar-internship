      Investigate the safety and tolerability of umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the pathophysiological changes that result in the symptoms of bradykinesia are poorly&#xD;
      understood, an inflammatory component appears to be involved. Human umbilical cord-derived&#xD;
      allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have documented anti-inflammatory properties, which suggest&#xD;
      these cells may be effective at treating Bradykinesia. It is understood that perinatal&#xD;
      products are potent immune modulators. It is believed that the positive symptomatic effects&#xD;
      are secondary to the modulation of the immune system, and specifically the reduction in&#xD;
      pathological inflammation. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia.&#xD;
