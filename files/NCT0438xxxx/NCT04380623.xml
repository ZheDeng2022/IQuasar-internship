  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes 90% of cervical cancers and is implicated in multiple&#xD;
      other cancers. The HPV vaccine can prevent the vast majority of these cancers, but it is&#xD;
      underused in adolescents, especially among those within vaccine hesitant (VH) parents. The&#xD;
      proposed research is to develop and pilot test a tailored, health communication intervention&#xD;
      aimed to increase HPV vaccination among VH parents. The proposed research is innovative&#xD;
      because no evidence-based health communication interventions target HPV VH parents, and we&#xD;
      will use stakeholder engagement throughout this study. The research will add knowledge on how&#xD;
      tailored education provided before a doctor's visit can play a role in improving HPV&#xD;
      vaccination rates among underserved, VH parents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this K01 application is to develop and pilot test an individually tailored,&#xD;
      pre-visit health communication intervention targeting HPV-VH parents. The partnering clinic&#xD;
      is Meharry Medical College Pediatric Group (MMC Pediatrics), a safety-net clinic serving&#xD;
      primarily publicly-insured and uninsured patients. The study has three specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To develop a tailored, health communication intervention targeting HPV-VH parents&#xD;
      prior to clinic visits. The tailored intervention will be delivered to VH parents via mobile&#xD;
      phones. Investigators will draft initial content based on the Theory of Reasoned Action and&#xD;
      Health Belief Model, previous VH research,14 and preliminary data. Then semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted with 25-30 VH parents who previously declined the HPV vaccine&#xD;
      and 10 physicians to elicit feedback on draft content. Qualitative data will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed iteratively, informing successive modifications to the intervention to cover a range&#xD;
      of potential concerns for VH parents, enhance message relevance, and refine the intervention&#xD;
      delivery process. Next, investigators will work with MMC Pediatrics to develop and refine the&#xD;
      study protocol. Investigators will pre-test and get feedback on the protocol from 16 VH&#xD;
      parents and 3 physicians to maximize acceptance and feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Conduct a pilot study of the intervention and study protocol to demonstrate&#xD;
      feasibility for the future full-scale randomized control trial (RCT). Based on Aim 1,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a small, pilot RCT with 70 VH parents with scheduled clinic&#xD;
      visits. Feasibility indicators are recruitment rates, retention rates, and ability to&#xD;
      ascertain patients' post-visit HPV vaccine status in the clinical record. VHealth software&#xD;
      will be used to extract information from the EHR to identify potentially eligible patients&#xD;
      with a previous HPV vaccine refusal and to determine the whether an HPV vaccine dose was&#xD;
      received during the scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Examine acceptability of the intervention and protocol among parents and providers.&#xD;
      Parents participating in the pilot study will complete a post-visit survey to measure&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention and protocol, provider trust/rapport, and satisfaction with&#xD;
      provider-patient communication. In addition, investigators will conduct semi-structured&#xD;
      debriefing interviews with a subset of 20-30 parents and 3 providers to gather qualitative&#xD;
      data about their experiences (e.g., unforeseen problems and barriers) and their perceptions&#xD;
      of acceptability of the intervention and protocol (e.g., ease of use, content, graphics). The&#xD;
      findings will be used identify needs for any additional modifications to the intervention and&#xD;
      protocol prior to the RCT.&#xD;
