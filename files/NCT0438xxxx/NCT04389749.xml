  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will directly compare the visual analog scale scores and narcotic pain&#xD;
      medication requirements in the patients who have continuous passive motion (CPM) versus those&#xD;
      who do not during the course of the hospital admission following an open reduction internal&#xD;
      fixation surgery for acetabular fracture, supracondylar femur fracture, or a tibial plateau&#xD;
      fracture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective comparative cohort study analyzing the practices of three&#xD;
      surgeons, one of whom routinely uses CPM following fixation of pelvic and acetabular&#xD;
      fractures, and two surgeons who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, over the age of 18 years who have undergone open reduction and internal&#xD;
      fixation (ORIF) of isolated acetabular fractures, supracondylar femur fractures, or tibial&#xD;
      plateau fracture will be asked to participate. Those who consent will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups. The experimental group will have a CPM applied in the PACU immediately post-op and it&#xD;
      will be utilized while the patient is awake in bed for 2 hours on and 2 hours off, when not&#xD;
      mobilizing with Physical Therapy (PT). The experimental group will also have traditional PT,&#xD;
      including sessions 1 to 3 times a week. The control group will have typical care, including&#xD;
      working with physical therapy 1 to 3 times a week. The investigators will directly compare&#xD;
      the VAS scores and narcotic pain medication requirements in the patients who have CPM versus&#xD;
      those who do not during the course of the hospital admission. VAS scores will be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the day by RN and/or PT. Functional outcomes will be assessed at the one-year mark&#xD;
      using the Iowa and Majeed pelvic functional outcome tools along with the SF-12. Orthopedic&#xD;
      Resident or Nurse Clinical will check the patient for incision integrity each day and each&#xD;
      session of using the CPM, the patient will be monitored for adverse events. Data will be&#xD;
      collected using Epic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will record patient demographics including age, sex, and pre-existing&#xD;
      narcotic usage. Fracture type according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association will be&#xD;
      recorded. VAS scores and pain medication requirements will be recorded from the first 48&#xD;
      hours during the patient's stay. Pain scores and CPM use will be obtained from Epic using the&#xD;
      flowsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional outcomes will be assessed at the one-year mark using the Iowa and Majeed pelvic&#xD;
      functional outcome tools along with the SF-12.&#xD;

    <description>The Short Form 12 (SF-12) uses just 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. An algorithm is used to generate the physical and mental health composite scores for comparison to normative data. The mean score is set to 50. Scores &gt;50 indicate better physical or mental health than to mean. Scores &lt;50 indicate worse physical or mental health than the mean.</description>
