  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human gastrointestinal tract harbours ~40 trillion microbial cells, far outnumbering the&#xD;
      cell number, and therefore the genetic content of its host. How this genetically diverse&#xD;
      bacterial (collectively referred as 'microbiota') co-resident modulates host homeostasis is&#xD;
      largely unknown. We are increasing gaining a better understanding how the microbes modulate&#xD;
      mucosal and systemic metabolic/immune and organ systems including the kidney, heart and the&#xD;
      brain. Therapeutic targeting of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota may help improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in conditions as diverse as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.&#xD;
      In contrast to other organ systems, studies investigating the role of the microbiota in&#xD;
      modulating clinical outcomes in renal transplantation lags behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine (a) how alterations in the urinary and GI microbiota and&#xD;
      associated metabolites impact on host immunity after renal transplantation, and (b) whether&#xD;
      such changes are correlated with post-transplant complications, such as rejection,&#xD;
      development of de novo donor specific antibodies, metabolic complications (e.g&#xD;
      post-transplant diabetes) and infections. Participants will be followed before and up to&#xD;
      twelve months post-transplantation, and, longitudinal microbial data will be correlated with&#xD;
      in-depth immune phenotyping and clinical end-points to define the impact that changes in&#xD;
      urinary and GI microbial ecology have on kidney transplant outcomes.&#xD;
