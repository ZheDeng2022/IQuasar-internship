      RECOVERY is a randomised trial investigating whether treatment with Lopinavir-Ritonavir,&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine, Corticosteroids, Azithromycin, Colchicine, IV Immunoglobulin (children&#xD;
      only), Convalescent plasma, Synthetic neutralizing antibodies (REGN-COV2), Tocilizumab,&#xD;
      Aspirin, Baricitinib, Infliximab, Empagliflozin or Anakinra (children only) prevents death in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RECOVERY trial has already shown that dexamethasone (a type of steroid) &amp; tocilizumab&#xD;
      reduce the risk of dying for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 receiving oxygen, and that&#xD;
      Regeneron's monoclonal antibody combination reduces deaths for hospitalised COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      who have not mounted their own immune response. The trial also concluded that there is no&#xD;
      beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin, convalescent&#xD;
      plasma, colchicine or aspirin in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and these arms have&#xD;
      been closed to recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: In early 2020, as this protocol was being developed, there were no approved&#xD;
      treatments for COVID-19, a disease induced by the novel coronavirus SARSCoV-2 that emerged in&#xD;
      China in late 2019. The UK New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group&#xD;
      (NERVTAG) advised that several possible treatments should be evaluated, including&#xD;
      Lopinavir-Ritonavir, low-dose corticosteroids, and Hydroxychloroquine (which has now been&#xD;
      done). A World Health Organization (WHO) expert group issued broadly similar advice. These&#xD;
      groups also advised that other treatments will soon emerge that require evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY AND RANDOMISATION: This protocol describes a randomised trial among patients&#xD;
      hospitalised for COVID-19. All eligible patients are randomly allocated between several&#xD;
      treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the&#xD;
      participating hospital. The study is subdivided into several parts, according to whether&#xD;
      participants are children or adults, and by geographic area. The study is dynamic, and&#xD;
      treatments are added and removed as results and suitable treatments become available. The&#xD;
      parts in the current version of the protocol are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (UK adults ≥18 years old only): Early phase assessment - Dimethyl fumarate vs no&#xD;
      additional treatment, and additional information on efficacy and safety collected.(Children's&#xD;
      recruitment to Part A discontinued in Protocol v17.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: discontinued in Protocol v16.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: discontinued in Protocol v15.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part D (UK [age ≥2 years with COVID pneumonia] and India [age ≥18 years] only): In a&#xD;
      factorial design, baricitinib vs no additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part E (non-UK countries; adults ≥18 years old with hypoxia only: In a factorial design,&#xD;
      high-dose corticosteroids vs no additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part F (adults ≥18 years): In a factorial design, empagliflozin vs no additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with PIMS-TS (hyper-inflammatory state associated with COVID-19): No additional&#xD;
      treatment vs tocilizumab vs anakinra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients for whom not all the trial arms are appropriate or at locations where not all&#xD;
      are available, randomisation will be between fewer arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECOVERY will also assess interventions for which additional information is required to&#xD;
      determine whether they are considered for large-scale assessment as their potential to&#xD;
      improve outcomes in COVID-19 is uncertain. Hence, for some patients the main randomisation&#xD;
      part A will include an Early Phase Assessment arm in which patients may be randomised to&#xD;
      receive dimethyl fumarate and additional information on efficacy and safety collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAPTIVE DESIGN: The interim trial results will be monitored by an independent Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (DMC). The most important task for the DMC will be to assess whether the&#xD;
      randomised comparisons in the study have provided evidence on mortality that is strong enough&#xD;
      (with a range of uncertainty around the results that is narrow enough) to affect national and&#xD;
      global treatment strategies. In such a circumstance, the DMC will inform the Trial Steering&#xD;
      Committee who will make the results available to the public and amend the trial arms&#xD;
      accordingly. New trial arms can be added as evidence emerges that other candidate&#xD;
      therapeutics should be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: The main outcomes will be death, discharge, need for ventilation and need for renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy. For the main analyses, follow-up will be censored at 28 days after&#xD;
      randomisation. Additional information on longer term outcomes may be collected through review&#xD;
      of medical records or linkage to medical databases where available (such as those managed by&#xD;
      NHS Digital and equivalent organisations in the devolved nations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIMPLICITY OF PROCEDURES: To facilitate collaboration, even in hospitals that suddenly become&#xD;
      overloaded, patient enrolment (via the internet) and all other trial procedures are greatly&#xD;
      streamlined. Informed consent is simple and data entry is minimal. Randomisation via the&#xD;
      internet is simple and quick, at the end of which the allocated treatment is displayed on the&#xD;
      screen and can be printed or downloaded. Key follow-up information is recorded at a single&#xD;
      timepoint and may be ascertained by contacting participants in person, by phone or&#xD;
      electronically, or by review of medical records and databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA TO BE RECORDED: At randomisation, information will be collected on the identity of the&#xD;
      randomising clinician and of the patient, age, sex, major co-morbidity, pregnancy, COVID-19&#xD;
      onset date and severity, and any contraindications to the study treatments. The main outcomes&#xD;
      will be death (with date and probable cause), discharge (with date), need for ventilation&#xD;
      (with number of days recorded) and need for renal replacement therapy. Reminders will be sent&#xD;
      if outcome data have not been recorded by 28 days after randomisation. Suspected Unexpected&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) to one of the study medication (eg, Stevens-Johnson&#xD;
      syndrome, anaphylaxis, aplastic anaemia) will be collected and reported in an expedited&#xD;
      fashion. Other adverse events will not be recorded but may be available through linkage to&#xD;
      medical databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED: The larger the number randomised the more accurate the results will&#xD;
      be, but the numbers that can be randomised will depend critically on how large the epidemic&#xD;
      becomes. If substantial numbers are hospitalised in the participating centres then it may be&#xD;
      possible to randomise several thousand with mild disease and a few thousand with severe&#xD;
      disease, but realistic, appropriate sample sizes could not be estimated at the start of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN POPULATIONS: If sufficient numbers are studied, it may be possible to&#xD;
      generate reliable evidence in certain patient groups (e.g. those with major comorbidity or&#xD;
      who are older). To this end, data from this study may be combined with data from other trials&#xD;
      of treatments for COVID-19, such as those being planned by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADD-ON STUDIES: Particular countries or groups of hospitals, may well want to collaborate in&#xD;
      adding further measurements or observations, such as serial virology, serial blood gases or&#xD;
      chemistry, serial lung imaging, or serial documentation of other aspects of disease status.&#xD;
      While well-organised additional research studies of the natural history of the disease or of&#xD;
      the effects of the trial treatments could well be valuable (although the lack of placebo&#xD;
      control may bias the assessment of subjective side-effects, such as gastrointestinal&#xD;
      problems), they are not core requirements.&#xD;

          -  (i) Hospitalised&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (ii) SARS-CoV-2 infection (clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (iii) No medical history that might, in the opinion of the attending clinician, put&#xD;
             the patient at significant risk if he/she were to participate in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the attending clinician believes that there is a specific contra-indication to one&#xD;
             of the active drug treatment arms (see Protocol Appendix 2; section 8.2 and Appendix&#xD;
             3; section 8.3 for children) or that the patient should definitely be receiving one of&#xD;
             the active drug treatment arms then that arm will not be available for randomisation&#xD;
             for that patient. For patients who lack capacity, an advanced directive or behaviour&#xD;
             that clearly indicates that they would not wish to participate in the trial would be&#xD;
             considered sufficient reason to exclude them from the trial.&#xD;
