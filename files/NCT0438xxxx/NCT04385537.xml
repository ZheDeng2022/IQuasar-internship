  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: To date, there are no published studies on the effects of pecans on vascular&#xD;
      function following a high-fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To examine the impact of daily pecan consumption for a 4-week period on vascular&#xD;
      health and other markers of cardiovascular disease risk in aging adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled trial in men and postmenopausal women (50-75y).&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the two study groups: a control group (CON) following&#xD;
      their usual diet, or intervention group (PECAN) following their usual diet but also consuming&#xD;
      68g/day of pecans as a snack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 visits: A Screening visit and a baseline and post-diet intervention visit&#xD;
      (4-weeks). Anthropometrics, questionnaires, a fasting blood sample, and fasting vascular&#xD;
      measures will be collected at each visit. Subjects will participate in a saturated fatty acid&#xD;
      meal challenge in which additional blood, vascular measurements will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Daily pecan consumption will result in improved fasting blood lipids, vascular&#xD;
      measures, antioxidant status, and appetite compared to the control group. Additionally, also&#xD;
      the PECAN group will result in improved postprandial blood lipids and vascular measures&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;
