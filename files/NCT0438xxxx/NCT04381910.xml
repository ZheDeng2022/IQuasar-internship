    <textblock>
      This is a Multicenter, Non-randomized, Open Label, Multiple Dose, Multiple administration,&#xD;
      Phase IIa Clinical Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of LY01610 in Patients with&#xD;
      Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer that Progressed after first-line Antitumor Therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY01610 in subjects with extensive&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer that progressed after first-line antitumor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were enrolled in one to three cohorts to receive LY01610 every 2 weeks, initial 30&#xD;
      subjects will be included in each cohort and the number of the cases could be adjusted.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive LY01610 start with 60 mg/m2 every 2 weeks，when the sixth subjects of&#xD;
      the current cohort completed 14 days safety observation of the first LY01610 administration,&#xD;
      the investigators will evaluate the ongoing dose tolerance. If the investigator and the&#xD;
      sponsor jointly believe that other doses can provide greater potential benefits for patients&#xD;
      while ensuring safety and benefit, other appropriate cohorts could be explored (such as 80,&#xD;
      90 and 100 mg/m2, etc.) Subjects will receive the LY01610 monotherapy until occurrence of&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD), death, intolerable toxicity reaction, withdrawal of informed&#xD;
      consent, conduct of other antitumor therapy or completion of the whole study.&#xD;
