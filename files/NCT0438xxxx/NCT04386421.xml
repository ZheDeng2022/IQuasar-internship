      The objective of the study is to compare effectiveness of OHI modalities a. verbal vs&#xD;
      videographic material, b. Verbal vs plaque disclosing tablet and c. Videographic material vs&#xD;
      plaque disclosing tablet over 3 months in adult orthodontic patients undergoing Fixed&#xD;
      Appliance Treatment (FAT). Secondary objective of this study is to evaluate influence of&#xD;
      three different modalities on patient cooperation and compliance towards orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that a rapid decline in oral hygiene compliance occurs after the&#xD;
      initial bonding of fixed appliances, as orthodontic brackets favor plaque accumulation by&#xD;
      hindering routine oral hygiene procedures such as tooth brushing and flossing. Tooth brush&#xD;
      access to the buccal surfaces of teeth becomes problematic and predisposes plaque buildup&#xD;
      around brackets. Inefficient removal of supra-gingival plaque leads to the development of&#xD;
      gingival inflammation and hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated in OpenEpi (version 3.01) sample size calculator using findings of&#xD;
      westmead who reported mean change in verbal group for BI as 0.93 ± 0.07 (Pre-instructions =&#xD;
      2.31 ± 0.50 and Post-instructions = 3.24 ± 0.43) and mean change in plaque disclosing tablet&#xD;
      group for BI as 2.9±0.21 (Pre-instruction = 4.30 ± 0.46 and Post-instruction = 1.39 ± 0.25)&#xD;
      keeping the power of test as 90% and confidence interval of 95%, the calculated sample size&#xD;
      came out as 1 in each group. Richter et al who reported mean compliance in low adherent group&#xD;
      of 62.2 ± 32.3 in initial leveling and alignment of orthodontic treatment and 81.4 ± 15.5 in&#xD;
      molar correction or space closure stage. Keeping α = 0.05 and a power of 80% sample size was&#xD;
      calculate to be 33. Therefore we will take 33 subjects in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION : Permuted block Randomization with blocks of 6 will be utilized to ensure&#xD;
      equal representation of all 3 arms in each block. The eligible subjects in each group will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of three groups at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization will aid in&#xD;
      minimizing selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT MECHANISM Sealed opaque envelopes containing random group information&#xD;
      will be used in this trial, thus preventing tampering and reading of the assigned group&#xD;
      before the subject number is given. The sealed opaque envelops will be produced by the CTU&#xD;
      department using a system that automates the random assignment of treatment arms to subject&#xD;
      numbers with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio within each age group. Designated CTU personnel will be&#xD;
      responsible to the production of the randomization list and the sealed envelopes. Study staff&#xD;
      will collect the envelopes from CTU pharmacist prior to randomization. They must be stored in&#xD;
      a secure place and opened one by one, only after the subject has been found eligible to be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEQUENCE GENERATION The Randomization list with treatment allocation sequence will be&#xD;
      electronically generated using a Randomization program at CTU. CTU will maintain the&#xD;
      randomization sequence as it is not involved in recruitment, so as to ensure allocation&#xD;
      concealment. The envelopes will be opened sequentially following subject IDs for each&#xD;
      consented participant after confirming the eligibility criteria BLINDING: As this is an&#xD;
      open-label study so study subjects and investigators are not blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthodontic patients are at an increased risk of developing gingivitis and white spot lesions&#xD;
      due to presence of arch wire and brackets, making oral hygiene maintenance difficult. These&#xD;
      symptoms due to poor oral hygiene will depict less interest of patients towards orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. Decreased and poor compliance of orthodontic patients may not only affect the&#xD;
      health but also the overall esthetic outcome of the orthodontic treatment. So, awareness&#xD;
      regarding oral hygiene maintenance is important. Motivations and encouragement of patients to&#xD;
      improve oral hygiene, improve cooperation and compliance of patients towards orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. Various means of communication has been used by authors to evaluate the&#xD;
      improvement in oral hygiene practices such as verbal instructions, written and educational&#xD;
      videos. The use of plaque disclosing tablet enabled subjects to remove 19% more plaque&#xD;
      compared to brushing alone. Presenting video graphic information regarding oral hygiene&#xD;
      practice and sequel of plaque deposition also resulted in a significant improvement in&#xD;
      patient knowledge thus improving oral hygiene in orthodontic patients. However, none of the&#xD;
      aforementioned modalities have been compared with each other at a time. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      this study will be to compare the overall oral hygiene improvement in fixed orthodontic&#xD;
      patients receiving Oral Hygiene Instructions in the form of verbal briefing, demonstration&#xD;
      via plaque disclosing tablets or video graphic information. Establishing the most efficacious&#xD;
      modality will aid in providing Oral Hygiene Instructions that are easier to understand,&#xD;
      retain and practice in our population undergoing Fixed Appliance Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature studies are evident that improvement in oral hygiene by means of various&#xD;
      incentives improved patient cooperation and compliance. In this study the investigators will&#xD;
      also assess whether these interventions apart from its impact on oral hygiene, has any impact&#xD;
      on compliance and cooperation of the patient as well. A positive change with these&#xD;
      interventions will help in better patient care and good adherence of patient with Fixed&#xD;
      Appliance Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to ethical considerations and patients' equal rights for oral health, all groups will&#xD;
      receive routine Oral Hygiene Instructions. The patients will be randomly allocated into 1 of&#xD;
      the 3 groups. Data will be collected four times during the whole study from a single&#xD;
      participant, initial baseline measurement (T0) will be taken on the first visit after&#xD;
      inclusion in the study however second, third and fourth measurement will be taken (T1, T2,&#xD;
      T3) after 1, 2 and 3 months follow up visits of the participant. Data for both the baseline&#xD;
      scores and after intervention scores will entered in the designed proforma which includes all&#xD;
      the indices used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient cooperation will also be determined after 3 months by Orthodontic Patient Cooperation&#xD;
      Scale (OPCS). This questionnaire will be filled by the patients' attending orthodontist. It&#xD;
      consists of 8 questions to assess cooperation and compliance of patient. Scale covers&#xD;
      parameters like attitude of patient towards orthodontic treatment, attitude of patient with&#xD;
      doctor, responsible attitude of patient, interest of patient etc. Each question contains&#xD;
      equal scores. Maximum scores being 5 and minimum 1. Percentage of scores will be calculated.&#xD;
      Total Scores below 34% will be considered as low cooperation, while scores ranging from 35% -&#xD;
      69% will be in moderate and scores greater than 70% will be considered as higher cooperation&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance of patient will be assessed by clinical compliance evaluation form (CCE) which&#xD;
      comprises of four factors i.e. oral hygiene, maintenance of appliance, punctuality of&#xD;
      appointments and appliance wear . These forms will be filled by co-investigator of the study.&#xD;
      Each component has the same scores of 25, making total of 100. Calculation of patient's&#xD;
      compliance on clinical compliance evaluation form will be the same as done by Richter et al.&#xD;
      Maintenance of appliance, punctuality of appointments and appliance wear will be recorded&#xD;
      from orthodontic record files while oral hygiene will be assessed when patient will come for&#xD;
      their regular orthodontic visit. Presence of soft white plaque will be recorded on surface of&#xD;
      bracket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance Check:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two compliance log will be maintained one by the patient at home and other one by the primary&#xD;
      investigator. A compliance log maintained by the primary investigator will be via telephone&#xD;
      call to the participants in all groups to remind them to use the intervention. This phone&#xD;
      call will be made to check whether the participants have used the intervention or not as&#xD;
      instructed. If the participants have not used the intervention they will be requested to use&#xD;
      the intervention and a final confirmation call will be made to check the compliance in few&#xD;
      days again. Both the compliance log maintained by the patient at home and by the primary&#xD;
      investigator will be compared to check the overall compliance of the participant at the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking the baseline measurements by the investigator will unseal the envelope from&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), containing information regarding the intervention to be used on&#xD;
      the participants based on randomization. The participants will be sent home and will be&#xD;
      recalled for re-evaluation after every month till 3 months (T1,T2 and T3) The compliance will&#xD;
      be assured by providing the log sheet to the participants . Additionally, after 2 weeks&#xD;
      interval, all patients will be reminded by the investigator via phone call to check the&#xD;
      compliance with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the CONSORT guidelines and guidelines of World&#xD;
      Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of GCP (Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice). All those patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria will receive detailed&#xD;
      information regarding the study and only those patients will be included who signed an&#xD;
      informed consent. Any subsequent protocol amendments will be submitted to ERC and regulatory&#xD;
      authorities for approval. The trial will be conducted in compliance with regulations, and a&#xD;
      copy of interim analysis and final study report will be submitted to ERC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible risks or benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks involved in this study as the study is based on communicating&#xD;
      necessary information through video method and plaque disclosing tablets. Plaque disclosing&#xD;
      tablets are considered to be safe for usage and are available as over the counter drugs.&#xD;
      However, slight coloration of the mouth may last for more than 24 hours and stains on&#xD;
      clothing as the coloring agent is strong. Benefits include finding the best modality to&#xD;
      motivate orthodontic patients in improving oral hygiene during the course of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no adverse event reported in the literature related to the plaque disclosing&#xD;
      tablets. The trial related events would be covered by the Department of Surgery. Slight&#xD;
      discoloration of the oral tissues may last for up to 24 hours after using plaque disclosing&#xD;
      tablets and stains on clothing can occur as the coloring agent are strong, these minor&#xD;
      adverse events would be managed by prior counseling of the participants. These adverse events&#xD;
      will be recorded and reported to ERC within a specified period of time, while no serious&#xD;
      adverse event are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right of refusal to participate and withdrawal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a choice to either participate or refuse to participate in the&#xD;
      study. All participants non-compliant with using plaque disclosing tablets or watching the&#xD;
      OHI video will be reinforced by phone calls, while comparing the compliance log sheets&#xD;
      provided to them and other maintained by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial would be stopped if any of the intervention does not control plaque or if there is&#xD;
      a deterioration of periodontal health as revealed by increasing GI, BI and OPI scores in the&#xD;
      interim analysis done after recruiting 15 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one month (T1) all patients will be offered oral prophylaxis free of cost. If the&#xD;
      indices are still high, and clinical examination shows a higher score of gingival&#xD;
      inflammation, additional measures such as topical metronidazole gel and antibiotics will be&#xD;
      given to control the gingival inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient confidentiality, access and storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information provided by the participant will remain confidential. Nobody except the&#xD;
      investigators will have access to it. Participants' name and identity will not be disclosed&#xD;
      at any time. However, the data may be seen by ERC, DSMB or any local regulatory body. As per&#xD;
      GCP and other guidelines, data will be retained for 15 years.&#xD;
