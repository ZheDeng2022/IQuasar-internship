    <textblock>
      The CONFORM-TAA post-market clinical follow-up study is undertaken to evaluate the prevention&#xD;
      of death related to a descending aortic aneurysm or PAU when treated by the E-nya Thoracic&#xD;
      Stent Graft System. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and clinical&#xD;
      performance of the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who receive an E-nya Thoracic Stent Graft for the endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm or PAU will be observed. The E-nya Thoracic&#xD;
      Stent Graft will be implanted in accordance with the instructions for use of the E-nya&#xD;
      Thoracic Stent Graft System and at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating physicians will be asked to provide their observations collected during routine&#xD;
      standard of care for patients he/she had decided to treat with the E-nya Thoracic Stent Graft&#xD;
      System. Informed consent of the patients will be obtained to allow the use of their clinical&#xD;
      records for the purpose of this observational study before data are being collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of data collection for each patient will be approximately 60 months from the&#xD;
      intervention. Source document verification will be performed on 100% of patients; data from&#xD;
      all visits will be reviewed and verified against existing source documents. Complete DICOM&#xD;
      image files of the CT scans will be sent to the CoreLab for independent evaluation.&#xD;
