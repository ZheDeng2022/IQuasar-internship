    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      toripalimab combined with axitinib as neoadjuvant therapy for advanced/metastatic non-clear&#xD;
      cell renal cell carcinoma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignant tumor with a wide range of heterogeneity, including&#xD;
      heterogeneous histological types. In addition to the most common clear cell carcinoma subtype&#xD;
      (more than 80%), the remaining histological types are collectively referred to as non clear&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (non-ccRCC), including papillary renal cell carcinoma (10-15%), chromophobe&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma (5%), and more rare Xp11.2 translocated RCC, unclassified as well as&#xD;
      collecting duct carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in molecular immunology have promoted the discovery of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors (ICIs) and have been successfully applied in clinic. Blockade to programmed death&#xD;
      receptor 1(PD-1) improves survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC),&#xD;
      but has not been validated in advanced RCC, especially immune combination TKIs drugs.&#xD;
      Preoperative immunotherapy (IO) with immune plus TKIs, that is, neoadjuvant IO plus TKIs&#xD;
      therapy, is of therapeutic value. Because primary tumors can serve as antigens for&#xD;
      tumor-specific T cell activation, diffusion, and spread, and then activate immune system to&#xD;
      monitor micrometastasis. Moreover, peripheral blood can be obtained during neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy, which lays a foundation for the study of the in vivo effects of PD-1 inhibitors&#xD;
      combined with TKIs on the microenvironment of primary tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to validate the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant immunotherapy&#xD;
      combined to TKIs in patients with locally advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma. At the&#xD;
      same time, this study intends to assess the relationship between somatic gene expression&#xD;
      profiles and pathological responses, as well as the dynamic changes in the microenvironment,&#xD;
      intratumoral, and immune biomarkers of primary renal cell carcinoma induced by immunotherapy.&#xD;
