    <textblock>
      High quality screening colonoscopy is critical for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention in&#xD;
      Veterans. There is significant variability in colonoscopy quality in VA that is directly&#xD;
      linked to differences in CRC incidence and death. The investigators developed the VA&#xD;
      Endoscopy Quality Improvement Program (VA-EQuIP) that the National GI program office will&#xD;
      implement using centralized quality measurement and reporting for adenoma detection rates&#xD;
      (ADR), bi-annual audit and feedback with provider benchmarking to local and national&#xD;
      performance, and collaborative learning to support colonoscopy quality improvement. Using a&#xD;
      cluster randomized controlled trial, the investigators will study the implementation of&#xD;
      VA-EQuIP and determine the efficacy of its intervention on adenoma detection rates, which are&#xD;
      directly linked to CRC incidence and death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention is a top VA priority. Veterans are highly impacted by CRC,&#xD;
      the third most common cancer diagnosed5,6 with a 3-year mortality rate of 35%.5 Colonoscopy&#xD;
      screening can save lives, and is the cornerstone of effective prevention. The National Polyp&#xD;
      Study showed that removal of adenomas during screening colonoscopy decreases the subsequent&#xD;
      development of CRC by up to 90% and death by up to 50% in comparison to historical controls.&#xD;
      In VA, colonoscopy is the primary CRC screening modality with over 200,000 colonoscopies&#xD;
      performed each year.9 Eighty-two percent of Veterans are up-to-date on CRC screening, with&#xD;
      89% having a colonoscopy.9 However, the quality of those VA colonoscopies is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High quality colonoscopy is critical for CRC prevention. Observational studies found&#xD;
      significant rates of CRC even after normal colonoscopy, likely due to colonoscopists' varied&#xD;
      performance in detecting and removing polyps.11,15 Among Medicare beneficiaries,&#xD;
      approximately 7% of all CRC occurred in individuals who had colonoscopy that apparently&#xD;
      missed the CRC diagnosis. A pooled analysis from eight surveillance studies suggested 52% of&#xD;
      incident CRCs after colonoscopy were due to missed lesions.16 These interval cancers&#xD;
      highlight the need to focus on colonoscopy quality indicators.11,15,17,18 Adenoma detection&#xD;
      rate (ADR) significantly varies by provider and has been strongly linked to both CRC&#xD;
      incidence and mortality. In essence, polyps that are not found cannot be removed for CRC&#xD;
      prevention. ADR, defined as the proportion of screening colonoscopies performed by a&#xD;
      physician that has one or more histologically-confirmed adenomatous polyps or CRC, is the&#xD;
      primary benchmark for colonoscopy inspection quality. Increasing ADR correlates with a lower&#xD;
      risk of interval and fatal CRC.10,11 A landmark US study of 314,872 colonoscopy exams showed&#xD;
      marked variability in providers' ability to detect polyps, with the ADR ranging from 7.4 to&#xD;
      52.5%.10 In patients of providers with the highest ADRs, as compared with those in the&#xD;
      lowest, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for fatal interval CRC was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.22 to&#xD;
      0.65).10 Each 1% increase in ADR was associated with a decrease risk of 3% for interval CRC&#xD;
      and 5% for CRC death.10 Using the methods the team developed19, the investigators have&#xD;
      powerful pilot results showing colonoscopy quality variability in the VA and direct&#xD;
      association with CRC death. From 1999-2011, there were 634,331 Veterans with baseline&#xD;
      colonoscopy performed by one of 3101 colonoscopists with ADRs ranging from 13-79%. In&#xD;
      patients who had a colonoscopy without polyps found, the higher the provider ADR, the more&#xD;
      protected the patient was from developing future CRC: adjusted HR (adjHR) 0.57 for incident&#xD;
      (95%CI: 0.42-0.79; ptrend&lt; 0.001) and 0.73 for fatal (95%CI: 0.50-1.06; p=0.047) CRC for the&#xD;
      highest vs. lowest ADR quintile. Among individuals who had a colonoscopy with polypectomy,&#xD;
      increasing ADR was also associated with reduced risk: adjHRs 0.46 for incident (95%CI:&#xD;
      0.34-0.62; ptrend&lt; 0.001) and 0.53 for fatal (95%CI: 0.34-0.84; ptrend=0.006) CRC for the&#xD;
      highest vs. lowest quintile. A 5% absolute increase in ADR was associated with relative&#xD;
      reductions in fatal CRC risk of 4% after normal colonoscopy (adjHR 0.96, 95%CI: 0.95-0.97)&#xD;
      and 6% after polypectomy (adjHR 0.94; 95%CI: 0.89-0.98) Other important quality metrics,&#xD;
      including bowel preparation quality20-23 and cecal intubation rate11 also impact patient&#xD;
      outcomes with poor bowel preparation and incomplete examinations associated with missed&#xD;
      lesions24 and need for earlier repeat procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit and feedback of colonoscopy quality improves performance and outcomes. The VA Surgical&#xD;
      Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) is an example of a VA nationwide reporting system that&#xD;
      formed to focus on quality and has led to a decrease in mortality of 47% in patients 30 days&#xD;
      after surgery.25-27 VASQUIP provides information to providers for self-assessment and quality&#xD;
      improvement purposes.25 There is similarly strong evidence that providing colonoscopy&#xD;
      performance feedback12,28,29 improves quality and patient outcomes.12,28 Kahi and colleagues&#xD;
      showed in a single-center VA setting that a quarterly report card improved colonoscopy&#xD;
      quality.28 Most recently, in a large prospective European cohort study evaluating annual&#xD;
      feedback and quality benchmark indicators on screening colonoscopy performance,12 the&#xD;
      majority of the endoscopists (74.5%) increased their annual ADR. Moreover, individuals&#xD;
      examined by endoscopists in the highest ADR quintile (&gt; 24.6%) had significantly lower risk&#xD;
      of interval CRC and death. When compared with no increase in ADR, reaching or maintaining the&#xD;
      highest quintile ADR decreased adjusted hazard ratios for interval and fatal CRC to 0.27 (95%&#xD;
      CI, 0.12-0.63; P = .03), and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.06-0.56; P = .03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Gap: Quality reporting improves patient outcomes. The national VA healthcare system&#xD;
      currently lacks a reliable, efficient program to routinely measure and report colonoscopy&#xD;
      quality.13 Accurate measurement of quality metrics is challenging, because validated quality&#xD;
      metrics are not available in structured VA data from VA CDW. The challenge is multifactorial.&#xD;
      Colonoscopy procedure documentation resides in text notes in Vista/CPRS or endoscopic&#xD;
      reporting software. The commonly used VA endoscopy note writer software programs (i.e.&#xD;
      Endopro�, Provation�, etc) do not facilitate tracking pathology data and quality measurement.&#xD;
      None of the current VA endoscopy reporting programs link to VA pathology data (to determine&#xD;
      ADR); and production-level pathology data is not in the CDW. Thus, within VA, there has not&#xD;
      been a reliable, efficient way to track critical procedure and pathology results to measure&#xD;
      colonoscopy quality and ensure optimal protection from CRC incidence and death for Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Solution and Rationale for Study: The foundation of VA-EQuIP is a novel natural&#xD;
      language processing (NLP) algorithm and informatics reporting infrastructure that the&#xD;
      investigators developed to measure the quality of colonoscopies performed by individual VA&#xD;
      colonoscopists.30 The team will evaluate a national quality improvement program to better&#xD;
      understand how and why such a program is effective or ineffective in different contexts. This&#xD;
      study is critically needed to allow us to perform a rigorous evaluation to answer&#xD;
      implementation science questions and to advance the clinical and epidemiologic knowledge on&#xD;
      the impact of colonoscopy quality on CRC mortality. Leveraging the informatics investment&#xD;
      made by HSR&amp;D as well as the National GI Program office partnership in quality improvement&#xD;
      initiatives, the roll out of VA-EQuIP is a rare opportunity to study, in real time, the&#xD;
      deployment and impact of a large-scale learning health system initiative. Most existing&#xD;
      performance measures are calculated at the facility level. The concept of calculating metrics&#xD;
      from individual provider procedures and comparing these metrics not only with local peers but&#xD;
      with national providers represents a profound culture shift. This is where implementation&#xD;
      science becomes essential, especially with respect to stakeholder engagement, adaptation and&#xD;
      tailoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A primary justification for this study is that VA-EQuIP has a high probability of improving a&#xD;
      quality metric outcome (ADR) directly associated with CRC death, one of the most common&#xD;
      cancers in Veterans. A randomized controlled trial of this magnitude is an opportunity to&#xD;
      show, for the first time, that even small improvements in clinical performance from audit and&#xD;
      feedback can save Veterans lives, since even a 1% increase in ADR translates to a 3%&#xD;
      reduction in interval cancer death. The proposal for a randomized program evaluation is a&#xD;
      tremendous opportunity to determine the large scale effect of the audit and feedback strategy&#xD;
      on changes in the colonoscopy quality metrics of individual endoscopists over time. The&#xD;
      evaluation of VA-EQuIP implementation will identify factors associated with effective&#xD;
      implementation and colonoscopy quality improvement (impact) at VA sites. Prior and planned&#xD;
      work builds toward long-term goal to reduce mortality in Veterans by increasing early&#xD;
      detection of CRC and inform national quality improvement initiatives such as remediation&#xD;
      training for continual low performing endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, with upcoming expansion to community care, VA will be making policy decisions about&#xD;
      what services should be furnished by VA versus non-VA providers. It is more crucial than ever&#xD;
      that health services researchers apply rigorous methods to identify meaningful quality&#xD;
      metrics that are linked by evidence to patient outcomes so that these measures of quality&#xD;
      will be used to justify such crucial &quot;make versus buy&quot; determinations. It is hopeful that the&#xD;
      investigators study will not only improve colonoscopy quality but also provide a framework&#xD;
      for assessing the quality of other procedures such as bone marrow biopsy or bronchoscopy.&#xD;
