      To Observe the Efficacy and Safety of Pyrotinib Maleate in Patients With HER2-positive&#xD;
      Advanced Colorectal Cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, two-cohort phase II trial, assessing the&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR) of pyrotinib monotherapy (Cohort 1) or in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab (Cohort 2), in HER2-positive advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2 positivity is centrally established by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and silver in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (SISH). To be HER2 eligible the original tumor, or the biopsied metastasis&#xD;
      (whichever is last available), must be IHC 3+ or 2+ in more than 50% of cells, confirmed by&#xD;
      SISH or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0. For IHC a&#xD;
      positive staining (3+) is defined as an intense membrane staining which can be&#xD;
      circumferential, basolateral, or lateral of the tumor cells.&#xD;
