    <textblock>
      Sixty physically active patients (aged 18-45) with chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy&#xD;
      will be recruited to take part in the study. The patients will be diagnosed by a sports&#xD;
      medicine doctor and an MRI scan and will be experiencing palpable Achilles pain at the time&#xD;
      of inclusion. The patients will be randomized into either a group performing the Silbernagel&#xD;
      combined concentric-eccentric program, or a group performing a novel multi-phase program with&#xD;
      specific outcome measures. The study will assess the patients calf strength, reactive&#xD;
      strength and running biomechanics at baseline, week's 6 and 12 of a rehabilitation program&#xD;
      and be available for a 6 month, 12 month and 2 year follow-up interview. The VISA-A&#xD;
      questionnaire will be the primary outcome measure and will be completed at each testing and&#xD;
      follow-up session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achilles tendinopathy is an overuse injury commonly seen in sports and physical activities&#xD;
      that involve running, jumping and hopping. Patients with Achilles tendinopathy experience&#xD;
      pain, morning stiffness and reduced ability to exercise. This condition can last for several&#xD;
      years in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise therapy in the form of resistance training has been demonstrated to be the most&#xD;
      effective rehabilitation tool to reduce pain and increase function in patients with Achilles&#xD;
      tendinopathy. Patients often experience clinical improvements before any meaningful&#xD;
      structural changes on MRI or ultrasound imaging are observed. Returning athletes back to&#xD;
      competitive sport requires a progressive loading program to enable them to tolerate high&#xD;
      stretch-shortening cycle loads appropriate to the demands of their sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SSC6 rehabilitation program is a six-stage pathway with a focus on strength development&#xD;
      of the local muscle-tendon unit and the kinetic chain, the development of power and kinetic&#xD;
      strength, running biomechanics and running load modification. The progression through each&#xD;
      phase is guided by objective outcome criteria based on pain and function, strength and&#xD;
      performance tests and achieving individualised resistance load targets. The strength and&#xD;
      power exercises are performed at high intensity three days per week with 48 hours recovery.&#xD;
      The Silbernagel program is a four-phase involves a daily exercise program of lower intensity&#xD;
      with progression through each phase guided by symptoms and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the effectiveness of a comprehensive Achilles tendinopathy&#xD;
      rehabilitation program with progression criteria with a common Achilles tendinopathy&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. Sixty recreationally-active subjects aged between 18-45 years who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria, will be recruited to partake in this study. The subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups where they will undergo a multi-phase rehabilitation&#xD;
      program. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, to monitor pain and&#xD;
      functional response, biomechanical and structural changes. At 6, 12 and 24 months following&#xD;
      the commencement of the rehabilitation program, patients will be required to complete a&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaire to monitor progress and any re-injury incidence that may have&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following testing protocols will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VISA-A Questionnaire The VISA-A questionnaire has been shown to be a valid, reliable and&#xD;
           easy to use outcome measure tool for intervention studies on Achilles tendinopathy. It&#xD;
           consists of eight questions regarding pain and function during both daily living and&#xD;
           sporting activities. The overall score is between 0-100 where higher scores represent&#xD;
           reduced pain and improved function. An improvement of 21 points between 2 and 12 weeks&#xD;
           of a rehabilitation program have been typically observed. The difference in VISA-A score&#xD;
           between both training protocols from baseline testing to the outcome testing at 6 weeks,&#xD;
           12 weeks, 6 and 12 months; will formulate the primary outcome measure for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ankle isokinetic testing Achilles tendinopathy has been associated with reduced plantar&#xD;
           flexor strength. Isokinetic testing is commonly used to measure plantarflexor peak&#xD;
           torque. The subjects will perform 2 isokinetic tests. In the first test the subjects&#xD;
           will lie in a prone position in an isokinetic dynamometer with full knee extension and&#xD;
           the foot securely strapped to a pedal a neutral ankle position (tibia perpendicular to&#xD;
           the sole of the foot). The centre of rotation of the ankle axis will be aligned with the&#xD;
           dynamometer. Subjects will be asked to perform a warm-up involving 5 sub maximal&#xD;
           concentric plantarflexion and dorsiflexion contractions between 60-100% of their&#xD;
           self-perceived MVC. The subjects will then be required to produce a maximal&#xD;
           plantarflexion force 5 repetitions for 2 sets with a 1 minute rest between sets. In the&#xD;
           second test the subjects will lie in supine position with the knee flexed to 80ยบ in&#xD;
           order to specifically test the peak torque of the soleus. The same warm-up protocol and&#xD;
           sets and repetitions as the previous test will apply. Both tests will use a speed of 60ยบ&#xD;
           per second and operate through an ankle range of between 30ยบ plantarflexion and 20ยบ&#xD;
           dorsiflexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Running biomechanics Altered running biomechanics and muscle recruitment strategies have&#xD;
           been highlighted in runners with Achilles tendinopathy. The subjects will be asked to&#xD;
           run on the treadmill at a self-selected sub maximal speed. Using 3D motion analysis (Run&#xD;
           3D, Oxford, United Kingdom), a number of biomechanical variables will be measured. These&#xD;
           include: vertical and leg stiffness, contact time, flight time, stride length, stride&#xD;
           frequency and joint angular displacements from initial contact to mid stance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hop testing Achilles tendon material properties contribute to stretch shortening cycle&#xD;
           performance during hopping tasks. Reduced tendon mechanical properties, plantar flexor&#xD;
           muscle rate of force development and deficits on a single leg horizontal hop have&#xD;
           previously been observed in patients with Achilles tendinopathy. Jump height, ground&#xD;
           contact time and reactive strength index (RSI) will be measured using a double and&#xD;
           single leg drop jump. Vertical, leg and ankle joint stiffness will be calculated using a&#xD;
           novel single leg hurdle hop test. A pilot study has previously been carried out on 10&#xD;
           healthy subjects prior to the commencement of the Achilles RCT study. Good to excellent&#xD;
           reliability was found for of vertical stiffness, contact time, ground reaction force,&#xD;
           hop distance and rebound distance and 3 trials were sufficient to obtain a true measure&#xD;
           of performance across most variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjective questionnaire After the completion of the rehabilitation program patients&#xD;
           will be ask to provide feedback on the prescribed program and will complete a training&#xD;
           diary where compliance and adherence to the program will be monitored.&#xD;
