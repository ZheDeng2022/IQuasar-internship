  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well pembrolizumab and carboplatin work in treating&#xD;
      patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with carboplatin may work better&#xD;
      in treating patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -2 of cycle 1 only.&#xD;
      Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 6 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months for year 1, and every 6 months for year 2.&#xD;
