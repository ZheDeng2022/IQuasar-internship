  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury occurs in up to 30% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Cardiac&#xD;
      surgery associated-acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is characterized by a sudden and sustained&#xD;
      decrease in renal function with insufficient elimination waste products. The problem is that&#xD;
      postoperative diagnosis of CSA-AKI is delayed because it relies solely upon the slow and&#xD;
      unreliable rise in serum creatinine (SCr) levels that may lead to delayed start in treatment&#xD;
      and increased risk of adverse outcomes. We hypothesize that Matrix Metalloproteins (MMPs) -2,&#xD;
      -9 and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) are associated with and earlier&#xD;
      detectors of CSA-AKI compared to levels of SCr.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), although essential to the performance of most cardiac&#xD;
      operations, has been shown to cause injury to other organs, particularly to the kidneys and&#xD;
      brain. Matrix Metalloproteins (MMPs) are ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes that degrade&#xD;
      extracellular matrix and have been shown to be involved in injury to transplant kidneys. To&#xD;
      date, no interventions are available to decrease the risk of cardiac surgery associated-acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (CSA-AKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGAL is a known indicator of injury to kidney, thus making it a promising biomarker for&#xD;
      CSA-AKI. It may be that a single biomarker will not be sensitive and specific across the&#xD;
      spectrum of CSA-AKI. This research investigates MMP-2, -9 and Neutrophil&#xD;
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and their association with and earlier detection of&#xD;
      CSA-AKI compared to levels of SCr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that increased activity of MMPs are associated with CSA-AKI. Furthermore,&#xD;
      MMP-2 and/ or -9 may be predictors and/ or biomarkers for the early detection of CSA-AKI&#xD;
      compared to serum levels of creatinine.&#xD;
