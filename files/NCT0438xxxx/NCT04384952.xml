  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;After summer break, the reading performance of dyslexic children declines more than those of&#xD;
      non-dyslexic children. Indeed, during the summer, dyslexic children are less inclined to read&#xD;
      and their consultations with speech therapist are usually suspended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive speech therapy programs proved to be efficient during the summer, to maintain&#xD;
      reading level of dyslexic children. However these programs are expensive and not easy to&#xD;
      generalise. Some other studies tested reading therapy programs applied by parents at home. It&#xD;
      proved to be effective and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the hypothesis of the present study is: a parent-administered reading therapy program&#xD;
      during the summer break could stabilise the reading performance of dyslexic children after&#xD;
      the summer. On the contrary the investigators assume the control group reading performance&#xD;
      would decrease.&quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Dyslexia is a specific learning disability characterised by reading difficulties, not caused&#xD;
      by developmental, neurological or sensory (vision or hearing) disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After summer break, the reading performance of dyslexic children declines more than those of&#xD;
      non-dyslexic children. Indeed, during the summer, dyslexic children are less inclined to read&#xD;
      and their consultations with speech therapist are usually suspended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive reading therapy programs proved to be efficient during the summer, to maintain&#xD;
      reading level of dyslexic children. However these programs are expensive and not easy to&#xD;
      generalise. Some other studies tested reading therapy programs applied by parents at home. It&#xD;
      proved to be effective and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the hypothesis of the present study is: a parent-administered reading therapy program&#xD;
      during the summer break could stabilise the reading performance of dyslexic children (grade 3&#xD;
      to 5) after the summer. On the contrary the investigators assume the control group reading&#xD;
      performance would decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a controlled randomised trial, the investigators will compare the reading performance of&#xD;
      two groups of dyslexic children with the same type of dyslexia (with visual information&#xD;
      treatment deficit). All of them are diagnosed by the Reference Centre for learning&#xD;
      disabilities (CRTLA), a Robert Debré Hospital's Unit, Paris (France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity and duration : 6 weeks during the summer break. 15 minutes/day, 5 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group : Parent-administered reading therapy program. Control group : Dyslexic's&#xD;
      Holiday Workbook (Hatier Editor). This study's main objective consists in evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness in reading performance of a parent-administered reading training program during&#xD;
      the summer break for dyslexic children.&#xD;
