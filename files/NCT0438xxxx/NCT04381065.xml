  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether persons with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PwP) whose Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms are uncontrolled have improved clinical patient&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life when managed with the aid of objective measurement and use of&#xD;
      PKG target ranges compared to PwP treated using only standard of care (SOC) (medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the value of the Personal KinetiGraph®&#xD;
      (PKG®) System and SOC vs. the SOC alone for treatment of PwP. The study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, quality of life outcomes, health economic benefits, duration of controlled&#xD;
      status, and need for additional PD treatment through 3 years follow-up of PwP specifically&#xD;
      treated to a target range when using the PKG data in the clinical management of PD in routine&#xD;
      clinical care compared to those managed with SOC alone. All subjects will be treated by&#xD;
      Movement Disorder Specialists and General Neurologists with expertise in PD. Both groups will&#xD;
      be recommended to undergo treatment changes until they reach a &quot;controlled state&quot; that is&#xD;
      determined by either the clinician using SOC (PKG- Group) or using recommended target ranges&#xD;
      for PKG scores and SOC assessments (PKG+ Group). Investigators will utilize standard&#xD;
      available treatments to manage these PwP in both groups.&#xD;

    <description>The Personal KinetiGraph (PKG®) System consists of the following:&#xD;
A wrist-worn movement recording device known as the PKG® Watch, designed to acquire data on the kinematics of movement disorder symptoms over a 6-10 day period&#xD;
Proprietary algorithms to translate raw movement data collected by the PKG® Watch&#xD;
Data-driven report known as the PKG®&#xD;
The PKG® provides continuous, objective, ambulatory assessment of the treatable and disabling symptoms of Parkinson's disease including tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia. The PKG® also provides an assessment of daytime somnolence and an indication of propensity for impulsive behaviors.</description>
