    <textblock>
      This study will find out if a meal replacement of this type is satisfying and tolerable for&#xD;
      men with prostate cancer. Participants will receive meal replacements of TalityTM as their&#xD;
      expected sole source of nutrition for 4 weeks. The purpose of the study is to test whether&#xD;
      TalityTM Synthetic Meal Replacements are suitable to be used in larger studies of patients&#xD;
      with prostate or other types of cancer.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: Determine the appeal/tolerability/palatability of a diet consisting solely&#xD;
      of TalityTM synthetic meal replacement in participants with prostate cancer Secondary&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate the effect of TalityTM on safety parameters including laboratory tests,&#xD;
      nutritional status and adverse effects&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy-proven prostate cancer with stable or rising PSA levels, defined as three&#xD;
             consecutive PSA levels, each value greater than 1 week apart, with fluctuation between&#xD;
             the three values no more than 10% downward. The third PSA needs to be within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment and &gt;= 0.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may previously have been on any regimen of chemotherapy completed at least&#xD;
             one month prior. Patients may be on any stable form of anti-androgen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males &gt;= age 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of &lt;= 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no clinically significant abnormalities of organ or bone marrow&#xD;
             function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document, and the willingness/ability to comply with the protocol&#xD;
             activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy within one month prior to enrollment or plans to receive chemotherapy&#xD;
             within one month after enrollment. Patients who are expected to require new or&#xD;
             modified anti-androgen therapy during the course of the study are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other Investigational Agents during the course of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who experience frequent symptoms of a gastrointestinal nature (e.g.,&#xD;
             diarrhea, abdominal bloating, constipation or pain) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, have a clinically&#xD;
             significant co-morbid disease that is likely to affect the ability of the patient to&#xD;
             complete the trial, interfere with their ability with measurement of self-reported&#xD;
             outcomes or result in adverse events unrelated to TalityTM are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of food allergy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications necessary to treat baseline disorders are allowed (e.g.,&#xD;
             hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring concomitant medications that, in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator, have an unacceptable risk of adverse effects due to their nature (e.g.,&#xD;
             anti-coagulant therapy, immuno-modulatory agents for autoimmune disease) must be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing patients will not be enrolled since prostate cancer is limited to&#xD;
             males.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients with active infections, HIV related cancer or poorly controlled&#xD;
             viral loads must be excluded. HIV-positive patients who are stable on anti-viral&#xD;
             therapy may be enrolled.&#xD;
