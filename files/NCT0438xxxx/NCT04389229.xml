      An open label, multi-centre Phase 1/2a study of modified and unmodified autologous Tumour&#xD;
      Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The&#xD;
      purpose of this phase I/II study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of both standard&#xD;
      unmodified TIL (UTIL-01) and TIL engineered to express the co-stimulatory receptor CoStAR&#xD;
      (CoTIL-01) in platinum resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm Phase 1/2a study of unmodified (UTIL-01) and gene modified (CoTIL-01)&#xD;
      adoptive TIL therapy which will enrol sequentially. A total of 8 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      to the UTIL-01 cohort to receive autologous standard unmodified TIL (phase 2). Up to 14&#xD;
      patients will receive autologous gene engineered TIL(CoTIL-1) in a dose escalation design&#xD;
      (Phase 1/2a). Once patients have met all the pre-screening inclusion criteria, and that&#xD;
      sponsor has confirmed a successful TIL harvest, a request to manufacture will be sent to the&#xD;
      Sponsor to initiate TIL production. Manufacturing and quality control assessment is&#xD;
      anticipated to take approximately 6 weeks. During this time, patients may receive standard of&#xD;
      care chemotherapy (bridging chemotherapy) as deemed appropriate by the treating oncology&#xD;
      team. Patients will proceed to the main trial after completion of bridging chemotherapy. Once&#xD;
      the TIL product is certified for release, and that patient has consented to the main trial&#xD;
      and has completed main trial screening assessments, study treatment can be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive non-myeloablative lymphodepleting pre-conditioning chemotherapy with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2/day and fludarabine 30mg/m2/day on Day -5, -4 and -3. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      will aim to be delivered as an outpatient, but patients can be admitted if clinically needed.&#xD;
      Patients will be required to maintain oral hydration of &gt;2 litres per day. If this is felt to&#xD;
      be difficult to achieve then the patient will be admitted for IV fluids. Patients will be&#xD;
      admitted for TIL infusion on Day 0. The TIL infusion will be administered at least 36 hours&#xD;
      after last dose of chemotherapy. The cells will only be thawed once an Investigator has made&#xD;
      a positive decision to go ahead with infusion and confirmed this in writing. TIL infusion may&#xD;
      be delayed for up to 7 days for clinical reasons or for issues regarding the cell&#xD;
      specification. This decision must be made before final preparation for infusion. Following&#xD;
      TIL infusion, patients will commence subcutaneous interleukin-2 at a fixed dose of 18 million&#xD;
      units once a day. Patients must remain an inpatient for the duration of IL-2 treatment for a&#xD;
      minimum of 7 days post TIL infusion. Recruitment to the study will occur over approximately&#xD;
      24-month period. Recruitment to CoTIL-01 will commence after UTIL-01. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up in the study for 24 months post TIL infusion.&#xD;
