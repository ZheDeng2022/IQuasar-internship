  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo and nocebo effects are defined as the positive and negative effects occurring after&#xD;
      the (supposed) administration of an inert treatment, which, through a given learning process,&#xD;
      is believed to have positive or negative effects. The objective of this study is to summarize&#xD;
      the available knowledge on experimental inductions of placebo and nocebo effects on&#xD;
      somatosensory sensations, specifically pain and itch. The aim isto investigate the extent to&#xD;
      which learning processes (such as conditioning and verbal suggestions) induce placebo and&#xD;
      nocebo effects on pain and itch in healthy humans. The researchers intent to examine&#xD;
      expectancy induction methods for placebo and nocebo effects on somatosensory sensations,&#xD;
      describe methodological attributes of the research and propose practical and theoretical&#xD;
      implications as well as future directions for research investigating placebo and nocebo&#xD;
      effects on somatosensory sensations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the average magnitude of placebo or nocebo effects on pain and on itch, across&#xD;
           included studies?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Across studies that tested multiple learning processes for placebo and nocebo effects on&#xD;
           pain, is the magnitude of a placebo or nocebo effect on pain different based on the&#xD;
           learning process used to induce the effect?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does the magnitude of placebo or nocebo effects differ between the sensations of pain&#xD;
           and itch?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are nocebo effects on pain and itch stronger than placebo effects on pain and itch, as&#xD;
           measured by their relative magnitude?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent upon search results, the researchers intend to answer questions 1 and 2 with&#xD;
      meta-analysis, and questions 3 and 4 with systematic review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search Strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Methodology Library will be searched.&#xD;
      Languages are restricted to English, Dutch, and German. Publication period is not restricted.&#xD;
      Searches were initially conducted on March 18th, 2019. The detailed key-worded search&#xD;
      strategy will not be made publicly available until this review is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition or domain being studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental induction of placebo or nocebo effects on somatosensory sensations (i.e., pain&#xD;
      and/or itch). For the purposes of in- and exclusion, studies are considered to have induced a&#xD;
      placebo or nocebo effect if the (supposed) administration of an inert treatment, is paired&#xD;
      with a given learning process attempt to induce positive or negative outcome-effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants/population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, adult human volunteers. Patient samples will not be included to improve homogeneity&#xD;
      of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titles and abstracts of articles retrieved using the search strategy and those from&#xD;
      additional sources will be screened by two independent reviewers to identify studies that&#xD;
      potentially meet the inclusion criteria outlined above. The full text of these articles and&#xD;
      articles about which doubts exist based on the title and/or abstract will be retrieved and&#xD;
      assessed for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Full texts that are considered to be&#xD;
      possibly eligible for inclusion or about which doubts exist will also be assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility by a third reviewer. Two independent reviewers will use a standardized form to&#xD;
      extract data from the included studies to derive study characteristics, assess study quality,&#xD;
      and for data analysis. Extracted information will include details of the intervention,&#xD;
      control condition, study population, sensation type and how sensations were measured (e.g.&#xD;
      self-report), type of experimental induction (i.e., learning method used), type of expectancy&#xD;
      (i.e., placebo or nocebo), information for quality assessment, and outcome data for&#xD;
      meta-analysis (e.g., sample size, mean, and standard deviation). Doubts regarding&#xD;
      data-extraction will be resolved through discussion with a second review author. Missing data&#xD;
      will be requested from the study authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of bias assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of bias will be assessed using the method developed by Marcuzzi and colleagues in 2013&#xD;
      specifically for quantitative sensory testing studies. This method assesses 1) whether the&#xD;
      sample was clearly described, 2) whether the sample is representative of the population, 3)&#xD;
      whether the somatosensory assessment methods are standardized, validated, and well described,&#xD;
      4) adequate blinding if relevant, and 5) whether potential confounders were taken into&#xD;
      account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy for data synthesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quantitative synthesis, using aggregate data, of the data is planned. The (standardized)&#xD;
      mean difference (with a 95% confidence interval) will be calculated for all included studies&#xD;
      for which sufficient data are available. Both between and within subject designs will be&#xD;
      included; sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test for a difference in design type&#xD;
      (within/between). If significant differences are detected, design type will be included in&#xD;
      the analyses as a moderator variable). Subsequently, the pooled effects for each of the&#xD;
      experimental induction will be analyzed using a random-effects model. The effects of&#xD;
      experimental inductions will also be compared between placebo and nocebo effects. If&#xD;
      sufficient data are available, the effects of the experimental inductions will be compared&#xD;
      between different somatosensory sensations (see below). Where statistical pooling is not&#xD;
      possible, the findings of the systematic review will be presented in narrative form.&#xD;
      Heterogeneity will be assessed with the I2 statistic, by visual inspection of the forest&#xD;
      plot(s), and by subset analyses (see below). The presence of publication bias will also be&#xD;
      assessed (e.g., via inspection of a funnel plot).&#xD;
