  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy on B7-H3 CAR-T in between&#xD;
      Temozolomide cycles in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back or does not&#xD;
      respond to the standard treatment. The antigen B7-H3 is highly expressed in glioblastoma of a&#xD;
      subset of patients. B7-H3 CAR-T, made from isolated patient peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells, can specifically attack patient glioblastoma cells that expressing B7-H3.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B7-H3 is expressed in 70% of patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B7-H3 is not expressed in normal tissues especially not in central nervous system.&#xD;
           Therefore, it is an attractive GBM target for CAR-T therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
           (CAR) targeting B7-H3, which can mediate CAR transfer into patient T cells with high&#xD;
           efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability intratumoral/intracerebroventricular injection&#xD;
           of B7-H3 CAR-T when used in between Temozolomide cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of R/R GBM&#xD;
           patients treated with B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles to the historical&#xD;
           Temozolomide data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To access the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of B7-H3 CAR-T in between&#xD;
           Temozolomide cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients autologous T cells are activated and transduced with retrovirus containing B7-H3&#xD;
      CAR. CAR-T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back to patients via intratumoral or&#xD;
      intracerebroventricular injection through an Ommaya catheter. 3 injections of CAR-T are&#xD;
      planned at two different doses with 1-2 weeks intervals. The CAR-T injections occur in&#xD;
      between Temozolomide (TMZ) cycles. Temozolomide treatment in the cycle of CAR-T injections&#xD;
      will be stopped and resumed next cycle. Patients may receive additional CAR-T cycles at the&#xD;
      discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist.&#xD;
