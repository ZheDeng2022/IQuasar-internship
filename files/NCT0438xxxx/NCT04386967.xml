  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study evaluates the safety and efficacy of OH2 as single agent or in combination&#xD;
      with Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with malignant solid tumors (Melanoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OH2 is an oncolytic virus developed upon genetic modifications of the herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      type 2 strain HG52, allowing the virus to selectively replicate in tumors. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      delivery of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      may induce a more potent antitumor immune response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The non-operative stage III or stage IV malignant tumor patients with clear diagnosis&#xD;
             by pathology and/ or cytology; breast cancer, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, liver&#xD;
             cancer, cervical cancer, malignant melanoma, head and neck tumors, Priority inclusion&#xD;
             in soft tissue sarcomas (mainly for melanoma patients at the dose extension phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The absence of a conventional effective treatment or treatment failure or recurrence&#xD;
             by a conventional method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female patients, aged 18 ≤ 75 years (including boundary value), general&#xD;
             physical condition score ECOG 0 ≤ 1, expected survival time more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior anti-tumor treatment (including endocrine, chemical/ radiotherapy,targeted&#xD;
             therapy) was over 4 weeks (more than 6 weeks of discontinuation using nitroso-and&#xD;
             mitomycin-based chemotherapy) and was recovered to grade 1 from the side effects of&#xD;
             prior treatment.&#xD;

             measured tumor focus is defined as the longest diameter ≥ 10 mm and the scanning&#xD;
