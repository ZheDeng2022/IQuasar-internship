      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placenta is the organ that permits the maternal-fetal exchange of the oxygen and&#xD;
      nutrients. The development of its vascular network occurs in the first trimester. Any deficit&#xD;
      during this important angiogenesis procedure can lead to the dysfunction of the placental&#xD;
      vasculature, which can potentially cause pathologies including preeclampsia (PE) and&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). PE concerns 3% of the pregnancy in France. It can&#xD;
      occur at any gestational age and leads to serious complications such as eclampsia, the HELLP&#xD;
      syndrome or the retro-placental hematoma. IUGR does not only lead to the morbidity and fetal&#xD;
      and neonatal mortality, but also has a predisposition for certain pathologies in the&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many groups have studied the placenta vasculature at the microscopic (histological) scale.&#xD;
      However, recent studies show that in addition to the damage at the microvasculature level,&#xD;
      the macroscopic placental vessel architecture is also altered. Nonetheless, the origin and&#xD;
      the etiology of this phenomenon remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is difficult to apply in-vivo imaging techniques on pregnant women due to the&#xD;
      restriction of usage of contrast agent. Alternatively, ex-vivo MR angiography (MRA)&#xD;
      techniques have been developed by our team and others to visualize the entire placental&#xD;
      vasculature in a faster way (as compared to corrosion casting). Up to now, only the study of&#xD;
      the healthy placenta is done and published. The analysis of the pathological placental&#xD;
      vasculature (i.e. PE and IUGR cases) at different gestational age and its comparison to the&#xD;
      physiological ones have not been conducted, which will potentially enable a better&#xD;
      understanding of the placental vasculature pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: the main objective of this study is to compare the vasculature architecture of&#xD;
      the normal and pathological placentas (with possible alteration in the placental&#xD;
      vasculature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: This is a monocentric, prospective, controlled but not randomized&#xD;
      study. The investigators expect to include 100 women in Nancy. The pregnant women will be&#xD;
      recruited when they arrived at the maternity hospital for delivery, for both the&#xD;
      physiological and potential pathological cases. The notice of this study will be given. If no&#xD;
      opposition is given by the subject, the placenta may be collected. This study will not&#xD;
      collect the patient consent but only the opposition declaration will be collected.&#xD;
