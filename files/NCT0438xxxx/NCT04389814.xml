  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is one of the leading causes of death&#xD;
      across the world and immediate treatment with either thrombolytics or percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) results in lower mortality. It is essential to accurately determine the&#xD;
      time of onset of myocardial infarction. Standard practice is to take the time of symptom&#xD;
      onset as a surrogate for artery occlusion time. However symptom onset is a subjective&#xD;
      parameter and affected by multiple factors such as recall issues in elderly patients and&#xD;
      preceding unstable angina symptoms before artery occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study by Mahmoud et al. an objective method, biochemical onset time is proposed&#xD;
      for estimation of artery occlusion time using serial cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels in&#xD;
      patients with STEMI. However, this study was retrospective, had an average of two&#xD;
      measurements of cTnT for each patient, peak troponin level was frequently missing and newer&#xD;
      earlier detectable biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin I (hsTnI) were not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use multiple samples of hsTnI for each patient using the same method as above and&#xD;
      we will compare the biochemical ischemic time with the patient reported symptom onset time.&#xD;
      Secondarily, we will try to determine whether a single sample of multiple cardiac biomarkers&#xD;
      with different release kinetics drawn at time of patient presentation in emergency room (ER)&#xD;
      could predict precise time of onset of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the biochemical onset time using multiple hsTnI measurements from each&#xD;
           patient (zero, 03, 08, 24 hrs), and compare this biochemical time to the&#xD;
           patient-reported symptoms onset time as an indicator of coronary artery occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To predict biochemical occlusion at the time of presentation with the use of single&#xD;
           sample of six different markers of myocardial injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the association of conventional ischemic time and biochemical ischemic time&#xD;
           with infarct size; using peak hsTnI, percent ejection fraction by Echocardiography and&#xD;
           Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging (CMR) based infarct volume in grams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the association of conventional ischemic time and biochemical ischemic time&#xD;
           with in-hospital and 30-days major adverse cardiac events, MACE; a composite of heart&#xD;
           failure, shock, re MI or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective nonintervention pilot study will include 100 consecutive patients coming with&#xD;
      acute STEMI. Patients' recruitment will be done in ER of Tabba Heart Institute, Karachi&#xD;
      Pakistan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is one of the leading causes of death&#xD;
      across the world (1) and immediate treatment with either thrombolytics or percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) results in lower mortality (2,3,4). Prior studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that in patients with STEMI approximately 50% of jeopardized myocardium&#xD;
      undergoes necrosis in the first hour, and after 6 hours, myocardial salvage is minimal or&#xD;
      absent (5,6). Among such patients each minute of delay in reperfusion treatment raises 1-year&#xD;
      mortality; in fact, the risk of 1-year mortality increases by 7.5% for each 30-minute delay&#xD;
      (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the outcome of reperfusion treatment in STEMI is time dependent, it is essential to&#xD;
      accurately determine the time of onset of myocardial infarction. It is standard clinical&#xD;
      practice to take the time of symptom onset as a surrogate for artery occlusion time, and this&#xD;
      helps in decision making about mode of reperfusion in STEMI-patients. However symptom onset&#xD;
      is a subjective parameter and affected by multiple factors such as recall issues in elderly&#xD;
      patients and preceding unstable angina symptoms before artery occlusion. This mandates need&#xD;
      for an objective method to know the artery occlusion time. Different time intervals are&#xD;
      defined for STEMI patients that include, &quot;artery occlusion to symptom onset time&quot;, &quot;symptom&#xD;
      onset to first medical contact time&quot; and &quot;door to balloon time&quot; and combination of all these&#xD;
      intervals is &quot;Total Ischemic time&quot; i.e. the time between artery occlusion and re-opening,&#xD;
      which is strongly correlated with 1-year mortality (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study by Mahmoud et al. (9) an objective method, biochemical onset time is&#xD;
      proposed for estimation of artery occlusion time using serial cardiac troponin T (cTnT)&#xD;
      levels in patients with STEMI. However, this study was retrospective, had an average of two&#xD;
      measurements of cTnT for each patient, peak troponin level was frequently missing and newer&#xD;
      earlier detectable biomarkers such as high sensitive Troponin I (hsTnI) were not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot study is to observe if there is any role of multiple samples of&#xD;
      markers of myocardial injury in prediction of the biochemical onset time. We plan to use&#xD;
      multiple samples (four) of hsTnI for each patient using the same method as above (9); and we&#xD;
      will compare the biochemical ischemic time with the patient reported symptom onset time.&#xD;
      Secondarily, we will try to determine whether a single sample of multiple cardiac biomarkers&#xD;
      with different release kinetics drawn at time of patient presentation in emergency room (ER)&#xD;
      can also predict precise time of onset of myocardial infarction, which would be a&#xD;
      revolutionary finding in STEMI patients' early management. For this purpose we will use three&#xD;
      markers including cardiac specific myoglobin (CS-Mb) and Creatinine kinase-Mb (CK-Mb) (10).&#xD;
      We also plan to test three other novel markers which has previously shown to have some role&#xD;
      in post MI prognosis and cardiac event risk prediction in general population {(Mean&#xD;
      neutrophil volume (MNV), Gamma Prime fibrinogen (γ' Fibrinogen) and heart type fatty acid&#xD;
      binding protein (h-FABP)} to assess whether it has a possible predictive value to assess time&#xD;
      of onset of MI. Lastly, we plan to assess the prognostic value of biochemical ischemic time&#xD;
      versus conventional ischemic time for the outcomes of major adverse cardiovascular events&#xD;
      (MACE) at hospital discharge and 30 days post MI, infarct size using CMR and echo based&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the biochemical onset time using multiple measurements of hsTnI from each&#xD;
           patient (zero, 03, 08, 24hrs), and compare this biochemical time to the patient-reported&#xD;
           symptoms onset time as an indicator of coronary artery occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To predict Biochemical occlusion at the time of presentation with the use of single&#xD;
           sample of six different markers of myocardial injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the association of conventional ischemic time and biochemical ischemic time&#xD;
           with infarct size; using peak hsTnI, percent ejection fraction by Echocardiography and&#xD;
           Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging (CMR) based infarct volume in grams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the association of conventional ischemic time and biochemical ischemic time&#xD;
           with in-hospital and 30-days major adverse cardiac events, MACE; a composite of heart&#xD;
           failure, shock, re MI or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This will be a single center nonintervention pilot study on 100 patients on&#xD;
      consecutive patients coming to ER Tabba Heart Institute Karachi, Pakistan, (THI) with acute&#xD;
      STEMI. Data will be collected prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non probability consecutive sampling will be done to enroll patients from the ER of the&#xD;
      hospital. Consecutive patients presenting at emergency of THI with diagnosis of STEMI within&#xD;
      24 hours of symptom onset will be assessed for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire and interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Officer (RO): three data collectors and one research officer will be employed full&#xD;
      time for the duration of the study. Their job description will include to make sure consent&#xD;
      forms and questionnaires are completed and to fill out the deficiencies from patients'&#xD;
      medical record files, to keep log of the patient forms and to arrange team meetings every&#xD;
      fortnight. Also they will follow the patients throughout the hospital stay to record relevant&#xD;
      events. Also he or she will be responsible to call and coordinate the patients for follow up&#xD;
      echo and CMR at 30 day post MI. This person will also be trained by the PI prior to the start&#xD;
      of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval: Ethical approval has been taken from ethical review committee in THI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: Before enrollment, patient or the designated attendant will be asked to&#xD;
      sign an informed consent form, provided both in Urdu and English as applicable to the&#xD;
      patients and attendants. The patient will be explained about their rights during the study,&#xD;
      regarding withdrawal and refusal anytime during the study. If the potential participant&#xD;
      disagrees to consent then the staff will politely inquire about the possible reasons behind&#xD;
      it and will offer reconsideration on next visit if possible. There will be no coercion,&#xD;
      persuasion or resentment from the study staff on refusal to consent. One copy of the consent&#xD;
      form will be handed to the patient along with important contact numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire: research officer will fill the questionnaire with the help of patient and the&#xD;
      attendants. The information which is not supplied by the participant will be attempted to&#xD;
      retrieve from the medical records and hospital data registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcomes Blood sampling Four trained phlebotomists will be utilized for blood&#xD;
      sampling. The study staff will take the samples; label them with patients' study ID and&#xD;
      medical record (MR) numbers, time and number of sample, and the biomarker being assessed.&#xD;
      Separate tubes will be used for each biomarker. To ensure timely sampling for each patient a&#xD;
      sheet with timed slots will be added to the patient's file to mark number of samples and&#xD;
      their timings. The test tubes will be promptly delivered to the lab by the phlebotomist. Cost&#xD;
      of blood testing of routine and additional cardiac biomarkers will be borne by the&#xD;
      investigating team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Infarct size 24hrs hsTnI: Blood sample will be drawn at 24hours of admission&#xD;
      for peak HsTnI as surrogate for the infarct size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic Echocardiogram: A post STEMI standard transthoracic echo will be performed on&#xD;
      all patients during index hospitalization which included detailed assessment of ejection&#xD;
      fraction and wall motion abnormality. At 30-days, re assessment of left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      function will be performed via 2D Echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI: Myocardial infarction can be visualized and quantified using inversion recovery&#xD;
      imaging 10 to 15 minutes after intravenous administration of gadolinium contrast (late&#xD;
      enhancement imaging). Infarct size is expressed as absolute mass or percent of left&#xD;
      ventricular mass (mass [grams] = volume [mL] × myocardial density [1.05 grams/mL]). Other&#xD;
      additional parameters such as left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, micro vascular&#xD;
      obstruction (MO) and myocardial salvage index (MSI) will also be obtained. Infarct size and&#xD;
      late MO will be assessed in late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) short-axis images covering the&#xD;
      whole left ventricle (LV) approximately 15 min after injection of gadolinium chelate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to get their routine standard care in the inpatient areas. After the&#xD;
      discharge in cardiology clinics, they will continue to receive standard medical care&#xD;
      including adjustments in drug regimens according to primary physician's opinion. For in&#xD;
      hospital MACE, data regarding heart failure (HF), cardiogenic shock, re-MI and in hospital&#xD;
      death will be calculated. At 30 day, data on re MI and death will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size is not determined using statistical power calculations. Sample size&#xD;
      is determined by the number of available specimens of each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Means ± SD will be reported for continuous variables if normally&#xD;
      distributed or median ± IQR if not normally distributed. Percentages will be used for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Boxplot will be to show the data range for each biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scatter plots will be generated using the time between symptom onset time and sample&#xD;
      collection time vs. biomarker values for each biomarker. PROC TRANSREG will be used to fit a&#xD;
      curve to the data if applicable. Scatter plots will be generated using time between symptom&#xD;
      onset time and sample collection time vs. change of biomarker values from previous time point&#xD;
      for each biomarker. PROC TRANSREG will be used to fit a curve to the data if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scatter plots will also be generated using time between symptom onset time and sample&#xD;
      collection time vs. percent change of biomarker values from previous time point for each&#xD;
      biomarker. PROC TRANSREG will be used to fit a curve to the data if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression Analysis Based on the above scatter plots, for each biomarker, a linear/nonlinear&#xD;
      regression will be run using time between symptom onset time and collection time as dependent&#xD;
      variable and using initial biomarker value, change of the biomarker value, age (in deciles),&#xD;
      gender and any interaction terms of these variables as independent variables. Backward&#xD;
      selection will be used to choose the best model for each biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Biomarkers Analysis Change for each biomarker will be calculated at the presentation&#xD;
      using biomarker value at presentation against corresponding limit of detection (LOD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Regressions will be run using time between symptom onset time and collection time as&#xD;
           dependent variable and using initial biomarker value, change of the biomarker value, age&#xD;
           (in deciles), gender and any interaction terms of these variables as independent&#xD;
           variables. The best regression model selection based on the minimum of Akaike&#xD;
           Information Criterion (AIC) will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Principle component analysis (11) will be used to determine all the principal components&#xD;
           with Eigen values greater than 1 using the following variables: change of each the six&#xD;
           biomarkers, age, gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression using time between symptom onset time and collection time as dependent variable&#xD;
      and principal components as independent variables will be run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A P-value &lt;0.05 will be taken as statistically significant. SAS version, 9.2 will be used for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis: In the sensitivity analyses, we will use mixed effects Tobit model with&#xD;
      random effects that will account for repeated measures of biomarker within the same subject,&#xD;
      and compare the results with the main fixed-effects analysis. We will also conduct sub-group&#xD;
      analyses according to type of treatment i.e. thrombolytic therapy vs. PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis: Estimates of first samples of the biomarkers (hsTnI, CS myoglobin, CK-Mb,&#xD;
      MNV and gamma' fibrinogen) at the time of ER presentation will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      biochemical onset time of MI using the same model. We will derive an equation using the&#xD;
      regression coefficients of the biomarkers against their respective times of measurements. We&#xD;
      will determine the discrimination and calibration (best fit) of the model with all these&#xD;
      biomarkers combined or any of their combination compared to hsTnI only. If feasible, a&#xD;
      nomogram will be developed using these regression coefficients to predict the biochemical MI&#xD;
      onset time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analysis: To analyze the associations of patient-reported symptom onset time and&#xD;
      biochemical onset time separately with infarct size using HsTnI, 2D echo derived EF and CMR&#xD;
      derived infarct size, in-hospital and 30-day MACE, we will use Cox proportional hazards&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
