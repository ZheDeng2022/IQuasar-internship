  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety，tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of KC1036 in participants with advanced recurrent or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors. The trial will be divided into three parts: dose-escalation phase, dose-expansion&#xD;
      phase, RP2D-extension phase.&#xD;
