    <textblock>
      in our study we are trying to reach to the preferred adjuvant from either ketamine or&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine to be added to bupivacaine local anesthetic during pec 11 modified block as&#xD;
      regard its efficacy and duration of postoperative analgesia it can maintain after modified&#xD;
      radical mastectomy surgery so as to achieve better control of postoperative pain than using&#xD;
      local anesthetic alone.&#xD;

      -  Type of Study: Randomized controlled trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Setting: Operating theater of Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo, Egypt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Period: 6 months .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be subdivided randomly into 3 groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (PC): will receive 30 ml of 0.25%bupivacaine plus 2ml normal saline. Group (PK): will&#xD;
      receive 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine added to ketamine hydrochloride&#xD;
&#xD;
      1mg/kg diluted in 2ml normal saline. Group(PD): will receive 30 ml of 0.25%bupivacaine added&#xD;
      to dexmedetomidine 1ug/kg diluted in 2 ml normal saline. Study Procedure Following local&#xD;
      university ethical committee approval, informed consent will be obtained. Details of the&#xD;
      anesthetic technique and the study protocol will be fully explained at the preoperative&#xD;
      visit, and written consent will be obtained from each patient before inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-induction room the patients will be taught how to assess their own pain score&#xD;
      using the numerical rating scale (NRS) (0-10; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain) and&#xD;
      how to use the device for a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) .Patients in all groups will&#xD;
      receive 5mg oral midazolam ,2 hours prior to surgery.A20 gauge IV cannula will be inserted in&#xD;
      the upper limb contralateral to the side of surgery upon reaching the operating room .Before&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia electrocardiography (ECG), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP),&#xD;
      arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCo2) will connected to the&#xD;
      patient. In all groups general anaesthesia will be induced using 2 Î¼g/kg fentanyl, 2.5mg/kg&#xD;
      propofol and 1 mg/kg lidocaine. Endotracheal intubation will be facilitated by 0.5 atracurium&#xD;
      and was maintained by 1 MAC sevoflurane in 50% Oxygen /air mixture, and ventilator parameters&#xD;
      will be adjusted to maintain normocapnia. The Pecs11 Modified block will be done using in&#xD;
      plane approach, an 80 mm needle using linear array ultrasound probe of high frequency (12Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Pec 11 block will be done using two needle approach, an 80 mm needle(PajunkR&#xD;
      SonoPlex Stim cannula U.S.A) with the aid of linear array ultrasound probe of high frequency&#xD;
      (SonositeR, Inc. U.S.A). The modified Pec 11 block technique: The ultrasound probe will be&#xD;
      angled inferolateral from the midclavicular level sagittal plane (same as in infraclavicular&#xD;
      brachial plexus block) the axillary artery and veins are located ,then the probe will be&#xD;
      moved laterally until the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles are seen, after&#xD;
      locating 2nd rib immediately under the axillary artery then the ultrasound probe will move&#xD;
      caudally from this position until both the third and fourth ribs are seen , the probe is&#xD;
      rotated 90 degrees so that it lies transversally and will move laterally toward the anterior&#xD;
      axillary line keeping the third rib at the center so that the lateral border of pectoralis&#xD;
      minor is will be identified and at the top of the third rib the serratus anterior muscle will&#xD;
      be seen deeper to the pectoralis minor ,the needle then will be advanced from the medial to&#xD;
      lateral side parallel to the ultrasound beam and 32ml of the solution will be injected&#xD;
      between the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles (8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each group, the 32ml solution constituents are different, for PC group (the control&#xD;
      group) the 32ml solution contain only 0.25% bupivacaine while for group PK it contains 1mg/kg&#xD;
      ketamine hydrochloride in addition to bupivacaine ,while for group PD it contains 1ug/kg&#xD;
      dexmetomedine in addition to bupivacaine. Surgery started 30 minutes after the block has been&#xD;
      given. Fentanyl 0.5ug was given as a bolus if HR or BP rose 20% above the baseline values,&#xD;
      Bradycardia (HR&lt;50/minute) is treated with atropine 0.5mg bolus, and hypotension (20% below&#xD;
      the baseline values) is treated with 10mg boluses of ephedrine. Patients were extubated after&#xD;
      adequate neuromuscular reversal using atropine 0.02mg/kg and 0.05mg/kg neostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that the patients were transferred to post-anaesthesia care unit where they were&#xD;
      followed up and assessed for the following parameters: O2 saturation(spo2),Respiratory&#xD;
      rate(RR), Non-invasive blood pressure(NIBP),Heart rate(HR), and Sedation agitation scores&#xD;
      using Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale(RASS)( +4=combative +3=very agitated +2=agitated&#xD;
      +1=restless 0=alert and calm,-1=drowsy,-2=light sedation,-3=moderate sedation&#xD;
      ,-4=deepsedation,-5=unarousable sedation) (11) will be measured 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min&#xD;
      postoperatively . Episodes of postoperative nausea and vomiting, sedation scale above 2,any&#xD;
      psychological complications (as hallucinations, dreams),are recorded and treated. nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting will be treated by ondansetron 4mg IV, if sedation scale scores&lt; -2 patient will&#xD;
      receive flumazenil 0.15mg IV over 15secnds ,and if patient manifest hallucination or RASS&#xD;
      &gt;+1, 1mg Midazolam IV will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores(NRS) at rest and movement of ipsilateral arm will be recorded every hour for 24&#xD;
      hour postoperatively .Total intraoperative fentanyl consumption ,and total postoperative&#xD;
      morphine consumption for the first 24 hours postoperative will be calculated and the time of&#xD;
      the first request of analgesic will be recorded. When analgesia is requested postoperatively(&#xD;
      once the pain is expressed by the patient or the NRS was&gt;3 ) an initial morphine bolus of&#xD;
      0.1mg/kg followed by 1mg bolus with a lockout periods of 15 minutes with no background&#xD;
      infusion allowed. At the end of 24 h, the patient's satisfaction about the post-operative&#xD;
      analgesia which was rated on a three-point scale, i.e., good = most satisfied, average =&#xD;
      somewhat satisfied, poor= dissatisfied, will be assessed.&#xD;
