      Introduction and Background According to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, stroke&#xD;
      is the 5th leading cause of mortality in the US, and a leading cause of significant long-term&#xD;
      disability where almost 50% of stroke survivors, age 65 and above, suffer from disabling&#xD;
      decrease in mobility. In its simplest form, an ischemic stroke is a decrease in the blood&#xD;
      flow to a certain area in the brain, due to a clot, stenosis or other cause, which lasts long&#xD;
      enough to cause permanent cellular injury and death and by extension, disability [1].&#xD;
      However, much more goes into that process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decreased blood flow to the tissue leads to the primary insult caused by ischemia which&#xD;
      leads to direct and immediate cell death. Meanwhile, the tissue surrounding this ischemic&#xD;
      area gets affected by the inflammation in the ischemic area, but maintains its viability and&#xD;
      is called the penumbra. Later on, this penumbra gets affected by the immune response and&#xD;
      toxic inflammatory mediators released in the ischemic area. Which ultimately results in&#xD;
      axonal structural changes and subsequent neuronal damage (secondary insult.) The main&#xD;
      attention of this paper is looking into the prevention of secondary insult and preserving the&#xD;
      penumbra which carries a neurorestorative capacity that is diminished by the inflammatory&#xD;
      response and the possibility of restoring the damaged area by neurogenesis as will be&#xD;
      explained later. As a result, improving the disability caused by the ischemic event [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only FDA approved treatments of stroke are Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA)&#xD;
      and Trevo which is a clot removal device, introduced in 2012. However, the group harvesting&#xD;
      the benefits of those treatments are fairly limited. For example, tPA has many&#xD;
      contraindications in addition to a narrow window of application of 4.5 hours from the start&#xD;
      of symptoms. Trevo can only be used within 6 hours as well (extended to 24h in certain cases)&#xD;
      [3]. Furthermore, a major downside that plagues these interventions is the&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion injury. I/R injury is characterized by reduced vascular relaxation and&#xD;
      perfusion, increased macromolecular permeability and an intense inflammatory response derived&#xD;
      by reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the ischemic area [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other interventions are being currently studied in the preclinical setting which is aimed at&#xD;
      enhancing and supporting the activity of neurons and neural progenitor cells and promoting&#xD;
      long-term functional recovery. Rather than concentrating on restoring blood flow, these&#xD;
      interventions are aimed towards inducing neuroprotection and saving brain function in the&#xD;
      long term. One such example, is omega-3 essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA n3)&#xD;
      specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5,&#xD;
      n-3), to a lesser extent. They have been shown to have a profound effect on decreasing the&#xD;
      neuroinflammation in the brain tissue of animal models after an acute stroke in addition to&#xD;
      its positive effects on cognitive function and neurodevelopment [4,5]. Furthermore, studies&#xD;
      conducted on mice such as the one conducted by Jos√© Pedro De La Cruz et al has shown great&#xD;
      neuroprotective qualities and a significant reduction in post-stroke neuroinflammation using&#xD;
      olive oil and acetylsalicylic acid [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering all that which have been mentioned in our introduction, the investigators have&#xD;
      set several objectives for this paper. First of all, studying the effects of using * omega-3*&#xD;
      as a safe and effective measures to prevent neuroinflammation after an ischemic event and how&#xD;
      can this affect the process of neurogenesis and subsequently and effect on patient disability&#xD;
      by using olive oil as one of the resources of omega-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an open-labelled two-armed randomized control trial, phase 4. One arm will&#xD;
      receive the intervention (fish oil). The other arm will be the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting of our study will be the KFMC ASU and NCCU. Our target population will be an&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, non-hemorrhagic, reperfused, and non-complicated stabilized patients&#xD;
      admitted to the NCCU/ASU at KFMC stroke unit located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Regarding the&#xD;
      sample size, it will consist of 60 stroke patients /year compiled of 5 patients each month.&#xD;
      The investigators will put into consideration having a confidence level of 95% with a power&#xD;
      of 80%. So, the number of the sample might be changed slightly according to the rate of&#xD;
      encountered eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Subject's recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to recruit confirmed admitted ischemic stroke patients from the&#xD;
      emergency department then referred to the stroke unit (NCCU/ASU) who need to follow up or&#xD;
      close monitoring. Patients will be eligible after stabilization and reperfusion to minimize&#xD;
      any risks to our intervention. This process will be monitored by the ICU specialist and a&#xD;
      neurologist. The intervention will not be started until the specialists approve to start.&#xD;
      More importantly, the subject will not be recruited until they or their responsible relative&#xD;
      gives informed consent. Participants can withdraw at any time during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of data collectors' recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collectors will be from health-care-related specialities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized by the order of their arrival to the NCCU/ASU alternating between&#xD;
      intervention and control groups with every patient. A research team member will be assigned&#xD;
      to put patients that arrive at the NCCU/ASU in either of the 2 groups using a computer&#xD;
      program which randomly selects between A or B. The fact of which letter is assigned to which&#xD;
      group will also be chosen by the same researcher and stored on an excel sheet which only&#xD;
      he\she has access to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an open-label randomized trial due to the difficulty of blinding the&#xD;
      patients and physicians from the odour, taste and colour between the intervention and&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, the supplement (but not the placebo) will come in the form of an encapsulated soft&#xD;
      gel which will be administered through the nasogastric or orogastric tube by injecting it in&#xD;
      the nutrition bag and dividing the dose throughout the number of bags per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average length of stay in ischemic stroke patients is 28 days, thus, the intervention&#xD;
      group will receive fish oil for 1 month starting from the incidence of the stroke. [13] The&#xD;
      chosen product of intervention is OMACOR from Abbott brand. This product is registered in the&#xD;
      Saudi FDA and is available in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will administer 4g per day of fish oil three times with meals for one month&#xD;
      with monitoring the health status regularly. According to the European Food Safety Authority&#xD;
      in 2012, long-term consumption of EPA and DHA supplements at combined doses of up to about 5&#xD;
      g/day, or EPA alone up to 1.8 g/day appears to be safe for the adult population and does not&#xD;
      increase the risk of spontaneous bleeding episodes, or affect glucose homeostasis, immune&#xD;
      function or lipid peroxidation. [18]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until the time of this study, the full mechanism of action of omega 3 is not well understood&#xD;
      to explain all of its effects. However, some theories to how it lowered blood triglyceride&#xD;
      levels propose that it reduces the hepatic production of triglyceride-rich very-low-density&#xD;
      lipoproteins. It also suppresses adipose tissue inflammation and increases FA uptake in&#xD;
      adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle. On the cellular level, it inhibits the action of acyl&#xD;
      CoA:1,2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increase hepatic mitochondrial and peroxisomal&#xD;
      beta-oxidation and thus result in a reduction in the hepatic synthesis of triglycerides&#xD;
      lowering their blood levels1. Furthermore, its cardiovascular effects are considered&#xD;
      multifactorial. It inhibits platelet aggregation, increases circulating EPA/arachidonic acid&#xD;
      ratio, and increases EPA composition from carotid plaques. [14]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety :&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a safety standpoint, omega 3 is a very safe drug with mild or no symptoms at all. The&#xD;
      only serious dangerous side effect is an allergic reaction to the drug. some side effects&#xD;
      include headache, unpleasant taste, bad-smelling sweat, bad breath, and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, and diarrhoea. [15] Besides, omega 3 being a mild&#xD;
      platelet aggregation inhibitor, it potentiates the effects of antiplatelet like low dose&#xD;
      (baby) aspirin. The interaction was reported in a case report&#xD;
&#xD;
      paper. Thus, after administering omega 3 or changing the dose for a patient on baby aspirin&#xD;
      or warfarin, the INR should be checked. [14]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring :&#xD;
&#xD;
      While administering omega 3, some parameters should be monitored at baseline and&#xD;
      periodically. In patients with hepatic impairment monitor liver function tests and enzymes&#xD;
      particularly ALT. Signs or symptoms of bleeding and perform an INR both at baseline and&#xD;
      periodically. [14]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Administration :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the investigators expect that some patients might be fully dependent on feeding&#xD;
      tubes. However, the omega 3 pills could still be administered through NGT or through feeding&#xD;
      formulas that contain EPA and DHA. In the study by Julie M. [15] Martin et al. found no&#xD;
      difference in the clinical outcome in critically ill patients when administering the drug&#xD;
      through NGT vs feeding formulas. However, administering pills instead of feeding formulas is&#xD;
      more convenient regarding training the staff and determining doses in addition to being&#xD;
      cost-effective. [16]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, Follow-up and Communication :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurology consultant (the principal investigator) will directly supervise the data&#xD;
      collection, intervention, follow-up and communication with the help of medical professionals&#xD;
      co-investigators and nurses. Meanwhile, entering the data and monitoring adverse effects will&#xD;
      be assessed by clinical pharmacists and other co-investigators. The participants will have&#xD;
      the contact number of the principal investigator to report any news or adverse reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for stopping follow-up and intervention in the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some events will cause stopping and loss of follow-up such as :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enlarging stroke area&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deterioration of the case condition (e.g. loss more neurological functions and&#xD;
           consciousness or other systematic organs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. New onset of stroke in the same or different areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participant withdrawing&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Death or brain death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the data using the SPSS software program (version 25).&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis and statistical Drop-outs from the study will be excluded from the&#xD;
      analysis, so the analysis type will be &quot;per protocol analysis&quot;.&#xD;
