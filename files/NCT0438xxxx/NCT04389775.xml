    <textblock>
      XW003 is an acylated human GLP-1 analogue and is being development for diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) management. This is a first-in-human (FIH),&#xD;
      single-centre, double blind, randomised, SAD and MAD study of XW003 conducted in healthy&#xD;
      adult participants. The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of&#xD;
      XW003 in healthy adult participants.&#xD;

      Participants will undergo a Screening period beginning up to 28 days prior to&#xD;
      randomisation/dose administration. Participants will undergo pre-dose assessments, post-dose&#xD;
      assessments, and will complete an EOS follow-up visit or early termination (ET) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 42 participants will be enrolled into one of up to six (6) sequential cohorts (Cohorts&#xD;
      A1 to A6). Participants in each cohort will be randomised to receive a single subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SC) dose of either XW003 or matching placebo on Day 1 following an overnight fast. Two&#xD;
      sentinel participants will receive a single SC dose of XW003 initially. If dosing of these&#xD;
      sentinel participants proceeds without clinically significant safety signals in the first 48&#xD;
      hours post-dose, the remaining participants will receive a single dose of XW003 or placebo&#xD;
      according to the randomisation schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Cohorts B1 to B3 (n=10 per cohort) will be randomized to receive a single SC&#xD;
      dose of either XW003 (n=8) or matching placebo (n=2) once weekly for 6 weeks. Doses will be&#xD;
      administered following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.&#xD;
