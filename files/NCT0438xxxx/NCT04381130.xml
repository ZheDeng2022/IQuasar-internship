  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi center, open-label, dose escalation, Phase I/IIa study of EF-009 in up&#xD;
      to 30 patients with borderline resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase I, the study will follow a &quot;3+3&quot; design to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of EF-009 implanted surgically in patients with pancreatic cancer. The MTD is defined&#xD;
      as one dose level (cohort) below the dose in which dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were&#xD;
      observed in ≥ 33% of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IIa is a single arm study with up to 12 subjects in order to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the MTD of EF-009 will increase the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      in patients with borderline resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer. The number of&#xD;
      EF-009 implanted will be based on the MTD dose determined in the Phase I portion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the Phase I and Phase IIa portions of the study, subjects will be evaluated for&#xD;
      response every 8 weeks after EF-009 wafer implantation for up to 2 years, by CT, PET/CT or&#xD;
      MRI (per treating investigator's discretion) using the same method as at baseline. Tumor&#xD;
      measurements will be assessed based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      guidelines version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). The total study duration for each subject consists of&#xD;
      screening, treatment, and extended follow-up period and survival follow-up period.&#xD;
