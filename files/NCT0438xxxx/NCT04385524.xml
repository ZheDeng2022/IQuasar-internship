  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protection against Hepatitis B infection is a regulatory and safety cornerstone to infection&#xD;
      prevention and control programs involving the healthcare workforce in the United States.&#xD;
      Until 2018 when a new adjuvanted vaccine was released, immunization for this population has&#xD;
      involved a three-dose series followed by an additional three-dose series for those&#xD;
      demonstrating lack of seroprotection. If that lack continued following the second three-dose&#xD;
      series, and verification of a negative Hepatitis B antigen status, that person has&#xD;
      historically been deemed a non-responder to Hepatitis B vaccine and at potential risk for&#xD;
      infection. This non-response status may be used to determine job responsibilities&#xD;
      representing excessive risk for the healthcare worker resulting in potential career and&#xD;
      practice limitations and decisions. With the release of the new adjuvanted vaccine, there is&#xD;
      potential to determine the role that new vaccine may play in promoting an immune response&#xD;
      among this non-responding subset of at-risk healthcare workers. The aims of this study&#xD;
      include: 1) determining the effect of this adjuvanted vaccine in producing seropositivity in&#xD;
      a population of healthcare personnel previously deemed as non-responders following&#xD;
      administration of two rounds of the traditional 3-dose series of Hepatitis B vaccine and&#xD;
      confirmation of negative Hepatitis B antigen; and 2) determining the personal and&#xD;
      professional impact of the lack of immunity to Hepatitis B among healthcare personnel.&#xD;

      Background Protection against Hepatitis B infection is a regulatory and safety cornerstone to&#xD;
      infection prevention and control programs involving the healthcare workforce in the United&#xD;
      States. Until 2018 when a new adjuvanted vaccine was released, immunization for this&#xD;
      population has involved a three-dose series followed by an additional three-dose series for&#xD;
      those demonstrating lack of seroprotection. If that lack continued following the second&#xD;
      three-dose series, and verification of a negative Hepatitis B antigen status, that person has&#xD;
      historically been deemed a non-responder to Hepatitis B vaccine and at potential risk for&#xD;
      infection. This non-response status may be used to determine job responsibilities&#xD;
      representing excessive risk for the healthcare worker resulting in potential career and&#xD;
      practice limitations and decisions. With the release of the new adjuvanted vaccine, there is&#xD;
      potential to determine the role that new vaccine may play in promoting an immune response&#xD;
      among this non-responding subset of at-risk healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heplisav B is a standard of care vaccine that provides an alternative to a traditional 3-dose&#xD;
      series by enabling use of a 2-dose series with doses one and two separated by one month. Work&#xD;
      by Jackson and Janssen have indicated a greater than 90% seroprotection, perhaps closer to&#xD;
      100%, with the 2-dose series of this adjuvanted vaccine where hyporesponsiveness to 3-dose&#xD;
      vaccines has been noted, principally in persons who smoke, are diabetic, obese, and male.&#xD;
      This shorter administration schedule and reduced number of doses, combined with the&#xD;
      seroconversion data make this vaccine ideal for situations where rapid induction of&#xD;
      immunization occurs, such as those working in exposure-risk jobs such as healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study include: 1) determining the effect of this adjuvanted vaccine in&#xD;
      producing seropositivity in a population of healthcare personnel previously deemed as&#xD;
      non-responders following administration of two rounds of the traditional 3-dose series of&#xD;
      Hepatitis B vaccine and confirmation of negative Hepatitis B antigen; and 2) determining the&#xD;
      personal and professional impact of the lack of immunity to Hepatitis B among healthcare&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Heplisav B will follow the FDA labeling and will not involve off-label use. Study&#xD;
      personnel will work with the employee/occupational health and infection control departments&#xD;
      to identify healthcare personnel working in a Louisville hospital, long term care facility,&#xD;
      or clinic meeting the definition of a non-responder. Work will be done with University of&#xD;
      Louisville Campus Health Services leadership to identify students, residents, fellows, or&#xD;
      faculty who meet the definition of a non-responder. After gaining consent for participation&#xD;
      in the study, titers will be drawn to document current Hepatitis B quantitative antibody and&#xD;
      antigen levels. Enrolled participants (those with negative antibody and antigen) will be&#xD;
      administered one dose of the adjuvanted vaccine followed by repeat antigen and antibody&#xD;
      testing 30-60 days after receipt of that dose of vaccine. If results of the antibody and&#xD;
      antigen are again negative, a second dose of the adjuvanted vaccine will be administered&#xD;
      followed by repeat antibody and antigen testing 30-60 days after receipt of that dose of&#xD;
      vaccine. For those healthcare personnel enrolled in the study, a questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered designed to understand the personal and professional impact of a non-responder&#xD;
      status to hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All doses of Heplisav B vaccine will be provided by Dynavax and will be at no cost to the&#xD;
      participants. All labs drawn will also be at no cost to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be seen for a total of up to 9 visits with participation in the study&#xD;
      lasting approximately 3 months. Visits involving labwork, vaccine administration, and the&#xD;
      survey will occur in-person at the University of Louisville International Travel Clinic&#xD;
      located in MedCenter One (501 East Broadway, Louisville Kentucky 40202). Visits gathering&#xD;
      information regarding adverse reactions to vaccination will occur via telephone call visits&#xD;
      as well as during in-person visits after the vaccine dose(s) have been administered.&#xD;
