  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) causes chronic cough, throat clearing, hoarseness, and&#xD;
      dysphagia and if left untreated can promote the development of laryngeal cancer. More than&#xD;
      20% of the United Stated population suffer from LPR, yet there is no effective medical&#xD;
      therapy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which inhibit gastric acid production but do not&#xD;
      prevent reflux events, continue to be prescribed for LPR despite their poor efficacy for this&#xD;
      patient population, high cost ($26 billion/year), and associated risks. Pepsin, detected in&#xD;
      the airway of these patients and now known to cause laryngeal inflammation and promote&#xD;
      disease independent of gastric acid, is a key therapeutic target. We report preclinical&#xD;
      studies of select HIV inhibitors that bind to and inhibit pepsin and thus hold promise for&#xD;
      the treatment of LPR. In support, a very low incidence of LPR was found in patients taking&#xD;
      these drugs compared to the general population. HIV inhibitors are ideal drugs to repurpose&#xD;
      because they target a foreign virus. Thus, a repurposing approach can be used to safely&#xD;
      perform proof of concept testing of the efficacy of a pepsin inhibitor for LPR. The Specific&#xD;
      Aim of this project is to perform a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial to assess the efficacy of fosamprenavir/Lexiva for LPR. Lexiva will be used at&#xD;
      the FDA approved, manufacturers recommended dose for HIV for 12 weeks in medically refractory&#xD;
      patients with clinically diagnosed moderate/severe LPR and combined multi-channel&#xD;
      intraluminal impedance - pH (MII-pH) confirmed laryngeal reflux events. Routine clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures for LPR (Reflux Symptom Index and Reflux Finding Score) will be documented&#xD;
      pre- and post-treatment with Lexiva (n = 52) and placebo (n = 52). Saliva will be collected&#xD;
      pre- and post-treatment for both pepsin protein analysis and kinetic activity assay to&#xD;
      compare with clinical measures. There is currently no effective medical therapy for LPR and&#xD;
      pepsin is the key therapeutic target. Identification of an FDA approved drug which inhibits&#xD;
      pepsin allows for a clinical trial to determine efficacy using a faster and safer repurposing&#xD;
      approach to address a significant gap.&#xD;
