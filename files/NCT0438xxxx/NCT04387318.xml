  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant current public health problem,&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of limited airflow. However, COPD has important manifestations&#xD;
      beyond the lungs, the so-called systemic effects. These included dysfunction of peripheral&#xD;
      and respiratory muscles. The growing amount of evidence has shown that patients with COPD&#xD;
      also present important deficits in postural balance and consequently, increased risk of&#xD;
      falling. As an essential part of the management of COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)&#xD;
      alleviates dyspnea and fatigue, improves exercise tolerance and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, and reduces hospital admissions and mortality for COPD patients. Exercise is the key&#xD;
      component of PR, which is composed of exercise assessment and training therapy. Currently,&#xD;
      two modalities of therapy have been suggested as complementary to pulmonary rehabilitation:&#xD;
      inspiratory muscular training (IMT) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Based on&#xD;
      the premise that peripheral and respiratory muscle dysfunction can negatively impact postural&#xD;
      control of patients with COPD, and given the importance of balance as a modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor for falls, it is important to investigate whether the use of these therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities (IMT and/or NMES) is capable of improving the short-term effects of pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation and also promoting improved balance.&#xD;

    <description>IMT will be performed using the POWERbreathe® Medic Plus inspiratory training device for five sets of 10 repetitions each, with a one-minute interval between each set. The initial load set will be 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), during the first two weeks to allow for an adjustment period. The IMT wil be performed two times per week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
NMES will be applied using an calibrated electrical stimulator (Neurodyn High Volt, IBRAMED, São Paulo/São Paulo, Brazil). The following parameters will be used: 50 Hz frequency, pulse duration of 400 µs, work cycle of 5 seconds ON and 15 seconds OFF (first month) adjusted for 10 seconds ON and 30 seconds OFF (second month) and maximum intensity tolerated during 2 times per week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
