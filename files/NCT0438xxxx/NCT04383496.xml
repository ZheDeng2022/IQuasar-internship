  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work will be a key step forward in fulfilling the mission of VA RR&amp;D to restore&#xD;
      function and enable social reintegration for Veterans. Development of an intervention to&#xD;
      increase physical activity may improve physical functioning for Veterans with posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD), thus addressing an important gap in existing care. If demonstrated to&#xD;
      be efficacious in a future randomized trial, this intervention could be implemented&#xD;
      throughout VHA to improve quality of life and enable a full recovery for many Veterans with&#xD;
      PTSD. Results from the proposed work may also advance our understanding of how to optimally&#xD;
      incorporate mobile health technology (mHealth) with more traditional types of patient&#xD;
      contacts, such as in-person visits and telephone calls. Effective use of mHealth may offer&#xD;
      greater flexibility for VHA clinics looking to implement new programs. Incorporation of&#xD;
      mHealth may also increase access to clinical services for Veterans who reside far from VHA&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have poor physical functioning and there&#xD;
      are no existing interventions that effectively address this problem. Our long-term goal is to&#xD;
      develop and implement effective interventions to improve physical functioning and reduce risk&#xD;
      for adverse health outcomes for Veterans with PTSD. The overall objectives of the proposed&#xD;
      project are to develop and pilot test a novel intervention aimed at initiating and&#xD;
      maintaining higher levels of physical activity for Veterans with PTSD. This new intervention&#xD;
      will address attitudinal and behavioral barriers to increasing physical activity for Veterans&#xD;
      with PTSD. Particularly relevant barriers for those with PTSD may include low perceived&#xD;
      behavioral control for making positive long-term lifestyle changes and personal attitudes&#xD;
      about the harms (vs. benefits) of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work will meet two specific aims: 1) Adapt graded exercise therapy (GET) and&#xD;
      incorporate motivational interviewing and mobile health technology (mHealth) to increase&#xD;
      physical activity for Veterans with PTSD; and 2) conduct a pilot study to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for a future randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      To achieve Aim 1, we will develop treatment manuals, training procedures for&#xD;
      interventionists, and processes for assessment of intervention fidelity. The intervention&#xD;
      will use GET to increase perceived behavioral control by enhancing knowledge about&#xD;
      appropriate activities and helping participants set appropriate and attainable daily goals&#xD;
      for physical activity. We will also incorporate motivational interviewing techniques and&#xD;
      mHealth to enhance positive personal attitudes about physical activity. We will work with our&#xD;
      Veteran Engagement Panel for PTSD to refine topics and communication materials. In Aim 2, we&#xD;
      will enroll 3 groups of 6-8 participants (18-24 total) and use a concurrent mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach to rapidly assess feasibility and acceptability. Quantitative measures will include&#xD;
      recruitment (proportion enrolled out of total eligible); attendance (proportion who attend&#xD;
      75% of in-person visits); and retention (proportion who complete post-intervention data&#xD;
      collection). Qualitative assessment will consist of semi-structured interviews on&#xD;
      acceptability of intervention components (eg, format and topics of in-person visits,&#xD;
      usability of mHealth), and barriers and facilitators to attendance. At baseline, during, and&#xD;
      post-intervention, we will also measure overall and physical functioning, and collect data on&#xD;
      other clinical variables (PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, pain, fatigue, and sleep&#xD;
      quality) to inform a future effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work is innovative because it is a novel combination of GET, motivational&#xD;
      interviewing, and mHealth to increase physical activity. It will also be the first&#xD;
      intervention to focus on changing physical activity as a means to improving physical&#xD;
      functioning for individuals with PTSD. Successful experiences with this program may also help&#xD;
      participants build confidence about their general ability to make positive changes related to&#xD;
      health, thus increasing the likelihood they will engage in (and adhere to) mental health&#xD;
      treatments. If such synergy is ultimately demonstrated, it will open a new direction for VA&#xD;
      RR&amp;D and VHA clinical care by indicating that interventions focusing on physical functioning&#xD;
      should be more closely integrated with mental health services. Additionally, this project&#xD;
      will be one of the first to collaborate with our Veteran Engagement Panel on PTSD research.&#xD;
      The format of our panel is adapted from and builds upon previous models of patient&#xD;
      stakeholder engagement. Our model addresses many of the barriers to effective stakeholder&#xD;
      engagement, including challenges to timely recruitment of patients with relevant experiences,&#xD;
      and lack of facilitation expertise among investigators. Completion of this project will help&#xD;
      establish the utility of our model of Veteran stakeholder engagement for rapidly developing&#xD;
      effective interventions with improved feasibility and acceptability. Thus, this work will&#xD;
      enable incorporation of Veteran engagement in future VA research projects.&#xD;
