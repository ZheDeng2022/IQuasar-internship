      Objective: To demonstrate the presence of bioresistant intracorporeal carbon-based&#xD;
      nanocomposites in subjects exposed to a fulguration, in the immediate aftermath of this&#xD;
      fulguration and 24 months (+/- 6 months) after the accident, on blood and urine samples, then&#xD;
      in comparison with blood and urine samples from 14 healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Lightning discharge in the human body reveals the presence of multi-functional&#xD;
      nanoparticles which are reassembled under the impact of the electric discharge into&#xD;
      nanostructured films, filaments and aggregates; they consist of dispersed graphene-like&#xD;
      nanoparticles embedded in an aliphatic cross-reticulated matrix. The high electrical&#xD;
      conductivity of the nanoinclusions, their refractory properties and the cross-reticulation of&#xD;
      the nanoassemblages explain their biorésistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The graphene-like multi-functional nanoparticles are assumed to trace a population of&#xD;
      aerosols formed in the atmosphere by plasma discharge which is present in air, water and all&#xD;
      natural resources. Their ability to undergo changes from folded nanosheets to confined&#xD;
      ultra-fine nanoparticles allow them to be inhaled or absorbed by the human body, or to be&#xD;
      ingested with food.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In order to detect nanocomposites in patients who have been impacted by lightning, an&#xD;
      analysis protocol will be performed on the remains of blood and urine samples from their&#xD;
      initial medical admission. After filtering the blood and urine samples, the remaining&#xD;
      nanocomposites are selected for characterization, at micro to nanoscale, using the scanning&#xD;
      electron microscope and the transmission electron microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on laboratory experiments, a second sampling of blood and urine will be performed 24&#xD;
      months (+/-6 months) after the lightning strike to follow the delayed production of&#xD;
      nanocomposites from the remaining activated nanoparticles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of bioresistant nanocomposites in blood and urine at D0 and M24 (+/- 6 months)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  If the victim was treated between H0 and H2 after the fulguration : an initial blood&#xD;
           sample was taken by the SMUR or the emergency room and stored&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the victim was treated between H0 and H6: urine sample was taken from the first urine&#xD;
           after fulguration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At M24 (+/- 6 months) after the fulguration: collection of 18 ml of blood and two&#xD;
           bottles of urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to describe the neurological disorders of the patients, initial clinical, biological&#xD;
      and radiological data will be collected in the patients' medical records and a new clinical&#xD;
      examination will be performed at 24 months (+/- 6 months) after fulguration.&#xD;

&#xD;
           - Looking through the medical file for the clinical examination of J0 and those of&#xD;
           follow-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Looking through the biological assessment carried out immediately after the event&#xD;
                between H0 and H12 in the lighting-stroke patient to highlight which organs were&#xD;
                affected (bloodlines, kidney, liver, muscle, heart).&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description of measures taken to reduce and avoid bias&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preliminary experiments carried out by the CNRS team with a lightning reactor on&#xD;
                self-samples of urine in order to obtain comparative images, adapt the&#xD;
                manipulations and anticipate the preparation of the lighting-stroke patient samples&#xD;
                to select the most representative nanocomposites for high resolution microscopic&#xD;
                characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the analysis of the samples, the only two experimenters will be the&#xD;
                investigator coordinating the study, Dr FOUSSAT, and Dr COURTY. There will be a&#xD;
                double reading of each sample with consultation on the description.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Photos will be taken with the same camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Selection bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - None, because all 14 patients were fulgurated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Memory bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Cross-check the patients' testimonies with the analyses and complementary examinations&#xD;
           carried out, requested by the attending physician or another health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sampling bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Matching the 14 healthy subjects to the age and sex of the 14 fulgurated subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to better understand the mechanisms of in vivo formation of these&#xD;
           nanocomposites, an attempt will be made to identify them in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Qualitative and quantitative aspects of bioremediation nanocomposites possibly&#xD;
           identified in the blood of subjects not affected by lightning-strike.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of the blood of 14 healthy patients for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  controlling stochastic forming mechanisms of polymer nanocomposite;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  controlling effects of environmental factors (air and water quality) on the&#xD;
                abundance and properties of airmade polymer nanocomposites&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  proof-of-concept justification&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  full analytical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Low levels of bioresistant nanocomposites are expected in this group. The aim is to&#xD;
           trace the occurrence of nanocomposites formed by plasma discharges in the atmosphere&#xD;
           which have passed through the alveolar and digestive barrier into the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The blood of healthy subjects will be collected at the Aurillac CH laboratory by taking&#xD;
           an additional 18 ml on sodium heparinate tube during a blood test for routine check-up&#xD;
           (INR monitoring for example). Patients will be given an information note and a consent&#xD;
           form stating that they accept this additional volume of sample. They will inform their&#xD;
           work and their commune of residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The samples will be anonymised and packaged for transport to the Aurillac laboratory for&#xD;
           analysis under a stereomicroscope microscope in the alcoholic liquid phase. They will&#xD;
           then be sent in dry form to the CNRS for analysis by scanning and transmission electron&#xD;
           microscope.&#xD;
