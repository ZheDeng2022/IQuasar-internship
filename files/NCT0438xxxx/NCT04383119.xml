  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is aimed at evaluating the activity of Trabectedin (arm A) in advanced leiomyosarcomas,&#xD;
      having Gemcitabine (arm B) as the comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the randomized cohort, the study has also an observational prospective cohort&#xD;
      which include patients who will refuse the randomization or for whom the investigator will&#xD;
      not judge the randomization as an appropriate option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to allow the participation of sites only to the prospective-observational (non&#xD;
      randomized) cohort, it was introduced the possibility to participate to the study and receive&#xD;
      the ethical approval only to the Observational Prospective Cohort In parallel an optional&#xD;
      translational study will be performed, in both cohorts, to identify factors predictive of the&#xD;
      activity of Trabectedin or Gemcitabine in this specific histotype.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of patients with leiomyosarcomas determines many difficulties. Despite&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis or who recur after initial treatment have a&#xD;
      dismal prognosis and, except for a subset of selected patients with completely resectable&#xD;
      disease, the median survival is less than two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the advanced-disease stage, the main aim of treatment is to improve patient's quality of&#xD;
      life, possibly survival, with the best compromise between toxicity and symptoms. Trabectedin&#xD;
      (T) is a marine-derived cytotoxic approved by European MEdicine Agency (EMEA) and FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, after&#xD;
      failure of anthracyclines-based chemotherapy or who are unsuitable to receive these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS), activity has been mainly detected in synovial sarcoma,&#xD;
      liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. Although the response rate did not exceed 10%, T was&#xD;
      demonstrated to provide disease control, with progression arrest rates exceeding 50% and&#xD;
      progression-free survival rates exceeding 20% at 6 months. So far no phase II or III studies&#xD;
      have been addressed to test the activity of T in leiomyosarcoma specifically (without&#xD;
      differentiation between site of primary localization) in comparison with Gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed at evaluating the activity of Trabectedin (arm A) in advanced&#xD;
      leiomyosarcomas, having Gemcitabine (arm B) as the comparator. In parallel an optional&#xD;
      translational study will be performed to identify factors predictive of the activity of&#xD;
      Trabectedin or Gemcitabine in this specific histotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the randomized cohort, the study has also an observational prospective cohort&#xD;
      which include patients who will refuse the randomization or for whom the investigator will&#xD;
      not judge the randomization as an appropriate option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to allow the participation of sites only to the prospective-observational (non&#xD;
      randomized) cohort, it was introduced the possibility to participate to the study and receive&#xD;
      the ethical approval only to the Observational Prospective Cohort In parallel an optional&#xD;
      translational study will be performed, in both cohorts, to identify factors predictive of the&#xD;
      activity of Trabectedin or Gemcitabine in this specific histotype.&#xD;
