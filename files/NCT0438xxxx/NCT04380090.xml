  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative constipation, defined as no fully satisfying bowel movement within the first&#xD;
      three postoperative days, is a common occurrence with some researchers estimating that&#xD;
      between 41 and 85% of postoperative patients experience symptoms. Causes include&#xD;
      intraoperative medications, postoperative opioid analgesics, decreased mobility, and&#xD;
      decreased oral intake. Constipation significantly impacts quality of life following surgery.&#xD;
      Current standard of care for preventing postoperative constipation for patients having a&#xD;
      single total knee arthroplasty at Cleveland Clinic is discharge on postoperative day one with&#xD;
      either a prescription to be filled for docusate sodium (brand name ColaceÂ®) 100 mg to be&#xD;
      taken two times a day by mouth for twenty eight days or the filled prescription, plus&#xD;
      discharge instructions on ways to avoid and treat constipation. Research results show that&#xD;
      docusate sodium is ineffective for preventing postoperative constipation in orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery patients, and anecdotal reports confirm this finding. The proposed study uses a&#xD;
      2-group non-equivalent cohort design to evaluate the effect of one standard dose (17 grams)&#xD;
      of an over-the-counter osmotic laxative (propylene glycol (PEG 3350), brand name Miralax) by&#xD;
      mouth prior to discharge to the current standard of care. The primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      whether patients report of a fully satisfying, normal for them, bowel movement within the&#xD;
      first three postoperative days. Patient reported data will be collected by phone call four to&#xD;
      seven days following surgery. Pertinent patient characteristics will be abstracted from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record. The sample will consist of patients over twenty years old having a&#xD;
      single total knee arthroplasty by Drs. Stearns, Molloy, or Murray who are admitted to unit 5D&#xD;
      at Cleveland Clinic Lutheran Hospital postoperatively. Intent to treat analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using logistic and linear regression models, adjusting for differences between&#xD;
      groups on patient and surgical characteristics. Based on use of a two-sided Pearson&#xD;
      chi-square test with 80% power and significance level of 0.05, 49 patients per group are&#xD;
      required to detect a 25% decrease in constipation rate. To account for attrition we will over&#xD;
      sample by 50% for a total of 74 per group or 148 total participants.&#xD;
