  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of short-term fasting in patients with skin&#xD;
      malignancy that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic) treated with&#xD;
      a PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      nivolumab, cemiplimab, avelumab, atezolizumab, or durvalumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Undergoing short-term fasting prior to treatment with one of these PD-L1 or PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors may potentially reduce the side effects of immunotherapy or even improve the&#xD;
      effectiveness of immunotherapy in patients with skin malignancy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of short term fasting in combination with PD-1&#xD;
      inhibition therapy for patients with advanced malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To estimate the percentage of patients who adhere completely to short term fasting (STF)&#xD;
      in combination with PD-1 inhibition therapy for 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. To estimate the percentage of patients who develop unacceptable fasting-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure how many patients can adhere with STF for at least 2 cycles in combination with&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To estimate the percentage of patients who adhere to STF in combination with PD-1&#xD;
      inhibition therapy for at least 2 cycles, or a total of at least 6 out of 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure all grades of fasting-related toxicity. IIa. To estimate the percentage of&#xD;
      patients who develop any grades of fasting-related toxicity, including acceptable&#xD;
      fasting-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The efficacy of combining STF with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition will be assessed by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 response rate, as measured at&#xD;
      the time of tumor assessment after 3 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The immune-related toxicity of combining STF with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition will be recorded&#xD;
      at the start of each cycle, and graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) v 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Quality of life during STF combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition will be recorded using&#xD;
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) version 4, questionnaire tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Fasting-related biomarkers to measure the impact of STF during PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition&#xD;
      include measurement of serum insulin/IGF-1, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, MAPK pathway signaling,&#xD;
      and markers of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Immune biomarkers will be analyzed using immunohistochemistry and ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
      expression studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo STF for 47-48 hours prior to immunotherapy and for 24 hours after&#xD;
      immunotherapy with standard of care pembrolizumab given intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes,&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes, cemiplimab IV over 30 minutes, avelumab IV over 60 minutes,&#xD;
      atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes, or durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up in 3-6 weeks.&#xD;

                  eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recent significant or unexplained weight loss that the investigator&#xD;
             feels may pose an unacceptable risk for enrollment should be excluded. (Candidates who&#xD;

             comorbidity which would make fasting potentially dangerous&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be receiving other concomitant biologic therapy, hormonal therapy,&#xD;
             chemotherapy, other anti-cancer therapy or any other investigational agents while on&#xD;
             this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy, non-cytotoxic agents or investigational agents in the 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive systemic corticosteroids equivalent to prednisone 10 mg or greater&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. use&#xD;
             of disease modifying agents or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or&#xD;
             pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not considered a form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test, active pregnancy or nursing/breast-feeding, due to the&#xD;
             potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm&#xD;
             nursing infants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of solid organ or bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
