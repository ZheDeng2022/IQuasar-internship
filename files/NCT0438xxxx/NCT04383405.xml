  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an acquired insult to the brain from an external mechanical&#xD;
      force. It is considered a major cause of mortality and of long-term disabilities in young&#xD;
      adults, especially considering high-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TBI can cause a wide range of temporary and/or permanent brain's dysfunctions that can&#xD;
      involve physical, cognitive, behavioural and emotional functioning limiting everyday life and&#xD;
      social activities and leading to a lowers quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a sequential preparatory approach (SPA), performed in aquatic environment, based on&#xD;
      increasing difficulty and following a specific sequence of preparatory exercises (from the&#xD;
      simplest to the most complex) could be an effective complementary training during post-acute&#xD;
      intensive rehabilitation in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI).&#xD;

    <description>Aquatic Training training consists of a sequential and a preparatory approach aimed at enhancing dynamic postural stability. The exercises follow a specific sequence starting from a kneeling position, proceeding to a sitting position and ending with a supine position. Step exercises preparatory for gait were performed using a step and two floating aids. Gait exercises were performed first with the upper limbs placed on two floating aids and then during a dual motor task (i.e. catching a ball thrown by the therapist). Subjects performed three sessions a week for four weeks and each session lasting 45 minutes. The training was carried out by a physiotherapist who had at least 5 years of experience in aquatic neurorehabilitation.</description>

    <description>Conventional land-based therapy consists of customized exercises focused on static and dynamic postural stability improvement. The exercises included the active-assisted mobilization, the muscle stretching the postural transition, the balance and the gait training. The control approach was carried out three times a week for four weeks and each session lasted 45 minutes.</description>
