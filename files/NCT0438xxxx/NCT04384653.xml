  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of intravenous&#xD;
      and subcutaneous Furosemide. Although these regimens are not intended to be bioequivalent,&#xD;
      they are both expected to achieve therapeutic plasma levels and induce effective diuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test formulation in this study is a buffered solution, Furosemide Injection Solution at&#xD;
      30 mg/mL at pH 7.4 (range 7.0 to 7.8) and is intended for SC injection according to the&#xD;
      instructions in the protocol. A commercial formulation of Furosemide Injection, USP will&#xD;
      serve as the reference drug in this study, which will be administered by IV bolus. It&#xD;
      contains furosemide 10 mg/mL in solution at alkaline pH of 8.0 to 9.3 and is marketed for IV&#xD;
      and IM injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the absolute bioavailability of furosemide&#xD;
      administered by subcutaneous infusion compared with an equivalent dose of furosemide&#xD;
      administered by IV bolus administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-way, two-period crossover&#xD;
      study in 20 adult subjects previously diagnosed with mild to moderate heart failure (New York&#xD;
      Health Association [NYHA] class II/III) being treated with oral furosemide therapy at a dose&#xD;
      of ≥40 mg/day. Each subject will complete Screening, Admission, Treatment, and Follow-up&#xD;
      Phone Call phases. The Screening Phase will be conducted on an outpatient basis between 28&#xD;
      and 3 days prior to admission. Subjects will be instructed to reduce sodium intake (target &lt;2&#xD;
      g sodium/day) starting 3 days prior to each of the clinical research unit (CRU) admissions.&#xD;
      Admission (Day -1) consists of CRU admission and final qualification assessments. The&#xD;
      Treatment Phase will comprise two crossover periods separated by a 7-day outpatient fluid&#xD;
      re-equilibration washout. Subjects will discontinue oral furosemide at least 24 hours prior&#xD;
      to administration of study drug for each Crossover Period (e.g., no oral furosemide should be&#xD;
      administered after 10pm the night prior to CRU admission). Subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA) to receive both subcutaneous&#xD;
      furosemide (Treatment A; Test) and IV furosemide (Treatment B; Reference) in Crossover&#xD;
      Periods (i.e., subcutaneous followed by IV or vice versa). Subjects will remain domiciled in&#xD;
      the CRU for each treatment Period during the Treatment Phase through 24 hours after&#xD;
      administration of study drug, after which time they will be discharged from the CRU if safety&#xD;
      parameters are acceptable to the Investigator. Oral furosemide therapy will be re-initiated&#xD;
      at discharge after Treatment 1 (i.e., during the 7-day fluid re-equilibration washout) and&#xD;
      after Treatment 2 (i.e., between discharge and Follow-up Phone Call). The Follow-up Phone&#xD;
      Call Phase will occur 7 days (± 1) after discharge from the CRU following Treatment 2,&#xD;
      completing subjects' study participation.&#xD;
