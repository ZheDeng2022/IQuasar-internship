  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary artery sling is a rare congenital pulmonary vascular malformation, often associated&#xD;
      with tracheal or bronchial stenosis. Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery sling with&#xD;
      tracheal stenosis has a high risk and a relatively poor prognosis. This article aims to&#xD;
      explore the relationship between the index of tracheal and left pulmonary artery stenosis and&#xD;
      the surgical effect of pulmonary artery sling with tracheal stenosis. Methods: Retrospective&#xD;
      analysis of the cases of pulmonary artery sling surgery in our center from January 2010 to&#xD;
      December 2018. Before operation, routine cardiac enhancement CT examination was performed,&#xD;
      and the diameter of the left pulmonary artery and the tracheal stenosis were measured on the&#xD;
      CT tomogram respectively, and the ratio of the degree of tracheal stenosis / left pulmonary&#xD;
      artery stenosis (T / P) was calculated, combining the surgical method and clinical prognosis&#xD;
      analyzed and discussed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary artery sling is a rare congenital pulmonary vascular malformation. The abnormality&#xD;
      of the left pulmonary artery originates from the right pulmonary artery instead of the trunk&#xD;
      of the pulmonary artery. It passes around the trachea, passes between the trachea and the&#xD;
      esophagus, and forms a vascular ring with the arterial ligament. Compression of the trachea&#xD;
      and esophagus, especially the symptoms of tracheal stenosis caused by the compression of the&#xD;
      trachea, can be manifested as serious symptoms such as respiratory infections, wheezing, and&#xD;
      even respiratory distress, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. Therefore, the key&#xD;
      to the surgical treatment of pulmonary artery sling is to relieve tracheal compression and&#xD;
      correct tracheal stenosis, which is also the difficulty. At present, the overall survival&#xD;
      rate of surgical treatment of pulmonary artery sling around the world is about 78% to 93%&#xD;
      [1], but the mortality rate for patients with severe tracheal stenosis is also high, reaching&#xD;
      about 24% [1], mainly due to pre-operative or post-operative respiratory failure caused by&#xD;
      narrowed trachea. At present, the selection and intervention of pulmonary artery sling&#xD;
      combined with tracheal stenosis is still a difficult problem. On the one hand, if&#xD;
      tracheoplasty is performed, anastomotic scar hyperplasia after surgery may lead to local&#xD;
      tracheal stenosis again [2], and long-term care is also quite difficult; If tracheoplasty is&#xD;
      not performed, tracheal stenosis may not be completely relieved, and obstructive ventilation&#xD;
      disorder and respiratory failure may occur after surgery [1]. At present, there is basically&#xD;
      no objection to the preoperative assessment methods of pulmonary artery sling. CCTA is&#xD;
      generally considered to be an effective method for diagnosing pulmonary artery sling with&#xD;
      tracheal stenosis. It can display abnormally deformed pulmonary arteries and narrowed&#xD;
      trachea, and it can also detect intracardiac malformations. The important means of&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation can also be used for postoperative evaluation [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no consensus on the indications for tracheal intervention with pulmonary&#xD;
      artery sling combined with tracheal stenosis. Some researchers believe that tracheoplasty&#xD;
      should be performed for tracheal diameters less than 3mm, or the prognosis is poor [4]. Some&#xD;
      researchers have suggested that the diameter / length percentage of tracheal stenosis can be&#xD;
      used as a reference index for intervention of tracheal stenosis [5]. Brouns et al. found that&#xD;
      the square of the cross-sectional area of the tracheal stenosis has a significant&#xD;
      proportional relationship with the air flow, so they believe that the cross-sectional area of&#xD;
      the tracheal stenosis is the main factor affecting the ventilation effect [6]. When I&#xD;
      reviewed the imaging data of children with tracheal stenosis in our center, the most severe&#xD;
      tracheal stenosis is usually located in the vascular ring formed by the right pulmonary&#xD;
      artery starting segment, the left pulmonary artery starting segment, and the left pulmonary&#xD;
      artery bypass segment. Not only was the trachea compressed and significantly narrowed, but&#xD;
      the left pulmonary artery was also significantly narrowed, that is, the trachea and the left&#xD;
      pulmonary artery were squeezed together in a limited space, causing both of them to be&#xD;
      compressed and narrowed. This study was the first to investigate the interaction and&#xD;
      morphological changes of the trachea and the left pulmonary artery, and the ratio of the&#xD;
      degree of tracheal stenosis / left pulmonary artery stenosis (T / P) was used to indicate the&#xD;
      degree of interaction between the two. A larger T / P ratio indicates that the left pulmonary&#xD;
      artery is more dominant in tracheal compression, and tracheal stenosis is usually more&#xD;
      serious. On the contrary, a smaller T / P ratio indicates that the trachea is more dominant&#xD;
      in compression of the left pulmonary artery, and the tracheal stenosis is usually relatively&#xD;
      lighter. This article retrospectively analyzes the cases in our center and discusses the&#xD;
      effects of surgical treatment.&#xD;
