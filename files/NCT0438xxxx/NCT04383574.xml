      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, single-center, placebo-controlled phase 1&amp;2&#xD;
      clinical trial in healthy elderly aged 60 years and above. The experimental vaccine and&#xD;
      placebo were both manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd. A total of 422&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled, with 72 in phase 1 and 350 in phase 2. 72 Subjects with 36 at&#xD;
      medium dosage stage and 36 at high dosage stage in phase 1 will receive two doses of primary&#xD;
      immunization according to the immunization schedule of day 0, 28 and the subjects at each&#xD;
      dosage stage will be assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive investigational vaccine or placebo&#xD;
      respectively.All enrolled subjects will receive 1 dose of booster immunization 1 year after&#xD;
      primary immunization.350 Subjects in phase 2 will receive two doses of primary immunization&#xD;
      according to the immunization schedule of day 0,28,the subjects will be assigned in a ratio&#xD;
      of 2:2:2:1 to receive the low dosage, medium dosage, high dosage vaccine, or placebo. All&#xD;
      enrolled subjects will received 1 dose of booster immunization 6 months after primary&#xD;
      immunization.&#xD;
