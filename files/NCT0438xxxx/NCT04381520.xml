      Heat-sensitive moxibustion is considered to be effective for primary hypertension in hospital&#xD;
      setting. This study aims to investigate whether heat-sensitive moxibustion&#xD;
      self-administration is effective for lowering blood pressure and improving quality of life&#xD;
      for patients with primary hypertension in community setting using a multicenter, prospective,&#xD;
      non-randomized study design&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hypertension is a global health issue with high incidence; it affected approximately&#xD;
      1.13 billion people worldwide and directly or indirectly causing an 10.4 million of death&#xD;
      yearly. The routine drugs for primary hypertension are limited by adverse effects and&#xD;
      expensive costs. Therefore, complementary and alternative medicine with good efficacy and&#xD;
      safety and low expenditure is still needed for primary hypertension, especially in&#xD;
      poverty-stricken areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat-sensitive moxibustion is an innovative therapy developed on the basis of traditional&#xD;
      moxibustion. Compared with traditional moxibustion, heat-sensitive moxibustion advocates&#xD;
      finding heat-sensitive acupoints where patients have special reactions to moxibustion heat,&#xD;
      including diathermy, heat transfer, soreness, etc. The application of moxibustion on&#xD;
      heat-sensitive acupoints (i.e., heat-sensitive moxibustion) has been shown to be more&#xD;
      effective to traditional moxibustion for many diseases, including primary hypertension.&#xD;
      Moreover, compared with acupuncture, heat-sensitive moxibustion has a main advantage that&#xD;
      moxibustion does not require professional qualifications and patients can self-administer&#xD;
      moxibustion after professional training. However, the current evidence is generated only from&#xD;
      hospital settings. Therefore, this study is specifically designed to investigate whether&#xD;
      heat-sensitive moxibustion self-administration is an effective intervention for lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure and improving quality of life for patients with primary hypertension in&#xD;
      community setting.&#xD;
