  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) are the major long-term complication of intrauterine procedures&#xD;
      and are associated with pelvic pain, menstrual disorders, obstetrical complication and&#xD;
      infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Womed Leaf is a medical device specifically designed for intrauterine use that prevents&#xD;
      intra-uterine adhesions. It is a film that acts as a mechanical barrier to keep uterus walls&#xD;
      separated during healing. It is then naturally discharged through the cervix and vagina in&#xD;
      less than 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PREG1 clinical investigation is designed to evaluate Womed Leaf safety under clinical&#xD;
      conditions, in women scheduled for a hysteroscopic myomectomy as well as its efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) are defined as &quot;fibrous strings at opposing walls of the uterus&#xD;
      and/or cervix leading to partial or complete obliteration of the cavity&quot;. IUAs are the major&#xD;
      long-term complication of intrauterine procedures and are associated with pelvic pain,&#xD;
      menstrual disorders, obstetrical complications and infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Womed Leaf™ is a sterile, degradable polymer film specifically design for intrauterine use.&#xD;
      It is inserter in the uterus like an intrauterine device. Once released it will self-deploy&#xD;
      into the uterine cavity to form a mechanical barrier keeping uterus walls separated during&#xD;
      healing, for several days, thus preventing the formation or recurrence of intrauterine&#xD;
      adhesions. It is degraded and discharged naturally through the cervix and vagina in less than&#xD;
      30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PREG1 clinical investigation is a prospective multicenter, single arm study, designed to&#xD;
      evaluate Womed Leaf safety under clinical conditions, in women scheduled for a hysteroscopic&#xD;
      myomectomy as well as its efficacy in preventing IUA at second look hysteroscopy.&#xD;
