  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the cerebral mechanisms of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH)&#xD;
      in type 1 diabetics following exposure to experimental recurrent hypoglycemia (HG). To induce&#xD;
      IAH, patients with T1D identified to have normal awareness of hypoglycemia (NAH) will undergo&#xD;
      three 2-hour long hypoglycemic clamps. Neurochemical profiles will be measured by high field&#xD;
      MRS before and after induction of IAH. Subject glycemic variability and activity/sleep for 1&#xD;
      week before each study will be monitored as all factors have been shown to alter responses to&#xD;
      HG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to identify how recurrent hypoglycemia (HG) leads to&#xD;
      the clinical syndrome of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetes (T1D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that recurrent HG in T1D leads to an upregulation in&#xD;
      brain glucose transport and alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic tone. The&#xD;
      investigators will use MRS methodology that permits evaluation of cerebral cortex and&#xD;
      hypothalamus in the same session to simultaneously evaluate the cerebral correlates/mediators&#xD;
      of impaired awareness and impaired counterregulatory hormone responses (CRR). High MR data&#xD;
      quality and reproducibility will be ensured by using high field MR scanners and technical&#xD;
      advances (automated voxel placement, real-time voxel position, frequency, shim updates).&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring and actigraphy will be used to chronicle glucose variability&#xD;
      and activity/exercise/sleep in the weeks before each experiment to assess the impact of these&#xD;
      variables on IAH.&#xD;

    <description>A kinetic model of glucose transport through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) via reversible symmetric Michaelis-Menten kinetics and irreversible utilization in brain tissue will be utilized. The kinetics of glucose transport into and utilization in the frontal cortex will be quantified using dynamic modeling to extract the Michaelis-Menten constants and the maximal rate for glucose transport and utilization. The ratio of maximal transport rate to cerebral metabolic rate of glucose will be estimated for the hypothalamus by steady-state modeling.</description>
