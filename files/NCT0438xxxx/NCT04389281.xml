  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I trial for subjects with advanced head &amp; neck cancer, breast cancer, soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma or melanoma all subjects will receive open label X-PACT treatment as a&#xD;
      intra-tumoral injection. The primary objective will be to establish the safety of X-PACT when&#xD;
      dosed with 5 intra-tumoral injections of the combination product (the phosphor device and&#xD;
      methoxsalen sterile solution and subsequently exposing the tumor to X-ray energy) over a&#xD;
      period of 6 weeks (on day D1, D3 and D5 of Week 1, on D1 of Week 2, and a booster on D1 of&#xD;
      Week 6). After the week 8 tumor assessment subjects demonstrating stable disease, partial&#xD;
      response or unconfirmed progression assessed by iRecist, will be eligible to receive two&#xD;
      additional booster treatments 4-6 weeks apart. Treatment will be considered safe provided ≤ 2&#xD;
      out of 12 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the&#xD;
      first intra-tumoral injection.&#xD;

    <description>X-PACT is comprised of a phosphor device, the drug methoxsalen sterile solution and X-ray energy. The dose of methoxsalen sterile solution per injection will vary per patient and will remained fixed across injections within each patient as it is based on the applicable tumor volume at baseline. Immediately after each injection of the combination product, patients will be exposed to an X-ray beam delivered via a LINAC (and thus targeted at the tumor) at a fixed dose to activate the combination product.</description>

               2. Advanced unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative&#xD;
                  treatment with surgery or radiation.&#xD;
