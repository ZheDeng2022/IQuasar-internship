  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REM Behavior Sleep Disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder causing people to 'act out' their&#xD;
      dreams. A high percentage of individuals with idiopathic RBD (iRBD) are known to develop&#xD;
      conditions affecting the neurons in the brain such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on the&#xD;
      increased risk to develop PD, individuals with iRBD are currently considered ideal candidates&#xD;
      for therapies that can possibly protects brain cells, due to the critical window of&#xD;
      opportunity to intervene early before brain cell loss progresses significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early changes of PD are associated with a number of symptoms including loss of smell,&#xD;
      constipation, anxiety and depression. In addition, early heart and brain abnormalities can be&#xD;
      visualized using specialized imaging techniques called 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy&#xD;
      (MIBG) and dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)&#xD;
      respectively. The combined presence of certain symptoms and the use of these imaging&#xD;
      techniques are considered early markers of PD in individuals with iRBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to learn about the effect of treatment with the&#xD;
      beta-blocker terazosin on MIBG abnormalities found in iRBD patients at risk to develop PD.&#xD;
      The investigators believe that reversing the MIBG abnormality might prelude to a slowing of&#xD;
      the neurodegenerative process. This drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Hypertension. However, terazosin is not&#xD;
      approved by the FDA in patients with iRBD at risk for PD. The available doses for this drug&#xD;
      oral formulations are 1mg, 2 mg, 5mg and 10 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes visualized with the MIBG imaging technique will be correlated to the presence and&#xD;
      severity of neurological (i.e. tremors, stiffness, slow movements, walking difficulties) and&#xD;
      other symptoms associated with PD (i.e. abnormal smell, constipation, depression, color&#xD;
      vision abnormalities), as measured by specific clinical scales and exams.&#xD;

    <description>Fifteen patients with defined pre-motor PD risk and abnormal baseline 123I-MIBG uptake, with or without 123I-Ioflupane uptake abnormality or PD motor symptoms, will be recruited to receive daily oral doses of terazosin 5 mg or 10 mg. The dosage of terazosin will be gradually increased from the initial recommended starting dose of 1 mg daily at bedtime and titrated stepwise to 2mg, 5mg or 10 mg weekly, according to patient tolerability, as measured by subjective complaints, arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The target dose will be 5 mg or 10 mg daily based on subject's tolerability. Development of incompatibility will be addressed by individually adjusting the dose of terazosin.</description>
