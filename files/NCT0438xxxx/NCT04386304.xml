  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study aimed at evaluating the safety, early&#xD;
      efficacy and potential biomarkers of (+)-epicatechin in patients with Becker or Becker-like&#xD;
      Muscular Dystrophy (BMD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of three escalating doses of (+)-epicatechin will be assessed and&#xD;
      early effectiveness measured by changes in plasma biomarkers, tissue biomarkers from muscle&#xD;
      biopsies, cardiac imaging, and on clinical function assessments of participants' muscle&#xD;
      strength. All patients will receive oral (+)-epicatechin for a total duration of&#xD;
      approximately 52 weeks. Three doses of (+)-epicatechin will be tested in sequential 2 month&#xD;
      periods with total daily doses of 75, 150, and 225 mg/day (+)-epicatechin. Doses will be&#xD;
      escalated every 2 months, if tolerated, for the first 6 months of the study. Participants&#xD;
      will then continue to receive the highest does they tolerated for an additional 6 months.&#xD;
