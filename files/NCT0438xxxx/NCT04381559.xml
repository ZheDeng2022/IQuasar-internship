  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the continued high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence rates among gay,&#xD;
      bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in North American cities, there is a&#xD;
      critical need for HIV prevention interventions for MSM in Canada. Social anxiety, or anxiety&#xD;
      about being evaluated in interpersonal and performance situations, is a reliable risk factor&#xD;
      for condomless anal sex (CAS) among MSM. Social anxiety may also increase substance use in&#xD;
      sexual situations, which is another risk factor for HIV among MSM. As such, an&#xD;
      empirically-based social anxiety treatment may also reduce HIV risk behaviours among MSM. The&#xD;
      present study will provide the first efficacy data for a novel and innovative HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention for MSM. This intervention will build upon empirically supported interventions&#xD;
      to reduce HIV risk among MSM and therapies to reduce social anxiety. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test the efficacy of a novel integrated HIV prevention intervention that combines&#xD;
      the most empirically supported treatment for social anxiety disorder, cognitive-behavioural&#xD;
      therapy, with HIV risk reduction counselling in order to simultaneously treat social anxiety&#xD;
      disorder, substance use disorders, and HIV sexual risk behaviour. This study will be a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing the study intervention relative to applied relaxation,&#xD;
      a behavioural intervention that is efficacious in treating social anxiety disorder but that&#xD;
      does not address substance use problems or HIV sexual risk behaviours. For this trial, 176&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to either 12 sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy with&#xD;
      HIV risk reduction counselling or 12 sessions of applied relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be eligible for the trial if they are HIV-negative, report clinically&#xD;
      significant symptoms of social anxiety disorder, substance use 2 hours before or during&#xD;
      sexual activity, and CAS without the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a male&#xD;
      partner who was not known to be HIV-negative. PrEP is a biomedical prevention approach in&#xD;
      which HIV-negative individuals are provided with daily oral antiretroviral medication for the&#xD;
      primary prevention of HIV.126 The present intervention, if found to be efficacious, is&#xD;
      innovative in that mental health clinicians will be able to not only extend empirically&#xD;
      supported therapies tested primarily with heterosexual populations to MSM, but they will also&#xD;
      be able to prevent HIV through empirically supported psychotherapy practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to bear a disproportionate&#xD;
      burden of the sexually transmitted infections (STI), such as HIV in Canada, largely&#xD;
      attributable to efficient transmission during condomless anal sex (CAS). Despite overall&#xD;
      declines in HIV incidence since 2005, HIV incidence among MSM remains stable. In 2016, MSM&#xD;
      accounted for 52.5% of new HIV diagnoses in Canada, compared with 56.8% in 2014. MSM also&#xD;
      represent over half of all prevalent HIV cases. The HIV epidemic among MSM has failed to&#xD;
      decline despite biomedically-driven efforts to reduce infectiousness through the&#xD;
      proliferation of antiretroviral Treatment as Prevention, and the emergence of HIV&#xD;
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce HIV susceptibility. The epidemiologic data&#xD;
      underscore the need for efficacious interventions for reducing sexual risk behaviour among&#xD;
      MSM. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has therefore identified MSM as a high&#xD;
      priority population to reach with prevention initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social anxiety is a risk factor for CAS among MSM. It is typically defined as the experience&#xD;
      of fear of and apprehension about being evaluated in interpersonal situations, including&#xD;
      romantic or sexual relationships. Social anxiety is higher among gay men and other sexual&#xD;
      minority populations than among heterosexuals on both dimensional measures and categorical&#xD;
      measures, with recent studies reporting the prevalence of social anxiety disorders among MSM&#xD;
      as 22.3-22.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social anxiety predicts risky sex among MSM. Research suggests a direct relation between&#xD;
      social anxiety and CAS among MSM. Social anxiety was associated with a greater proportion of&#xD;
      receptive and insertive CAS even after adjusting for condom use negotiation, depression, and&#xD;
      club drug use. Social anxiety may also increase substance use in sexual situations, which is&#xD;
      another risk factor for HIV among MSM. However, no studies have examined the efficacy of&#xD;
      social anxiety treatment on CAS among MSM. Social anxiety is highly modifiable via&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fears of being sexually rejected by one's partner fully accounted for the association between&#xD;
      social anxiety at baseline and CAS at 6-month follow-up. This study is consistent with&#xD;
      previous findings that 32% of gay men reported being less likely to use condoms when they&#xD;
      were concerned their partner would react negatively. Substance use may be another mediator.&#xD;
      Social anxiety is also a risk factor for later alcohol use and other substance use problems&#xD;
      in clinical and nonclinical samples, including among MSM. Substance use tends to follow&#xD;
      social anxiety disorder because alcohol and other substances are used to self-medicate&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms in social situations. Alcohol and substance use in sexual situations is a&#xD;
      relatively consistent risk factor for CAS among Canadian MSM, as well as higher HIV&#xD;
      incidence. Due to consistent data linking substance use to HIV risks, it has been suggested&#xD;
      that incorporating alcohol and substance use treatment into sexual risk reduction counselling&#xD;
      may increase the efficacy of HIV prevention efforts for MSM. Social anxiety may have a&#xD;
      specific relationship with substance use in creating risk for HIV and other STIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will provide efficacy data for a novel and innovative STI/HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention for MSM. This intervention, called Sexual Confidence, builds upon empirically&#xD;
      supported treatments for social anxiety, including social anxiety-related substance use, by&#xD;
      adding risk reduction counselling to reduce STI/HIV sexual risk behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 10 years, numerous well-designed clinical trials have established the efficacy&#xD;
      of behavioural interventions to reduce HIV risk behaviour among HIV-negative individuals.&#xD;
      However, the success of these programs is limited, and evidence suggests these effects&#xD;
      diminish over time. Improving the efficacy of these programs is a public health priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal seeks to reach individuals who are at higher risk for engaging in&#xD;
      continued HIV risk behaviour due to the presence of social anxiety and substance use in&#xD;
      sexual situations, and who may have difficulty responding to an intervention that targets&#xD;
      sexual risk taking alone. Research from multiple countries suggests that all MSM are not&#xD;
      equally at risk for HIV. A preponderance of data indicates the incremental presence of&#xD;
      co-occurring mental health and substance use problems, called syndemic, predict both HIV&#xD;
      prevalence and HIV sexual risk behaviour among MSM. One of the largest studies of MSM from&#xD;
      151 countries reported a strong dose-response relationship with increasing odds of HIV&#xD;
      infection and greater number of syndemic problems. Compared with those without syndemic&#xD;
      problems, the odds of HIV infection among those with 1, 2 and 3 or more syndemic problems&#xD;
      were 1.67, 2.02 and 2.35 times greater respectively. The MSM in our study may account for&#xD;
      almost half (22% of MSM who have double the risk for contracting HIV) of the HIV epidemic in&#xD;
      Canada and beyond. Our team and others in sexual health promotion and HIV prevention have&#xD;
      found that untreated mental health issues interfere with safer sexual practices. In order to&#xD;
      adequately meet the HIV prevention needs of MSM, HIV prevention interventions need to address&#xD;
      the mental health problems that contribute to increased risk in this group and that impede&#xD;
      the efficacy of traditional HIV prevention efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses suggest that behavioural interventions can be efficacious at reducing&#xD;
      self-reported CAS among MSM. Other reviews found greater efficacy with active interventions&#xD;
      rather than interventions where participants just receive information. In accordance with&#xD;
      these findings, the Sexual Confidence program includes actively role-playing situations in&#xD;
      which participants practice their safer sex negotiation skills. Given the lack of efficacious&#xD;
      interventions designed in Canada, there is a need for rigorous empirical testing of the&#xD;
      effects of HIV prevention interventions for Canadian MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea have risen among MSM, especially among HIV+ MSM&#xD;
      living in the Canadian urban centers including Toronto. Co-infection with HIV is particularly&#xD;
      concerning as CAS with HIV+ MSM can increase likelihood of transmission. A cohort study from&#xD;
      the Ontario HIV Treatment Network reported a 12-month cumulative incidence of 1.7% (95% CI&#xD;
      1.1% to 2.2%) for chlamydia/gonorrhea and having CAS with multiple HIV+ partners (HR=3.3, 95%&#xD;
      CI 1.4 to 7.8) was a strong predictor of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT focuses on reducing psychological distress and the psychosocial interference of anxiety,&#xD;
      substance use, and other psychological problems using cognitive restructuring techniques&#xD;
      (i.e., teaching people to think more realistically about the situations they fear) and by&#xD;
      repeated exposure to feared situations. CBT promotes learning adaptive responses to feared&#xD;
      stimuli and is hypothesized to facilitate cognitive changes. Although behavioural therapies&#xD;
      such as applied relaxation (AR) and exposure therapy are also brief and efficacious&#xD;
      interventions, only CBT has evidence supporting its use when social anxiety disorder and&#xD;
      substance use problems are comorbid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT has proven to be acceptable among diverse MSM populations. A manualized format, the&#xD;
      availability of training, and the presence of competence and adherence rating scales are&#xD;
      additional characteristics that make CBT a feasible modality for HIV prevention programming.&#xD;
      Lastly, the conceptual underpinnings for CBT (social cognitive theory) are shared by most&#xD;
      other research-supported HIV risk reduction interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current state of the science identifies behavioural therapies, including CBT, as the&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment of choice for social anxiety disorder. A review of 32 RCTs reported&#xD;
      that the average CBT treated participant scored better than 80% of the waitlist and 66% of&#xD;
      the placebo participants, and patients continue to increase the magnitude of their treatment&#xD;
      gains over time. Pharmacotherapy treatments fare as well as CBT although pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      often requires continuing treatment indefinitely to prevent relapse, whereas CBT has a finite&#xD;
      number of sessions and is associated with strong maintenance of treatment gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to test the efficacy of this integrated program in reducing sexual risk&#xD;
      behaviour using a 2-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT). Secondarily, we will compare the&#xD;
      social anxiety, substance use in sexual situations, and the cumulative incidence of bacterial&#xD;
      STIs between the two arms over a 9-month follow-up period. We hypothesize that, relative to&#xD;
      the control condition, Sexual Confidence will reduce sexual risk behaviour, as defined by CAS&#xD;
      with HIV-positive or unknown HIV status sexual partners without the use of PrEP. We further&#xD;
      hypothesize that Sexual Confidence will result in greater reductions in social anxiety and&#xD;
      substance use in sexual situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed research is a single blind, two arm randomized trial. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the CBT or AR arm. Counsellors cannot be blinded as they are providing&#xD;
      treatment, but assessors will be blinded to treatment condition. Participants will not be&#xD;
      provided with details on the treatment condition to which they were not assigned to minimize&#xD;
      the possibility that participant beliefs about which condition is better will impact&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to CBT, the experimental arm, or the AR arm, which&#xD;
      serves as the control condition. Both arms are active treatment conditions; however, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the Sexual Confidence CBT arm will have a significantly larger effect on&#xD;
      sexual risk behaviour than the AR arm as AR does not discuss or address substance use, sexual&#xD;
      risk reduction, or sexual behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a conceptual model for the relationship between social anxiety, substance use, and&#xD;
      sexual risk behaviour that purports the experience of social anxiety symptoms in sexual&#xD;
      situations generates unwanted anxious affect (e.g., fear of sexual rejection, fear of&#xD;
      negative evaluation), which individuals are motivated to avoid. Heavy alcohol and drug&#xD;
      consumption before or during sexual activity is the behavioural mechanism in the model in&#xD;
      this study for avoiding the anxiety associated with social interactions. In this way, using&#xD;
      substances to avoid socially anxious thoughts leads to risky sexual behaviour both directly&#xD;
      and indirectly through impaired safer sex negotiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These mechanisms are consistent with cognitive-behavioural theory. Behaviourally, substance&#xD;
      use (and potentially risky sexual behaviour) is negatively reinforced through the avoidance&#xD;
      of (or escape from) unwanted anxious affect. Cognitively, socially anxious predictions&#xD;
      generate unrealistic risk appraisals of rejection that contribute to sexual risk. Sexual&#xD;
      Confidence is designed to address these specified pathways: (a) planned exposures to learn&#xD;
      adaptive strategies for reducing social anxiety, avoidance-motivated substance use, and&#xD;
      avoidance-motivated sexual risk, (b) cognitive restructuring to train realistic cognitive&#xD;
      appraisals of rejection for negotiating safer sex, and (c) risk reduction counselling to&#xD;
      increase safer sex negotiation skills and to specify safer sex behaviour change targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During COVID 19, participants may not be able to attend in-person sessions for assessments&#xD;
      and therapy. In order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among study participants,&#xD;
      and to address potential participant reluctance to attend assessment and therapy sessions in&#xD;
      person, we have created an online, or teletherapy, version of the study using Zoom for&#xD;
      Healthcare. Teletherapy will be used for all assessment and therapy sessions. Participants&#xD;
      who do not have access to a private location and/or the necessary technology to safely&#xD;
      utilize Zoom will be offered a private room with a computer in order to utilize teletherapy&#xD;
      from our research lab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must report engaging in CAS sex without PrEP with a man of HIV-positive&#xD;
             or unknown HIV status within the last 3 months and report using substances within 2&#xD;
             hours before and/or during sexual activities. Participants must self-identify as a man&#xD;
             (including trans* men who self-identify as men), and be aged 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To minimize bias, participants will be asked to report to the research study clinician in&#xD;
        case they decide to engage in other psychotherapies outside of the study protocol or decide&#xD;
        to change their psychoactive medication or dose for the duration of their participation in&#xD;
        the study. Participants who participate in outside psychotherapies or who change their&#xD;
        medication regimens will still be permitted to conclude the therapy, but their data will&#xD;
        not be included in the RCT analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As mentioned previously, participants taking PrEP will be excluded from participating.&#xD;
             This excludes individuals 1) on daily PrEP dosing, with no more then 3 doses missed&#xD;
             per week at the time of exposure and 2) on-demand dosing at the time of the exposure,&#xD;
             including at least one dose before and after exposure. Participants need to score&#xD;
             within 1 SD of the clinical mean (M = 67.2) for social anxiety disorder on the&#xD;
             Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons will be excluded if our assessors/counsellors find that a participant's&#xD;
             ability to respond to study measures is compromised by mental or physical disabilities&#xD;
             or inability to speak and understand English.&#xD;
