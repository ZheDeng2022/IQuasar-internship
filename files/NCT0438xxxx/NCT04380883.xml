  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiography or angioplasty are commonly now done through inserting the device through radial&#xD;
      artery in hand i.e. trans-radial procedures. It is reported that between 2-30% of these&#xD;
      procedures get complicated by radial artery occlusion (RAO) which limit future use of this&#xD;
      site for similar procedures if needed. It is important to control the arterial bleeding after&#xD;
      the procedure completion while maintaining radial arterial flow appears to be an important&#xD;
      factor in reducing RAO (patent hemostasis). Currently the most frequently employed method for&#xD;
      hemostasis following trans-radial procedures is a compression device (RCD) such as&#xD;
      TransRadial Bands (TRB). But TRB takes hours to achieve hemostasis and causes discomfort to&#xD;
      the patients and longer time to discharge. Hemostatic pads offer an alternative to RCD where&#xD;
      overall compression time is inherently low and patent hemostasis can possibly be achieved.&#xD;
      The combined use of TR band with a hemostatic device may allow ease of use with reduced&#xD;
      hemostasis time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial aims to test the hypothesis that compared to TR band (TRB) alone, catecholamine&#xD;
      chitosan-based pad (InnoSEAL hemostatic pad, InnoTherapy, Inc.) used in conjunction with TRB&#xD;
      (InnoSEAL+TRB)is nearly as good as TRB alone in terms of the outcomes like RAO and hematoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, randomized, open label trial with the following study hypotheses (Ha):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. InnoSEAL+TRB is non-inferior to TRB alone in terms of the composite adverse access site&#xD;
           outcomes including RAO and hematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. InnoSEAL+TRBis non-inferior to TRB alone when comparing ease of use scores rated by the&#xD;
           cath lab technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. InnoSEAL+TRB is superior to TRB alone for outcomes of reduction in total hemostasis&#xD;
           time, total observation time for the radial site and time to hospital discharge for&#xD;
           daycare patients sub group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. InnoSEAL+TRBis superior to TRB alone in terms of minimized patient discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping a combined complication rate of 17.7% (RAO:7.7%, Hematoma: 10%), difference in favor&#xD;
      of the experimental treatment of 4.89%, power of 80%, one sided alpha of 2.5%, 10% attrition&#xD;
      rate, a sample of at least 357 patients in each group and a total of 714 patients will be&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using variable sized blocks through computer software by an&#xD;
      unrelated staff from the research department who is not a part of this study and will be kept&#xD;
      in safe in the research department. Allocation of intervention will be informed to the&#xD;
      research staff for each individual patient through telephone call, only after the informed&#xD;
      consent has been taken by the data collector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In InnoSEAL+TRB arm, InnoSEAL patch will be applied at the puncture site and will be covered&#xD;
      by a transparent dressing. TRB will be applied over the patch and 12 cc air will be injected&#xD;
      to inflate the band. Air is removed from TRB during 60 minutes, removing 2cc air at 20&#xD;
      minutes, 4cc at 40 minutes and 6cc at 60 minutes from the time of sheath removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TR band is applied centered over the puncture site and the bladder is inflated with 15cc air.&#xD;
      Air is removed gradually leaving at least 10 cc air provided there is no oozing. Start&#xD;
      removing air at 90 min (from the time of hemostasis protocol):&#xD;
&#xD;
      4cc-at 20 min, 6cc-at 40 min. 6cc-at each 20 min till reach 0cc. If re-bleeding at any time,&#xD;
      reintroduce 2cc air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the arms TRB will be left with 0cc air for 30 min. Reverse Barbeau's test will be&#xD;
      applied in both the arms to determine RAO. If occlusion was found, radial artery ultrasound&#xD;
      will be conducted. Both TRB and InnoSEAL patch will be removed before discharge of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by the trained nursing staff hired specifically for the study and who&#xD;
      will receive one day training on study protocols. Study coordinator will daily check all the&#xD;
      forms for completeness and accuracy and 10% of the completed forms will be randomly checked&#xD;
      by one of the study investigators. Institutional IRB will also do an audit of the study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered in Access data base and will be analyzed through SPSS v.25. Means and&#xD;
      standard deviation will be reported for continuous data based on normality assumption along&#xD;
      with histograms and compared using Student t-test. And frequencies with percentages will be&#xD;
      reported for the categorical variables. The differences between categorical variables were&#xD;
      examined by the Chi square test considering p-value&lt; .05 statistically significant. Chi&#xD;
      square test will be utilized to assess primary composite outcome and its components.&#xD;
      Independent sample t-test will be used for comparison of time intervals. Kruskall Wallis test&#xD;
      will be utilized for significance testing between ordinal secondary outcomes of ease of use&#xD;
      and patient discomfort.&#xD;
