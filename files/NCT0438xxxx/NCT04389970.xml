    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the preliminary efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      acceptability of time restricted feeding (TRF) among a sample of 12 adults with&#xD;
      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). The specific aims of this study are: 1: To&#xD;
      determine preliminary efficacy of TRF for reducing symptom burden, improving inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, and reducing cardiometabolic risk among adults with RRMS. 2: To determine the safety&#xD;
      and participant acceptability of TRF. Participants will be asked to consume all food during&#xD;
      an 8-hour window each day and not eat for the remaining 16 hours. All participants will&#xD;
      follow this eating pattern for 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination and&#xD;
      loss of axons in the central nervous system. Over the last decade there has been an influx of&#xD;
      evidence demonstrating the impact of lifestyle risk factors on the progression of MS&#xD;
      symptoms. Specifically, epidemiological studies report that poor diet is associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of disability in adults with MS. Despite this evidence, little research has&#xD;
      explored dietary interventions that may reduce symptom burden of MS. One dietary intervention&#xD;
      that has shown particular promise in animal models of MS is intermittent fasting (IF), which&#xD;
      is a dietary pattern characterized by cycles of eating and extended fasting. There are a&#xD;
      number of protocols for IF, including time restricted feeding (TRF), in which all food is&#xD;
      consumed during a limited window of time each day. Growing evidence demonstrates that IF&#xD;
      reduces inflammation, improves immune function, and improves cardiometabolic risk in animal&#xD;
      models of MS, however, little of this research has been translated into human trials. In&#xD;
      addition to these physiological benefits, the investigators believe that TRF will provide a&#xD;
      behavioral benefit, as it addresses barriers traditionally seen in dietary interventions by&#xD;
      shifting the focus from restricting what participants eat, to focusing on meal timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the preliminary efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      acceptability of TRF in adults with MS. The specific aims of this study are: 1: To determine&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of TRF for reducing symptom burden, improving inflammatory markers, and&#xD;
      reducing cardiometabolic risk among adults with RRMS. 2: To determine the safety and&#xD;
      participant acceptability of TRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve adults with relapsing-remitting MS will eat all meals within an 8 hour period each&#xD;
      day. All participants will follow the assigned meal plan for 8 weeks.&#xD;
