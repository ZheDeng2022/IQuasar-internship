  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a concept elicitation study to identify important aspects of acute pain assessment,&#xD;
      treatment, and response to treatment in infants and young children, age 0 to 3 years old,&#xD;
      from a clinician's perspective.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify important endpoints and outcomes for use in&#xD;
      pediatric trials of acute pain therapeutics in children who are 0 to &lt;3 years of age from a&#xD;
      clinician's perspective. To identify these endpoints and outcomes the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct remote qualitative concept elicitation interviews with 27 clinicians who treat&#xD;
      pediatric patients. These interviews will include verbal consent to participate, a&#xD;
      demographics questionnaire, and a semi-structured interview which will last approximately one&#xD;
      hour. Interview questions will address the participant's professional experience recognizing&#xD;
      and managing pain in children between 0 and 3 years of age. Interviews will be audio recorded&#xD;
      and transcribed with the participant's permission. Transcripts and notes will be coded and&#xD;
      analyzed. This is a minimal risk study; the investigators are only using standard interview&#xD;
      procedures and are not collecting any protected health information from participants. While&#xD;
      the investigators do not believe that any information collected would jeopardize the personal&#xD;
      or professional standing of participants, all information will be kept strictly confidential&#xD;
      per Good Clinical Practice guidelines.&#xD;
