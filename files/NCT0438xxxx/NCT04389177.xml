    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      plus paclitaxel, cisplatin followed by Da Vinci robot radical surgery for locally advanced&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Preoperative chemoradiotherapy with surgery is the standard treatment in NCCN guideline.&#xD;
      But many patients refused or abandon radiotherapy because of the intolerable adverse effects.&#xD;
      We designed a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel,&#xD;
      cisplatin followed by Da Vinci robot radical surgery for locally advanced (stage III)&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell cancer. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety.&#xD;

Da Vinci robot radical surgery: Before surgery, head/abdomen/chest CT scan, type B ultrasonic, upper gastrointestinal contrast, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and gastroscopy with biopsy will be done. Surgery should be done within 4-6 weeks after last neoadjuvant treatment finished.&#xD;
Adjuvant period: Adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks (6 cycles) should be performed within 3-6 weeks after surgery if the surgical pathology result is not pCR. abdomen/chest CT scan will be performed every 3 month after surgery.</description>

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs);&#xD;
&#xD;
