  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a combination of a single ascending dose (SAD) study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK of 3 oral doses of a MEK inhibitor and a multiple ascending dose (MAD)&#xD;
      study of 3 oral doses of a MEK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were to be enrolled in 3 different cohorts in the SAD and 3 different cohorts in the&#xD;
      MAD and were to be randomly (blinded) allocated to active treatment or placebo (each cohort&#xD;
      consisted of 8 subjects receiving active treatment and 2 subjects receiving placebo).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject in the SAD cohorts was to receive a single dose of the MEK inhibitor ATR-002&#xD;
      (PD0184264), with a starting dose of 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 100 mg + X mg ATR-002 or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 100 mg + X mg + Y mg ATR-002 or placebo. An additional cohort (Cohort 4) of 10&#xD;
           subjects (4:1 active vs placebo) could have been recruited into the SAD Part, if&#xD;
           appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectively, 4 cohorts were treated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 300 mg ATR-002 or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 600 mg ATR-002 or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 900 mg ATR-002 or placebo. Between each cohort, a blinded interim analysis of&#xD;
           PK, safety and tolerability had to be performed. The available data was evaluated by the&#xD;
           Investigator and sponsor in a Safety Review Committee (SRC) meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a dose level was judged to be safe, the SRC determined the dose level for the next&#xD;
      cohort considering a maximal increment of 400 mg compared to the previous cohort, and the&#xD;
      next dose level could be administered to the next cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal dose level could not exceed 900 mg ATR-002. Each subject in the MAD cohorts was&#xD;
      to receive once daily (QD) doses (fasted) of the MEK inhibitor ATR-002 for 7 days, starting&#xD;
      with a dose of 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: 100 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: 100 mg + A mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 7: 100 mg + A mg + B mg ATR-002 QD or placebo. An additional cohort (Cohort 8) of&#xD;
           10 subjects (4:1 active vs placebo) could be recruited into the MAD Part, if&#xD;
           appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectively, 3 cohorts were treated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: 100 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: 300 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 7: 600 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo. Between each cohort, a blinded interim analysis&#xD;
           of PK, safety and tolerability had to be performed. The available data was evaluated by&#xD;
           the Investigator and sponsor in a SRC meeting. Once a dose level was judged to be safe,&#xD;
           the SCR determined the dose level for the next cohort considering a maximal increment of&#xD;
           400 mg compared to the previous cohort, and the next dose level could be administered to&#xD;
           the next cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal dose level could not exceed 900 mg ATR-002. During the study, no repeated daily&#xD;
      dose could exceed the maximum single dose that has been shown to cause no safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were resident on the ward from the day (late afternoon/evening) before dosing (Day&#xD;
      -1) until completion of procedures at 96h following their final dose of study medication.&#xD;
      They were to attend a follow up visit 28 days (± 2 days) following their final dose of study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with AEs that were ongoing at the end of the study were followed up as appropriate&#xD;
      until the AEs had resolved or stabilised, up to a maximum of 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics were determined predose 30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h, postdose, and&#xD;
      predose on Day 2-4 in the SAD Part, and predose 30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h, of Day&#xD;
      1 and Day 7, predose on Day 2-6 and 48h, 72h, and 96h post final dose of Day 7 in the MAD&#xD;
      Part. The 72h and 96h samples in both SAD and MAD were only to be analysed if deemed&#xD;
      informative based on the results of the 48h PK sample.&#xD;

             was not of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: medically acceptable methods of contraception that could be used by the partner&#xD;

             performed, indicating that the subject understood the purpose of and procedures&#xD;
             required for the study and was willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG, or laboratory values at&#xD;
             the pre-study screening assessment that could interfere with the objectives of the&#xD;

          2. Presence of acute or chronic illness or history of chronic illness sufficient to&#xD;
