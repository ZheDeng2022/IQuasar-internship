  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proof of concept study to investigate the impact of a food supplement consisting of Acacia&#xD;
      gum on changes of gut microbiota and production of short chain fatty acids. Additionally,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and parameters of bowel function (stool frequency, stool consistency and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms) will be assessed during the study.&#xD;
