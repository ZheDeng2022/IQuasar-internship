      Purpose: Examine the impact of nutrition claims on parents' decisions to purchase fruit&#xD;
      drinks in a randomized controlled trial in an online virtual convenience store (task 1) and&#xD;
      examine the impact of added sugar warnings on parents' snack purchasing decisions in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial in an online virtual convenience store.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants will consist of approximately 2,500 individuals 18 and older with&#xD;
      at least one child ages 1-5. The child 1-5 who had their birthday most recently must have&#xD;
      consumed at least one fruit drink in the previous week. Additionally, they will live in the&#xD;
      United States and identify as non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, or Hispanic. The panel&#xD;
      research company Kantar will recruit individuals from its pool of potential individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): The investigators will randomize participants to one of 12 versions of&#xD;
      a virtual convenience store (iShoppe) and then the participants will complete two shopping&#xD;
      tasks in the store. They will select two beverages (task 1) for their child 1-5 who had their&#xD;
      birthday most recently, and they will select a snack (task 2) for that same child. After&#xD;
      completing the shopping tasks, the participant will complete a survey in Qualtrics. The&#xD;
      survey will ask a series of questions about the beverages and snacks (e.g., perceived&#xD;
      healthfulness, perceived appeal, intentions to consume products). Questions will also include&#xD;
      standard demographic and health related variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are major racial-ethnic disparities in the US childhood obesity epidemic. Among&#xD;
      children age 1-5 years, Black children are twice as likely to be obese and Latino children&#xD;
      are three times as likely to be obese compared to White children. Sugar-sweetened beverage&#xD;
      (SSB) and processed food consumption are major drivers of the childhood obesity epidemic, and&#xD;
      an important driver of racial-ethnic obesity disparities. Policies to reduce marketing and&#xD;
      require warning labels are important strategies for improving health outcomes among US&#xD;
      parents and children at risk for obesity. Understanding the impact of nutrition claims on&#xD;
      fruit drink purchases among Black and Latino parents is especially important given&#xD;
      pre-existing disparities in early childhood SSB consumption and obesity. However, little is&#xD;
      known about the relationship between nutrition claims and SSB purchases among racial-ethnic&#xD;
      minorities. Thus, it is important to understand the effect of nutrition claims on&#xD;
      racial-ethnic minority parents' purchases of fruit drinks. Another key research gap relates&#xD;
      to the impact of warning labels for processed food among this population. Thus, in this study&#xD;
      the investigators also aim to test warning labels on food/snack products as part of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The trial will take place in a virtual convenience store setting created for&#xD;
      researchers to examine how store and product characteristics influence consumer purchases in&#xD;
      a controlled but realistic environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited online through Kantar's currently available panel&#xD;
      participants. Interested potential participants will complete a screener online, and if they&#xD;
      are eligible, they will be redirected to the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: Participants will view an online consent form prior to participating in the&#xD;
      study, They will acknowledge their consent by proceeding onto the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After acknowledging consent, participants will be randomized to one of 12&#xD;
      versions of the store(see trial arms). Participants will have an equal chance to be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the arms of the store.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Participants will enter the virtual convenience store and be given a shopping&#xD;
      task to select 2 beverages (task 1) for their child age 1-5 who celebrated their birthday&#xD;
      most recently. The participant will have to select between 100% grape juice and a&#xD;
      grape-flavored fruit drink, and they will have to select between water and an apple-flavored&#xD;
      fruit drink. After selecting two beverages, the participant will then be directed to complete&#xD;
      a snack shopping task (task 2). After completing the two shopping tasks, the participant will&#xD;
      be redirected to an online survey to complete. Participation in the study will last&#xD;
      approximately 15-18 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial arms: All participants will complete two shopping tasks where they have to (1) choose&#xD;
      between a grape fruit drink and a 100% grape juice, and choose between an apple fruit drink&#xD;
      and water, and (2) choose between a snack with a nutrient warning label or a snack with no&#xD;
      warning label. There will be 4 versions of the fruit drinks that participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to. They will see either a fruit drink with no claim (control) or a fruit drink&#xD;
      with 1 of 3 claims (&quot;No artificial sweeteners,&quot; &quot;100% vitamin c daily value,&quot; &quot;100% all&#xD;
      natural&quot;). For the snack with the nutrient warning label, participants will see either a&#xD;
      control label (barcode) or a nutrient warning label (text or graphic).&#xD;
