  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the primary complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), including vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crises and more persistent, chronic pain. SCD-related pain is associated with significant&#xD;
      functional impairment, spanning poor school attendance, decreased quality of life, and stress&#xD;
      and mood difficulties. Pharmacological approaches are the first-line treatment for&#xD;
      SCD-related pain, but these can be costly and have unwanted side effects. Given limitations&#xD;
      from pharmacological approaches and the influence that poor behavioral responses have on&#xD;
      disease management and health outcomes suggest a critical need for alternative and adjunctive&#xD;
      treatments. Due to gaps in available behavioral treatments specifically designed for&#xD;
      addressing common challenges associated with pain management in pediatric SCD, the&#xD;
      investigators developed a manualized behavioral therapy protocol by tailoring existing&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments. The overall goal of the intervention is to reduce the impact of&#xD;
      pain on daily functioning in pediatric SCD. This study will empirically test the feasibility&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of this intervention for youth with SCD. Children and adolescents&#xD;
      with SCD between the ages of 8 and 17 years old (n=20) will be recruited to complete the&#xD;
      treatment protocol. Feasibility will be assessed by examining participation and program&#xD;
      completion rates, as well as feedback from a treatment acceptability questionnaire and&#xD;
      qualitative interview. Participants will complete baseline assessments, weekly&#xD;
      questionnaires, and post-treatment assessments (post-intervention assessment, follow-up time&#xD;
      points: 1-month following the intervention, and 3-months following the intervention).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and adolescents with SCD (HbSS, HbSC, HbS-beta0 thalassemia, or HbS-beta+&#xD;
             thalassemia) between the ages of 8 and 17 years old with pain-related disability and&#xD;
             who are currently prescribed short- or long-acting opioid medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participants will meet at least one of the following criteria for pain-related&#xD;
                  disability: 1) Have had at least 3 pain crises in the last year, 2) Have had at&#xD;
                  least one admission for pain in the last year, or 3) Have missed at least one&#xD;
                  week of school (5 days) in the last year&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current prescription of opioids will be confirmed by participants' primary&#xD;
                  hematologist, review of the electronic medical record, and discussion with the&#xD;
                  family.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the assessments and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of major depressive disorder in medical record and/or through&#xD;
             discussion with their primary hematology suggesting that patients may need a specific&#xD;
