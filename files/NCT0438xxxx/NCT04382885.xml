&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
             Disorders, Fifth Edition) criteria for ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal physical examination findings and clinical laboratory&#xD;
             test results for their age group or abnormal results judged not clinically significant&#xD;
             by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening (all&#xD;
             female participants that have reached menarche).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of tumor of the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously taken cariprazine or previously participated in an investigational study of&#xD;
             cariprazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or&#xD;
             participation in such a study within 3 months of Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a blood or plasma donation program within 60 or 30 days,&#xD;
             respectively, prior to Study Day 1.&#xD;
