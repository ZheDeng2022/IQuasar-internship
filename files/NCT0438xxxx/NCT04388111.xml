  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team wants to investigate if an intraosseous injection (directly into the bone&#xD;
      marrow) of morphine during primary total knee replacement helps with post-operative pain&#xD;
      following primary total knee replacement surgery. For this study patients will either be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups: Group 1: Receives an intraosseous injection of morphine&#xD;
      (mixed with standard antibiotics) during their primary total knee replacement or Group 2:&#xD;
      Serves as the control group and only receives an intraosseous injection of antibioitics&#xD;
      during their total knee replacement. The research team will have patients fill out a symptom&#xD;
      journal for two weeks following their surgery to measure pain levels and pain medication&#xD;
      consumed throughout the day as well as nausea and other symptoms. Additionally, the research&#xD;
      team will take blood samples both intraoperatively and post-operatively (10 hours post-op) to&#xD;
      measure the level of inflammatory markers as well as morphine.&#xD;

    <description>Patient will fill out Visual Analog Scale pain scores three times a day for 14 days (day 1 as day of surgery) post-op in a pain journal. Levels will be compared between study groups. A higher score indicates a higher self-perceived level of pain and a lower score indicates a lower perceived level of pain for the patient.</description>
