  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra System comprised of the Quantra&#xD;
      Hemostasis Analyzer with the QStat Cartridge in trauma patients and obstetric patients with&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses&#xD;
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic&#xD;
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The QStat Cartridge was developed to&#xD;
      monitor hemostasis in patients that may experience a range of coagulopathies of various&#xD;
      etiologies including fibrinolytic defects. This includes the trauma, obstetric hemorrhage and&#xD;
      liver transplant populations. The cartridge consists of four independent channels each&#xD;
      containing different sets of reagents, which provide four measurements performed in parallel&#xD;
      yielding five parameters that depict the functional status of a patient's coagulation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational pilot study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra&#xD;
      System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to comparable measures using conventional&#xD;
      viscoelastic testing methods.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is â‰¥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a trauma patient experiencing major trauma (preferably requiring the&#xD;
             highest level of team activation) with active bleeding or deemed at high risk of&#xD;
             significant bleeding according to mechanism of injury.and is a candidate for a ROTEM&#xD;
             test to be performed to access coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Subject is an obstetric patient experiencing post-partum hemorrhage based on one of the&#xD;
        following conditions: estimated blood loss during delivery &gt;1000 mL; placental abruption&#xD;
        with hemorrhage of any quantity; clinically suspected DIC; pregnancy resulted in fetal&#xD;
        demise with hemorrhage of any quantity; or is under consideration for administration of&#xD;
        tranexamic acid for treatment of hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is younger than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject presents for a procedure intended to abort a pregnancy for reasons other than&#xD;
             medical necessity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is known to have received antifibrinolytic therapy immediately prior to&#xD;
             presentation to trauma unit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently enrolled in a distinct study that might confound the results of&#xD;
             the proposed study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is affected by a condition that, in the opinion of the clinical team, may pose&#xD;
             additional risks.&#xD;
