  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Symtuza® in a rapid&#xD;
      reinitiation model of care in patients with HIV-1 infection and who are treatment-experienced&#xD;
      but have been off of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 12 or more weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, only 49 percent of persons living with HIV infection are currently&#xD;
      retained in care (Centers for Disease Control, 2018). Many individuals initially start&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) but fall out of care and discontinue treatment, only to reenter&#xD;
      care at a later date. Gaps in care contribute to the likelihood that a patient might not have&#xD;
      a recent viral load or CD4 count, as well as knowledge of previous ART regimens or resistance&#xD;
      data. Furthermore, high plasma HIV-1 RNA is a major risk factor for HIV transmission, and&#xD;
      effective ART can reduce viremia and transmission of HIV to sexual partners by more than 96%&#xD;
      (Cohen et al., 2011; Palella et al., 1998). Thus, a secondary goal of ART is to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of HIV transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional models of care have an initial period where a person is brought back into care&#xD;
      and assessed by a healthcare provider on various factors, including HIV RNA level, genotypic/&#xD;
      phenotypic resistance, immune status, renal/hepatic function, and general medical&#xD;
      comorbidities before reinitiating ART. These steps can add weeks without treatment and, in&#xD;
      turn, delay resupression of the virus and immune system improvement, as well as continuing to&#xD;
      contribute to the community viral load and offering more opportunities for the person to fall&#xD;
      out of care again. (Horburg et al., 2013) This traditional model places a burden on both the&#xD;
      patient and the healthcare system as multiple visits are required, each one a potential point&#xD;
      where the patient can be lost again to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rapid reinitiation of ART for persons who have fallen out of care is a potential&#xD;
      intervention that could improve retention rates, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Given these factors, the single-tablet regimen of D/C/F/TAF (Symtuza®) may serve as an ideal&#xD;
      regimen for a Rapid Reinitiation model of care, combining potency, sustained efficacy, a high&#xD;
      genetic barrier to resistance, with a well-described safety profile of the individual&#xD;
      components, and practical, convenient dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, multicenter study will follow subjects for 48 weeks with subjects either&#xD;
      returning to the site or having a virtual visit (TeleVisit) for Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, and&#xD;
      48. Baseline safety labs will dictate whether the ART regimen will need to be modified but&#xD;
      will not be required to be completed at the initiation of ART. Assessment of drug&#xD;
      accountability, reasons for non-adherence, recording of concomitant therapies, adverse&#xD;
      events, weight, physical examinations (complete or symptom-directed), laboratory evaluations&#xD;
      (for efficacy and safety), and health outcome assessments will be performed from baseline&#xD;
      onwards.&#xD;
