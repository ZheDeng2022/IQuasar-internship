  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Curcumin is a molecule soluble in fat. It has multiple health benefits. Indeed, it has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Curcumin could play a role in preventing&#xD;
      diseases such as cancer, inflammatory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids are also important for good health, as they have positive effects on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular and neurological systems. However, curcumin is poorly absorbed by the body&#xD;
      when provided in supplements. In order to improve curcumin's absorption, a natural health&#xD;
      product that combines curcumin and omega-3 fatty acids has been developped. The goal of this&#xD;
      project is therefore to determine the absorption of curcumin when administered in combination&#xD;
      with omega-3 fatty acids esterified in monoacylglycerol (MAG). This combination will be&#xD;
      compared with a curcumin extract alone or in rice oil. A pharmacokinetic study will be&#xD;
      carried out for each of the formulations. Pharmacokinetics (PK) is defined as monitoring the&#xD;
      blood concentrations of curcumin over a 24-hour period after taking one of the three&#xD;
      different supplements.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 men and 15 women in good health conditions will be recruited for this project. The study&#xD;
      has a randomized double-blinded crossover design with three treatments that include an equal&#xD;
      dosage of curcumin as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 mg of curcumin extract,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 mg of curcumin in rice oil,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 mg of curcumin extract + 1.5 g omega-3 in MAG form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the above listed products, a natural product number (NPN) was requested to Health&#xD;
      Canada and these number are currently pending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will consume each of the three treatments in a random order with a minimum&#xD;
      of 7 days washout phase between both treatments. Blood samples will be collected at time 0,&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 24h (10 blood samples per participant per treatment) after&#xD;
      taking the single dose intake. A questionnaire will allow documenting side effects throughout&#xD;
      the study period. The analyses will be performed by ultra-high-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography couples to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC/MS/MS). Samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed in a blinded manner such that the student and research assistant will be blinded&#xD;
      from the type of treatment and the time point they are analyzing. After performing all the&#xD;
      analyses, sample identification will be decoded and pharmacokinetic data of the curcuminoids&#xD;
      in each of the treatments will be plotted on a plasma concentration vs time curve. The&#xD;
      parameters below will be calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Area under the curve (AUC) 0-24h (bioavailability);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Area under the curve (AUC) 0-6h (absorption);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum concentration (Cmax);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Half-life (if available).&#xD;
