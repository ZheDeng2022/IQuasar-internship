  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single-center study of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma patients who failed at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy and one line&#xD;
      of immunotherapy of targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation including imaging, blood and urine samples, EVG&#xD;
      and physical examination to confirm suitability for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will undergo surgery to collect a tumor sample for TIL culturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an autologus TIL infusion once the cells have been properly cultured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the infusion, patients will receive a high dose of IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the intervention, patients will be monitored to evaluate study endpoints.&#xD;

             or targeted therapy (FGFR inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma with at least one lesion that is resectable&#xD;
             for TIL generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with one or more brain metastases less than 1 cm each, and any patients with&#xD;
             1 or 2 brain metastases greater than 1 cm must have been treated and stable for 4&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;

         11. Hematology:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm3 without support of filgrastim&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Normal WBC ( &gt; 3000/mm3).&#xD;

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV&#xD;
                  seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus can be less responsive&#xD;
                  to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Seronegative for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. (patients who recovered from&#xD;
                  previous infection and have no detected HBSAg or HCV RNA are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Chemistry:&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Negative pregnancy test in women of child bearing potential because of the potentially&#xD;
             dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time&#xD;
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients' toxicities must have&#xD;
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).&#xD;
             Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures with the past 3 weeks, as long&#xD;
             as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.&#xD;

             regimen on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Systemic steroid therapy required (patients that require replacement therapy for&#xD;
             adrenal insufficiency may be enrolled if steroid treatment dose do not exceed 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical&#xD;
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a&#xD;
             positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease&#xD;
             and AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Opportunistic infections (the experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol&#xD;
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may&#xD;
             be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its&#xD;
             toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;

             significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias including but not limited to: atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, second- or third-degree heart block&#xD;
