      To pilot test a group intervention for newly married women and their households to improve&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Aim: To test the feasibility of an empowerment and food insecurity intervention for newly&#xD;
      married women and others in their households to improve maternal and child health outcomes.&#xD;
      The investigators will pilot an intervention consisting of groups of newly married women,&#xD;
      their husbands and mothers-in-law. Each household will be enrolled for 4 months in weekly&#xD;
      sessions. Topics discussed will include behavioral messaging crafted specifically for newly&#xD;
      married households (including husbands and in-laws) to address the perceptions of different&#xD;
      family members about food consumption, gender inequality, and the relationship between&#xD;
      women's nutrition, food consumption, maternal health, and birth outcomes. Behavioral&#xD;
      messaging at the household level: Based on findings from preliminary studies, key barriers to&#xD;
      newly married women receiving needed nutrition/food and potential mechanisms to address those&#xD;
      barriers were identified, as well as informational messages that could be used to address&#xD;
      specific barriers. Particular attention was paid to how household dynamics and&#xD;
      decision-making relate to gender inequality and food insecurity. Thirty randomly selected&#xD;
      newly married households will be recruited to participate in testing the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention. Acceptability will be assessed from women, husbands, and&#xD;
      mothers-in-law through surveys at the end of 4 months with questions on relevance to their&#xD;
      needs, information gained, and interest in participating further. Enrollment and retention at&#xD;
      4 months will also be used to measure acceptability. Preliminary changes in knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and behaviors will be assessed through a comparison of pre and post survey data.&#xD;
      The investigators will also conduct semi structured interviews with 15 participants and 5&#xD;
      stakeholders. If necessary, the intervention will then be refined.&#xD;
