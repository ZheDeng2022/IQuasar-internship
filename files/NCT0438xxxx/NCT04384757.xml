    <textblock>
      There are more than 75% of patients with gastric cancer who are diagnosed in advanced stage&#xD;
      in Vietnam, most of cases in T4a. The purpose of this study is to compare the technical&#xD;
      feasibility, early and long term outcomes of open and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma in T4A stage&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer poses a significant public health problem. It is one of the most common&#xD;
      cancers in Vietnam . Despite recent advances in multimodality treatment and targeted therapy,&#xD;
      surgery remains the first option of treament for this disease. For resectable gastric cancer,&#xD;
      complete removal of macroscopic and microscopic lesions and/or combined resections and also&#xD;
      regional or extended lymphadenectomy should represent in the world now. Since laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrectomy for early gastric cancer (EGC) was firstly reported in 1994 , this technique has&#xD;
      become standard for treatment of EGC due to the many advantages of mininally invasive surgery&#xD;
      and also in oncologic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer AGC was first applied by Uyama in 2000,&#xD;
      and then, many surgeons have used it for treatment of AGC, especially in Japan, Korea and&#xD;
      China. However, the real role of laparoscop for treament of (AGC) is still controversial in&#xD;
      term of technical feasibility, safety and oncologic aspect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paragastric inflammatory strands may occur in T4a tumor so that laparoscopic technique is&#xD;
      difficult to radically perform. Peritoneal seeding of malignant cells, intra- and&#xD;
      postoperative complications, trocarts metastasis may risk during procedures. Despite, some&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated the safety and the short-term benefits of LG for T4a gastric&#xD;
      cancer, the number of these studies and sample sizes have been still inadequate to give good&#xD;
      evidence for applying it. and long-term oncologic outcomes&#xD;

    <description>An incision of 15~20 cm length is made in the abdominal midline . Standard distal gastrectomy and omentectomy will be performed with D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of splenic artery, proper hepatic artery) .

    <description>5 trocar were used. The gastrocolic ligament was divided along the border of the transverse colon. ligating the left gastroepiploic vessels to remove group 4sb.&#xD;
The right gastroepiploic vein was divided and the right gastroepiploic and the inferior pyloric artery were vascularized and cut at their origin from the gastroduodenal artery, just above the pancreatic head, to dissect group 6.&#xD;
The dissection was continued along the hepatoduodenal ligament to removed group 5 and group 12a and along the common hepatic artery to remove group 8a and along the celiac axis to remove group 9.&#xD;
The left gastric vein was prepared and separately divided and then the left gastric artery was vascularized to remove group 7.&#xD;
The dissection was continued upward along the proximal branches of splenic vessels to remove group 11p and along the lesser curvature to remove group 1,3.&#xD;
As a general rule, Billroth II method was used for gastric reconstruction for most cases</description>
