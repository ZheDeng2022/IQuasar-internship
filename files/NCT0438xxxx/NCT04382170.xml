  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will examine the safety, tolerability, optimal dose, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of dexmedetomidine sublingual film in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial&#xD;
      in 40 hospitalized patients with hyperactive delirium (i.e., delirium with agitation) in the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1 (safety and tolerability): To examine the incidence of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      other side effects following the administration of dexmedetomidine sublingual film in&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in the ICU with delirium and agitation in a randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      trial (total N=80 patients with delirium [with or without agitation], with a goal of&#xD;
      administering dexmedetomidine to at least 40 participants with agitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Dexmedetomidine sublingual film will be associated with hypotension and/or&#xD;
      bradycardia requiring clinical intervention in ≤ 20% (8 of 40) participants. Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      will not be associated with QTc prolongation or non-cardiac adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2 (preliminary efficacy): To examine the impact of dexmedetomidine sublingual&#xD;
      film on agitation and delirium severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Dexmedetomidine will lead to reductions in agitation and delirium severity during&#xD;
      the follow-up period (co-primary endpoints = 1 and 2 hours post-administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3 (optimal dosing): To identify the minimum dose that is effective at reducing&#xD;
      agitation and delirium severity without causing significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants receiving doses of 60 mcg of dexmedetomidine will have a faster time&#xD;
      to a reduction in agitation and greater reductions in delirium severity than participants&#xD;
      receiving 20 mcg of dexmedetomidine.&#xD;

      Study Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either 20 mcg or 60 mcg of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      sublingually. Participants will receive repeat dosing every 30 minutes for up to three&#xD;
      additional doses, leading to maximum doses of 80 mcg and 240 mcg, respectively. Both&#xD;
      investigators and clinicians will be blind to the participant's group, with only the study&#xD;
      pharmacist aware of the dose of medication on the films.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline monitoring: Following enrollment, the study team will record baseline measures of&#xD;
      heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be&#xD;
      performed, and agitation and delirium severity will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication administration: Dexmedetomidine sublingual film will be administered by the study&#xD;
      physician or study nurse as per the manufacturer's instructions. Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      administration will be repeated every 30 minutes if the participant continues to have&#xD;
      agitation and does not meet any cardiovascular stopping criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring for side effects: Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, use of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen, and use of pressors will be monitored continuously and recorded every 30&#xD;
      minutes for the 6 hours following the initial medication administration (baseline; Time 0).&#xD;
      An ECG will be performed at 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 hours, and QTc will be calculated using the&#xD;
      Fridericia formula. Study staff will also monitor the participant and speak with nursing&#xD;
      staff at 6 hours to assess for any other side effects/complaints the patient may have had&#xD;
      during the time since medication administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of agitation and delirium severity: Agitation will be measured every 30 minutes&#xD;
      and delirium severity at hours 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Tolerability (Aim #1) The investigators will examine changes in heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, oxygen saturation, and QTc interval from baseline to the follow-up timepoints, as&#xD;
      well as the incidence of self-reported and clinician-reported side effects during the 6-hour&#xD;
      post-medication interval. They also will record the total dosage of medication each&#xD;
      participant received and examine whether medication dose was associated with the incidence of&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Efficacy (Aim #2) The investigators will assess changes in agitation and delirium&#xD;
      from baseline to the follow-up timepoints. One and two hours following medication&#xD;
      administration will be considered the co-primary timepoints for these efficacy measures. They&#xD;
      also will record the total dosage of medication each participant received and examine whether&#xD;
      medication dose was associated with a reduction in agitation and delirium severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum Dose of Administration (Aim #3) The investigators will measure the amount of time&#xD;
      from the initial dexmedetomidine administration until agitation resolves. Then, they will&#xD;
      compare between-group differences in time to agitation resolution, changes in agitation and&#xD;
      delirium severity, and the incidence of side effects. The optimal dose will be chosen based&#xD;
      on the dose that leads to the quickest resolution of agitation without leading to clinically&#xD;
      significant side effects.&#xD;
