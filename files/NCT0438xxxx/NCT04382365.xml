    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine feasibility of an online program providing cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for insomnia in adults with cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves the use an Internet program (website) for 9 weeks. There are two required&#xD;
      study visits in the home or in a UVA clinic. Participants will complete online questionnaires&#xD;
      and sleep diaries twice during a 4-month period. Participants will also wear a sleep watch&#xD;
      for two weeks before and after using the website.&#xD;

      Mild cognitive impairment in older adults. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is recognized as&#xD;
      an early stage cognitive disorder, a condition where patients live independently and are able&#xD;
      to still perform many instrumental activities of daily living.1,2 Individuals with MCI&#xD;
      typically present with subtle cognitive changes that can worsen over time.3,4 MCI prevalence&#xD;
      is estimated to be as high as 19% among older adults in the US,3,5 with 10-13% progressing to&#xD;
      dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), every year.6-8 With no known cure for MCI,&#xD;
      current treatments focus on the maintenance of cognitive function, management of behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms, and slowing or delaying the symptoms of disease.9 Characteristics of sleep in MCI&#xD;
      and AD. Recent research concludes that individuals with cognitive impairment experience more&#xD;
      disruptive sleep and sleep disorders than those without cognitive concerns.10-12 Older adults&#xD;
      also more likely to have MCI, and other age-related sleep changes include a decrease in total&#xD;
      sleep duration, decreased sleep efficiency, increased sleep fragmentation, increased sleep&#xD;
      onset latency, and decreased slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In a review&#xD;
      examining the effect of poor sleep on cognitive outcomes, poor sleep was identified as a risk&#xD;
      factor for cognitive decline and AD.10 Recent research seeks to understand the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying this relationship using neuroimaging as well as sleep and cognitive functioning&#xD;
      data. Although exact mechanisms underlying this relationship are not yet known, and possibly&#xD;
      interactive, healthy sleep promotes maintenance of brain health, and may delay symptoms of AD&#xD;
      and other dementias.10 Insomnia in older adults. Insomnia affects up to 25% of older adults.&#xD;
      It is characterized by difficulty falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep as well as impaired&#xD;
      functioning during waking hours.13 Individuals with insomnia have decreased work&#xD;
      productivity, more accidents, more hospitalizations, and overall greater healthcare costs&#xD;
      compared to their healthy counterparts.14,15 Insomnia symptoms can also affect significant&#xD;
      others and caregivers. Specifically, nighttime activities can disrupt partners' sleep, which&#xD;
      may impact the ability for him or her to function normally and provide care, as insomnia has&#xD;
      been associated with decrease in measures of attention.16,17 Although everyone is at risk for&#xD;
      developing insomnia, there are certain factors that increase one's risk. For example,&#xD;
      predisposing factors include older age, female gender, and a positive family history of sleep&#xD;
      disorders.18 The most common precipitating factors are psychological stress and major life&#xD;
      changes. Factors known to perpetuate insomnia are typically behavioral and cognitive&#xD;
      reactions, which are learned responses to sleep problems (e.g., daytime napping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of insomnia. Treatment is recommended in two forms: pharmacological and&#xD;
      behavioral-based interventions. Most commonly, sleep disturbances are treated with&#xD;
      medication.19 Although pharmacological interventions can be effective in the short-term, they&#xD;
      do not treat underlying predisposing, precipitating, and/or perpetuating factors of insomnia.&#xD;
      Older adults experience pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes associated with aging;20&#xD;
      are more susceptible to consequences of potentially inappropriate medications;21 and are most&#xD;
      likely to experience negative side-effects of polypharmacy.22 Age-related issues are&#xD;
      especially concerning when using traditional benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine receptor&#xD;
      agonist sleep aids such as zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon. Use of traditional sleep aids&#xD;
      in older adults has been associated with serious adverse events (e.g., cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      falls).23,24 Despite evidence regarding adverse consequences, pharmacological treatment of&#xD;
      insomnia remains the most common treatment for insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological treatment of insomnia. Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for insomnia&#xD;
      (CBT-I) is a non-pharmacological intervention that is effective in treating insomnia in older&#xD;
      adults, even when present with comorbid medical and psychological conditions.25 CBT-I focuses&#xD;
      on the maladaptive behaviors and dysfunctional thoughts that perpetuate sleep problems, and&#xD;
      typically consists of five primary treatment components: sleep restriction, stimulus control,&#xD;
      cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and relapse prevention.26,27 Although there are&#xD;
      effective treatments for insomnia, less than 15% of all adults with chronic insomnia are&#xD;
      estimated to get any treatment for insomnia.28 Even for those seeking CBT-I, access is&#xD;
      extremely limited due to the small number of clinicians trained in behavioral insomnia&#xD;
      treatment.29 Internet CBT-I. The Internet has the potential to overcome barriers related to&#xD;
      obtaining face-to-face CBT-I. Older adults have historically had limited Internet access, but&#xD;
      this is changing dramatically. In 2000, only 14% of adults over the age of 64 used the&#xD;
      Internet.30 In 2017, 66% of adults over 65 years of age and 87% age 50-64, reported Internet&#xD;
      access.30 Almost 50% of older adults describe the Internet as ''quite a bit'' to&#xD;
      ''extremely'' helpful to find new knowledge about their disease, treatment options, and drug&#xD;
      therapy.59 Older adults are also more likely to use technology when presented with the&#xD;
      potential benefits.57 Internet-delivered interventions for older adults have also been shown&#xD;
      to be feasible and effective. For example, Internet-delivered interventions for dementia&#xD;
      caregivers improved caregiver confidence, depression, and self-efficacy.31 The CBT-I internet&#xD;
      intervention, Sleep Healthy Using Internet (SHUTi) for Older Adult Sufferers of Insomnia and&#xD;
      Sleeplessness (OASIS), was developed for adults over age 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep diaries and actigraphy. Sleep diaries are often used both as a behavioral tool during&#xD;
      CBT-I as well as a way to determine the effect of CBT-I on sleep. For the latter, sleep&#xD;
      diaries are kept by the patient both prior to and following the intervention and the patient&#xD;
      reports on various sleep factors each night. From this self-reported data, sleep variables&#xD;
      can be calculated, such as sleep onset latency (SOL), wakefulness after initial sleep onset&#xD;
      (WASO), total sleep time (TST), total time spent in bed (TIB), sleep efficiency (SE), and&#xD;
      sleep quality.32 This data can also be collected passively through the use of actigraphy.&#xD;
      Actigraphy is an objective, non-invasive, and minimally burdensome approach to continuously&#xD;
      measure gross motor activity and provide wake/sleep timing. Although actigraphy is considered&#xD;
      less reliable in patients with insomnia compared to polysomnography (PSG),33 actigraphy&#xD;
      provides the opportunity to collect multiple nights at little to no extra burden to&#xD;
      participants. There is also a strong correlation between sleep diaries and actigraphy. Most&#xD;
      notably, Chambers34 found a substantial within-participant correlation (r = .80) between&#xD;
      actigraph and sleep diaries, and, we plan to use actigraphy for similar within-participant&#xD;
      analyses examining sleep variability and patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research focuses on individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment and insomnia,&#xD;
      positing that improved sleep will moderate further cognitive decline. Before undertaking&#xD;
      large-scale interventions to determine efficacy of SHUTi OASIS in this population and&#xD;
      long-term cognitive outcomes of improved sleep, there must be preliminary work to determine&#xD;
      feasibility of delivering the intervention to older adults with MCI and insomnia. To better&#xD;
      understand sleep patterns of individuals with MCI and insomnia, actigraphy data will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed to identify within-participant sleep patterns.&#xD;
