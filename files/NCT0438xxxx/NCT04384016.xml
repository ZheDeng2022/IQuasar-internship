      This is a cross-over, open-label, single-group study. The study subjects were children 12&#xD;
      months to 12 years of age who will be vaccinated with a single dose. The duration of&#xD;
      follow-up for safety evaluation and immunogenicity (on a small group) is 6 weeks (+ 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main target:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Evaluating the safety of live attenuated Varicella vaccine [Oka / SK], lyophilized powder&#xD;
      and solvent for subcutaneous injection (SKYVaricella inj.) in healthy Vietnamese children&#xD;
      from 12 months to 12 years, with a single injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary target:&#xD;
&#xD;

           vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of expected systemic and local adverse events within 7 days after&#xD;
           vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of serious adverse events and Unexpected adverse events within 6 weeks&#xD;
           after vaccination The Immunogenicity of Skyvaricella Injection: seroconversion rate by&#xD;
