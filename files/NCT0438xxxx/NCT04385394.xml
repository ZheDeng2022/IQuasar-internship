      The purpose of this study is to explore if Bright Light Therapy (BLT) as augmentation of&#xD;
      depression treatment on an acute psychiatric floor is feasible, helps alleviate depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, improve functioning, and decrease length of stay on the psychiatric floor.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bright light therapy is an evidence-based treatment for seasonal depression (SAD), recently&#xD;
      there is evidence that it has some efficacy in nonseasonal major depressive disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      when used together with antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLT works via the patient's eyes through&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Melanopsin (Intrinsic Photo receptor ganglion Cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN, master clock) which follows a rhythmic change&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serotonin&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies showed seasonal changes in serotonergic parameters, including brain&#xD;
      serotonin concentration and turnover. There were no research on using the BLT on the acute&#xD;
      inpatient floor to augment the antidepressant treatment. Yet, there is a great need for such&#xD;
      augmentation as for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) to take full effect 4-6&#xD;
      weeks needed. Moreover, patients with depression often do not spend enough time on the direct&#xD;
      sun light, which exacerbate and prolong their depressed mood. The augmentation with the BLT&#xD;
      on the acute psychiatric floor will help the antidepressant work, expedite the recovery, and&#xD;
      potentially shortens the length of stay in the hospital, which in turn will lead to an&#xD;
      economic saving and faster return of the patient into the community and to the workforce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, case series study. All patients that meet exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      have equal chance to receive BLT. We will administer the questionnaires before the BLT and at&#xD;
      the end of treatment. Patient will continue to receive the pharmacological and therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment on psychiatric floor as usual during the BLT. We will evaluate the changes in the&#xD;
      questionnaires before and after BLT treatment, the length of stay on the unit. We will&#xD;
      analyze the contributing factors such as age, gender, duration of depressive symptoms, other&#xD;
      psychiatric and medical comorbidities, social factors (homelessness, social support, etc),&#xD;
      current psychiatric medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be invited to participate and consent will be obtain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The type of light we use is the &quot;Sun Box Sun Square +&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emits about 10,000 lux of light and is wide enough to be used for more than 2 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  186 watts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full spectrum 5000k white light (without the UV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It has an inbuilt spectrally transparent prismatic diffuser that blocks UV, that does&#xD;
           not filter the quality of light and will not yellow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal heat and no bulb flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Where: Bedroom / Common sitting area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reading/ Having breakfast/ Watching tv/Drawing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Just after awakening within an hour early morning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 mins/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have eyes open, but not looking into the light&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff will monitor while the patients are under the BLT&#xD;
