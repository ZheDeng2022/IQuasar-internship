  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer and colorectal cancer are common gastrointestinal malignancies in the&#xD;
      world.Early cancer generally has no obvious symptoms. Endoscopy is the &quot;gold standard&quot;for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer.gastric cancer and colorectal cancer&#xD;
      treatment mainly includes surgery and medication.Compared with traditional diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment methods, the application of gene detection technology, especially high-throughput&#xD;
      sequencing technology (NGS) in tumor diagnosis and treatment, performs multi-dimensional and&#xD;
      multi-target detection of cancer-related genes, which can quickly and accurately determine&#xD;
      the target gene mutations Morphology and expression differences, so as to provide&#xD;
      personalized guidance to patients in terms of medication, treatment or prognosis evaluation,&#xD;
      which can save a lot of time and treatment costs, and improve the overall treatment effect&#xD;
      and patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystoscopy and biopsy sampling pathological testing are the gold standard for bladder cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, and have been widely used in clinical diagnosis and prognosis judgment. However,&#xD;
      cystoscopy is cumbersome, expensive, and often causes pain to the patients under test. At&#xD;
      present, the main clinical non-invasive detection technique for bladder cancer is still the&#xD;
      cytological examination of urinary tract bladder cells in urine, and its sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity are not good, especially for the diagnosis of early lower grade bladder&#xD;
      cancer.For bladder cancer, tumor tissue (puncture biopsy or surgical resection) DNA, urine&#xD;
      ctDNA, urinary tract exfoliated cell DNA and peripheral blood ctDNA can be used for genetic&#xD;
      testing, but the consistency of the genetic testing results of these four types of samples&#xD;
      has not been verified, especially There is no systematic evaluation of the guidance effect of&#xD;
      non-invasive gene detection of free tumor DNA and urinary tract shed cell DNA in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer.The corresponding relationship between the&#xD;
      significant mutation genes contained in the DNA derived from bladder urinary tract cancer and&#xD;
      the various types and stages of bladder cancer is not clear.&#xD;
