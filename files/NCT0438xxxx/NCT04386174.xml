  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about how patterns of brain activity&#xD;
      change during different thinking tasks and how these changes relate to the intensity and&#xD;
      unpleasantness of the neuropathic pain that people with SCI experience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a kind of pain that is caused by a disruption of the nervous system.&#xD;
      Neuropathic pain is common among people with spinal cord injury (SCI), is often severe, and&#xD;
      can interfere significantly with daily life. Current treatments do not eliminate neuropathic&#xD;
      pain for most individuals. Therefore, it is important to identify other strategies that&#xD;
      enable people with SCI to exert more control over their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to examine patterns of brain activity in people with&#xD;
      SCI while they perform different thinking tasks. This study will help researchers understand&#xD;
      how patterns of brain activity change during these tasks and how these tasks affect pain&#xD;
      severity and unpleasantness. The information we learn in this study will help us create new&#xD;
      treatment options to help people with SCI to manage their chronic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over 2 days, separated by 1-3 weeks or so, depending on scheduling&#xD;
      of study activities. The study should take approximately 1 hour on the first day (for a&#xD;
      telephone interview), and up to 7.5 hours on the second day (for a visit to Kessler for&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be asked to respond to a series of questions relating to&#xD;
      their physical health, mental health, and pain history. The researchers may also review their&#xD;
      medical records if needed to determine if it is safe for them to have an MRI. Those who&#xD;
      qualify will visit Kessler and will be introduced to different thinking strategies that can&#xD;
      be used to try to change the activity in the brain in areas that relate to the experience of&#xD;
      pain. Participants will undergo 3 separate fMRI sessions. During the first session, the&#xD;
      researchers will locate a pain-related region of the brain from which to gather information&#xD;
      about brain activity. In the second and third sessions, the researchers will use fMRI to&#xD;
      measure the activity in a pain-related region of the brain while the participant tries out&#xD;
      different thinking strategies. While participants practice use of these strategies, they will&#xD;
      be shown information about brain activity and will be asked to use this information as they&#xD;
      try to become better at using the strategies. The researchers will also ask participants&#xD;
      whether the experience of their pain (severity and unpleasantness) changed while they&#xD;
      practiced these strategies.&#xD;
