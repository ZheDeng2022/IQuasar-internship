    <textblock>
      40 allergic rhinitis patients in the acute phase will be enrolled in the study. All the&#xD;
      allergic patients should be confirmed those who are over 20 years old and hypersensitive to&#xD;
      house dust mite allergens confirmed by MAST test before study. All patients were treated with&#xD;
      mixed formula of Chinese medicine for one months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Perennial allergic rhinitis is an important disease in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) due&#xD;
      to its high prevalence rate in Taiwan. In our previous studies, a new mixed formula of&#xD;
      Chinese herbs was evaluated for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In these studies, we&#xD;
      found that immunoduoatory effects of Chinese medicine include: CD4+ T lymphocytes; Regulatory&#xD;
      T cells; Dendritic cells, and Regulatory B cells. These results allow us to confirm the&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects of mixed formula of traditional Chinese medicine. In recent years,&#xD;
      more and more attention has been paid to the effects of gut microbiota on immune-modulation.&#xD;
      Many immunomodulaotry effects of allergic diseases were considered to be closely related to&#xD;
      gut bacteria. However, the research on allergic rhinitis is still rare, especially related to&#xD;
      TCM treatment. From our previous studies, it has been confirmed that TCM have an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effect on allergic rhinitis. Whether or not they are associated with gut&#xD;
      microbiota changes is still unknown. This year, we compared the difference of composition and&#xD;
      diversity of gut microbiota of allergic rhinitis patients and normal individual. Indeed, we&#xD;
      found it were different between allergic patients and normal individuals. The results of this&#xD;
      study will provide us the information to understand whether the immunemodulation of TCM&#xD;
      treatment on allergic rhinitis is correlated with the changes of gut microbiota.&#xD;
