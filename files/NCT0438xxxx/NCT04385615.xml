  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity today has become one of the main public health concerns. As a consequence, different&#xD;
      strategies have arisen to fight weight gain. One of the alternative strategies to increase&#xD;
      the success of therapeutic approaches to weight loss is the increase in energy expenditure,&#xD;
      through thermogenesis, regulated by the beige/brown adipose tissue (BAT). Studies have shown&#xD;
      that beige/BAT has a strong correlation with body weight regulation. It has also been&#xD;
      demonstrated that cold exposure activates beige/BAT. Recent studies, mainly in animal models,&#xD;
      suggest that beige/BAT can also be activated by specific food and nutrients. Concomitantly,&#xD;
      new dietary interventions, to treat obesity, have also been studied. One of these dietary&#xD;
      interventions is the Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD). Since FMD is high in unsaturated fat, and&#xD;
      clinical trials have shown that FMD interventions reduced body weight and improved metabolic&#xD;
      health, there is a possible association between this diet and the activation of beige/BAT.&#xD;
      The aim of this is study is to investigate the effect of Fasting Mimicking Diet on the&#xD;
      activation of beige/brown adipose tissue, in humans with overweight. This will be an open&#xD;
      clinical trial with the duration of three consecutive months (three cycles of the FMD diet).&#xD;
      There will be an FMD and a control group. The following data will be collected before and&#xD;
      after the intervention, for each group: dietary intake and physical activity data, evaluation&#xD;
      of beige/brown adipose tissue activation (Positron Emission Tomography - PET with&#xD;
      fluoride-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in combination with computed tomography -&#xD;
      PET/CT scan, Thermal Imaging, BAT adipokines and genes related to BAT activity), basal&#xD;
      metabolic rates and caloric needs (Indirect Calorimetry), anthropometric measures and body&#xD;
      composition (DEXA scan), lipid profile and inflammatory markers. Data will be expressed as&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation and the variables will be compared by Student's t-test or ANOVA,&#xD;
      for repeated measures.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beige/BAT has been shown as a promising strategy to treat obesity. The exact mechanism, and&#xD;
      stimulus, of activation of this tissue have not been completely clarified. However, some&#xD;
      studies have identified some nutrients, such as unsaturated fat, as a potential stimulus for&#xD;
      activation. The effect of Fasting Mimicking Diet on the activation of Beige/Brown Adipose&#xD;
      Tissue has not yet been investigated. Since FMD is high in unsaturated fat, and clinical&#xD;
      trials have shown that FMD interventions reduced body weight and improved metabolic health,&#xD;
      there is a possible association between this diet and the activation of beige/BAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that an intervention, with a 5-days cycle for 3 consecutive months, of&#xD;
      Fasting Mimicking Diet will promote beige/brown adipose tissue activation and will improve&#xD;
      body weight and metabolic markers related to obesity, in humans with overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of a dietary intervention using 3 cycles of Fasting Mimicking Diet on&#xD;
      the activation of beige/brown adipose tissue, in humans with overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the FMD on the activation of Beige/Brown Adipose Tissue using&#xD;
           PET/CT (FDG-18) and Thermal Imaging (FLIR camera);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate anthropometric measures (weight, abdomen circumference) and body composition&#xD;
           (DEXA scan), before, during and after the FMD intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate basal metabolic rates and daily caloric needs (Indirect Calorimetry), before&#xD;
           and after the FMD intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the FMD on metabolic markers and hormones: leptin (ELISA),&#xD;
           insulin (ELISA), glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the FMD on insulin sensitivity (using OGIS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the FMD on cytokines: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),&#xD;
           interleukin 1-beta (IL1β), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP1), interleukin-6&#xD;
           (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) (ELISA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the FMD on Brown Adipose Tissue Adipokines: insulin-like&#xD;
           growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and&#xD;
           12,13-dihydroxy-9z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME) (ELISA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the FMD on BAT activation genes: peroxisome&#xD;
           proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and G-protein coupled&#xD;
           receptor 120 (GPR120) (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated sample size is 26 individuals. Participants will be overweight. There will be a&#xD;
      control group (n=13) and an FMD group (n=13). There will be similar sample size for both&#xD;
      genders. Participants will be recruited through electronic and printed media propagation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open clinical trial with the duration of three consecutive months (three&#xD;
      cycles). There will be data collection before, during and after the dietary intervention. In&#xD;
      this intervention, participants will be requested either to follow three cycles of a Fasting&#xD;
      Mimicking Diet, or to follow their habitual eating habits for three months (control group).&#xD;
      For the FMD group, participants will receive the FMD diet and will be requested to follow the&#xD;
      recommendations from the manufacturer: FMD diet for 5 consecutive days (during these days,&#xD;
      they will be asked to only eat the FMD diet), and for the remaining 25 days of the month,&#xD;
      participants should continue with their habitual eating habits. This procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FMD diet will be provided by L-Nutra, Nutrition for Longevity (commercial name of the&#xD;
      diet: ProLon). All the data will be collected at University of Campinas, Brazil. More&#xD;
      specifically, the Indirect Calorimetry and the DEXA scan will be done at the LIMED&#xD;
      (Laboratory of Investigation of Metabolism and Diabetes) and the PET/CT (FDG-18) will be done&#xD;
      at the Center of Nuclear Medicine in the Hospital de Clínicas (HC) Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected from both groups (control and FMD):&#xD;
&#xD;

           intervention;&#xD;
