      Pre-pivotal, randomized study to assess the safety and efficacy of the IUB SEAD™ device in&#xD;
      women suffering from abnormal uterine bleeding.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), involving menstrual bleeding of abnormal quantity,&#xD;
      duration, or schedule, is experienced by 10-35% of women, and can markedly impact everyday&#xD;
      activities, can lead to iron deficiency and in severe cases, can necessitate emergency&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While pharmacologic treatment options exist, some women desire a treatment that requires less&#xD;
      maintenance or is definitive. Endometrial ablation is a minimally invasive approach applied&#xD;
      to manage AUB and can be performed using resectoscopic instruments or with a&#xD;
      non-resectoscopic approach, in which the device is inserted into the uterine cavity and&#xD;
      delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining. Non-resectoscopic endometrial&#xD;
      ablation has become an accepted office-based procedure, but requires training in&#xD;
      administration and response to complications of conscious sedation and of assisting&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IUB SEAD™ device is a novel Spherical Endometrial Ablation Device, developed to allow for&#xD;
      a simple, office-based chemical endometrial ablation to treat AUB. The suggested procedure is&#xD;
      expected to be simpler than the currently available ablation methods and to result in a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful delay or abolishment of the need for hysterectomy&#xD;
