  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of utilizing blood flow restriction (BFR)&#xD;
      therapy in patients treated both non operatively and operatively for rotator cuff tears&#xD;
      (RCT). BFR has been proposed to work by restricting arterial inflow leading to an oxygen&#xD;
      depleted environment and the ability to induce muscle adaption at lower maximum repetition&#xD;
      via reactive hyperemia. Muscle atrophy occurs following rotator cuff tear. Thus, physical&#xD;
      therapy is used to regain strength with the ultimate goal of returning to activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this investigation is to determine if using BFR during therapy for&#xD;
      non-operatively managed and operatively managed rotator cuff tears would lead to increased&#xD;
      and expedited strength gains. Additionally the investigators would like to determine if BFR&#xD;
      is beneficial in preventing muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration often seen in the setting&#xD;
      of rotator cuff tear, as it is known that cuff tears can subject the muscles to degenerative&#xD;
      changes and these patients are at risk for poorer clinical outcomes. The investigators will&#xD;
      also look at patient reported outcomes metrics and pain scores to determine if BFR has a&#xD;
      significant impact on the patient experience surrounding rotator cuff tear after both&#xD;
      nonoperative treatment with therapy and operative treatment with surgical repair and&#xD;
      peri-operative rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the BFR group will have significantly greater strength&#xD;
      gains at all time points. Previous studies have shown that BFR has potential in increasing&#xD;
      muscle torque generation and cross sectional area in the first six months following anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. While there have not been as many studies&#xD;
      investigating the use of BFR following upper extremity surgery, previous research has&#xD;
      demonstrate that BFR can be useful both proximal and distal to the targeted muscle groups in&#xD;
      the upper extremity. In addition to the paucity of research on post-operative BFR following&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair (RCR), there is no evidence on pre-operative use as well. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that the use of BFR in the perioperative period surrounding rotator&#xD;
      cuff tear and repair has the potential to significantly decrease muscle atrophy and lead to&#xD;
      faster, more substantial strength gains and less muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are seen in clinic for rotator cuff pathology will undergo treatment for their&#xD;
      rotator cuff based on a shared-decision making process with the orthopedic surgeon,&#xD;
      irrespective of this study. Once a treatment plan is in place, the patient will be introduced&#xD;
      to this study and presented with the opportunity to participate. If the patient agrees, a&#xD;
      formal consent process will take place in clinic and the patient will undergo initial,&#xD;
      baseline testing of strength, range of motion, pain scores, and patient reported outcome&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore patients will be either in the nonoperative arm or the operative arm of this study.&#xD;
      Within each arm, patients will be randomized via computer to be placed in either the blood&#xD;
      flow restriction (BFR) cohort or the traditional (non-BFR cohort). Patients will&#xD;
      prospectively undergo rotator cuff rehabilitation using BFR or conventional therapy by&#xD;
      physical therapists with extensive experience in rotator cuff rehabilitation who will undergo&#xD;
      training on use of BFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nonoperative group will be given identical rehabilitation protocols, with the only&#xD;
      difference being the use of a BFR cuff during rehabilitation for the BFR cohort. Similarly,&#xD;
      the operative group will be given identical rehabilitation protocols, with the only&#xD;
      difference being the use of a BFR cuff during rehabilitation for the BFR cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing operative rotator cuff repair (RCR) will undergo preoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation prior to surgery for two weeks. Due to limitations of health insurance&#xD;
      coverage of physical therapy sessions, the two weeks of preoperative &quot;prehab&quot; will consist of&#xD;
      a structured home exercise program that is taught to the patient by a physical therapist&#xD;
      during one session and recorded on a physical therapy (PT) diary by the patient during the&#xD;
      two weeks leading up to surgery. Patients will be provided video instruction and training on&#xD;
      how to conduct the exercises and this will also be done with and without the use of BFR&#xD;
      depending on group allocation (via randomization). Additionally, warning signs for BFR cuff&#xD;
      intolerance such as increased pain, swelling, numbness/tingling of the arm will be&#xD;
      communicated to the patient. Following surgery patients will immediately be started in a&#xD;
      formal physical therapy regimen as an outpatient. Therapy will consist of a structured&#xD;
      program progressing from range of motion, to strength training and then functional tests.&#xD;
      Patients will remain in their allocated BFR or non-BFR group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol as follows, both groups will use the same protocol with the only difference being&#xD;
      use of BFR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For surgical patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Preop: Patients will undergo a home program consisting of isometric exercises including&#xD;
      shoulder extension, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation pushing against a&#xD;
      wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both surgical and non-surgical patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-op weeks 0-8: Passive shoulder range of motion (ROM) only&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sling immobilization with active elbow, wrist and hand ROM&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Passive ROM only of shoulder including pendulums, supine elevation in scapular&#xD;
                plane, external rotation with arm at side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8-12 weeks being more active range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discontinue sling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Being active exercises including prone row, standing internal/external rotation&#xD;
                with bands, wall slides into shoulder flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 12-20: Strength and function o Sidelying shoulder external rotation, increase&#xD;
           resistance band exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout this protocol patients will have a pre-operative visit, an early 2 week post&#xD;
      operative visit to check range of motion and wound healing, a six week visit to monitor range&#xD;
      of motion and potentially clear for active ROM and sling discontinuation, and a three month&#xD;
      visit prior to clearance to being return to more aggressive activity. Strength and range of&#xD;
      motion will be recorded at each of these visits in order to assess the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Strength to be measured via dynamometer at each clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Range of motion via goniometer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain via visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scale at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient reported outcomes scores at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy measured via ultrasound and compared to&#xD;
                pre-operative imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan to recruit patients starting in June 2020. Will enroll patients and collect data from&#xD;
      June-2020 to May 2021. Manuscript writing and submission to occur in June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analysis: The primary endpoint of this study was a maximum repetition total work&#xD;
           deficit of 15% between the BFR and control group as measured by dynamometer. This was&#xD;
           based on previous data showing that a strength deficit of 15% represents a clinically&#xD;
           significant difference that is not likely attributable to limb dominance. Work deficit&#xD;
           was calculated in each group by comparing the operative leg with the nonoperative leg to&#xD;
           obtain a deficit percent. A power analysis was performed before the study to assess the&#xD;
           number of patients needed to detect a 15% total work deficit between the BFR and control&#xD;
           groups. With a power of 80% (beta level Â¼ 0.80, alpha level Â¼ 0.05), a sample size of 34&#xD;
           (17 patients per group) was obtained. Data will be provided to and analyzed by trained&#xD;
           statisticians to determine differences in primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All continuous data will be analyzed using independent 2-group t tests and reported as&#xD;
           means Â± standard deviations. Categorical data will be compared between the 2 groups&#xD;
           using chi-square tests and reported as counts and percentages. A preliminary test to&#xD;
           confirm the quality of variances will be conducted prior to utilizing the t test to&#xD;
           confirm the appropriate statistical analysis. Nonparametric equivalents Wilcoxon&#xD;
           rank-sum and Fisher exact tests will be used as needed for nonnormal distributions and&#xD;
           low variable numbers, respectively. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to&#xD;
           assess for potential confounding demographic variables.&#xD;
