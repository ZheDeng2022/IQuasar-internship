  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this online RCT study is to examine how sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) health&#xD;
      warnings influence US adults' perceptions and reactions. The investigators have the following&#xD;
      predictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SSB warnings will be perceived as more effective than the control (message topic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Icon and graphic warnings will be perceived as more effective than text-only warnings&#xD;
           (message type)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine the interaction of warning topic and warning type, but&#xD;
      have no specific hypothesis about this interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will test the following predictions about the secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSB warnings (vs. control), as well as icon and graphic warnings (vs text.warnings), will&#xD;
      lead to lower perceived product healthfulness, lower purchase intentions, and higher&#xD;
      cognitive elaboration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a major public health problem in the US among racial and ethnic&#xD;
      minorities, including among the US's growing Latino population. One promising but&#xD;
      understudied policy for addressing childhood obesity is requiring warnings on the front of&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverage containers. However, the topic and design of warnings that are most&#xD;
      effective in communicating the harms of sugar-sweetened beverages remains unknown. This study&#xD;
      assess which warning topics and which warning designs lead to the greatest perceived message&#xD;
      effectiveness among US Latino and non-Latino parents of children ages 2-12. The investigators&#xD;
      focus on parents as they are the primary decision-makers and purchasers of food products for&#xD;
      children and exert strong influence over their children's dietary intake and food attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The trial will take place online on a survey developed using Qualtrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited online by CloudResearch PrimePanels, a survey&#xD;
      research platform with access to over 20 million participants. As such, participants will&#xD;
      have to be PrimePanels members in order to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: After determining eligibility, eligible participants will be directed to a&#xD;
      page on Qualtrics with the consent form. Participants acknowledge their consent in the study&#xD;
      by clicking the &quot;next page&quot; arrow and proceeding to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After consenting, the participant is randomly assigned to to view one of the 5&#xD;
      warning topics. &quot;WARNING: High in added sugar&quot; (added sugar), &quot;WARNING: Excess consumption of&#xD;
      drinks with added sugar contributes to weight gain&quot; (weight gain), &quot;WARNING: Excess&#xD;
      consumption of drinks with added sugar contributes to type 2 diabetes&quot; (Type 2 diabetes),&#xD;
      &quot;WARNING: Excess consumption of drinks with added sugar contributes to heart damage&quot; (heart&#xD;
      damage), and &quot;Please refrain from littering&quot; (control). Within each of the four experimental&#xD;
      arms, participants see the message displayed on four different types of warning designs: a&#xD;
      text warning on a square background, a text warning on a octagon background, and icon&#xD;
      warning, and a graphic warning. Within the control arm, participants see the message&#xD;
      displayed on three different types of warning designs: a text warning on a square background,&#xD;
      an icon warning, and a graphic warning. Participants randomly see the different warning&#xD;
      designs in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey: The participants complete a survey answering behavioral perceptions and intentions&#xD;
      questions about the different warning labels.&#xD;
