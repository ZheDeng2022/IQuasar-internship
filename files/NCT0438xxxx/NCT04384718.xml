  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to document the effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention system for&#xD;
      specific reading and writing disorders, in use at Scientific Institute (IRCCS) Medea, as&#xD;
      applied and adapted to a different clinical context and socio-demographic situation. To this&#xD;
      purpose, two groups of children will be recruited and treated in two different contexts, and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes will be compared. The first one is the centre where the Tachidino platform&#xD;
      has been developed and validated, the second one is a different centre, in a different&#xD;
      geographical region where lower digital alphabetization may be a disadvantaging factor, but&#xD;
      lower population density and the presence of fewer centres for assessment and intervention&#xD;
      for learning disorders make remotely monitored protocols even more valuable.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, the intervention system based on the web platform &quot;Tachidino&quot; and routinely&#xD;
      used for the rehabilitation of reading and spelling disorders at Medea, Lombardy region,&#xD;
      would be extended to Marche (precisely, the clinical service connected to Urbino University,&#xD;
      located in Pesaro, a coastal town in Central Italy), a different geographical region with&#xD;
      different population characteristics. Precisely, the Lombardy region is a highly&#xD;
      industrialized region with the highest digitalization rate in Italy, whereas Marche is a more&#xD;
      agriculture-oriented region, with lower population density and less widespread use of digital&#xD;
      technologies. The main aim of the study is, then, to ascertain whether the effectiveness&#xD;
      levels found for the treatment protocol in the original context generalize to a different&#xD;
      context and population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system for the empowerment of reading and spelling skills (&quot;Tachidino&quot; software) is based&#xD;
      on two principles of proven effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The selective stimulation of a cerebral hemisphere and specific reading strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The training of selective visuospatial attention, as well as the perception of rapid&#xD;
           movement and the control of visual crowding effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and assessment procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current clinical practice at IRCCS Medea, intervention in &quot;e-health&quot; mode is divided into&#xD;
      one or more rehabilitation modules through the use of the Tachidino platform, with systematic&#xD;
      monitoring and motivational reinforcement by professionals with experience in e-health&#xD;
      approaches. In order to be included in the training, the child must have already obtained a&#xD;
      diagnosis of dyslexia, according to the current diagnostic standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structure of the intervention modules is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 initial meeting to get to know the child, pre-test assessment - reading and writing&#xD;
           tests of words, non-words and sentences, metaphonological tests and text reading tests&#xD;
           (reading accuracy and speed) in order to define dyslexia subtypes; intervention planning&#xD;
           - demonstration of Tachidino use and programming of first activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  telephone support to monitor and motivate correct use of the software, during active&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 final assessment meeting (with repetition of the tests used at pre-test and&#xD;
           compilation of questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the main goal and the above-described procedure, the study will investigate&#xD;
      the effects of treatment with additional tests providing parallel versions and lists of&#xD;
      stimuli, so as to exclude any possible repetition effect and thus to better highlight &quot;pure&quot;&#xD;
      intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' characteristics: Children aged between 7 and 16 years with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      Specific Reading Disorder, Mixed Disorder of Scholastic Skills or Developmental Dyslexia,&#xD;
      pertaining to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes F81, F81.0, F81.3,&#xD;
      referred to one of the two participating centres because of school learning problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of subjects: 32 (16 per centre). An additional group of 16 children with&#xD;
      Dyslexia and/or Dysgraphia on a waiting list will also be tested and retested after 4 weeks,&#xD;
      providing a further control for the effects of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants has been determined with a power analysis based on data on the&#xD;
      effects of treatment observed in the group already treated with Tachidino at IRCCS Medea. The&#xD;
      number of 32 participants turned out to be sufficient to provide a power of 0.8 with alpha&#xD;
      set at .005.&#xD;

        Children will be recruited among those referred to either IRCCS Medea or ASUR Marche&#xD;
        because of learning and school-achievement problems. All children who were offered&#xD;
        treatment through the web-based platform &quot;Tachidino&quot; and who meet inclusion/ exclusion&#xD;
        criteria will be enrolled in the study after their parents have accepted and signed&#xD;
        informed consent. After completion of the two treatment groups (32 children), the next 16&#xD;
        children referred to either Centre will be enrolled as Waiting list group and treated after&#xD;
        a 4 weeks observation period without treatment.&#xD;
