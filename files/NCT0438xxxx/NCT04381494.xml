    <textblock>
      A study of whether mobile devices can improve the detection of pulmonary AEs (including&#xD;
      pneumonitis) in stage III NSCLC patients post-CRT, while on durvalumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing post-CRT treatment for lung cancer with consolidation durvalumab can&#xD;
      experience pulmonary AEs that could become severe if not recognized and treated in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be used to evaluate the likelihood of early detection of pulmonary AEs in&#xD;
      unresectable Stage III NSCLC patients on durvalumab. This project seeks to understand if&#xD;
      multiparametric mobile technology collecting patient reported outcomes, vital signs, and&#xD;
      respiratory function, integrate well into a patients daily life and aid physicians in early&#xD;
      detection of pulmonary AEs.&#xD;

    <description>To describe the identification of treatment-emergent pneumonitis by grade (regardless of radiation therapy and/or immune-related etiology) in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC receiving durvalumab through the use of mobile technology which collects patient reported outcomes (PROs), vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate), oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), pulmonary function tests (spirometry), and physical movement (number of steps per day).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL): Assessment of general cancer-associated parameters by use of European Organization For Research And Treatment Of Cancer Quality Of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions that can be combined to produce functional scales (e.g. physical), symptom scales (e.g. fatigue), and a global measure of health status. Each of the scales are measured from 0 to 100. The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual (Fayers et al. 2001). Higher scores on the global measure of health status and functional scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales/scores represent greater symptom severity. Changes from baseline scores will be assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a lung cancer specific module from the EORTC comprising 13 questions to assess lung cancer symptoms (dyspnoea, and a series of single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and haemoptysis). Scores from 0 to 100 were derived for each symptom item with higher scores indicating a higher level of symptomatology/problems. Changes from baseline scores will be assessed.</description>
