  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 15,000 Veterans who are hospitalized for stroke each year more than half experience&#xD;
      spatial and motor impairments and pain. Spatial-motor-sensory problems limit functioning and&#xD;
      independence, which is costly to Veterans, their families, and society. Currently,&#xD;
      spatial-motor-sensory problems are targeted using different treatments. However, there is a&#xD;
      treatment that has shown promise in simultaneously targeting spatial function, motor function&#xD;
      and pain in right-brain stroke. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility of&#xD;
      using adapted spatial-motor sensory assessment and treatment procedures for Veterans with&#xD;
      left-brain stroke who have language and cognitive impairment. The next step will be to&#xD;
      conduct a large-scale study focused on this multi-target treatment for more efficient and&#xD;
      effective stroke rehabilitation. The investigators expect this line of research to increase&#xD;
      functioning, independence and quality of life in Veteran stroke survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The functional disability experienced by Veterans after stroke, and the limited&#xD;
      rehabilitation resources available, highlight the importance of identifying feasible&#xD;
      treatments acting on more than one recovery target. Currently, there are separate and&#xD;
      modality-specific treatment pathways for cognitive and motor impairments. These&#xD;
      modality-specific treatment pathways lead to fragmentation of care, and under-identification&#xD;
      and under-treatment of invisible disabilities, such as spatial neglect, aphasia and pain. The&#xD;
      result is longer hospital stays, greater risk of falls, and poor functional outcomes.&#xD;
      Employing a treatment that simultaneously addresses multiple targets will ensure that the&#xD;
      investigators provide the needed care for &gt;50% of post-stroke Veterans who have both visible&#xD;
      and invisible disabilities, during the critical post-acute period of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) is a 10-day regimen reported to be inexpensive, replicable&#xD;
      and effective for treatment of spatial neglect, and studies have demonstrated that it also&#xD;
      enhances everyday activities and motor recovery and reduces chronic post-stroke pain in&#xD;
      patients with right brain stroke. Additionally, brain mapping methods have shown that in&#xD;
      patients with right brain stroke, those with frontal lesions respond optimally to PAT. No&#xD;
      studies have investigated PAT in left-brain stroke patients with language and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. To address this research gap, the investigators will address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted PAT procedures in patients with aphasia and&#xD;
      memory impairment. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted methods for assessing spatial and motor&#xD;
      function and pain in patients with aphasia and memory impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To demonstrate the feasibility of using information about lesion location from the&#xD;
      radiology report to classify frontal vs. nonfrontal lesions.&#xD;
