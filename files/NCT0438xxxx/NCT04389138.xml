  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition affecting 145,500 people in&#xD;
      the UK. The condition impairs movement leading to gait and dexterity problems. Various types&#xD;
      of exercise are beneficial for both motor and non-motor symptoms such as depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organisation's (WHO) recommendations on exercise include at least 150&#xD;
      minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week . People with Parkinson's&#xD;
      may struggle to achieve this because of movement problems and fatigue. Physiotherapists may&#xD;
      have a role in persuading people to exercise and supporting them in their activity goals.&#xD;
      While studies show that Parkinson's patients with falls or gait freezing clearly benefit form&#xD;
      physiotherapy, there is at present no robust evidence to demonstrate the impact of&#xD;
      physiotherapy early in the course of the illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEEP seeks to explore the effectiveness of physiotherapy for early Parkinson's (ie within 4&#xD;
      years of diagnosis and before onset of falls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It comprises three distinct parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A survey of people with Parkinson's exploring their experience and opinions with respect&#xD;
           to physiotherapy for early Parkinson's&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A feasibility randomised controlled trial (fRCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A qualitative process evaluation. The fRCT will aim to recruit and randomise 40 people&#xD;
           withParkinson's who have been diagnosed in the last 4 years and have had no&#xD;
           physiotherapy. These participants will undergo several assessments at baseline, 3 months&#xD;
           and 6 months, and will also have 7 days' worth of activity monitoring done via physical&#xD;
           diary and a commercially available activity tracker to determine levels of activity.&#xD;
           Participants randomised to the intervention arm will also receive 5 physiotherapy&#xD;
           sessions (1 for assessment and 4 for treatment) additional to standard NHS care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff and some participants involved in the fRCT will be included in a qualitative process&#xD;
      evaluation to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and the research&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Principle research question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the experience and opinions of people with Parkinson's in relation to&#xD;
           physiotherapy and exercise in early disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a physiotherapy exercise intervention for people with early Parkinson's&#xD;
           disease using insights from patients and professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the feasibility of a future definitive randomised controlled trial, which&#xD;
           would investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of the physiotherapy intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has 3 elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A survey of people with Parkinson's exploring their views about physiotherapy and&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A feasibility randomised trial of Parkinson's versus usual care for people with&#xD;
           Parkinson's.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A qualitative process evaluation exploring view of participants, research nurses and&#xD;
           treating physiotherapists on the acceptability and of the intervention and the research&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of people with Parkinson's:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online and paper survey will be available for people with Parkinson's to complete. The survey&#xD;
      will be posted on the Parkinson's UK website. The survey will be open to UK residents with&#xD;
      Parkinson's who have been diagnosed within the last 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial The project will also consist of a Feasibility trial&#xD;
      of physiotherapy for early Parkinson's versus usual care. Randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
      Blinded assessment of outcomes. Parallel group design. Patient will be followed up at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the baseline visit. The RCT will be set in two NHS tertiary care centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, the following study procedures will be completed. Eligibity assessment by the PI&#xD;
      or delegated research team member. 1. Demographics, medical history, medication history,&#xD;
      physical examination (DOB, Height, Weight, Sex) The following Standard Questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed at the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA). This is a measure of cognition widely used in&#xD;
           Parkinson's clinics (38).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDQ-39.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UPDRS. This is a Parkinson's assessment tool that includes subsections looking at motor&#xD;
           symptoms and signs, non-motor symptoms, activities of daily living and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SF-12. This is a measure of health related quality of life. Where the participant with&#xD;
           Parkinson's has a carer who has agreed to take part in the study the investigator will&#xD;
           ask the carer to complete this assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LPAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-BEST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tragus to wall distance. Activity diaries: Participants will be given an activity diary&#xD;
           and asked to record their activity over the next 7 days (starting the day after the&#xD;
           initial visit). The activity diary will be returned to the research team in a pre-paid&#xD;
           addressed envelope that will be provided to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity monitors: The research nurse will provide each participant with a activity monitor&#xD;
      and provide instruction on how to use and charge at home. The monitor will be provided fully&#xD;
      charged. The device will be worn on the wrist. Participants will be asked to wear the device&#xD;
      for the next 7 days. The device can be worn while showering or swimming. The device should&#xD;
      then be returned to the research team in a stamped addressed envelope provided, along with&#xD;
      the completed activity diary. The main outcomes of interest from the activity monitors will&#xD;
      be average daily step count and active minutes/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Participants randomised to the intervention arm, they will attend an initial assessment&#xD;
      visit followed by 4 physiotherapy intervention visits. At each of these 5 visits, a checklist&#xD;
      will be completed by the physiotherapist to document what has been delivered as part of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will take place at 3 months and 6 months after baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDQ-39&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SF-12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of falls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 day activity diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity monitor (7days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LPAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tragus to wall&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record of outside of study therapy interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event register&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outcome assessor will be asked if they have been unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mini-BEST will be measured at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both staff and participants will be interviewed to explore views on care and the&#xD;
      intervention. Interviews will last roughly 1 hour. Interviews will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-10 physiotherapists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-8 Participants from the Randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-4 Research Nurses from the Randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
