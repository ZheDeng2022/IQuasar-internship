  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) are helpful or harmful for&#xD;
      preventing diabetes complications among children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).&#xD;

      Eligible participants will be scheduled for a baseline visit. During the week prior, they&#xD;
      will be instructed to continue usual dietary habits and complete an online photo-assisted&#xD;
      food record, with parental assistance. At the baseline visit, height and weight will be&#xD;
      measured, a spot urine sample will be collected, and a blood draw will be performed.&#xD;
      Participants will have their CGM data for the past two weeks downloaded. In a subset of&#xD;
      participants, an abdominal MRI will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomized to either: 1) low-calorie sweetener (LCS) restriction or 2)&#xD;
      continuation of usual LCS intake (control). All participants (both groups) and their parent&#xD;
      will undergo a brief, 20-minute orientation where the PI and study dietitian will provide an&#xD;
      introduction to the study, instructions on completing food records, education on CGM. Those&#xD;
      in the intervention group will be given sample replacement beverages and a brochure on&#xD;
      avoiding LCS to take home which will include a list of specific foods and beverages&#xD;
      containing LCS to avoid during the study. Participants in the control group will be counseled&#xD;
      on healthy eating as those in the intervention group (in accordance with standard dietary&#xD;
      guidance for T1D management), with the exception of information and resources for avoiding&#xD;
      LCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, text messages will be sent to parents 3X/week with reminders that their child&#xD;
      should avoid LCS or continue usual intake, per randomization. Adherence will be monitored&#xD;
      through collection of spot-urine samples for measurement of sucralose and ace-K&#xD;
      concentrations. daily text message beverage logs completed by the parent, and photo-assisted&#xD;
      food records with parent assistance in Weeks 0, 1, 6, and 12. During Week 6, participants and&#xD;
      their parent will attend a mid-intervention telemedicine booster visit, during which the PI&#xD;
      and/or study RA will reinforce the intervention and remind participants to mail back a spot&#xD;
      urine sample using materials provided by the study team at baseline. Participants will be&#xD;
      reminded of the study instructions, including the importance of inserting the DEXCOM G6&#xD;
      sensor (provided by study team) at the beginning of Week 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Week 12, participants and their parent will return for follow-up. Participants&#xD;
      will have their CGM data downloaded using DEXCOM Clarity™ software. Height and weight will be&#xD;
      measured and a second blood draw performed. Those who had an MRI at the baseline visit (n=30)&#xD;
      will undergo a second abdominal MRI. Those randomized to the intervention will be&#xD;
      purposefully sampled and asked to complete a ~20 minute qualitative interview and ~5 minute&#xD;
      satisfaction survey, together with their parent, about their study experience and the&#xD;
      challenges of LCSB restriction.&#xD;
