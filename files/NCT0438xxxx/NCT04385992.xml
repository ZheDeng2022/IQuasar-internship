  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is based on specific somatostatin receptor&#xD;
      targeting with radiolabelled analogues 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE. These two most&#xD;
      commonly used radiopeptides, 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE, produce overall objective&#xD;
      response rates of 15-35%. PRRT is generally well tolerated with mild toxicity, if the&#xD;
      necessary precautions, such as the co-administration of nephroprotective amino acids or the&#xD;
      adjustment of the administered activity, are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT&#xD;
      with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at&#xD;
      high risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to&#xD;
           modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will&#xD;
      participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the&#xD;
      last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study un initial experience was reported with neoadjuvant PRRT followed by&#xD;
      surgical resection in patients affected by PanNETs. In this study, patients with resectable&#xD;
      or potentially resectable PanNETs at high risk of recurrence after surgery who underwent&#xD;
      neoadjuvant PRRT were compared with a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery. Of&#xD;
      note, patients who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT had a significant lower risk of developing&#xD;
      pancreatic fistula and a lower risk of postoperative complications. Moreover, among those&#xD;
      patients who underwent curative resection, patients who received PRRT had a progression-free&#xD;
      survival significantly longer after compared to upfront surgery. Neoadjuvant PRRT may be a&#xD;
      valuable option to reduce the risk of failure after surgery in patients with PanNETs who are&#xD;
      at high risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT has&#xD;
      never been investigated in a prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT&#xD;
      with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at&#xD;
      high risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to&#xD;
           modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will&#xD;
      participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the&#xD;
      last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the Single-Stage Phase II sample size method, we estimated a sample size of 30&#xD;
      patients to test if the proportion of patients without postoperative complications&#xD;
      (responses) is more than or equal to 57% (p1 ) or less than equal to 39% (p0 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be enrol in the study, all the patients should have a cytological/histological&#xD;
      confirmation of PanNET and meet one or more inclusion criteria. Moreover, all the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria should have been ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo the following laboratory examinations at week 0, week 1, week 9, week&#xD;
      17, week 25, week 38, week 40, week 45-52: blood cell count, urea, creatinine, sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, cloride, calcium, glucose, bilirubin, AST, ALT, LDH, GGT, ALP, Albumin, urine&#xD;
      test. Gravindex will be executed at week 0, week 1, week 9, week 17, week 25, week 40 and&#xD;
      they will be asked to fill a quality of life questionnaire at wwk 0, week 38, week 40-52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be treated with standard pancreatic resection according to PanNET&#xD;
      localization, after a course (4 cycles) of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a cumulative activity of 29.600 MBq (800 mCi), divided in 4&#xD;
      administrations (or cycles) of 7.400 MBq (200 mCi) each, with treatment intervals of 6-8&#xD;
      weeks. The per-cycle activity of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and consequently the cumulative activity)&#xD;
      might be reduced if relevant blood and renal toxicity, or other side effects, will occur&#xD;
      during the course of PRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTATATE will be slowly injected intravenously over a period of 30 minutes and using a&#xD;
      dedicated pump-system of infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the administration of the therapy, performed into a dedicated room of the Nuclear&#xD;
      Medicine Division, the Health Physics staff will monitor the patient by means of an&#xD;
      ionization chamber, in order to check the completeness of the radiopeptide administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain an adequate hydration of the patient and to protect the renal parenchyma&#xD;
      during the phase of excretion of the radiopharmaceutical from an excessive tubular reuptake&#xD;
      of radiopetide, the administration of the radiopharmaceutical will be preceded and followed&#xD;
      (without interruption) with intravenous infusion of 1000 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution&#xD;
      containing L-Arginine hydrochloride and/or Lysine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gamma emission of 177Lu (113 and 208 KeV, relative abundance 6 and 11%, respectively)&#xD;
      allows a suitable observation of the radiopharmaceutical biodistribution during the entire&#xD;
      therapeutic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 16-24 hours from administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and for each treatment cycle)&#xD;
      patients will undergo anterior and posterior whole body scan (imaging will be acquired on a&#xD;
      128x512 matrix, by means a double-headed gamma-camera, equipped with a low-energy&#xD;
      high-resolution collimator (LEHR), with energetic window set on 177Lu peaks.) in order to&#xD;
      verify the correct bio-distribution of the radiopharmaceutical and its focal uptake into the&#xD;
      target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, at 1st and 4th cycle, when feasible and indicated, a more accurate imaging&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed by using SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging (6-24 hours after&#xD;
      administration), in order to quantify percentage of radiopharmaceutical uptake and half-life,&#xD;
      absorbed dose, effective biological dose (BED), equivalent uniform dose (EUD) both in target&#xD;
      lesions and critical organs (bone marrow and kidney) and correlate these parameters with the&#xD;
      response to the treatment) and with the toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be re-evaluated 3 months after the 4th cycle of PRRT, in order to assess&#xD;
      the rate of objective radiological response, according to mRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo standard pancreatic surgery plus lymphadenectomy at one of the&#xD;
      participating surgical site identified in the protocol. Pancreatic resection will be&#xD;
      performed according to the localization and extended to nearby organs and/or vessels when&#xD;
      invasion is present. Concomitant liver resection may be performed in the presence of liver&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcomes. 90-day post-operative mortality and morbidity will be classified&#xD;
      according to the definition proposed by Dindo et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-OTATATE according to modified&#xD;
      RECIST criteria (mRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life (QoL) at diagnostic workup, after neoadjuvant PRRT and after the&#xD;
      pancreatic surgical resection, will be evaluated by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected with CRFs and information will be recorded in a protected database.&#xD;
