      To compare different timing of insulin Glargine administration (early-6 pm versus standard&#xD;
      bedtime-10 pm) as part of standard of care in patients with type1 diabetes who wish to fast&#xD;
      the month of Ramadan.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to compare the effectiveness and safety of two management strategies&#xD;
      currently used in basal insulin adjustment for treatment of Type1 diabetes (T1DM) during&#xD;
      fasting the holy month of Ramadan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if taking basal insulin Glargine at 6 pm is associated with less rates of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia -(we will consider glucose level of 70 mg/dl ( 3.9 mmol/l) and below as the&#xD;
      level of hypoglycemia ) - compared to bedtime timing (10-12pm) during fasting Ramadan in&#xD;
      patients with T1DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the difference between the two groups in glucose variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the difference between the two groups in number of days they needed to brake&#xD;
           their fast&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the difference in glycemic control between the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate the difference between the two groups in overnight and daytime&#xD;
           hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To estimate the difference between the two groups in rate of severe hyperglycemia and&#xD;
           /or DKA&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multi-center open label randomized study that will take place in the&#xD;
      diabetes/Endocrine clinics at National Guards Hospitals in four cities (Jeddah, Riyadh,&#xD;
      Alhasa, and Dammam)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be Assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient's demographics including (age, gender, type and duration of diabetes), and&#xD;
           baseline measurements (weight, height,BMI, â€¦).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of Hypoglycemic events (as per SMBG records and CGM) in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of days fasting was broken in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rate of severe hyperglycemic episodes (BG&gt;250mg/dl) or DKA in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mean blood glucose for the month of Ramadan as calculated from sum of each patient's&#xD;
           7-point blood sugar home measurements in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mean 24-hour blood glucose as measured by a continuous glucose monitoring devise in both&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Mean fasting blood glucose for the month period as calculated from patients home blood&#xD;
           sugar measurements in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Mean 2-hour post-prandial blood glucose for the as calculated from patients home blood&#xD;
           sugar measurements in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Fructosamine and HbA1c level before and after Ramadan in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study will help fill a current gap of knowledge and may also contribute to&#xD;
      the development of future guidelines for the management of type1DM during Ramadan.&#xD;
