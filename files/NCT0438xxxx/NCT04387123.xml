    <textblock>
      Vaginoscopic examination is usually difficult due to continuous leakage of the distension&#xD;
      medium from the introitus. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and success of&#xD;
      performing diagnostic or operative vaginoscopic surgery via a tight self-retaining external&#xD;
      vulvar sheet (Darwish sheet) expressed as tight vaginoscopy (TV) compared with conventional&#xD;
      vaginoscopy (CV).&#xD;

      This is a prospective cross-sectional interventional cohort study was performed at the&#xD;
      Endoscopy Unit of the Woman's Health University Hospital, Assiut, Egypt, between July 2014&#xD;
      and January 2020. Participants were symptomatic patients with suspected narrow vagina. They&#xD;
      were children, adolescents or nulliparous adult females scheduled for vaginoscopy to confirm&#xD;
      the diagnosis and whenever indicated to remove a vaginal or cervical lesion or FB. All cases&#xD;
      underwent a high-resolution 2D transabdominal ultrasonography with full-bladder technique to&#xD;
      assess the vaginal integrity, length and width. If a mass was seen, the examiner commented on&#xD;
      its origin (whether cervical or vaginal), its echogenicity, and its dimensions. In doubtful&#xD;
      cases, a pelvic MRI was requested to confirm the diagnosis. Children with suspected FB were&#xD;
      subjected to plain X-ray to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with definite or suspected&#xD;
      vaginal or cervical lesions were included in this study. For young girls or virgin adults,&#xD;
      every effort was exerted to avoid hymenal injury during vaginoscopy on their request. All the&#xD;
      cases were prepared for a vaginoscopic surgery at the regular endoscopy unit in the immediate&#xD;
      postmenstrual period (if postmenarchal) but young girls were operated on at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient was subjected to a sequential diagnostic conventional vaginoscopy (CV) followed&#xD;
      by tight vaginoscopy (TV), and whenever required operative TV. Vulvar tightness was made&#xD;
      using a self-retaining external vulvar sheet (Darwish sheet). Under general anesthesia, all&#xD;
      the cases were placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Trendelenburg position was avoided&#xD;
      because it hinders access to the entire vagina and the cervix, and may increase the risk of&#xD;
      gas or air embolism. For adult cases, conventional hysteroscope was used as a vaginoscope. A&#xD;
      4-mm zero-degree telescope loaded inside a 5-mm outer sheath and connected to a light cable,&#xD;
      with a pneumatic infusion pump for 0.9% saline irrigation, was inserted inside the vaginal&#xD;
      introitus. At the investigator's institution, automatic infusion pumps are not used for&#xD;
      vaginoscopic surgery as the vagina is a distensible organ unlike the uterus. The vaginoscope&#xD;
      was gradually advanced inside the vagina (Figure 1) with reporting on the vaginal walls till&#xD;
      the ectocervix. Proper examination of the cervix included the endocervical canal and the&#xD;
      internal os. If feasible, the telescope was advanced to examine the endometrial cavity,&#xD;
      searching for any associated intrauterine lesion, with a comment on the endometrial pattern&#xD;
      and vasculature. Any suspected lesion was prepared for complete excision or at least biopsy&#xD;
      to complete the diagnosis. On the other hand, for children, office hysteroscope (a 2.6-mm&#xD;
      telescope and a 3.2-mm outer sheath) was used and the procedure was performed in the same way&#xD;
      as that in adults, with exemption of uterine cavity examination. The visualized pattern of&#xD;
      any vaginal or cervical lesion was reported. At the end of the procedure, the telescope&#xD;
      loaded inside its sheath was extracted. The same patient was re-examined using TV. The&#xD;
      vaginoscope penetrates a sterile self-retaining tight external silicone vulvar sheet (Darwish&#xD;
      sheet) measuring 20x15 cm which is tied around the patient waist (Figure 2) with a central&#xD;
      linear incision of 10 mm aiming to minimize the reflux of the irrigating fluid from the&#xD;
      vagina. Comment on the appearance of the normal anatomy of the vagina (Figure 1) and the&#xD;
      cervix, (Figure 3) any vaginal or cervical lesion like cervical polyps (figure 3,4) or&#xD;
      foreign bodies (FB) (Figure 4), or a vaginal septum (video) was made. Importantly, the&#xD;
      surgeon commented on clarity of visualization, amount of used and leaked 0.9% saline before&#xD;
      and after application of Darwish sheet on the vulva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For operative TV, a 27-Fr rotatory resectoscope loaded inside the sterile self-retaining&#xD;
      tight external silicone vulvar sheet (Darwish sheet). Glycine 1.5% was used for monopolar&#xD;
      resectoscopy. Vaginal or cervical polyps were excised by a loop electrode, while vaginal&#xD;
      septum was cut using a hook electrode. FB was extracted using a flexible grasping forceps&#xD;
      inserted in the vagina alongside the vaginoscope; if any difficulty was faced, the telescope&#xD;
      was loaded inside rigid grasping forceps to extract the FB. A comment on the feasibility of&#xD;
      surgery (clarity of visualization and access to the lesion), operative time and any possible&#xD;
      complications was made. The amount of irrigated distension medium as well as escaped amount&#xD;
      in the suction unit and that collected in a sterile plastic bag embedded under the buttocks&#xD;
      of the patient were collected and measured after every case of the diagnostic CV, diagnostic&#xD;
      TV, and operative TV. All endoscopic equipment was manufactured by Storz Co. (Tuttlingen,&#xD;
      Germany). All excised tissues were sent for histopathologic assessment. The attached video&#xD;
      shows different cases of diagnostic and operative vaginoscopy before and after application of&#xD;
      Darwish sheet. The main outcome measures included clarity of visualization of the vagina and&#xD;
      the cervix, estimation of infused and leaked distension medium before and after application&#xD;
      of vulvar Darwish sheet and the success rate of operative TV whenever indicated.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, the patients were kept under observation for 2-4 h and discharged whenever&#xD;
      stable. All cases were followed up at least once after the next menses and examined&#xD;
      clinically and by ultrasonography.&#xD;
