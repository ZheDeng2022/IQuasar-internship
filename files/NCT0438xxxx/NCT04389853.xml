  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of nephrolithiasis is increasing over the last two decades, and kidney stones&#xD;
      is a recurrent disorder, with lifetime recurrence risks reported to be as high as 50%. One of&#xD;
      the most challenging stones is the lower pole (LP) nephrolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard management of lower pole stones (LPS), is still controversial especially for&#xD;
      stones smaller than 20 mm, with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and mini-PCNL (miniperc)&#xD;
      both demonstrated to be safe and effective methods for treating LPS with a diameter of 1-2&#xD;
      cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selecting the optimal modality for treating renal calculi is challenging, as both techniques&#xD;
      may be associated with different patient benefits and risk profiles. Despite the evolution of&#xD;
      mini-PCNL and fURS techniques into clinical practice, there is a lack of comparative clinical&#xD;
      data assessing SFRs and complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, no previous studies have addressed the outcome of ambulatory&#xD;
      tubeless miniperc as a same day procedure, which this study will look to assess. The&#xD;
      investigators are planning to discharge all participants home the night of surgery, without&#xD;
      admission or insertion of nephrostomy tube. This will decrease the morbidity of miniperc and&#xD;
      encourage head-to-head comparison with fURS in a prospective randomized protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of nephrolithiasis is increasing over the last two decades, and kidney stones&#xD;
      is a recurrent disorder, with lifetime recurrence risks reported to be as high as 50%. One of&#xD;
      the most challenging stones is the lower pole (LP) nephrolithiasis. This could be explained&#xD;
      by its antigravity location, acute angle with the renal pelvis and the narrow angle of the&#xD;
      infundibulum. Therefore, the optimal management of LP calculi continues to be a dilemma. The&#xD;
      standard management of lower pole stones (LPS), is still controversial especially for stones&#xD;
      smaller than 20 mm, with competing interventions possessing advantages and disadvantages.&#xD;
      Treatment options include percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), retrograde intrarenal surgery&#xD;
      (RIRS), or shockwave lithotripsy (SWL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCNL has regained popularity thanks to the possibility of using reduced calibers and modern&#xD;
      technology, which has reduced the complications without compromising the stone clearance, and&#xD;
      more efficient intracorporeal lithotripter modalities. However, PCNL is still a challenging&#xD;
      surgical technique and can be associated with significant complications that may compromise&#xD;
      its efficacy. In the present time, surgeons have available calibers ranging from 4.8 to 30&#xD;
      French. Many reports advocate that morbidity after PCNL may be reduced by recent&#xD;
      modifications, such as mini-PCNL (miniperc). One meta-analysis of mini-PCNL and conventional&#xD;
      PCNL demonstrated that mini-PCNL had a greater safety profile with similar stone free rates&#xD;
      (SFRs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another alternative option is RIRS. RIRS has gained much popularity especially when the role&#xD;
      of SWL, in management of LPS, has been significantly diminished in the few last years. RIRS&#xD;
      is dependent mainly on flexible ureteroscopy (fURS). fURS increases the quality and&#xD;
      performance of upper urinary tract exploration, allowing for the treatment of the majority of&#xD;
      stones at all sites. Moreover, it is associated with no risk of renal parenchymal injuries&#xD;
      and a very low risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIRS and miniperc are both safe and effective methods for treating LPS with a diameter of 1-2&#xD;
      cm. The SFRs were comparable at the first postoperative day (90.2% vs. 93.2%) and the second&#xD;
      month postoperatively (93.8% vs. 95.1%), for RIRS and miniperc, respectively. However,&#xD;
      miniperc was associated with significant longer hospital stay and higher hospitalization&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, selecting the optimal modality for treating renal calculi is challenging, as both&#xD;
      techniques may be associated with different patient benefits and risk profiles. Despite the&#xD;
      evolution of mini-PCNL and fURS techniques into clinical practice, there is a lack of&#xD;
      comparative clinical data assessing SFRs and complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, no previous studies have addressed the outcome of ambulatory&#xD;
      tubeless miniperc as a same day procedure, which this study will look to assess. The&#xD;
      investigators are planning to discharge all participants home the night of surgery, without&#xD;
      admission or insertion of nephrostomy tube. This should decrease the morbidity of miniperc&#xD;
      and encourage head-to-head comparison with fURS in a prospective randomized protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attempt to address whether there is a difference in clinical outcome&#xD;
      between ambulatory mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy and flexible ureteroscopy in the&#xD;
      management of lower pole kidney stones?&#xD;
