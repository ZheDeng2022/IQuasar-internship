  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TAK-981 is being tested in combination with pembrolizumab to treat participants who have&#xD;
      select advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of TAK-981&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be on this combination treatment for 21-day cycles. They will continue with&#xD;
      this treatment for up to 24 months or until participants meet any discontinuation criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have select advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will include a dose&#xD;
      escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 242 patients, approximately 32 participants in the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase 1 and approximately 76 to 210 participants in each of the 8 cohorts of dose&#xD;
      expansion phase. Participants will receive escalating doses of TAK-981 and fixed dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab until RP2D is determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Dose Escalation: TAK-981 + Pembrolizumab (fixed dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once RP2D is determined, participants of select advanced or metastatic solid tumors will&#xD;
      receive TAK-981 in below defined cohorts in the expansion phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort A: Non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort B: Cervical Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort C: MSS-CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort D: Cutaneous Melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort E: Squamous NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort F: Small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort G: HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion Phase: Cohort H: MSI-H/dMMR CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 48 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and&#xD;
      progression-free survival follow-up for maximum up to 12 months after last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs after administration of first dose of study drug and through 30 days after last dose of study drug or until start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy. AEs will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), v5.0 except cytokine release syndrome (CRS), will be graded according to American society for transplantation and cellular therapy (ASCST) Consensus Grading for CRS.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a histologically or cytologically documented, advanced (metastatic and/or&#xD;
             unresectable) cancer as listed below that is incurable: Note: Prior neoadjuvant or&#xD;
             adjuvant therapy included in initial treatment may not be considered first- or&#xD;
             later-line standard of care treatment unless such treatments were completed less than&#xD;
             12 months prior to the current tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. Non-squamous NSCLC for which prior standard first-line treatment containing an&#xD;
             anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death protein 1 ligand&#xD;
             (PD-1/PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) alone or in combination has failed and that&#xD;
             has progressed to no more than 1 prior systemic therapy. In Phase 2, participants with&#xD;
             non-squamous NSCLC must have not received more than 1 prior systemic therapy and must&#xD;
             not have presented with disease progression during the first 5 months of treatment&#xD;
             with first-line CPI/anti-PD-(1/L1)-containing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In Phase 1, participants with non-squamous NSCLC and known driver&#xD;
             mutations/genomic aberrations (eg, EGFR, B-Raf proto-oncogene mutation V600E [BRAF&#xD;
             V600E], and ROS proto-oncogene 1 [ROS1] sensitizing mutations, neurotrophic receptor&#xD;
             tyrosine kinase [NRTK] gene fusions, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]&#xD;
             rearrangements) must have also shown progressive disease after treatment with a&#xD;
             commercially available targeted therapy. In Phase 2, participants with driver&#xD;
             mutations are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             B. CPI-naive cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma of the cervix) participants for whom prior standard first-line&#xD;
             treatment has failed and who have received no more than 1 prior systemic line of&#xD;
             therapy for recurrent or Stage IVB cervical cancer. Note: The following cervical&#xD;
             tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma malignum, gastric-type&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma, and mesonephric carcinoma. Histologic&#xD;
             confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via pathology report. Note:&#xD;
             First-line treatment must have consisted of platinum-containing doublet. Chemotherapy&#xD;
             administered concurrently with primary radiation (e.g., weekly cisplatin) is not&#xD;
             counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
