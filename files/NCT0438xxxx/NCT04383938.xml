      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      APR-246 (eprenetapopt) in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies. In the safety lead-in part of study (phase 1), the safety and the recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APR-246 will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion part of the study (phase 2), both safety and efficacy for the combination&#xD;
      therapy will be investigated in the 3 cohorts.&#xD;
