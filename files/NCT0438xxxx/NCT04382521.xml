  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of an adaptive text message intervention (TMI) to promote well-being and health&#xD;
      behavior adherence in 60 patients with two or more cardiac risk conditions (hypertension,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, or hyperlipidemia).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an adaptive text message intervention (TMI) that uses&#xD;
      participant feedback for individual messages and progress towards health goals to deliver&#xD;
      increasingly personalized positive psychology (PP) and health behavior text messages over&#xD;
      time. The investigators aim to examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy in a randomized, controlled pilot trial in 60 adults with two or more cardiac risk&#xD;
      conditions (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or hyperlipidemia).&#xD;

    <description>This is an 18-item instrument that measures three dimensions of locus of control. It assesses people's beliefs that their health is or is not determined by their own behavior. The survey has three subscales: internality of health locus of control, powerful other locus of control, and chance locus of control. All items are measured on a 6-point Likert scale, and our main subscale of interest will be internal locus of control, which will be a sum of scores from questions 1,6,8,12,13,17 (range: 6-36). Higher scores indicate higher locus of control.</description>

Items are summed, and a total score is also calculated and ranges from 12 to 84. Higher subscale and total scores indicate high levels of perceived social support.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a three component intervention consisting of (1) daily, adaptive text messages related to Positive Psychology or health behaviors, (2) twice weekly text messages related to a specific health behavior goal, and (3) three brief check-ins (at baseline, week 4, and week 8 of the intervention) with a study staff member to discuss progress towards health behavior goals. During the brief check-ins, the study staff member will inquire about: (1) medical conditions, (2) adherence gaps, (3) personal health goals (including weight goals), (4) motivation, self-efficacy, and barriers to reaching health goals, (5) preferred activity types (e.g., walking), and (6) sources of sedentary time (e.g., computer, TV). This information will be added to the algorithm for each individual and we will deliver tailored daily text messages for our participants.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac risk conditions. Participants will have two or more of hypertension, type-2&#xD;
             diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Patients will have met 2+ of 2017 AHA-ACC criteria for&#xD;
             hypertension (SBP ≥130, DBP ≥80), 2018 ADA criteria for type-2 diabetes (e.g., A1C&#xD;
             ≥6.5%), and 2013 AHA-ACC criteria for hyperlipidemia (e.g., LDL cholesterol ≥190), via&#xD;
             medical record review, with confirmation by healthcare providers as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low physical activity or elevated sedentary leisure time (SLT). Low activity will be&#xD;
             defined as ≤150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA), which is an&#xD;
             ADA-recommended level of MVPA; elevated SLT will be ≥120 min/day, which is linked to&#xD;
             adverse medical health. As initial screens for both MVPA and SLT, we will use the&#xD;
             International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Patients reporting ≤150 min/week&#xD;
             of MVPA or ≥120 min/day of SLT will wear accelerometers for 10 days to confirm low&#xD;
             MVPA/high SLT (patients will indicate their leisure time hours to allow assessment of&#xD;
             SLT during those hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suboptimal diet. Participants must also report either fewer than 5 daily servings of&#xD;
             fruit/vegetables (measured by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System's [BRFSS]&#xD;
             Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Module) or have a score of ≥70 on the MEDFICTS scale&#xD;
             for fat/cholesterol intake, representing high risk. We will require diet and activity&#xD;
             deficits to ensure that a broad range of messages will be relevant to every&#xD;
             participant as we explore the utility of individual messages and patterns of message&#xD;
             selection in this initial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to receive text messages. Participants must have a cellular phone that&#xD;
             receives texts and that they use at least daily. We will remunerate them the cost of&#xD;
             receiving the messages as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to read in English or Spanish. Text messages will be available in English and&#xD;
             Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing coronary artery disease (CAD; diagnosed via cardiac catheterization using&#xD;
             standard coronary artery stenosis definitions or prior ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An unrelated condition limiting physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in programs focused on cardiac prevention or well-being (e.g., cardiac&#xD;
             rehabilitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A cognitive disturbance precluding participation or informed consent, assessed using a&#xD;
             six-item screen designed to assess suitability for research participation.&#xD;
