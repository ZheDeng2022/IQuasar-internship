  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study can be identified as an experimental study with a quasi-randomized control. It&#xD;
      consisted of HVLA manipulation on blocked sacroiliac joints (SIJ) and it was checked whether&#xD;
      it affected the appropriate parameters determining the pressure center (COP). The value of&#xD;
      the parameters were examined twice, before (PRE) and after (POST) manipulation. The results&#xD;
      were compared with the control group (people without hypomobility SIJ) in which sham&#xD;
      manipulation was performed, and COP parameters (PRE and POST) were measured twice. In&#xD;
      addition, PRE and POST results were compared within the group, i.e. separately in the&#xD;
      experimental group (E) and separately in the control group (C) to check the effect of HVLA&#xD;
      manipulation and placebo manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hypothesis assumes that persons belonging to the experimental group are&#xD;
      characterized by significantly higher values of COP parameters before manipulation than&#xD;
      values in the control group. The second hypothesis assumes that COP parameters will normalize&#xD;
      as a result of sacroiliac joint mobilization performed in the experimental group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project was to determine the effectiveness of HVLA manipulation in maintaining&#xD;
      static body balance. To implement it, it was necessary to conduct an experiment consisting in&#xD;
      performing HVLA manipulation in people with SIJs hypomobility and checking whether it affects&#xD;
      the COP parameters. It was assumed to measure these parameters twice (before (PRE) and after&#xD;
      (POST) manipulation) and compare them with the measurements in the C group (sham&#xD;
      manipulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size necessary to power the study was determined at the test planning stage, using&#xD;
      the G * Power 3.1.9 software. The standard threshold α = .05 was established; then the&#xD;
      acceptable power level of the 1-β = .90 test and the expected moderate effect size η2 = .30&#xD;
      were determined for within-between interaction. The calculated total expected size of the&#xD;
      sample is N = 32, i.e. 16 subjects in one research group, assuming that their number will not&#xD;
      decrease during the study. With a higher test power 1-β = .95 and a moderate achieved result&#xD;
      for observed effect size η2 = .25, the sample should have to consist of 26 subjects per&#xD;
      subgroup. It was decided to examine a slightly larger number of available entities due to the&#xD;
      possibility of excluding incorrect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poznan University of Physical Education's students were invited to the research,&#xD;
      electronically. Before starting the research, they were informed about the purpose and manner&#xD;
      of conducting the research, and the type of methods used. Participation in the experiment was&#xD;
      voluntary and free. Participants could withdraw from cooperation in the research at any time.&#xD;
      They obtained assurance that the data obtained will be used only for scientific purposes and&#xD;
      their processing will be fully anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among 202 students of the Poznań University of Physical Education who responded to the&#xD;
      invitation to the study project interview has been conducted, as a result of which 22 people&#xD;
      were excluded from further actions due to disqualification criteria. Then sacroiliac mobility&#xD;
      tests has been performed which made it possible to recognize hypomobility in 72 people. From&#xD;
      the group of people with hypomobility, 36 people were randomly selected and included in the E&#xD;
      group. From among people without hypomobility, 31 people were randomly selected for the C&#xD;
      group. An random number table was used in the draw. The subjects did not know any group they&#xD;
      were assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the examination of each project participant consisted of performing podometric&#xD;
      measurements and SIJs mobilization in the E group or placebo in the C group, and&#xD;
      re-performing functional tests and podometrics in both groups after the procedure. At the&#xD;
      stage of analyzing data rejected 8 people who did not meet the assumed criteria, thus finally&#xD;
      there were 30 people in the experimental group and 29 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualification of the subjects to the E and C group was conducted by a researcher who had&#xD;
      seven years of experience in using manual therapy techniques. The following tests of SIJs&#xD;
      mobility were performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standing forward flexion test: the symmetry of posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS)&#xD;
           displacement during forward flexion is assessed. In the case of hamstrings tension, the&#xD;
           result may be false positive, so it should be repeated in a sitting position or with&#xD;
           slightly bent knees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One leg standing / Stork / Gillet test: the hip joint is bent in the standing position,&#xD;
           the downward and medial displacement of PSIS in relation to S2 is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of the Derbolowsky symptom (Pidellou symptom / long sitting test): was&#xD;
           performed as determined by Bemis and Daniel. It allows determining the dysfunctional&#xD;
           side and the rotation of iliac bone. The level of medial ankles during lifting of the&#xD;
           torso from lying back position to straight sit with simultaneous traction of legs is&#xD;
           observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lower limb adduction test: the patient is lying back, upper anterior iliac spine&#xD;
           stabilization (ASIS) is required. The adduction of the bent at the hip and knee joint&#xD;
           lower limb follows it. On the limited side, the adduction angle will be smaller compared&#xD;
           to the healthy side. The test has screening character, because blockage of the joint may&#xD;
           occur without limitation of adduction in the case of hip over-mobility, but due to the&#xD;
           simplicity of implementation, it is a valuable indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of SIJs mobility tests are burdened with the accuracy and reliability errors in&#xD;
      situations when they are performed individually. However, performing more tests increases the&#xD;
      accuracy of the diagnosis. For this reason, there were performed four SIJs mobility tests, as&#xD;
      well as complementary measurements of PSIS, ASIS, and iliac crest levels before (PRE) and&#xD;
      after (POST) treatment to determine its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Podometric measurement After conducting functional tests, the study participants were&#xD;
      directed to a podometric measurement, which was performed twice - PRE and POST. The&#xD;
      measurement was carried out using the Medicapteurs PEL 38 platform, which allows conducting&#xD;
      both static and dynamic measurements, and it cooperates with the TWINN software in Windows.&#xD;
      The equipment was designed and tested in leading medical centers in Europe and put into use&#xD;
      in the USA by Physical Support Systems. The platform has 1024 sensors with a total measuring&#xD;
      surface of 320x320 [mm] and the appropriate resolution for testing the distribution of foot&#xD;
      pressure and tracking the position of COP. The platform was calibrated automatically&#xD;
      accordingly to the bodyweight of each participant, and the measurement was taken in a&#xD;
      standing (Frankfurt) position with upper limbs hanging freely. Participants were asked to&#xD;
      maintain a stable position without unnecessary movements and to look straight ahead at eye&#xD;
      level. During the study, patients did not have visual access to a graphical record of the&#xD;
      measurement carried out to avoid attempts to correct body posture. Each measurement was&#xD;
      conducted for 30 seconds, recording the current COP position at a frequency of 10 frames per&#xD;
      second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental manipulation Persons with blocked SIJ on one or both sides, constituting an E&#xD;
      group, were manipulated on the blocked joints. People without blocked SIJs constituted a C&#xD;
      group that underwent placebo manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure of experimental manipulation: the patient lay on the healthy side with the&#xD;
      straight lower limb, and the torso turned towards the dysfunctional side, whose lower limb&#xD;
      was bent in the hip and knee joint, and the hands rest on the lower ribs on the same side.&#xD;
      The therapist allowed the initial loosening of the tissues and chose the movement barrier&#xD;
      with his stabilizing hand. Then, with the treatment hand, he introduced the HVLA thrust&#xD;
      through the iliac bone towards the bottom, while giving the iliac bone a posterior or&#xD;
      anterior rotation - meaning, the opposite to the occurring dysfunction. If during the&#xD;
      manipulation, no cavitation sound was heard, the HVLA thrust was repeated once. In the C&#xD;
      group, the placebo procedure was the same, but no external force was introduced in the form&#xD;
      of a therapeutic impulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods The collected data were analyzed in a statistical program Statistica&#xD;
      version 13. The normality of the distribution of all measured variables on the quantitative&#xD;
      scale in both groups was checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the effect of the manipulation on the measured variables, there was carried&#xD;
      out quantitative analysis of variance with repeated measures, plus a number of comparisons&#xD;
      using the Student's t-test for dependent and independent attempts, and in some cases for the&#xD;
      characteristics whose distribution differed from the standard - with the use of&#xD;
      non-parametric the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent pairs or Wilcoxon test for dependent&#xD;
      pairs. The Cohen d effect power measure was also used in data analysis.&#xD;
