  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various driver gene mutations have been identified in lung cancer. Among them, human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) was identified in approximately 2% of non-small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancers. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2&#xD;
      receptors. This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label phase II study, designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with thalidomide in advanced non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer patients with HER2 exon 20 insertions.&#xD;
