      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex heterogeneous autoimmune disease with a wide&#xD;
      variety of clinical and serological manifestations that may affect any organ. Vasculitis&#xD;
      prevalence in SLE is reported to be between 11% and 36%. A diverse clinical spectrum, due to&#xD;
      inflammatory involvement of vessels of all sizes, is present. Even though cutaneous lesions,&#xD;
      representing small vessel involvement, are the most frequent, medium and large vessel&#xD;
      vasculitis may present with visceral affection, with life-threatening manifestations such as&#xD;
      mesenteric vasculitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, or mononeuritis multiplex, with detrimental&#xD;
      consequences. Early recognition and an appropriate treatment are crucial. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that vasculitis in patients with SLE may present different clinical forms based on the&#xD;
      organ involved and the size of the affected vessel. It is noteworthy that the episodes of&#xD;
      vasculitis are not always accompanied by high disease activity. Recent articles on this topic&#xD;
      have focused on new treatments for the control of vascular disease, such as biological&#xD;
      therapies such as Rituximab and Belimumab, among others.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Affected individuals age greater than or equal to 9 years with no upper age limit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy Volunteers (non-related) age greater than or equal to 18 with no upper age&#xD;
             limit&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medical problems which would confound the interpretation of studies&#xD;
             gathered by this protocol. Included in this is the presence of HIV in the blood,&#xD;
             active malignancies, or other significant medical conditions that may interferes with&#xD;
             interpretation of some lupus studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medical, surgical or other conditions for which inadequate facilities are&#xD;
             available to support their care at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;

        physical limitations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any comorbidity of medical or psychological/psychiatric condition or treatment after&#xD;
             reviewing of patients previous or outside medical records, that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator, would exclude the subjects from the research studies (e.g.&#xD;

             intercurrent change in medical condition or medications. Subjects meeting this&#xD;
             exclusion criterion may still be included in the study but will not be exposed to the&#xD;
