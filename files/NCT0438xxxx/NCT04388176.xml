    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over phase 2 trial&#xD;
      investigating the effect of C21 on cold-induced vasoconstriction in subjects with Raynaud's&#xD;
      phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis. The purpose of the trial is to achieve a&#xD;
      vasodilatory effect in subjects with Raynaud's phenomenon by stimulation of the AT2R with&#xD;
      C21.&#xD;
