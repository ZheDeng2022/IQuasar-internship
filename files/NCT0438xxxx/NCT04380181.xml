  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study is based on the observation that management of the cardiopulmonary by-pass&#xD;
      withdrawal in pediatric heart surgery is quite variable between medical teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, in our center (HUDERF), the most common inotropic plan is dobutamine only or&#xD;
      combination of milrinone and adrenalin but their uses seem to be very anesthesiologist&#xD;
      dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the lack of sufficient evidence, the choice is probably multi-factorial, based mainly&#xD;
      on the inotrope pharmacology, the patient physiopathology and the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if one of these inotropic strategy (dobutamine VS&#xD;
      milrinone + adrenaline) is better compared to the other in terms of morbi-mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do that, the investigators will realize a retrospective study based on files from&#xD;
      January 2008 to December 2018 concerning 250 selected patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As use of inotropes is highly variable between anesthesiologists, the investigators want to&#xD;
      study if the choice of the inotropic drugs have an impact on morbid-mortality in paediatric&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will retrospectively review the files from patients operated from january&#xD;
      2008 to December 2018. The investigators will concentrate on high risk patients defined as&#xD;
      age ≤ 1 year, RACHS score ≥ 3 and complex heart surgery (Switch procedure, atrioventricular&#xD;
      canal defect, aortic coarctation or aortic arch interruption, truncus arteriosus, mitral&#xD;
      valvuloplasty). The investigators aim for a study population of about 250 patients. Primary&#xD;
      outcome will be MODS score defined by death or 2 organ dysfunction (circulatory, respiratory&#xD;
      or renal failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One propensity score will be performed on two groups: Dobu and Milri. After 15 multiple&#xD;
      imputations of the datasets using the mice R package, the CBPS R package will be used to&#xD;
      perform the propensity score, estimating an Average Treatment Effect (ATE), using covariate&#xD;
      balancing and requesting an exact match, which has been showed to be superior to traditional&#xD;
      logistic regression approaches and boosted classification and regression trees . An absolute&#xD;
      standardized difference less than 10-15% will be considered to support the assumption of&#xD;
      balance between the groups because it is not affected by the sample size, unlike P-values,&#xD;
      and it may be used to compare the relative balance of variables measured in different units.&#xD;
      The mean and standard deviation obtained after matching for continuous variables, and the&#xD;
      percentage for categorical variables will be presented. After the propensity score, the&#xD;
      investigators will use the survey R package to perform logistic regressions for binary&#xD;
      outcome variables and linear regressions for continuous outcomes, which will include the&#xD;
      treatment group effect, the weight resulting from the matching and variables present in the&#xD;
      propensity score in order to obtain a doubly-robust estimator which will correct the last&#xD;
      remaining possible imbalance between the covariates and produces an unbiased treatment&#xD;
      effect. The survey R package includes the Huber-White corrected standard errors, which&#xD;
      maintains the standard errors unbiased even under heterogeneity of the residuals. Last, the&#xD;
      advantage of a doubly-robust estimator is that it needs only one of the two models&#xD;
      (propensity score and logistic regression after the propensity score) to be correctly&#xD;
      specified. The so-called 'within approach', that is averaging the treatment effects on the 15&#xD;
      logistic and linear regressions has been showed to produce less biased estimates than the&#xD;
      'Across approach' - that is, performing linear or logistic regressions on averaged imputed&#xD;
      matched datasets - especially when missing data is related to the treatment group. The R&#xD;
      software (R Core Team, 2019), version 3.6.2. will be used to produce the results.&#xD;
