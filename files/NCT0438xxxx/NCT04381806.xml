  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RDT aims to take advantage of the relatively safer toxicity profiles of both lower dose&#xD;
      radiation therapy and systemic ALA to treat non-superficial lesions in a manner similar to&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy. The doses of radiation administered in this study will be lower than&#xD;
      those typically used to treat cancer. However, with administration of ALA, which has been&#xD;
      shown to be selectively concentrated in neoplastic cells, it is reasonable to expect&#xD;
      responses in the target lesion(s) with relative sparing of nearby normal structures. A&#xD;
      similar therapy is currently being used in a single institution in China. Members of the Fox&#xD;
      Chase Cancer Center have visited the Chinese medical site multiple times and have gained&#xD;
      first-hand experience with this therapy. Based on thus-far unpublished data, this treatment&#xD;
      appears to be both safe and well-tolerated. There have been marked responses seen in some of&#xD;
      these patients, but this therapy has not yet been investigated in a more formalized clinical&#xD;
      trial setting, nor has it been used on Western patients. Thus, while these findings are&#xD;
      encouraging, much work is necessary to determine the efficacy and role of this intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase 1, open label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) or recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of both ALA and RT. Once the MTDs are identified, the cohort providing the highest dose intensity at or below the MTD (if supported by emerging PK and biomarker data) will be selected for an expansion phase for the purpose of refining the safety assessment and assessing preliminary efficacy. The initial dose escalation phase will enroll at least 20 patients across a variety of tumor types, after which concurrent disease site-specific expansion cohorts will accrue, each consisting of 20 patients. Anatomic site-specific cohorts will include patients with symptomatic metastatic disease to specific anatomic regions, where varying toxicity may be expected (Head and Neck, Thorax and Abdomen/Pelvis).</intervention_model_description>

             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
