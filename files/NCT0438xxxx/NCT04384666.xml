    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, 2-sequence, 2-treatment cross-over study in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects. Rotigotine PK profiles will be obtained from all subjects after both a single dose&#xD;
      of 28 mg LY03003 and 1 week of 4 mg q24h NEUPRO® patch. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1&#xD;
      of the 2 treatment sequences.&#xD;

      Sequence 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will check into the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day 0. On Day 1, subjects will&#xD;
      receive the first 4 mg NEUPRO® patch in the morning. On Days 2 to 7, subjects will receive a&#xD;
      4- mg NEUPRO® patch every 24 hours (+/- 30 minutes) on one of the 7 designated patch&#xD;
      application sites (see Section 12.2). On Day 1, serial PK samples will be collected within 30&#xD;
      minutes prior to patch application and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 hours post patch application. On&#xD;
      Days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, one PK sample will be collected pre-patch (&lt;30 minutes pre-patch)&#xD;
      application only. On Day 7, the subjects will receive the NEUPRO® patch and serial PK samples&#xD;
      will be collected pre-patch (&lt;30 mins pre-patch) application and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20,&#xD;
      24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, and 48 hours post-patch application Subject will stay at CRU till Day&#xD;
      14 to complete the End of Treatment ( EOT) procedures and prepare for the LY03003 treatment&#xD;
      in Period 2 on the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 in the morning, subjects will receive a single-dose IM injection of 28 mg LY03003.&#xD;
      Serial PK samples will be collected within 30 minutes pre-dosing and at 0.5, 1, 6, and 12&#xD;
      hours post dosing on Day 1. On Days 2 to Day 8, Day 10, Day 12, Day 15, Day 17, and Day 22,&#xD;
      one single post-dose PK sample will be collected at the following corresponding hours: 24,&#xD;
      48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 216, 264, 336, 384, and 504 hours post dosing. Subjects will stay&#xD;
      at CRU till Day 22 to have PK collected and EOT activities completed. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged on the same day. A 7-day safety follow-up period will be followed with a call on&#xD;
      Day 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence 2 Period 1 Subjects will check into the CRU on Day 0. In the morning of Day 1,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single-dose IM injection of 28 mg LY03003. Serial PK samples will be&#xD;
      collected within 30 minutes pre-dosing and at 0.5, 1, 6 and 12 hours post dosing on Day 1. On&#xD;

      sample will be collected at the following corresponding hours: 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168,&#xD;
      216, 264, 336, 384, and 504 hours post dosing. On Day 22, Subjects will have PK samples&#xD;
      collected and EOT activities completed. Subjects will stay at the CRU until Day 29 and&#xD;
      complete a 7-day washout period and to prepare for NEUPRO® patch treatment in Period 2 on the&#xD;
      next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2 On Day 1, subjects will receive the first 4 mg NEUPRO® patch in the morning. On Days&#xD;
      2 to 7, subjects will receive a 4- mg NEUPRO® patch every 24 hours (+/- 30 mins) on one of&#xD;
      the 7 designated patch application sites (see Section 12.2). On Day 1, serial PK samples will&#xD;
      be collected within 30 minutes prior to patch application and 2,4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours&#xD;
      post patch application. On Days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, one PK sample will be collected pre-patch&#xD;
      (&lt;30 minutes pre-patch) application only. On Day 7, the subjects will receive the NEUPRO®&#xD;
      patch and serial PK samples will be collected pre-patch (&lt;30 minutes pre-patch) application&#xD;
      and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, and 48 hours post-patch application.&#xD;
      Subjects will stay at CRU and continue the safety follow-up period until Day14. On Day 14,&#xD;
      subjects will complete EOT activities, followed by being discharged from the study on the&#xD;
