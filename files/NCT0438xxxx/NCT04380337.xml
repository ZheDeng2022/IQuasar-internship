  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to evaluate whether both chemotherapy and radiotherapy can&#xD;
      lead to higher rates of clinical complete response leading to organ preservation in human&#xD;
      subjects with cancer. The objective is to learn if this treatment approach may safely be used&#xD;
      as an alternative to the standard treatment for rectal cancer and to know the quality-of-life&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To assess clinical complete response of an organ preservation approach&#xD;
      using short course radiation followed by intensified chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To assess safety in all enrolled patients, local regrowth rate and other&#xD;
      cancer specific outcomes (metastasis-free survival, colostomy-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival), longitudinal health-related quality of life of this organ preservation approach&#xD;
