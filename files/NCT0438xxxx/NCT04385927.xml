  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of neurodiverse children are more likely to experience traumatic events related to&#xD;
      the care of their child/children. This increases the probability to experience Posttraumatic&#xD;
      Stress Injury (PTSI). However, interventions addressing PTSI symptoms in parents are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project the study investigators will test the feasibility and efficacy of&#xD;
      e-NET, a distance-delivered, exposure-based intervention for PTSI adapted to the needs of&#xD;
      parents of neurodiverse children. E-NET is an adapted version of the Narrative Exposure&#xD;
      Therapy (NET), an evidence-based intervention approach for individuals with PTSI who have&#xD;
      experienced repeated or continuous trauma. The intervention will be conducted via&#xD;
      videoconferencing with trained paraprofessionals. During the intervention a narrative of both&#xD;
      positive and negative (traumatic) experiences in the parents' life will be created. The&#xD;
      intervention contains approx. 12 one-on-one sessions with a trained paraprofessional via&#xD;
      videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a waitlist control group design. Approx. 20 participants will receive&#xD;
      e-NET directly after the baseline survey and 20 participants will receive e-NET approx. 3&#xD;
      months after the baseline survey. To test the efficacy of the intervention, participants will&#xD;
      fill out surveys about PTSI and other mental health symptoms before, directly after, and 2&#xD;
      and 6 months after the intervention. Adverse events and distress will be assessed in every&#xD;
      session. As part of the baseline, participants will complete the survey &quot;Surviving and&#xD;
      Thriving in Parenting Neurodiverse Children&quot; to determine their eligibility for the&#xD;
      intervention. Main eligibility criterion is the presence of PTSI symptoms.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post- intervention, 2 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms are measured with the PTSD Checklist - 5 (PCL-5). Respondents are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each of 20 items in the past month on a 5- point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total severity score. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome</description>

    <measure>Parent-child Relationship</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Wait list Baseline; Immediately Post intervention; 2 month follow up; 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The parent-child relationship will be measured with the Parent and Family Adjustment Scales (PAFAS). Items are rated from 0 to 3. Note that shaded items in the scoring key below must be reverse scored (i.e. 0=3, 1=2, 2=1, 3=0) before summing the Total Score. High scores indicate worse outcome.</description>
