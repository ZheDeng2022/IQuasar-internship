  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the administration of Toripalimab (anti-PD-1 antibody,&#xD;
      JS001) combined to metronomic Vinorelbine may be an interesting therapeutic option for female&#xD;
      patients with HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The approach suggested here is to deplete and&#xD;
      active the immune response of these patients. The combination of Toripalimab and Vinorelbine&#xD;
      would provide a higher gain in anti-tumor response in these patients than in those with&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators proposal is to conduct a multicentric, single arm, Phase II trial in HER2-&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancer, aiming to evaluate the clinical activity of the&#xD;
      combination therapy Toripalimab + metronomic Vinorelbine. Patients will receive Vinorelbine&#xD;
      (40 mg/day, tiw, per os) and Toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks, intravenously [IV]). The&#xD;
      adverse events of the two drugs are well known.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both study drugs will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical&#xD;
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease&#xD;
      progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic&#xD;
      data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;

          -  Previous treated by oral NVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before the beginning of&#xD;
             treatment with study drug. Less than 30 days since receipt of any other&#xD;
             investigational product or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drug.&#xD;
