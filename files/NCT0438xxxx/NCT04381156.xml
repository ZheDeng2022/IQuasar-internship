      In this Pilot study, the potential of noncoding RNAs in renal recovery from acute kidney&#xD;
      injury will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in almost 50% of patients treated in intensive care units.&#xD;
      AKI mainly occurs after sepsis, acute ischemia, nephrotoxicity or hypoxia and leads to severe&#xD;
      damage of the kidney and to an increased risk of mortality. The diagnosis of AKI is currently&#xD;
      based on creatinine, urea and diuresis. Yet, novel markers may improve the accuracy of this&#xD;
      diagnosis at an early stage of the disease, thereby allowing for early prevention and&#xD;
      therapy, ultimately leading to a reduction of the need for renal replacement therapy and&#xD;
      decreased mortality. Several potential biomarkers have been examined in the context of AKI in&#xD;
      the last years [e. g. Cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor, NGAL (neutrophil&#xD;
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin), KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule 1), and IGFBP7 (insulin like&#xD;
      growth factor binding protein 7) and TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These biomarkers may help to identify AKI earlier and more reliable in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recovery of renal function during/after AKI is not predictable with the classical&#xD;
      biomarkers creatinine and urea. Only a few studies have analyzed the potential of several new&#xD;
      biomarkers in the prediction of renal recovery during AKI including urinary hepatocyte growth&#xD;
      factor (uHGF), urinary IGFBP- 7 and TIMP-2 or NGAL. Still, their ability to predict renal&#xD;
      recovery remains unclear and in clinical practice, recovery of renal function is estimated&#xD;
      empirically including the decision to discontinue renal replacement therapy. In a consensus&#xD;
      statement from 2017 on behalf of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative Workgroup 16 it is&#xD;
      stated that more research is needed to &quot;determine optimal methods to assess functional&#xD;
      recovery and identify novel biomarker(s) [...] that can inform ongoing injury and repair in&#xD;
      AKD&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ncRNA in renal recovery study we therefore aim to analyze the potential of microRNAs&#xD;
      (miRNAs) and circular RNA (circRNAs) in predicting recovery of renal function in critically&#xD;
      ill patients suffering from AKI. Non-coding RNAs emerged during the past few years as&#xD;
      important regulatory molecules that allow a fine-tuning of gene expression and protein&#xD;
      synthesis. This regulation is necessary to maintain homeostasis and its dysregulation is&#xD;
      often associated with disease development. Non-coding RNAs are present in the kidney and in&#xD;
      body fluids and their expression is modulated during AKI and their potential as biomarkers in&#xD;
      various diseases has been shown. As ncRNAs are involved in injury and repair of kidneys, they&#xD;
      may represent an interesting class of molecules with a potential as biomarkers and&#xD;
      therapeutic targets in recovery from AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be collected at 4 different time points (day 0, day 1, day 2 and&#xD;
      day 7). Plasma miRNAs will be screened for differential miRNA expression by next generation&#xD;
      sequencing (5 patients with early recovery versus 5 patients with no signs of recovery).&#xD;
      Differentially expressed miRNAs will then be analyzed by qPCR in plasma and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is aimed to better understand the pathophysiological basis of recovery&#xD;
      from AKI and may form the basis of further studies for biomarker and therapeutics research in&#xD;
      renal recovery.&#xD;
