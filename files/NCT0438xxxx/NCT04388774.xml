  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2A, single dose, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of a low-dose, 40-minute infusion into the veins (intravenous infusion or &quot;IV&quot;) of&#xD;
      ketamine in children with ADNP syndrome (Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein). The&#xD;
      study team will enroll 10 participants, ages 5 to 12, at Mount Sinai. The study participation&#xD;
      is expected to last 4 weeks and will include 5 scheduled clinic visits in order to complete&#xD;
      safety monitoring, clinical assessments, and biomarker collection. At the conclusion of this&#xD;
      study, the study team expects to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of low-dose ketamine&#xD;
      in children with ADNP syndrome. Additionally, the study team anticipates identifying&#xD;
      meaningful signals of efficacy in clinical outcome measures using RNA and DNA sequencing to&#xD;
      analyze ADNP protein expression and DNA methylation profiles, a natural process by which&#xD;
      methyl groups are added to the DNA to change its activity, in order to assess sensitivity to&#xD;
      change with low-dose ketamine treatment and inform future phase 3 studies. Ketamine is not&#xD;
      currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat this syndrome, but it is&#xD;
      approved for use in children in other situations, for example in anesthesia.&#xD;

    <measure>The Systematic Longitudinal Assessment of Adverse Events (SLAES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scale at weeks 1, 2, and 4 compared to baseline. The Systematic Longitudinal Assessment of Adverse Events (SLAES) is a comprehensive form that assesses medical and behavioral conditions that were present at screening and/or baseline. Conditions are considered treatment emergent if their severity increased significantly after the participant had taken at least one dose of the study treatment. Treatment emergent adverse events will be tracked considered in the adverse event safety analysis. Severity of adverse events are categorized as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or resulting in death and the treating physician indicates if the adverse event was related or unrelated to study drug.</description>
