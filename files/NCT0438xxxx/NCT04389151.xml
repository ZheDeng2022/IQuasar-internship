  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2019NCCN guidelines, immunocheckpoint inhibitors are recommended for&#xD;
      first-line treatment of metastatic colon cancer patients with high microsatellite instability&#xD;
      (msi-h) or mismatched gene deletion (dMMR) who are not suitable for intensive treatment, and&#xD;
      for all patients with second-line or above msi-h /dMMR treatment.This study is a&#xD;
      single-center, single-arm phase II study of the use of triplezumab (JS001) combined with&#xD;
      CAPEOX regimen in the neoadjuvant therapy of msi-h /dMMR for locally advanced colon cancer.&#xD;
      The subjects received neoadjuvant therapy with triplezumab (JS001) combined with CAPEOX&#xD;
      regimen, with one treatment cycle every 3 weeks and two cycles of surgery followed by&#xD;
      pathological evaluation.&#xD;
