      Background: Keratoconus leads to gradual progressive loss of vision in young and adult&#xD;
      patients. For visual rehabilitation and to hinder keratoconus progressionthe investigators&#xD;
      designed this study to help the keratoconus patients to improve and stabilize their vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective consecutive uncontrolled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes 36 eyes of 36 patients with moderate degree o keratoconus (KC) undergoing&#xD;
      combined wave front guided transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TPRK) and accelerated&#xD;
      corneal collagen crosslinking (ACXL) after intracorneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation.&#xD;
      Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest&#xD;
      refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), corneal indices based on Scheimpflug tomography,&#xD;
      higher-order aberrations (HOAs) will be evaluated at baseline, after ICRS implantation, and&#xD;
      at1, 3, 6, and 12 months after combined TPRK and CXL.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study conducted upon 36 eyes of 36 patients with moderate keratoconus who undergoing&#xD;
      combined corneal wavefront-guided TPRK and accelerated corneal CXL at least 3 months after&#xD;
      ICRS implantation in the period between October, 2018 and April 2020, at the Security Forces&#xD;
      Hospital, Ophthalmology Department, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study was approved&#xD;
      by SFHP ethical board committee (IRB registraion number: 18-289-54) and was adhered to the&#xD;
      tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki as well as followed good clinical practices. All&#xD;
      patients provided informed written consent for the study and for publication. All included&#xD;
      patients undergoing combined corneal wavefront guided TPRK and corneal ACXL at least 3 months&#xD;
      after ICRS implantation. Grading of keratoconus was based on the Amsler Krumeich&#xD;
      classification. Progression was defined as one or more of the following changes over a period&#xD;
      of 6 months: an increase of ≥1.00 diopter (D) in maximal keratometry values, an increase of&#xD;
      ≥1.00 D in manifest cylinder, and an increase of ≥ 0.50 D in MRSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations and measurements:- At baseline, the preoperative examination included UDVA,&#xD;
      CDVA, manifest and cycloplegic refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry, Pentacam&#xD;
      camera, tomography, and dilated fundus examination using binocular ophthalmoscopy. If patient&#xD;
      use contact lenses it should be stopped 3 weeks before exam date, and medical history,&#xD;
      including any systemic diseases, were recorded. After ICRS implantation (before combined TPRK&#xD;
      and ACXL), and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after combined TPRK and CXL, all patients undergoing&#xD;
      complete ophthalmic examinations, which included examinations for UDVA and CDVA with a&#xD;
      Snellen chart, manifest refraction (MR). The corneal indices measured at the 8-mm zone using&#xD;
      the Scheimpflug tomography system with Pentacam camera (OCULUS- Netzteil Art., Pentacam HR,&#xD;
      Germany), and for measuring changes in corneal aberrations, including HOAs, coma, and&#xD;
      spherical aberrations, corneal wavefront analysis implemented using corneal topographic data&#xD;
      with tomography (Sirius, SCHWIND eye-tech-solutions GmbH, Kleinostheim, Germany). Root mean&#xD;
      square (RMS) values of the corneal HOAs, with analysis up to the 7th order by expanding the&#xD;
      set of Zernike polynomials, were calculated. Any postoperative complications, corneal haze ,&#xD;
      wound healing time were estimated. Patients overall satisfaction for the procedure were asked&#xD;
      at last follow up and all data were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      First step procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgery, tetracaine hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic solution (Bausch &amp; Lomb, Minims)&#xD;
      and moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox, Alcon Co.) drops were instilled 3 times within a 5-minutes&#xD;
      interval. The eyelids were prepared with antiseptic Chlorohexidine Gluconate 0.05% solution&#xD;
      (Saudi Medical Solution Company). All patients undergoing femtosecond laser enabled ICRS&#xD;
      implantation. An Intacs SK intra-corneal ring (6.0 mm optical zone; fixed arc length of 150∘;&#xD;
      angulation 30∘) was implanted in the cornea. The ring segment thickness sizes were decided&#xD;
      according to the nomogram provided by the manufacturer. The incision was placed at the&#xD;
      steepest meridian and the depth of the ring tunel was set at 75-80% of the thinnest&#xD;
      pachymetry reading. After surgery, a bandage contact lens (BIOMEDICS Evolution CL ocufilcon D&#xD;
      45%, water 55%) was placed to be removed after incision healing. Postoperative use of&#xD;
      moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox, Alcon Co.) eye drops 4 times/ day for two weeks, tobradex eye&#xD;
      drops (Tobramycin 0.3%- dexamethasone 0.1%, Alcon Co.) with tapering dose for 1 month, and&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate 0.2% ( Hyfresh eye drops, Jamjoom Pharma Co.) eye drops QID for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second step procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least 3 months with average 3.9 ± 2.2 and range (3-5) months from the ICRS&#xD;
      implantation and when the mean keratometry stabilized and not decreased &gt; 1 diopter from the&#xD;
      previous visit, all patients were scheduled for combined corneal wavefront-guided TPRK and&#xD;
      accelerated CXL. TPRK between the corneal ring segments were performed using Amaris excimer&#xD;
      LASER 193 nm, version 750 S (Schwind eye-tech-solutions GmbH&amp; Co. KG, Mainparkstrasse,&#xD;
      Kleinostheim, Germany. The ablation profile was planned using the integrated Optimized&#xD;
      Refractive Keratectomy-Custom Ablation Manager software (Schwind eye-tech-solutions GmbH and&#xD;
      Co KG). Using this software, ablation was planned based on clinical parameters, including&#xD;
      manifest refraction, pachymetry, and corneal wavefront data (up to the 7th order aberrations)&#xD;
      and topography obtained with the Sirius topographer. The maximum ablation depth was limited&#xD;
      to ( 50- 60 micro m), and then mitomycin C 0.02% (MMC) was applied for 20 seconds to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative haze followed by eye irrigation with balanced saline solution (BSS). Riboflavin&#xD;
      0.1 % with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Vibex Rapid; Avedro Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) is&#xD;
      soaked onto the corneal surface for 10 minutes immediately after excimer laser ablation.&#xD;
      Riboflavin solution were added at 2 minutes interval during the soaking process after which&#xD;
      the eye was irrigated with cold BSS. After completion of soaking, Ultra viollet A exposure&#xD;
      (wavelength: 365 nm) was performed for 10 minutes at an irradiance of 9 mW/cm², to give a&#xD;
      total radiant exposure of 5.4 J/cm² and intermittent riboflavin drops application during&#xD;
      radiant exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery a bandage contact lens was placed, and the same previous&#xD;
      postoperative medications were used beside pain keller oral tablet was perscribed if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:- The investigators recorded all patients' data in Microsoft Excel&#xD;
      Sheet, then copied and analyzed using A Graph Pad Prism 8 program; Paired student's t-test&#xD;
      was used for the UDVA &amp; CDVA means in log MAR values and for MRSE means. One way ANOVA was&#xD;
      used for corneal indices. For all tests, a (P value &lt; 0.05) was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
