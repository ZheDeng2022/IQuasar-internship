  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical study to demonstrate a reduction in jowling and laxity of the&#xD;
      jawline that can be achieved following facial volume enhancement using Juvederm Voluma. The&#xD;
      secondary measure will be if this can be achieved with Jawline injection only, or if a&#xD;
      superior result can be obtained with both cheek and jowl injection.&#xD;

      This study is proposed to evaluate the best protocol for achieving improvement in the sagging&#xD;
      jawline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC will be injected in each of 16 women with sagging of grades 1-3 using a&#xD;
      published jawline evaluation scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Group 1: JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected&#xD;
      into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular area) (the latter area will be&#xD;
      added if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl attenuation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Group 2: JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-3 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected&#xD;
      into the lateral cheek (zygomatic) area plus JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe&#xD;
      is 1 cc) will be injected into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular&#xD;
      area) (the latter area will be added if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl&#xD;
      attenuation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution photographs from multiple angles will be taken in identical lighting and&#xD;
      position with the VISIA CR and with the Fotofinder at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Additional&#xD;
      real-time video telemedicine visits will take place at 6 months and 12 months. In addition, a&#xD;
      72-hour safety phone call will be completed with the subject after each injection session.&#xD;
      All visit timing will be based on the last injection session. 2 blinded dermatologists will&#xD;
      rate the patient's severity of jowling based on the Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) (1) at the 2-&#xD;
      and 4-week visits. The patient will also rate their jowling based on the JRS as well as their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the procedure.&#xD;
