    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lot consistency, immunogenicity and safety of&#xD;
      three lots of Sabin strain inactivated polio vaccine (Vero Cell) (sIPV) manufactured at&#xD;
      commercial scale by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., and evaluate the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      investigational vaccine against a post-market inactivated polio vaccine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, and positive-controlled clinical trial. A total&#xD;
      of 1300 infants aged 2 months will be enrolled and assigned to 4 groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:1&#xD;
      to receive vaccination of 3 lots of investigational sIPV and control IPV manufactured by&#xD;
      Sanofi Pasteur S.A respectively. Each subjects should finish the three-doses primary&#xD;
      vaccination at the schedule of 2,3,4 months of age. Thirty-days safety observation after each&#xD;
      dose of vaccination will be carried out. Venous blood should be collected from all the&#xD;
      subjects before and 30 days after the three-doses primary vaccination, for the neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody assay, and further to evaluate the immunogenicity.&#xD;
