      Exercise is an important factor in bone health. Sclerostin is one of the key molecules&#xD;
      involved in bone response to mechanical loading. In particular, sclerostin decreases bone&#xD;
      formation directly through the inhibition of Wnt/ β-catenin signaling and increases bone&#xD;
      resorption indirectly via upregulation of the RANK/RANKL. The Wnt pathway is an anabolic&#xD;
      signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of osteoblasts. OPG is another osteokine&#xD;
      secreted by osteoblasts and osteogenic stomal cells that has a protective osteogenic role in&#xD;
      humans by inhibiting the binding of RANKL to its receptor RANK. The RANK/RANKL pathway is a&#xD;
      catabolic signaling pathway controlling osteoclast differentiation. Only a few studies have&#xD;
      examined the effects of one single bout of high impact exercise on serum sclerostin levels in&#xD;
      adults, most of which are from the investigators' lab. However, not many studies have&#xD;
      examined the acute effects of moderate intensity, low-impact exercise on osteokines of the&#xD;
      Wnt signaling. Previous studies have only investigated the impact of high intensity cycling&#xD;
      on sclerostin, OPG and RANKL, however, no research has been done to investigate the response&#xD;
      of osteokines to moderate intensity continuous cycling. This study aims to investigate&#xD;
      differences in osteokines and markers of bone turnover following three moderate intensity&#xD;
      cycling trials of different duration (30, 60 and 120 min) in an energy replete state. The&#xD;
      question we aim to answer is whether there is a threshold of time where continued stimulus&#xD;
      from moderate strain on the bone fails to elicit an additional metabolic response in bone or&#xD;
      even becomes osteocatabolic, when athletes are in an energy replete state. Additional&#xD;
      biochemical responses to the exercise will also be examined including inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      glucose, anabolic/hormonal markers and oxidative stress.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise has been shown to positively benefit bone health. It's well documented that an acute&#xD;
      bout of weight bearing, high load and dynamic strain on the skeleton mobilizes markers of&#xD;
      bone formation in normal weight males and females. Acute bouts of low-impact high intensity&#xD;
      exercise such as cycling, have also been investigated for their effects on bone formation and&#xD;
      resorption, showing an overall anabolic effect (Mezil et al. 2015). One study exists&#xD;
      investigating an acute two-hour bout of moderate intensity cycling, which showed increases in&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone, associated with bone metabolism, although the effects of these transient&#xD;
      hormonal changes on bone remain unknown (Barry &amp; Kohrt, 2007). Minimal research has&#xD;
      investigated the effects of acute bouts of moderate intensity continuous cycling (70% of VO2&#xD;
      max) on bone metabolism. In contrast to these acute controlled studies, at least two studies&#xD;
      have reported that athletes who regularly participate in non-weight bearing sports such as&#xD;
      cycling present with higher rates of osteopenia in the lumbar spine and hip region (Rector et&#xD;
      al. 2008; Sherk et al. 2013). Another study investigated the bone status of adolescent male&#xD;
      cyclists, over 17 and under 17 years of age, compared to healthy age matched controls.&#xD;
      Cyclists had lower BMD at the legs, pelvis, and total hip. In cyclists over 17, reported BMD&#xD;
      was 8.9% to 24.5% lower for the whole body, pelvis, femoral hip and legs, suggesting cycling&#xD;
      performed during adolescent years may negatively affects bone health and one's ability to&#xD;
      reach peak bone mass during this critical time (Olmedillas et al. 2011). However, a small&#xD;
      study investigating 5 male elite racers during a 6-day road cycling stage race, while meeting&#xD;
      energy needs, showed an increase markers of bone formation and a decrease in markers of bone&#xD;
      resorption (Hinton et al. 2010). Thus, the evidence provided above appears contradictory. On&#xD;
      the one hand, an acute bout of high intensity cycling has an osteogenic effect on bone, while&#xD;
      longer-term studies or observational data, which allow for the time required to see changes&#xD;
      in BMD, appear to show that road cycling can also have an osteocatabolic effect on bone&#xD;
      (Olmedillas et al. 2012). This contradiction raises interesting questions about the impacts&#xD;
      of larger loads of cycling, energy intakes, as well as the impacts of longer durations of&#xD;
      cycling on bone health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There appear to be conditions related to the sport of road cycling, not specific to the&#xD;
      mechanics of cycling itself, that can predispose an athlete to low BMD over time. These&#xD;
      conditions remain unclear. Possible factors contributing to the lower BMD found in cyclists&#xD;
      include low energy availability and its associated hormonal and nutritional implications,&#xD;
      carbohydrate availability, the omission of weight bearing loads due to long hours spent&#xD;
      performing non-weight cycling, weight loss, as well as excess calcium losses through sweat&#xD;
      and urine. Recent studies have also provided evidence of the importance of consuming&#xD;
      carbohydrates in attenuating markers bone resorption and supporting bone health during&#xD;
      exercise (Heikura et al. 2019). Of interest, is the fact that gymnasts, athletes who also&#xD;
      often train under conditions of low energy availability, appear to gain a protective effect&#xD;
      from their high impact sport, that overrides the bone resorption typically associated with&#xD;
      calorie deficits. The high mechanical forces in this sport have large osteogenic effects,&#xD;
      maintaining BMD, unlike what has been observed in cyclists (Robinson et al. 1995). This makes&#xD;
      one question if it is the non-weight bearing nature of cycling, certain conditions&#xD;
      surrounding cycling or something inherent to the mechanical aspects of cycling itself, that&#xD;
      have a seemingly negative impact on bone?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, researchers have investigated the effects of an acute bout of high intensity cycling&#xD;
      on markers of bone formation and resorption, as well as moderate intensity cycling and its&#xD;
      effects on bone. Field studies have been executed where energy needs have been met and where&#xD;
      energy deficiency was present. There is a gap in the research as far as the impact of&#xD;
      duration of moderate intensity cycling on bone, in an energy replete state, in a controlled&#xD;
      setting. Filling this gap through a systematic approach would help to better understand if&#xD;
      and how duration impacts the metabolic bone response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a variety of methods to measure the bone's response to acute mechanical loading.&#xD;
      Since changes in BMD are not immediate, and only occur over longer time periods, this&#xD;
      measurement is not appropriate to use to investigate changes in bone metabolism after one&#xD;
      acute bout of exercise. After an acute bout of exercise, it is common to measure circulating&#xD;
      bone turnover markers. These markers are products of bone formation or resorption. There are&#xD;
      a variety of bone turnover markers, however some of the more commonly used are procollagen I&#xD;
      intact N-terminal (PINP) and C-terminal crosslinking telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX),&#xD;
      which are recognized by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and are products of&#xD;
      osteoblastic or osteoclastic cell activation, respectively. More recently, bone metabolism&#xD;
      has been investigated through measures of the glycoprotein sclerostin, an inhibitor of the&#xD;
      Wnt pathway, which leads to decreased bone formation. The Wnt/β-catenin signalling process&#xD;
      has influence on the mobilization of OPG (Osteoprotegerin). OPG binds to receptor activator&#xD;
      of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL), preventing RANKL from binding to RANK (an&#xD;
      osteoclast cell surface receptor), acting as a decoy receptor. RANKL binding to RANK would&#xD;
      otherwise increase bone resorption. Therefore, the two pathways, Wnt-B-catenin and OPG/RANKL&#xD;
      have a relationship that can help us to better understand the processes of bone resorption&#xD;
      and formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study aims to investigate differences in markers of bone metabolism (CTX, PINP)&#xD;
      and osteokines (sclerostin, OPG and RANKL) between three moderate intensity cycling trials of&#xD;
      different duration (30, 60 and 120 min) in an energy and carbohydrate replete state. The&#xD;
      question the investigators aim to answer is whether there is a threshold of time where&#xD;
      continued stimulus from moderate strain on the bone fails to elicit an additional metabolic&#xD;
      response in bone or even becomes osteocatabolic, when athletes are in an energy replete&#xD;
      state. Additional biochemical responses to the exercise will also be examined including&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, glucose, anabolic/hormonal markers and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen 20-30-year-old active male participants (sample size calculated based on Mezil et al.&#xD;
      2015) will arrive to the lab on 5 separate occasions. Visit one will include anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and a VO2max test. Participants will fill out a 24-hour food recall before visit&#xD;
      one. Participants will complete one control and three continuous cycling trials (visits 2, 3,&#xD;
      4 and 5) on the cycle ergometer at 60-70% of their respective VO2 max based on their test&#xD;
      from visit 1. The order of exercise sessions will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will follow a balanced diet the day before visits 2 to 5, which will be based on&#xD;
      the participants food log for the 24 hours before visit one. Adjustments will be made to&#xD;
      participants' food log in order to meet the macronutrient composition of 65% CHO, 25% PRO and&#xD;
      15% fat, to assure they arrive at the lab in an energy replete state before visits 2 to 5.&#xD;
      Participants will also be given hydration guidelines for the 24 hours before arriving at the&#xD;
      lab and will be asked to refrain from any vigorous activity for 24 hours before all visits to&#xD;
      the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For visits 2 to 5, participants will arrive at the lab fasted for a resting blood draw&#xD;
      followed by a standard breakfast. Thirty minutes after breakfast, a post-breakfast blood draw&#xD;
      will be taken followed by the respective protocol of the day (control, 30-, 60- or 120-min&#xD;
      cycling). Additional blood samples will be taken as described below. To maintain hydration&#xD;
      during the cycling trials, participants will be provided with 500 ml (for 30 min trial) to 1L&#xD;
      (for the 60 and 120 min trials) of water to drink at libitum. The value of these visits is to&#xD;
      see if there is a change in bone metabolism over time between the control, and three&#xD;
      different cycling duration protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples: During the control session, a total of 7 blood samples will be taken: one upon&#xD;
      arriving to the lab, one post-meal but before the 2-hour control session begins, and five&#xD;
      during the control session at 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 150 min and 180 min. During each&#xD;
      cycling trial, a total of five (5) blood samples from each participant will be collected: one&#xD;
      upon arriving to the lab, one post-meal but before cycling, and 3 post-cycling at 5 minutes,&#xD;
      30 minutes and 60 minutes after completion the cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be drawn using a catheter (IV) performed by a certified paramedic.&#xD;
      Catheterization would be upon subject arriving to the lab, suggest base line vital signs pre&#xD;
      and post IV placement, preferably with subject in a recumbent position for the duration of&#xD;
      assessment and IV placement. IV placement to be preferentially placed in the left or right&#xD;
      forearm (posterior hand if no other sites visible) with a maximum of two IV attempts per&#xD;
      visit. IV insertion to be completed using aseptic procedures as per safety standards. IV&#xD;
      cannula to be secured via tegaderm, hypoallergenic tape and a compliant fishnet style elastic&#xD;
      fabric to provide added protection from displacement during heavy perspiration and movement&#xD;
      of the subject. Cannula would be locked with a saline lock and extension for access during&#xD;
      blood draws (see below for schedule). Each blood draw should use one initial vacutainer as a&#xD;
      waste draw due to saline in the IV lock with the second container being a pure venous sample.&#xD;
      Once sampling is completed, saline is reintroduced at slightly higher pressure into the&#xD;
      saline lock to maintain patency of the cannula for the next draw. Aseptic methods used&#xD;
      throughout each procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will contain 5-10 ml of blood using serum and plasma tubes. Bone turnover&#xD;
      markers, anabolic/hormonal markers, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress will be&#xD;
      examined in each sample. To control for circadian rhythm, the exercise session and related&#xD;
      blood samples will be performed at the same time of day between 9:00 am and 1:00pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Measurements: Height will be assessed using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.1&#xD;
      cm with no shoes. Body mass (kg), relative body fat (%) and fat free mass (kg) will be&#xD;
      measured using Bod Pod (air displacement plethysmography method). All the participants will&#xD;
      have familiarization with Bod Pod by sitting in the chamber before the test to see if they&#xD;
      are claustrophobic. Participants will have the choice of an investigator of the same sex to&#xD;
      take their anthropometric measurements.&#xD;
