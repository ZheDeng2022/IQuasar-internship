    <textblock>
      Patients born with a cleft of the lip and/or palate may have a gap in the bone in the roof of&#xD;
      their mouth and in the area of bone where the teeth develop. These patients require an&#xD;
      alveolar bone graft (ABG) to allow the eruption of the maxillary canine teeth amongst other&#xD;
      reasons. The optimal time to carry this out is between the ages of nine and eleven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the patients will have had interventions as infants, this is often the first procedure&#xD;
      a child born with a cleft lip and/or palate is likely to comprehend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An audio-visual guide has been developed by the Great Ormond Street Hospital Dental&#xD;
      Department for children undergoing an ABG. It explains the reason for the procedure, what the&#xD;
      process will involve and advice regarding postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will try ascertain whether providing information to patients and parents in this&#xD;
      manner reduces anxiety, improves understanding of why the procedure was undertaken and&#xD;
      post-operative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between the ages of eight and twelve ready for this procedure at Great Ormond Street&#xD;
      Hospital will be enrolled. They will be allocated into two groups during their assessment&#xD;
      appointment. The control will be given standardised verbal and written information, whilst&#xD;
      the experimental group will also be given the animation. The level of anxiety and&#xD;
      understanding of the procedure will be measured after the intervention/control information&#xD;
      and once again when the patient attends for their pre-surgical assessment two to three months&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to see whether the patient and parent anxiety is reduced and knowledge&#xD;
      regarding the procedure is improved when utilising this of kind audio-visual guide for&#xD;
      children. This will indicate whether it is worthwhile committing resources to the development&#xD;
      of similar animations for other procedures.&#xD;

      Study Overview This is a single-centre prospective randomised control trial at (Great Ormond&#xD;
      Street Hospital) with concealed allocation. A randomised controlled trial was chosen to allow&#xD;
      equal distribution of confounding factors including age, gender and previous experience of&#xD;
      orthodontic or surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Patients identified by the cleft team as needing an alveolar bone graft are booked&#xD;
      onto joint maxillofacial - orthodontic clinics which run several times a week. The clinical&#xD;
      notes of these clinics will be screened for patients by a member of the study team (who are&#xD;
      also part of the clinical care team) two weeks before a clinic The parents/guardian of&#xD;
      patients identified as meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be called by identified&#xD;
      members of the research team to explain the study. They will seek consent for Patient&#xD;
      Information Sheets (PIS) to be posted to their registered address at least one week before&#xD;
      the appointment date (Appendix D&amp;E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the assessment, children deemed suitable will be invited to participate. The&#xD;
      researcher will go through the PIS verbally in detail allowing the participants to ask any&#xD;
      questions. Verbal and then written consent will be obtained from those willing to&#xD;
      participate. They will be allocated into a control or intervention group using a random&#xD;
      number generator to ensure a randomised and concealed allocation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation has been carried out, using previous studies that have used the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure. 56 children will be recruited accounting for a 20% drop out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;ACE&quot; animation does not reduce the anxiety of patients between the age of eight and&#xD;
      twelve years undergoing an alveolar bone graft (ABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;ACE&quot; animation reduces the anxiety of patients between the age of eight and twelve years&#xD;
      undergoing an alveolar bone graft (ABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention A control group will receive standardised verbal and written information (the&#xD;
      current protocol). The study group will additionally be given the &quot;ACE&quot; animation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control arm will be utilised, so the investigators can ascertain if the animation does make&#xD;
      a difference to the anxiety and understanding of children/adults. As the animation is not&#xD;
      routinely provided to children, this group will not be disadvantaged when compared to our&#xD;
      current practice and patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if the alternative hypothesis is true the control group will be disadvantaged. The&#xD;
      investigators will mitigate this by showing all those in the control group the animation&#xD;
      (during the pre-assessment appointment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure is the State Anxiety Section of State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC -S)- a validated measure of child anxiety (Appendix B).&#xD;
      This will be given to both groups on enrolment (T1) as a baseline. At the end of the&#xD;
      assessment appointment during which participants will have received the control or&#xD;
      intervention they will be asked to fill this questionnaire again (T2). The patient will be&#xD;
      asked to fill this anxiety assessment when they attend for their pre-surgical assessment&#xD;
      which is usually 2-3months later (T3). This will allow us to ascertain whether there is a&#xD;
      short and/or long-term change in anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures will be assessed by the State Anxiety section of State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (Appendix Bii), to be filled in by the parents at the same time points&#xD;
      (T1,T2,T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants and parents of both intervention and control will fill in their&#xD;
      respective parts of a questionnaire that assesses their self-reported understanding of the&#xD;
      procedure (Appendix Ci and Cii). This will happen at time points T2 (end of assessment&#xD;
      appointment) and T3(end of pre-surgical appointment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire has been developed by an expert panel of Consultant Orthodontists,&#xD;
      Restorative Dentists, Paediatric dentists, Maxillofacial and Oral Surgeons and Clinical&#xD;
      Psychologists, followed by a Patient and Public Involvement session with the GOSH London&#xD;
      Young Person's Advisory Group - a group of 8 to 21 year olds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group was invited to recommend changes to the Participant Information Sheets,&#xD;
      Consent/Assent forms and Questionnaires to improve their acceptability and readability. They&#xD;
      were also asked to make changes to the questionnaire to better reflect what they wanted to&#xD;
      know as patients and the public. Changes to the layout and wording were presented to the&#xD;
      Expert panel and broadly accepted. The YPAG voted this project as being the most interesting&#xD;
      and informative of their session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias in the study will be minimised by randomisation and concealed allocation processes.&#xD;
      Patients/parents will be blinded, they will not be told if they are in the control or&#xD;
      intervention group. The Participant Information Sheets do not mention an animation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis This will be undertaken by a statistician independent from the clinical&#xD;
      care team who is blinded to which group is the intervention and the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A narrative description of the protocol is given in Appendix N.&#xD;
