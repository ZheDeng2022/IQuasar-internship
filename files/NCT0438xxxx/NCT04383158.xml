  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-centre randomised controlled pilot study involving 12-24 healthy adult patients for&#xD;
      investigating dental extraction socket healing with and without plasma rich in growth factors&#xD;
      (PRGF) taking place during early days of healing (days 1, 3, 7, 15, 30) and relating the&#xD;
      healing to clinical and histological outcomes after 90 days of healing. Healing will be&#xD;
      investigated by means of various non-invasive imaging technologies (e.g. laser scanners,&#xD;
      thermal cameras, laser cameras) in addition to conventional technologies (e.g. bone core&#xD;
      biopsy, 3D xray images). At 90 days of healing, dental implants will be placed in the healed&#xD;
      sockets and implants will be restored and followed up until 12 months after connecting the&#xD;
      prosthesis to the implant (e.g. implant crown). Dental implant outcomes (e.g. survival,&#xD;
      success) will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      Randomised, controlled, single-centre, prospective, parallel-group qualitative pilot study.&#xD;
      Objectives: the study aims to characterise wound healing events in the dental extraction&#xD;
      socket with and without plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) taking place during early days&#xD;
      of healing after a dental extraction and their relation to clinical and histological outcomes&#xD;
      after 90 days of healing. The early healing events of the post-extraction socket will be&#xD;
      characterized in terms of volumetric changes in relation to intra-oral thermographic changes,&#xD;
      blood flowgraphy, molecular (proteomic) changes, as well as extra-oral integrated geometric&#xD;
      thermographic changes in tandem with clinical measures of soft tissue healing, post-operative&#xD;
      pain assessment. The early healing events will be analysed in relation to volumetric,&#xD;
      clinical and histomorphometric changes of new bone formation after 90 days of healing during&#xD;
      dental implant treatment. Dental Implant outcomes will be evaluated up to 12 months after&#xD;
      loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Overall, we anticipate that the study will last approximately 28 months. We&#xD;
      estimate a 3-month study set-up period, followed by a recruitment period of 6 months. Each&#xD;
      participant will attend 14 visits over approximately 18-19 months. The first 9 visits involve&#xD;
      a dental extraction and follow-up until 90 days after extraction to obtain a bone core biopsy&#xD;
      and dental implant placement. Visits 10 to 14 will be for restoring the dental implant and&#xD;
      evaluating dental implant treatment outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>ENDORET® POST-EXTRACTION ALVEOLUS DENTAL KIT (KMU16) is a system for obtaining plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF), which can be applied in the regeneration of bone and other connective tissues in oral surgery. PRGF is a completely autologous blood platelet concentrate that stimulates tissue regeneration due to enrichment with autologous growth factors, acting as a biological system.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Malocclusion, or collapse of the occlusal vertical dimension leading to dentoalveolar&#xD;

          -  Lack of adjacent sound restored or unrestored teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any male participants with facial hair (such as moustache, beard or any other&#xD;
             variations of facial hair styles) and must keep their face shaven until after the&#xD;
             placement of the dental implant (Visit 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any individuals using Botox or fillers in the face region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients to be enrolled who meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be asked if&#xD;
        they have participated in any other interventional periodontal studies within the last 3&#xD;

        until after 3 months wash-out period has elapsed.&#xD;
