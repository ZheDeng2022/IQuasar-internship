  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal pain management program is needed to control severe pain after abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy which is considered as one of the major abdominal surgeries. Opioids (which are&#xD;
      the analgesic of choice) have many adverse effects such as sedation, nausea, and vomiting.&#xD;
      Hence, different methods are needed to control pain and decrease opioid consumption and its&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block blocks the sensory afferent nerves run between the&#xD;
      abdominal muscles and controls postoperative incisional pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blanco was the first who described the quadratus lumborum block (QLB). Somatic pain after&#xD;
      upper and lower abdominal surgery can be controlled by QLB. QLB can be performed for all&#xD;
      generations (adult, pediatrics, and pregnant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QLB is considered to be an easy technique to learn as it is easy to get the key sonoanatomic&#xD;
      markers for QLB. The novice can learn this block after only a few performance of the&#xD;
      procedure. QLB produces effective postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery,&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery, anterior abdominal wall surgery, and hip and femur surgery. The&#xD;
      analgesic effect of QLB covers 24-48 h. While some authors inserted catheter for continuous&#xD;
      infusion of the local anesthetic drug to extend the duration of postoperative analgesia,&#xD;
      others added dexamethasone to local anesthetic to extend the effect of local anesthetic&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US)-guided Ilioinguinal and Iliohypogastric nerve and TAP block have been&#xD;
      established as analgesic adjuncts for post hernia repair pain management, under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, neuraxial, MAC and infiltration techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US-guided technique of blocking Ilioinguinal and Iliohypogastric nerves have higher success&#xD;
      rate compared to conventional technique. TAP block provides analgesia to the parietal&#xD;
      peritoneum and skin of the abdomen in infra-umbilical surgeries. Few cadaveric studies showed&#xD;
      good analgesic effect in the region between T10 and L1 following a single posterior TAP&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be assessed preoperatively by history taking, physical examination, and&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation. On arrival of the patients to the operative room, electrocardiography,&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and capnography will be applied. Baseline&#xD;
      parameters such as systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous (IV) line will be inserted and IV fluid will be started. For both groups, general&#xD;
      anesthesia will be induced with IV injection of fentanyl (1 µg/kg) (Sunny Pharmaceutical,&#xD;
      Egypt) and propofol (2mg/kg) (AstraZeneca, UK), and then, atracurium (0.5 mg/kg)&#xD;
      (GlaxoSmithKline, UK) will be injected for endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation will be maintained to keep the end-expiratory CO2 values between 34&#xD;
      and 36 mmHg. Anesthesia will be continued with isoflurane 1%-2% in 100% O2. Incremental dose&#xD;
      of atracurium (0.1 mg/kg) will be given every 30 min or when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After endotracheal intubation and before the start of the surgery. A computer system will be&#xD;
      used for randomization by creating a list of number each number referred to one of the two&#xD;
      groups. Block randomization will be used to ensure equality of the groups. Each number will&#xD;
      be sealed in an opaque envelope. Then, each patient will be asked to choose one of the&#xD;
      envelopes and give to an anesthesiologist who compared it to the computer-generated list and&#xD;
      hence assigned her to one of the two groups. Anesthesiologist (who will be blinded to the&#xD;
      collected data until the end of the study) will perform the block techniques and administered&#xD;
      the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 Patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups (each 30 patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D-TAP (30 patients): Each patient will receive general anesthesia plus bilateral&#xD;
           ultrasound-guided dual TAP [combining TAP and IL/IH nerve blocks]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group QL (30 patients): Each patient will receive general anesthesia plus bilateral&#xD;
           ultrasound-guided QLB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blocks technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both blocks were performed under complete aseptic precautions using ultrasound machine with&#xD;
      high-frequency linear probe covered with sterile sheath (Sonoscape® SSI-6000, Chinawith12-6&#xD;
      MHz high-frequency linear probe) and 100-mm needle (B Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In TAP / Ilioinguinal/Iliohypogastric nerve block, the probe will be located between the&#xD;
      iliac crest and the lower costal margin in the anterior axillary line at the level of&#xD;
      umbilicus, and the layers of abdominal wall will be identified (external oblique, internal&#xD;
      oblique, and transverse abdominis muscles). In-plane technique will be used and the tip of&#xD;
      the needle was inserted between the internal oblique and transverse abdominis muscles. After&#xD;
      negative aspiration (to exclude intravascular injection), 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be&#xD;
      injected. Then abdomen will be scanned through anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)-umbilicus&#xD;
      line. Ilioinguinal nerve can be visualised between the internal oblique and transverse or&#xD;
      external oblique muscles and within 1 to 3 cm from the ASIS. The iliohypogastric nerve lies&#xD;
      immediately adjacent. After negative aspiration (to exclude intravascular injection), 10 mL&#xD;
      of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected. The same technique will be performed on the other&#xD;
      side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In QL block, the patient will be positioned supine with lateral tilt to perform the block,&#xD;
      and the transducer will be placed at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine and moved&#xD;
      cranially until the three abdominal wall muscles will be clearly identified. The external&#xD;
      oblique muscle will be followed posterolaterally until its posterior border will be&#xD;
      visualized (hook sign), leaving underneath the internal oblique muscle, like a roof over the&#xD;
      QL muscle. The probe will be tilted down to identify a bright hyperechoic line that&#xD;
      represented the middle layer of the thoracolumbar fascia. The needle will be inserted in&#xD;
      plane from anterolateral to posteromedial. The needle tip will be placed between the&#xD;
      thoracolumbar fascia and the QL muscle, and after negative aspiration, the correct position&#xD;
      of the needle will be proved by injection of 5 mL of normal saline to confirm the space with&#xD;
      a hypoechoic image and hydrodissection. An injection of 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be&#xD;
      applied and the same technique will be performed on the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative fentanyl 1-2 ug/kg will be given if the HR or the blood pressure or both&#xD;
      increase &gt;20% of the baseline. About 30 min before the end of the surgical procedure,&#xD;
      paracetamol 1 g IV will be given for all patients. Isoflurane will be discontinued on&#xD;
      completion of the surgical procedure, and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg plus atropine 0.01 mg/kg&#xD;
      will be administered to reverse the effect of atracurium. After awakening from anesthesia and&#xD;
      achieving an appropriate level of consciousness, the patient will be discharged from the&#xD;
      operating room. Visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to assess the postoperative pain; if&#xD;
      VAS &gt;3 postoperatively, IV increment of morphine 3 mg will be given. Any side effects were&#xD;
      recorded as hypotension (systolic arterial pressure &lt;90 mmHg), arrhythmia, bradycardia (HR&#xD;
      &lt;50 beat/min), nausea or vomiting, lower limb muscle weakness, or any other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data as age, BMI, ASA status, duration of anesthesia and duration of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative pain severity assessed by VAS for pain (ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 no&#xD;
           pain and 10 maximum pain) will be evaluated postoperatively at 30 min and 2, 4, 6, 12,&#xD;
           and 24 h postoperative. Patients with VAS≥ 4 will be received morphine at dose IV&#xD;
           increment of morphine 3 mg. while patients with VAS&lt;4 will be received paracetamol 1gm&#xD;
           IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The total dose of morphine used postoperatively/patient (rescue analgesia) within first&#xD;
           24 h postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The total dose of intraoperatively fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of postoperative analgesia (the time from recovery to the first given dose&#xD;
                of morphine)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of patients needed rescue analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any recorded postoperative complication as hypotension (systolic arterial pressure&#xD;
                &lt;90 mmHg), arrhythmia, bradycardia (HR &lt;50 beat/min), nausea or vomiting, lower&#xD;
                limb muscle weakness, or any other complications&#xD;
