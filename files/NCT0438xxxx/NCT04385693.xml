  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When proximal carious lesions of primary molars are located in close proximity to the&#xD;
      cementum enamel junction (CEJ), marginal seal is challenging and extraction is recommended.&#xD;
      Pulpotomy is indicated for vital primary teeth to preserve them in function. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to monitor the long-term effect of intentional bioactive cement pulpotomies and&#xD;
      crown coverage performed on vital and asymptomatic carious primary molars with gingival&#xD;
      margins close to or at the CEJ&#xD;

    <description>Pulpotomy using bioactive bioceramic cement of 1.5 mm layer of a newly FDA approved calcium-based silicate cement (Nusmile NeoPutty) will be placed on the pulp chamber floor and canals' orifices for pulp and root therapy. Pulpotomy is a procedure in which the coronal pulp is amputated, and the remaining radicular pulp tissue is treated with a medicament to preserve the pulp's health.This technique involves administration of local analgesia, Isolation of the tooth with rubber dam, complete caries removal and then access to the pulp chamber using drills.</description>

    <description>If during the pulpotomy procedure, hemostasis is not obtainable, or signs of advanced pulp degeneration such as dark and limited or no bleeding from canals, the pulp will be diagnosed as chronically inflamed or necrotic, and tooth will be extracted. As part of the standard of care after extractions of primary molars, space maintenance will be assessed, and a space maintainer fabricated if indicated. Extracted teeth will serve as controls, and information regarding the need or not of space maintenance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Selected patients will have one or more primary molar teeth diagnosed clinically with&#xD;
             large proximal carious lesions with the gingival extension of the cavity at or below&#xD;
             the cemento-enamel junction. The tooth should be asymptomatic and must have no signs&#xD;
             of swelling, fistula, abnormal mobility and sensitivity to percussion (ruling out food&#xD;
             impaction), and adequate space for placement of a stainless steel crown restoration.&#xD;
             The pre-operative periapical radiograph, taken as part of the new patient/recall&#xD;
             routine visit, should reveal a lesion in close approximation to the pulp, but having&#xD;
             at least 1-2 mm of sound dentin separating the deepest portion of the lesion and the&#xD;
             pulp. In addition, no evidence of furcation and periapical pathology, internal or&#xD;
             external root resorption and presence of half to two-thirds of root length remaining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncooperative patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Teeth with positive history of pain, abnormal mobility, signs of pulp necrosis such as&#xD;
             presence of swelling or fistula, and significant space loss due to caries not allowing&#xD;
             placement of a stainless steel crown restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographically, signs of furcation and periapical pathology, internal and external&#xD;
             resorption, less than half to 2/3 of root length remaining&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Selected patients will be treated by pediatric dental residents in the regular dental&#xD;
             clinic setting with or without nitrous oxide inhalation, as part of the standard of&#xD;
             care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to the beginning of the study, all operators will be calibrated by the principal&#xD;
             investigator on identifying the teeth in question, as well as on the restorative&#xD;
             technique&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Selected patients may have one or more qualified teeth&#xD;
