      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicide rates are rising. In 2013, it was the third leading cause of death in children ages&#xD;
      10-14. It was the second leading cause of death for ages 15-24. Many risk factors for suicide&#xD;
      have been found. But it is hard to predict. Evidence is growing that some factors that may&#xD;
      make people vulnerable to suicide can be identified before birth or in early childhood.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study vulnerability to suicide. They want to look at different kinds of&#xD;
      development. These include prenatal, social, behavioral, cognitive, and neurologic. They will&#xD;
      do this by linking data from the United States Collaborate Perinatal Project (CPP) to the&#xD;
      National Death Index (NDI). The CPP data are from about 50,000 children born to mothers who&#xD;
      enrolled in the 1960s. The CPP observed and examined about 60,000 pregnancies. Then it&#xD;
      followed the babies from when they were born through age 7. The CPP collected data on things&#xD;
      like family and medical history, economic status, and behavior. The NDI has data on the date&#xD;
      and cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To link data from the CPP to the NDI in order to study certain precursors to suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offspring born to women who enrolled in the CPP in 1959-1966 and known to be alive at age 7&#xD;
      (Note: at the start of this study around in 2016, the youngest of those still alive would be&#xD;
      50 and the oldest would be 57 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on children from the CPP will be submitted electronically to the NDI. It will be&#xD;
      encrypted and data from the NDI will be deidentified to protect confidentiality. It will then&#xD;
      be merged with existing CPP data. Researchers will analyze the data.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of this study is to ascertain the vital status and cause-specific&#xD;
      mortality of children born to participants in the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP)&#xD;
      between 1959 and 1966 in order to investigate domains of vulnerability to suicide that are&#xD;
      hypothesized to be established in early childhood. This will be accomplished by linking&#xD;
      existing data in the NICHD-CPP cohort to the National Death Index (NCHS National Center for&#xD;
      Health Statistics). This project does not involve direct contact with human subjects&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this project is as follows. Suicide rates are rising, from 10.43/100,000 in&#xD;
      2000 to 13.02/100,000 in 2013. In 2013, suicide was the third leading cause of death among&#xD;
      children ages 10-14 years and the second leading cause of death between ages 15 and 24.&#xD;
      Suicide accounts for 800,000 years of potential life lost annually. In addition to an&#xD;
      economic impact exceeding $40 billion per year, it has devastating personal impacts on&#xD;
      survivors as well as the general public. Although numerous risk factors have been identified,&#xD;
      including prior attempts, traumatic or stressful life events, and sociodemographic,&#xD;
      psychiatric, psychological, biological and family, and socioeconomic characteristics,&#xD;
      accurate prediction of suicide remains elusive even in high-risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, epidemiologic studies of suicide have largely focused on proximal risk factors and&#xD;
      developmental stages beyond the initial formation of vulnerability, despite growing evidence&#xD;
      that frames psychiatric disorders as neurodevelopmental disorders. Evidence is also&#xD;
      increasing that adolescent and adult precipitants of suicide have roots in early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of 52,966 offspring born to women who enrolled in the CPP and&#xD;
      known to be alive at age 7 years; at the time of the NDI search, in 2016, the youngest of&#xD;
      those still alive would be 50 and the oldest would be 57 years old. The CPP involved the&#xD;
      systematic and extensive observation and examination of 58,760 pregnancies, including&#xD;
      collection of blood samples collected at the first and subsequent prenatal visits, and&#xD;
      follow-up assessments of offspring through the first 7 years of life (Niswander and Gordon,&#xD;
      1972). National follow-up rates for surviving offspring (96.7% of study births at age 7&#xD;
      years) were 88% at year 1, 75% at year 4, and 79% at year 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of secondary analyses in which CPP offspring data will be linked to the&#xD;
      National Death Index to determine vital status and cause(s) of death. NICHD is the steward of&#xD;
      personally identifying information from the CPP. Data on offspring, including date (month,&#xD;
      day, and year), name, father s surname, state of birth, and race/ethnicity will be submitted&#xD;
      to the National Death Index (NDI) for a record search covering the years 1979 to 2016 (all&#xD;
      years included within the NDI). Results of the NDI linkage will be anonymized and then merged&#xD;
      with existing CPP data for statistical analyses. Hypotheses to be tested include the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of hypotheses to be tested include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Being born small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW), and exposure to&#xD;
           maternal metabolic (e.g., gestational diabetes) and psychiatric conditions will be&#xD;
           associated with an increased risk for suicide mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Family socioeconomic disadvantage, residential instability, and family disruption during&#xD;
           the first 7 years of life will be associated with an increased risk of suicide&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Children whose behavioral profiles are characterized by low attention, conduct problems,&#xD;
           and emotional withdrawal will have an elevated risk of suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Children with lower scores on tests of intelligence at ages 4 and 7 will have an&#xD;
           increased risk of suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Neurological soft signs and neurological hard signs detected in clinical examinations&#xD;
           during early childhood will be associated with later suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. There will be a systematic pattern of differences between 275 suicide cases and 550&#xD;
           matched controls selected from among the remaining CPP offspring, with cases exhibiting&#xD;
           a pattern of biomarker concentrations consistent with a perturbation of the maternal&#xD;
           immune system from what would be expected during a normal pregnancy.&#xD;
