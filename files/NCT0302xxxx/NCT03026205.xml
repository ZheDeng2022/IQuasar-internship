    <textblock>
      This is a single center study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I a formulation that&#xD;
      incorporates cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), administered once as a single dose of three&#xD;
      sprays orally, followed by multiple dosing (3x daily oral sprays) over days 3-6 and then a&#xD;
      repeat pharmacokinetic study during the final oral dose administered as the first dose on day&#xD;
      7 to ascertain CPC accumulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARMS Pharmaceuticals LLC intends to apply for approval of ARMS-I as a prescription drug for&#xD;
      the prevention of influenza, rhinovirus and RSV (collectively, &quot;vURTI's). The company plans&#xD;
      on confirming the limited systemic bioavailability, through conducting a study to&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I administered orally in healthy adults. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I following oral&#xD;
      administration to healthy subjects. Specifically, investigators will assess whether there is&#xD;
      measurable systemic exposure and if so, to determine the plasma and pharyngeal fluid&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of ARMS-I after single and multiple oral dosing. The&#xD;
      secondary objective will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ARMS-I.&#xD;
