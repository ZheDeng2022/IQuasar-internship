      In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate&#xD;
      without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of&#xD;
      the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment&#xD;
      option.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is a lasting condition&#xD;
      in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes&#xD;
      the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint&#xD;
      movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from&#xD;
      OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means&#xD;
      they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells&#xD;
      (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study,&#xD;
      researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing&#xD;
      side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over&#xD;
      time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option.&#xD;
