      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ubidecarenone injectable&#xD;
      nanosuspension (BPM31510) in treating patients with high-grade glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma&#xD;
      or glioblastoma) that has come back and have been previously treated with bevacizumab.&#xD;
      BPM31510 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of BPM31510 plus vitamin K in subjects with&#xD;
           high-grade glioma(HGG), defined as anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma (GB) that&#xD;
           has recurred on a BEV containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to&#xD;
           subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the overall survival in subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen&#xD;
           from the 1st day of infusion of BPM31510 plus vitamin K to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of BPM31510 plus vitamin K on shifting HGG metabolism to aerobic&#xD;
           respiration by PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of BPM1510 plus vitamin K on MRI imaging by Response Assessment&#xD;
           in Neuro Oncology (RANO) criteria [specifically progression free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
           response rate (RR)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate plasma pharmacodynamics (PD) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to&#xD;
           subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen.&#xD;
