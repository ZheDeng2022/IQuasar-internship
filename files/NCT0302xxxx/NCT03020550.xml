  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study measuring physiologic and behavioral correlates of symptom severity in&#xD;
      adult patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete questionnaires regarding their GERD-related symptoms and have a visit&#xD;
      with a study clinician regarding their symptoms. We will measure heart rate variability and&#xD;
      galvanic skin response in patients during the visits and video record the visits. Subjects&#xD;
      will complete a daily GERD symptom diary for 2 weeks and then return to the study center to&#xD;
      complete additional questionnaires and an exit interview.&#xD;

    <measure>Association of Change in Patient's GSR From Beginning to End of Study Visit With GERD Symptom Severity 2 Weeks Later</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning to end of study visit (1 hour or less for change in GSR)</time_frame>
    <description>Galvanic skin response (GSR) was measured with a device from ADInstruments during the baseline study visit. Values ranged from 0.93 - 12 micro-Siemens (μS). Change in GSR was calculated as mean value of GSR for the first 2 minutes of the study visit minus mean value of GSR for the last 2 minutes of the study visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Association of Change in Patient's High Frequency HRV From Beginning to End of Study Visit With GERD Symptom Severity 2 Weeks Later</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning to end of study visit (1 hour or less for change in HRV/RMSSD)</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured using a device from ADInstruments gathering data at 256 Hz. We used the RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences) value as a proxy for high frequency HRV. Measured values ranged from 0 - 150 msec. Change in high frequency HRV was calculated as the RMSSD value for the first 5 minutes of the study visit minus the RMSSD value for the last 5 minutes of the study visit.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation Between Concordance in GSR Between Patient and Physician During the Study Visit and Percent Change in Patients' GERD Symptoms Over 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning to end of study visit (1 hour or less for concordance between patient and physician GSR)</time_frame>
    <description>Concordance in galvanic skin response (GSR) between patient and physician was calculated using an established approach (Marci CD, 2007; PMID 17299296) to create a single index value for the visit. The natural logarithm of this value was taken to reduce skew. A value greater than 0 means more than 50% concordance in the data, a value less than zero means less than 50% concordance in the data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post GERD Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks (baseline and 2 week follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>GERD symptom severity at follow-up was assessed by self-report on a 7-day symptom diary (symptoms collected days 8-14 after the study visit). Possible daily scores ranged from 0-12 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms (sum of daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and acid regurgitation symptoms each rated 0-4 in severity [none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe]). Daily scores across the 7 days were averaged to create the Post GERD symptom severity score. Adapted from: Miner P, et. al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2002. PMID: 12094846.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in Patient's GERD Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks (baseline and 2 week follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in patient's GERD symptoms was calculated as: (post GERD symptom severity - baseline GERD symptom severity) / baseline GERD symptom severity*100.&#xD;
GERD symptom severity scores were averaged across 7 day baseline and follow-up periods from a symptom diary (adapted from Miner P, 2002; PMID 12094846). Scores ranged from 0-12 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms (sum of daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and acid regurgitation each rated 0-4 in severity [none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe]).</description>

          <description>A standardized visit (based on a pre-set question template) modeled after an integrative medicine visit for GERD symptoms. The Expanded Visit includes all of the questions in the Standard Visit plus additional questions about the nature of the GI symptoms (e.g., taste of reflux, food cravings and aversions), other health issues, and the patient's temperament (e.g., shy, anxious, caring). Some of these questions address the patient's &quot;constitutional type&quot; as might be assessed by some integrative practitioners (e.g., tell me about your sleep; do you tend to be hot or cold?).</description>

          <title>Average Daily GERD Symptom Severity</title>
          <description>Severity of GERD symptoms were assessed by participant self-report on a 7-day symptom diary for one week immediately prior to enrolling in the study. Possible daily scores ranged from 0-12 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms (sum of daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and acid regurgitation symptoms each rated 0-4 in severity [none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe]). Daily values across each of the 7 days were averaged to create the average daily GERD symptom severity score. Adapted from: Miner P, et. al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2002 Jun;97(6):1332-1339.

          <title>Percent Change in Patient's GERD Symptoms</title>
          <description>Percent change in patient's GERD symptoms was calculated as: (post GERD symptom severity - baseline GERD symptom severity) / baseline GERD symptom severity*100.&#xD;
GERD symptom severity scores were averaged across 7 day baseline and follow-up periods from a symptom diary (adapted from Miner P, 2002; PMID 12094846). Scores ranged from 0-12 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms (sum of daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and acid regurgitation each rated 0-4 in severity [none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe]).</description>
