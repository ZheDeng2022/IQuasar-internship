  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the most frequent infection in critically ill patients and remains a significant&#xD;
      challenge to intensivists world-wide due to persisting high mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Compelling evidence suggests that appropriate antibiotic therapy remains the most important&#xD;
      intervention to improve patients' outcome, including the administration of a suitable&#xD;
      molecule at an optimized dosage regimen. A vast array of pathophysiological changes can occur&#xD;
      in critically ill patients that can complicate antibiotic dosing. Knowledge of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibiotics used for the management of&#xD;
      critically ill patients is essential for selecting the antibiotic dosing regimens, which will&#xD;
      optimize patient outcomes. Changes in volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (CL) of&#xD;
      antibiotics have been noted in these patients, which may affect the antibiotic concentration&#xD;
      at the target site. It follows that the pharmacodynamic parameters that determine antibiotic&#xD;
      efficacy, which can vary between antibiotic classes, may also be affected. Optimization of&#xD;
      these parameters is necessary to maximize the rate of response through patient recovery and&#xD;
      minimized antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multicenter observational study in critically ill patients with normal plasma renal&#xD;
      indices at admission, about 65% of patients manifested augmented creatinine clearance on at&#xD;
      least one occasion in the first seven study days. Augmented creatinine clearance may&#xD;
      significantly impact drug pharmacokinetics for a variety of renally eliminated&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals (such as low-molecular weight heparins, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, and&#xD;
      β-lactams), leading to subtherapeutic concentrations and potentially adverse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Currently little data exist that describe the consequences of augmented creatinine&#xD;
      clearance on antibiotics PK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceftaroline (600 mg bid) is a cephalosporin with expanded gram-positive activity, including&#xD;
      MRSA and penicillin-resistant streptococcus, which was approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) on October 29, 2010 for the treatment of acute bacterial SSSIs and&#xD;
      community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Ceftaroline showed also good activity against some of&#xD;
      the common gram-negative respiratory pathogens (eg, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella&#xD;
      catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, and Pasteurella multocida). However, it does not display&#xD;
      clinically relevant activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumannii. Ceftaroline also lacks activity against gram-negative organisms with&#xD;
      extended-spectrum β-lactamases. Importantly, because ceftaroline appears to induce AmpC&#xD;
      β-lactamases despite MIC values in susceptible range, ittheoretically should be avoided in&#xD;
      gram-negative bacteria known to harbor inducible AmpC β-lactamases (eg, Serratia, Proteus,&#xD;
      Citrobacter, Morganella, Enterobacter, Providencia, and P. aeruginosa). In patients,&#xD;
      ceftaroline is given as a prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil. After intravenous administration, the&#xD;
      prodrug is rapidly transformed by plasma phosphatase enzymes to its bioactive metabolite. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline has been evaluated in single and multiple dose studies in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, in subjects with various degrees of renal impairment and in healthy&#xD;
      elderly subjects. The volume of distribution is equal to 20.3 L, which corresponds to&#xD;
      extracellular fluid volume. The protein binding is low (20%). The main route of elimination&#xD;
      is via renal excretion, with a clearance estimated to160 mL/min close to the creatinine&#xD;
      clearance. The elimination half-live is 2.6 h in adults with normal renal function.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, no PK study has been performed in infected critically ill patients with&#xD;
      augmented creatinine clearance. The best PK-PD index predicting drug efficacy is %Time&gt;CMI. A&#xD;
      bacteriostatic effect is achieved when free drug concentrations exceed the MIC for 30 to 40%&#xD;
      of the dose administration interval (30 to 40%T&gt;MIC). Near maximum organism kill is achieved&#xD;
      at 50 to 60%T&gt;MIC (30%T&gt;MIC for Staphylococcus aureus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to characterize ceftaroline PK in patients with early-onset pneumonia and&#xD;
      augmented creatinine clearance. The choice of ceftaroline is justified by its spectrum&#xD;
      suitable for micro-organisms commonly encountered in early onset pneumonia, including&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Secondary main objective is to predict the&#xD;
      probably of reaching PK-PD targets using Monte Carlo simulations under various scenario in&#xD;
      order to identify optimal ceftaroline administration schemes in critical care patients with&#xD;
      various degrees of renal impairment.&#xD;
