      Brace treatment is the most effective non-surgical method for the treatment of Adolescent&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The goal of bracing is to stop the curve progression during the&#xD;
      high risk period of the adolescent growth spurt. A spinal brace is a hard plastic shell with&#xD;
      pressure pads installed inside the liner to provide mechanical support to the curvature of&#xD;
      the spine. It is a big commitment for adolescents to wear a brace because it is physically&#xD;
      restrictive, uncomfortable and draws unwanted attention. Therefore, it is very important to&#xD;
      make the brace treatment as effective as possible to get patient buy-in to compromise their&#xD;
      lifestyle by wearing a brace. Patients' belief in the treatment outcomes is also a factor to&#xD;
      attain their compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical study will investigate if the effectiveness of brace treatment can&#xD;
      be maximized by combining ultrasound imaging assistance during brace design with the smart&#xD;
      brace to automatically maintain corrective brace pressures at the optimum level during the&#xD;
      whole treatment period.&#xD;

      Background: Brace treatment is the most effective non-surgical method for the treatment of&#xD;
      AIS. The goal of bracing is to stop the curve progression during the high risk period of the&#xD;
      adolescent growth spurt. A spinal brace is a hard plastic shell with pressure pads installed&#xD;
      inside the liner to provide mechanical support to the curvature of the spine. It is a big&#xD;
      commitment for adolescents to wear a brace because it is physically restrictive,&#xD;
      uncomfortable and draws unwanted attention. Therefore, it is very important to make the brace&#xD;
      treatment as effective as possible to get patient buy-in to compromise their lifestyle by&#xD;
      wearing a brace. Patients' belief in the treatment outcomes is also a factor to attain their&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective: This randomized clinical study will investigate if the effectiveness of&#xD;
      brace treatment can be maximized by combining ultrasound imaging assistance during brace&#xD;
      design with the smart brace to automatically maintain corrective brace pressures at the&#xD;
      optimum level during the whole treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection: One hundred and twenty-eight brace candidates with AIS will be recruited&#xD;
      over the next 5 years. During the scoliosis clinic, the attending orthopaedic surgeon&#xD;
      identifies a potential candidate. He will ask the potential patient if he/she is interested&#xD;
      in speaking with the research coordinator about research projects that he/she is eligible.&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are patients 1) age 10 - 16 years, 2) diagnosis of AIS, 3) require&#xD;
      full-time brace wear, 4) Cobb angle between 20° - 40°, 5) Risser sign ≤3 and 6) premenarchal&#xD;
      or less than 1 year postmenarchal. Subjects will be randomly selected to 1 of the 2 groups:&#xD;
      a) An ultrasound assisted designed brace and a brace monitor, and b) An ultrasound assisted&#xD;
      designed brace and a smart brace device. Figure 1 shows the flow chart of the study. Each&#xD;
      subject will have 50% chance of being in any one of the groups. An extra 15 minutes will be&#xD;
      needed for both groups during the brace fitting clinic to install the brace monitor or smart&#xD;
      brace device. An extra 30 minutes will be added to your casting. Participants will be&#xD;
      monitored until the brace treatment is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description: The brace monitor is a small electronic device which will be embedded&#xD;
      inside the brace. It is a very low power system operating at 3.3 V and 2 milliampere (mA) (on&#xD;
      average). It is able to store 12 months of data and the battery can last for 9 months. It&#xD;
      will record how much time and how tightly the subject wears the brace. The brace with the&#xD;
      monitor looks exactly the same as a standard brace. The subject won't feel any different and&#xD;
      don't need to do anything beyond. We will replace the monitor with a new one at every&#xD;
      standard follow up clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A smart brace device is a small electronic device. It will have a small air bag embedded at&#xD;
      the major pad area covered with stretchable leather. It will record how much time and how&#xD;
      tightly the brace is worn. The air bag will inflate if the contact pressure between the brace&#xD;
      and the body is lower than expected. The air bag will deflate if the contact pressure between&#xD;
      the brace and the body is higher than expected. This automatic pressure adjustment will only&#xD;
      be activated during daytime which is individualized based on the patient's sleep pattern. The&#xD;
      system will also be activated only if breathing motion is detected (which means brace is&#xD;
      worn). The smart brace monitor is able to store 6 months of data but requiring to recharge&#xD;
      every day for 30 minutes. The smart brace monitor is a low power system (operating at 4.2 V&#xD;
      and 150 mA max). It has an on-off switch and a pressure enable-disable regulation switch&#xD;
      safety functions. Switching enable-disable regulation to off will make the smart brace device&#xD;
      becomes a standard brace monitor. Turing off the on-off switch will disable all the functions&#xD;
      and this brace will become a standard brace. We will replace the monitor with a new one at&#xD;
      every standard follow up clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound assisted design requires to get 4 ultrasound images: normal standing, normal&#xD;
      supine, bending left supine and bending right supine. Each scan takes approximately 1 minute.&#xD;
      These 4 scans will provide spine flexibility information. After this, the subject will be&#xD;
      asked to stand in a wooden positioning frame with pressure pads allow to move&#xD;
      3-dimensionally. Multiple adjustable brace pads will be applied to the patients' body&#xD;
      according to orthotist suggestion. An ultrasound scan will be performed after the pads are&#xD;
      applied. The orthotist will use the ultrasound image to decide if the pads are at the optimum&#xD;
      locations and applied proper pressures. If the orthotist is satisfied with the correction,&#xD;
      he/ she will use this setup to build the brace. Otherwise, he/she will adjust the position&#xD;
      and orientation of the pads and repeated the ultrasound scan.&#xD;
