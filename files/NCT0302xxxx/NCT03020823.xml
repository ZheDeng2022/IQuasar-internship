      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of i.v. infusion for 24-hour of&#xD;
      SCB01A in subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck who have failed previous&#xD;
      platinum based therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From pre-clinical pharmacology and phase I clinical study SCB01A has demonstrated promising&#xD;
      anticancer action with a vascular disrupting activity that has the potential for treatment of&#xD;
      various malignancies, particularly for patients with drug resistance. The drug has been&#xD;
      studied in human subjects in a dose escalation phase I study and has shown to be safe for up&#xD;
      to 2 cycles of 24 mg/m2 (each cycle consisting of one intravenous [i.v.] administration of&#xD;
      SCB01A via a central line every 3 weeks). In the phase I study, partial response (PR)&#xD;
      (shrinkage of tumor size to 50%) was observed in cycle 9 (3 mg/m2) of one subject with right&#xD;
      buccal squamous cell carcinoma and 19/33 (58%) subjects had stable disease (SD) for more than&#xD;
      2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre clinical study of SCB01A showed that the concentrations at which tubulin inhibition&#xD;
      occurred were around 80 nM for 24-hour exposure or 200 nM for 6-hour exposure. However,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) results of phase I study showed that the average elimination half-life&#xD;
      (t1/2) of a 3-hours i.v. infusion of SCB01A is approximately 2.5 hours and almost no SCB01A&#xD;
      can be detected after 10 hours, indicating most subjects were treated in short API exposure&#xD;
      time and may have been insufficient to achieve efficacy. Therefore, to extend the exposure&#xD;
      duration above effective concentration in blood may increase the treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of i.v. infusion for 24-hour of&#xD;
      SCB01A in subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck who have failed previous&#xD;
      platinum based therapies.&#xD;
