      Objective: Investigate the direct correlation of CYP3A5 genotype with tacrolimus trough&#xD;
      levels and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      proportion of patients reaching target levels (8-10 ng/mL) on Day 3 and Day 7 after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      Participants: All new kidney transplant recipients aged 18 to 65 years who are admitted at&#xD;
      UNC-CH and provided informed consent will be included in this study (Unless they meet the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria specified). A total of 260 subjects will be included in the study, 130 of&#xD;
      which will be included in the pharmacogenomic group and the remaining 130 will be in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): The pharmacogenomic group will partake in a 12-month study comprising&#xD;
      of two periods, Genotype-Guided Initial Dosing Intervention and Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, patients on transplant waitlist will be screened for eligibility. At the&#xD;
      pre-intervention assessment (Study Day 0), buccal swab samples for genotyping will be&#xD;
      collected on all eligible patients who provided informed consent (performed in real time).&#xD;
      Results of the genotyping test will be incorporated into electronic medical record (EMR). The&#xD;
      initial tacrolimus dose will be based on genotype: 0.1 mg/kg/day (non- expressers) or 0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg/day, with maximum of 20 mg/day (expressers) given in 2 divided doses. Eligible patients&#xD;
      who consented to receive genotype-guided tacrolimus dose will enter the pharmacogenomic group&#xD;
      and will receive the initial tacrolimus dosing based on genotype results following kidney&#xD;
      transplantation (Study Day 1). Subsequent tacrolimus dosing will then be adjusted according&#xD;
      to trough concentrations (C0) and therapeutic target concentrations. The genotype-guided&#xD;
      dosing recommendation for tacrolimus only refers to the initial tacrolimus dose. All patients&#xD;
      in the pharmacogenomic group will be followed from Study Day 2 and up to 12 months to assess&#xD;
      long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-, race-, and disease-matched patients who had previously received kidney transplantation&#xD;
      with standard tacrolimus dosing from 2010 to present will also be asked to give consent for&#xD;
      genotyping (historical controls). These patients will be included in the control group and&#xD;
      their safety and efficacy data will be collected retrospectively for up to 12 months from the&#xD;
      initiation of first tacrolimus dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there are confounding variables, including age, race and disease state that may impact the&#xD;
      results of the study, our study design incorporates an overall matching strategy, so that we&#xD;
      can identify a well-matched control group. First, to control for differences in care over&#xD;
      time, patients in the pharmacogenomic group will be matched to controls enrolled from 2010 to&#xD;
      present. This time period was selected as there had been no major changes in standard of care&#xD;
      or treatment regimen since 2010. After eligibility is met, control patients will be selected&#xD;
      to match the pharmacogenomic group using a computerized matching algorithm that has been&#xD;
      optimized to match baseline demographic and disease characteristics that have been identified&#xD;
      a priori as likely to influence the treatment response to tacrolimus. To balance the&#xD;
      trade-off between minimizing bias and maximizing matched sample size, a systematic approach&#xD;
      will be conducted to identify the number of matched control patients for each patient in the&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic group. This approach will include the following steps: 1) run the desired&#xD;
      matching algorithm, starting with 1:1 (one control to one patient in the pharmacogenomic&#xD;
      group) matching and iterating until the maximum desired number of potential controls per&#xD;
      treated subject is reached; 2) for each iteration, test for covariate balance; and (3)&#xD;
      generate numeric summaries and graphical plots of the balance statistics across all&#xD;
      iterations in order to determine the optimal number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of patients for the control group using a matching algorithm will be conducted&#xD;
      by an independent statistician in a blinded and unbiased manner. The statistician will have&#xD;
      no knowledge of survival outcome, other outcome data, and genotype. The algorithm will not be&#xD;
      used to guide treatment in any way.&#xD;
