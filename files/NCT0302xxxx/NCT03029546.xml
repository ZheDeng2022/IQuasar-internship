      The investigator's main objective is to analyze the effects of a routine prenatal care&#xD;
      screening tool (glucola test for gestational diabetes) on maternal inflammation through&#xD;
      assessment of maternal circulatory biomarkers and blood pressure. Improving knowledge about&#xD;
      routine prenatal care and how a variety of screening factors affect maternal physiology&#xD;
      allows the investigators to be educated and informed when caring for mothers with medical&#xD;
      co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if an acute glucose load (50g) is associated with an in-vivo and in-vitro&#xD;
           increase in the concentration of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEP's) that, in turn,&#xD;
           can impact vascular endothelial reactivity and induce an acute increase in blood&#xD;
           pressure. Previous studies generated in the investigators' laboratory showed that&#xD;
           circulating soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE) and Tumor&#xD;
           Necrosis Factor (TNF)-a (mediator of acute inflammation) are considered markers of the&#xD;
           extent of maternal RAGE activation and/or systemic inflammation, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how an acute glucose load (50g) at the time of normal screening for&#xD;
           gestational diabetes induces an acute increase in the level of sRAGE and TNF-a. If the&#xD;
           investigators' hypothesis is confirmed, the investigators will have strong confirmation&#xD;
           of the involvement of glycation products and TNF-a in generating the acute negative&#xD;
           clinical symptoms of women experiencing a glucose tolerance test, such as headache,&#xD;
           nausea, sweating, and bloating.&#xD;

      A. Research Design Participants will be identified at the time of their prenatal care visit&#xD;
      (24-28 weeks GA). The investigators will ask permission for participation in the research&#xD;
      protocol. A waiver of HIPPA has been added to the protocol to explain the sources&#xD;
      investigators might use to screen for eligible subjects. The electronic medical records may&#xD;
      be accessed with a partial waiver to review the medical information that will make each&#xD;
      subject a candidate for the protocol. The subject will be instructed on the benefits of the&#xD;
      study for which the participant is eligible and that management will not be influenced by the&#xD;
      participant's decision to volunteer or not. If the patient agrees to participate, the&#xD;
      participant will be given the written consent to read. The participant will be asked if there&#xD;
      is understanding, if all has been explained, and if there are any questions the investigators&#xD;
      need to clarify. The informed consent will be obtained. No ads, flyers, website postings,&#xD;
      recruitment letters, or oral/written scripts will be involved for recruitment of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collection of blood (5 cc or one teaspoon of whole blood) and urine (1/2 cup) specimens&#xD;
           prior to administration of the 50 gr. glucola test. This protocol will be presented in&#xD;
           this arm of the study to women (n=50) who have a clinically indicated 1 hour glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test to diagnose gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood pressure measurements every 15 minutes for one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collection of a second blood (5 cc or one teaspoon of whole blood), and urine (1/2 cup)&#xD;
           specimen following administration of the 50 gr. glucola test. Collection of blood at&#xD;
           this time will be clinically indicated to test for abnormal clinical values that might&#xD;
           classify the patient as gestational diabetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In a separate group of women classified as healthy pregnant controls (n=50) the&#xD;
           investigators will obtain informed consent using a protocol similar to the one described&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Collection of a blood (5 cc or one teaspoon of whole blood), and urine (1/2 cup)&#xD;
           specimen will be performed prior to administration of the 50 cc of plain water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blood pressure measurements will be performed every 15 minutes for one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Collection of a second blood (5 cc or one teaspoon of whole blood), and urine (1/2 cup)&#xD;
      sample will occur at the end of the hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Sample Participants will be enrolled based on the eligibility for a one hour GTT. Chart&#xD;
      reviews of the clinic schedules will be performed the week prior to identify the target&#xD;
      population for recruitment who are 24-28 weeks gestation in need of a diabetes screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 pregnant women in the high risk clinic presenting for diabetes screen at a routine&#xD;
      prenatal visit will be recruited for enrollment. This population is at risk for subsequent&#xD;
      adverse pregnancy outcomes, and the investigators will evaluate if biomarkers, such as&#xD;
      advanced glycation end products, are affected following glucose loading for diabetes&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 healthy pregnant women in the general obstetric clinic at McCampbell Hall will be&#xD;
      recruited as controls to ingest a 50cc sample of water and undergo identical objective&#xD;
      measurements (blood pressure measurements and urine/ blood samples) as the glucose loading&#xD;
      subjects. Biomarker analysis will be compared with that of the glucose loading population.&#xD;
      These patients serving as controls will undergo the clinically indicated glucola screening at&#xD;
      another visit between 24-28 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-English-speaking subjects will be excluded due to inability to appropriately&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-pregnant patients will be excluded since this is a study of maternal tissues and&#xD;
           pregnancy outcomes related to exposures in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Men will be excluded since this is a study that includes pregnant women only by nature&#xD;
           of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prisoners will be excluded to avoid any potential for coercion&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Minors under 18 years of age will be excluded due to lack of ability to consent without&#xD;
           a legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with contra-indications to glucola testing for gestational diabetes screening&#xD;
           will be excluded, such as bariatric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease with partial&#xD;
           bowel resection, and other mal-absorptive conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Measurement/ Instrumentation 50 pregnant patients who are 24 to 28 weeks gestation&#xD;
      undergoing routine screening for gestational diabetes using a 50g glucose load will be&#xD;
      recruited. Following enrollment, maternal blood and urine specimens will be obtained as&#xD;
      outlined above. Blood pressure will be recorded. For this type of study design each patient&#xD;
      will serve as the participant's own control. Additionally, 50 healthy pregnant patients will&#xD;
      be recruited to perform a test similar to the diabetes screen using water only to serve as&#xD;
      additional controls. Advanced Glycation End Products among other proteins will be analyzed&#xD;
      for each of the specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using standard immunoassay procedures available in our laboratory, the investigators will&#xD;
      perform in parallel proteomics analysis of urine and maternal blood in addition to placental&#xD;
      evaluation following delivery. Advanced Glycation End Products and TNF-A will be the focus,&#xD;
      but, by performing proteomics studies of the biological samples, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      discover other biomarkers and biological pathways that might be responsible for the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of the test. The newly discovered key proteins and important regulatory&#xD;
      protein pathways can potentially be targeted to identify and treat diabetes and other medical&#xD;
      conditions in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Detailed Study Procedures Women will be recruited in the OSUMC High Risk or Low risk&#xD;
      Clinics, and Labor and Delivery. Clinical data for the study will be abstracted from the&#xD;
      subject's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential hazards are related to the risks of an additional blood draw outside of routine&#xD;
      prenatal care. These risks include bruising, discomfort or pain at the site, infection, or&#xD;
      fainting. The risks are perceived as minimal, but patients will be compensated for their time&#xD;
      and willingness to undergo the discomfort of this additional blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be coded as numbers 1 to 100. In addition, specimens will be coded with a&#xD;
      letter code followed by numbers in consecutive number. The PI will create a computer&#xD;
      worksheet where the name and medical record of the subject is linked to the coded information&#xD;
      of the subject and to each of the coded specimen numbers. The computer desktop that holds the&#xD;
      worksheet with Public Health Information (PHI) has a disk encryption. One copy of the consent&#xD;
      form will be kept in a secured and locked cabinet in the PI's office which is also locked.&#xD;
      The subject's name will be kept separate from the results. No reports will be communicated&#xD;
      back to the subjects or included in their medical record, since they will not affect how&#xD;
      pregnancy, labor or their post-delivery care will be managed. Only the subject's doctor and&#xD;
      the researchers will know of the subject's participation in the study. No further public&#xD;
      disclosure of this information will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Internal Validity&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid study bias, we have also employed the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of internal controls and an external control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of consecutive enrolled patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Data Analysis Statistical comparisons between groups will be performed using Student t or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test or Two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc&#xD;
      Holm-Sidak tests as appropriate. Pearson product moment correlation will be used to estimate&#xD;
      association between variables. A p=&lt;0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical&#xD;
      significance. Gestational age, weight of the fetus at the time of glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
      presence or absence of any of the medical complications of pregnancy, medication and&#xD;
      substance abuse history, and maternal demographic characteristics will be analyzed and the&#xD;
      subject of statistical comparison.&#xD;
