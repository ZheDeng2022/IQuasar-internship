  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted reproduction treatment in patients with low ovarian reserve is a big difficult&#xD;
      clinical problem. Growth hormone (GH) is crucial in the development of follicles since&#xD;
      preantral follicle to ovulation and can promote steroid hormones and gamete formation,&#xD;
      increase the granular cell sensitivity,and inhibition of follicular atresia. Latest research&#xD;
      shows that GH can improve egg quality through regulating mitochondrial function of the&#xD;
      oocytes and increase the rate of embryo euploid. It becomes a new argument in that promotion&#xD;
      of clinical pregnancy rate in assisted reproduction treatment. GH applied in the field of&#xD;
      assisted reproduction 30 years experience of applicable people, but drug dosage, drug&#xD;
      intervention time continue to explore. 2015 China assisted reproductive stimulate ovulation&#xD;
      medicine expert consensus recommend joint GH for poor ovarian response, repeated implantation&#xD;
      failure patients and older patients assisted fertility treatment, but not on the specific use&#xD;
      time limit, the daily dose of drugs and curative effect. How to maximize growth hormone&#xD;
      potential advantage in improving the egg quality bothers the clinical doctors. We had a&#xD;
      self-controlled retrospective analyses in growth hormone application and found that the&#xD;
      average daily injections of GH dose 2 iu for 45 days can significantly improve the embryo&#xD;
      quality in patients with low ovarian reaction. And now long-acting recombinant human growth&#xD;
      hormone is available, which make it convenient for patients. A forward-looking experimental&#xD;
      is expected to answer clinical practical problems and provide proper GH regimen for low&#xD;
      ovarian responder.&#xD;

      This study is a pilot study to investigate the effect of growth hormone in assisted&#xD;
      reproductive technology clinical outcome of poor responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: randomized controlled trial. Setting: Assisted reproductive technologies unit.&#xD;
      Patients: patients diagnosed poor ovarian responder who is in accordance with the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and not meet the exclusion criteria, who had repeated IVF treatment from Mar 2017&#xD;
      to Aug 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The comparison was made between GH group and the control group, both groups are&#xD;
      conducted with the mini-dose GnRH-a long protocol for IVF treatment. GH group use Long-acting&#xD;
      recombinant human growth hormone 14IU qw, until the day of hCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of the study is live birth rate. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate, number of oocytes retrieved, fertility rate, normal&#xD;
      fertilization rate, rate of transferable embryo and good quality embryo rate.&#xD;
