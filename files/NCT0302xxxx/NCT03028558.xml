  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic cigarettes (EC) are battery powered nicotine delivery devices that aerosolize&#xD;
      nicotine and other flavor constituents. Despite the increasing use of EC, little attention&#xD;
      has been paid to their possible adverse effects on human health. Theoretically, the risk&#xD;
      relates to nicotine per se and/or the propellants or contaminants in the EC aerosol. The&#xD;
      hypothesis underlying the proposal is that chronic EC smoking disorders the biology of the&#xD;
      oral epithelium, the first cell population exposed to inhaled EC vapors. Using a&#xD;
      cross-sectional, cohort-comparison of EC smokers compared to age-, gender- and&#xD;
      ethnicity-matched never smokers, the investigators propose to assess the oral epithelium&#xD;
      obtained by punch biopsy or brushing from 100 EC smokers and 25 nonsmoker controls. The EC&#xD;
      study cohort will be restricted to young adults (age 21-35 yr) with no prior history of&#xD;
      tobacco smoking, but who have smoked EC for &gt;6 months.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is compelling evidence to support this hypothesis: (1) EC vapors contain nicotine, the&#xD;
      oral epithelium expresses nicotine receptors, and exposure of epithelia to nicotine activates&#xD;
      the nicotine pathway; (2) EC vapors also contain chemical contaminants that can potentially&#xD;
      effect oral epithelial biology; and (3) in vitro studies suggest that EC vapors modify&#xD;
      epithelial biology and data generated by our laboratory demonstrates that even a brief, acute&#xD;
      exposure of healthy nonsmokers to EC vapors induces significant changes in the airway&#xD;
      epithelial transcriptome, including the expression of genes in the nicotine and p53 pathways.&#xD;
      With the knowledge that disordering of cell biology occurs long before clinical disease,the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the oral epithelium at the transcriptome (mRNA and miRNA) levels.&#xD;
      They will then identify gene(s)/pathways/communities disordered by EC vapors.&#xD;

        The investigators plan recruit the EC smoking (also called &quot;vaping&quot;) population, and have&#xD;
        experience recruiting from the extensive network of EC shops and vaping &quot;bars&quot; in the New&#xD;
        York City metropolitan area, providing ample access to young adult, sole EC smokers. The&#xD;
        control groups will be age-, gender- and ethnicity-matched healthy nonsmokers. Based on our&#xD;
        experience with this population, the investigators know that the variables of EC smoking&#xD;
        history (brand, flavorings, length and extent of EC smoking history) demand that there is&#xD;
        sufficient &quot;n&quot; to power the analysis. In this regard, the study population will include&#xD;
        n=125, including n=100 EC smokers and a control group of n=25 healthy nonsmokers. Between&#xD;
        the ages of 21-35 years old.&#xD;
