      This study aims to investigate safety and efficacy of Occlutech® AFR device in patients with&#xD;
      severe pulmonary hypertension (PH).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects with severe pulmonary hypertension until a maximum of 30&#xD;
      patients have undergone implantation with the Occlutech® AFR device. Enrolment will be&#xD;
      devided in 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: At least 15 adult patients with age ≥ 18 years will be enrolled. Phase 2: Patients&#xD;
      with age ≥ 6 years will be enrolled until a maximum of 30 patients is reached.&#xD;
