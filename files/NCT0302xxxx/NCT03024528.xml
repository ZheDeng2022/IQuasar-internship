  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain experienced by critically ill patients is a major problem affecting nearly 50% of the&#xD;
      patients. Assessing pain in critically ill patients is a challenge even in an intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) with a minimal opioid-based sedation protocol. In patients who are unable to&#xD;
      self-report pain, behavioural scales are used, such as CPOT - Critical Care Pain Observation&#xD;
      Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the Polish version of a behavioural pain&#xD;
      assessment method - CPOT in an ICU with a minimal sedation protocol (opioid-based) versus&#xD;
      self-report pain using Numeric rating scale (NRS) in both delirious and non-delirious&#xD;
      patients (assessed using Confusion Assessment Method for ICU, CAM-ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A prospective observational cohort study will include 70 patients. The patients will&#xD;
      be observed during a non-nociceptive procedure (wash of an arm) and a nociceptive procedure&#xD;
      (turning). Patients will be observed 5 minutes before, during, and 15 min after the two&#xD;
      interventions (six assessments). Each CPOT assessment will be carried out by two observers&#xD;
      blinded to each other. To validate the Polish CPOT translation calculations of interrater&#xD;
      reliability, criterion validity and discriminant validity will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients frequently suffer from pain during their stay in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, as nearly 30% of those patients experience pain at rest and up to 50% experience pain&#xD;
      during nursing procedures. Pain experienced by critically ill patients falls into four&#xD;
      categories that coexist and overlap: pre-existing chronic pain, acute illness-related pain,&#xD;
      continuous ICU treatment-related pain or discomfort and intermittent procedural pain.&#xD;
      Moreover, acute pain experienced in the ICU may become a chronic problem after discharge from&#xD;
      the unit, as a lifelong ICU footprint. Everyday nursing procedures and interventions (i.e.&#xD;
      positioning, mouth and trachea suctioning, wound care, catheter removal or placement,&#xD;
      cannulation or intubation) performed in the ICU may be a potential source of pain, therefore&#xD;
      there is a clinical need for a simple and easy ICU pain scale to evaluate this condition in&#xD;
      patients unable to self-report pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pain in patients treated in the ICU becomes a daily clinical challenge for the&#xD;
      ICU team, especially in those units where deep levels of sedation are used, but also in the&#xD;
      minimal sedation environment based on analgesia. Various guidelines and recommendations exist&#xD;
      to guide the ICU care team in the pain management and assessment process. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      gold standard for pain assessment is patient's self-report of pain (using numeric raing scale&#xD;
      - NRS or visual analog scale - VAS), which can be aided with behavioural scales only when the&#xD;
      self-report is unreliable or impossible to obtain. Those observational pain scales include&#xD;
      the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and the Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) and have&#xD;
      been recommended for clinical use in the critically ill adults. However, their validation in&#xD;
      a given patient population (cardiac, burn, different languages) is strongly recommended and&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to equip critical care teams with dedicated monitoring tools is clear as early&#xD;
      identification warrants early treatment. The CPOT has been developed by ICU professionals,&#xD;
      yet it has not been translated or validated in Polish until now.&#xD;
