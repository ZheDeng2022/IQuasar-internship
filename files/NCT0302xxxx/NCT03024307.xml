      This is a randomised trial on the efficacy of an Outpatient Pharmacy Clinical Services&#xD;
      Program (OPCSP) on adherence and clinical outcomes among patients with rheumatic diseases.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. rates of medication adherence in the OPCSP program compared with usual care in an&#xD;
           integrated health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. total direct costs and clinical outcomes in the OPCSP program compared with usual care&#xD;
           in an integrated health care system.&#xD;

      This is a randomised trial on the efficacy of an Outpatient Pharmacy Clinical Services&#xD;
      Program (OPCSP) on adherence and clinical outcomes among patients with rheumatic&#xD;
      diseases.Three types of rheumatic diseases were included in the study, Systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE), Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and Rheumatoid Arthritis(RA). The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. rates of medication adherence in the OPCSP program compared with usual care in an&#xD;
           integrated health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. total direct costs and clinical outcomes in the OPCSP program compared with usual care&#xD;
           in an integrated health care system.&#xD;

    <description>This was an open labelled randomised study. Rheumatic diseases patients were recruited and arbitrarily divided into the intervention group (usual care plus OPCSP) and the non-intervention group (usual care only). Those enrolled in the research were scheduled for follow-up for eight consecutive visits. Improvements in lab results and direct costs were compared longitudinally (pre and post analysis) between the groups.</description>
