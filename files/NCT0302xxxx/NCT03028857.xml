  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to determine if providing a nutritional supplement, phosphatidylcholine, to&#xD;
      pregnant women improves early brain development with improved brain-related development&#xD;
      during the first four years of life. Participating pregnant women will receive either&#xD;
      phosphatidylcholine or a placebo from approximately 16 weeks gestation through birth. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is the child's behavior at four years of age as reported by the primary&#xD;
      caregiver. Secondary outcomes include motor development, socio-emotional development,&#xD;
      language development, and cognitive development. Potential contributors beyond the&#xD;
      supplement, including maternal stress and placental function will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Choline is an essential nutrient that can be found in foods, such as egg yolks, liver, and&#xD;
      other meats. It is important for the composition and repair of normal cellular membranes,&#xD;
      normal brain function, and normal cardiovascular function. Research has suggested that the&#xD;
      presence of adequate amounts of choline during pregnancy and breastfeeding can help ensure&#xD;
      healthy fetal brain development. Additionally, adequate prenatal choline levels may have&#xD;
      long-lasting positive effects on cognitive function, including memory. However, sufficient&#xD;
      research has not been done on the effects of choline on pregnant women and their unborn&#xD;
      babies. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of taking choline supplements&#xD;
      during pregnancy, and whether taking choline during pregnancy will have an effect on infant&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo&#xD;
      or 1250 mg of choline daily throughout pregnancy, until delivery. Vital signs will be taken,&#xD;
      potential side effects will be assessed, and study medication will be given at each visit.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken at enrollment and approximately at weeks 20, 28, 32. Children&#xD;
      will be followed and assessed until 4 years of age.&#xD;
