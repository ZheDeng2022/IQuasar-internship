      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quitting smoking is hard. It is easy to relapse. Smokers may think of temptation to smoke as&#xD;
      a threat if they think it suggests that they are unable to meet the challenges of stopping.&#xD;
      When people feel such a threat to their sense of self-identity, they may get defensive. They&#xD;
      may want to downplay the importance of quitting. This could make them try to quit less.&#xD;
      Self-affirmation is a process of focusing on strengths and values. This can offset threats to&#xD;
      the self and promote healthier behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore people s values, smoking attitudes, and smoking behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study takes place entirely on a mobile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give their age, gender, data about their smoking habits, and desired quit&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then they will get different texts about quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer follow-up surveys 1 and 3 months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking is challenging and relapse is likely. Smokers may perceive temptation to&#xD;
      smoke as threatening if they think it suggests that they are unable to meet the challenges of&#xD;
      cessation. When individuals experience such a threat to their sense of self-identity (e.g.,&#xD;
      to their sense that they have integrity and/ or competence), they often respond defensively.&#xD;
      Individuals have a tendency to react defensively to information that informs them that their&#xD;
      behavior increases risk for a particular disease or negative health consequences.&#xD;
      Self-affirmation a process through which individuals focus on their strengths and values can&#xD;
      offset threats to the self and promote healthier behaviors, including smoking cessation. To&#xD;
      the extent that relapse or difficulty quitting is perceived as a threat to self-identity,&#xD;
      when individuals are presented with the opportunity to self-affirm they may perceive failure&#xD;
      as less threatening, mitigating the motivation to downplay the importance of quitting.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that self-affirmation can be feasibly incorporated into an&#xD;
      existing smoking cessation text message-based intervention, and may bolster cessation rates&#xD;
      among users motivated to quit smoking. Here, we propose to extend that research by examining&#xD;
      whether the addition of self-affirmation text messages to a smoking cessation app (Smoke Free&#xD;
      United Kingdom (UK) promotes smoking cessation, compared to standard of care (i.e., existing&#xD;
      app content only). Importantly, self-affirmation material will be incorporated into the&#xD;
      current app and will not change the goals or nature of the original texting program. We&#xD;
      predict that the individuals in the self-affirmation condition will be more likely to report&#xD;
      being smoke-free at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups.&#xD;
