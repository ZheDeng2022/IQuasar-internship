  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, single-blind, randomized, multicenter, therapeutic clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the feasibility of enrolling infants and toddlers (9 months to 36&#xD;
      months) with sickle cell anemia (SCA; HbSS or HbSβ^0thalassemia), regardless of disease&#xD;
      severity, to a therapeutic trial. A prior clinical trial at St. Jude Children's Research&#xD;
      Hospital (SJCRH) (BABYHUG, NCT01783990) demonstrated that a fixed dose (20 mg/kg/day) of&#xD;
      hydroxyurea was safe and effective in decreasing SCA-related complications in very young&#xD;
      children (9-18 months), and largely due to these findings, hydroxyurea is recommended to be&#xD;
      offered to all children (≥9 months old) with SCA, independent of disease severity.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, children in the treatment arm of BABYHUG continued to experience vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      symptoms and to incur organ damage. In clinical trials of older children with SCA,&#xD;
      intensification of hydroxyurea to a maximum tolerated dosage (MTD), defined by mild to&#xD;
      moderate myelosuppression, may be associated with improved laboratory parameters compared to&#xD;
      fixed lower-dosing, but the clinical benefits gained from dose intensification have not been&#xD;
      described. Therefore, in this trial, children in the standard treatment arm will receive a&#xD;
      fixed dose of hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg/day), and participants in the experimental arm will&#xD;
      receive hydroxyurea intensified to MTD, defined by a goal absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of&#xD;
      1500-3000 cells/µL. This trial aims to establish a multicenter infrastructure that will&#xD;
      identify, enroll and randomize very young children (9-36 months) to receive fixed dose versus&#xD;
      intensified-dose hydroxyurea in a single blinded manner, and to obtain prospective pilot data&#xD;
      comparing the clinical and laboratory outcomes between the treatment arms to facilitate&#xD;
      design of a definitive phase III trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will initially receive hydroxyurea at a dose of ~20 mg/kg/day in an open&#xD;
      label fashion for eight weeks (± 2 weeks) prior to randomization. Participants will receive&#xD;
      monthly medical evaluations (every 4 ± 2 weeks) where they will have height and weight&#xD;
      measurements, medical history, physical examination, and medication adherence assessments.&#xD;
      During these monthly visits complete blood counts with absolute reticulocyte count will be&#xD;
      monitored. Hemoglobin electrophoresis, complete serum chemistries, urinalysis, lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase and quality of life measurements will be obtained every 20 (±2) weeks.&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound velocities will be obtained at study entry (in&#xD;
      participants ≥2 years of age) and study exit. Participants randomized to receive hydroxyurea&#xD;
      at MTD will have their dose increased by 5 mg/kg/day every 8 weeks, in the absence of&#xD;
      toxicity, until a goal ANC of 1500-3000 cells/µL is achieved, up to a maximum of 35&#xD;
      mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive their assigned treatment for 48 weeks (± 3 weeks). Participants will&#xD;
      be in the study for a total of 56 weeks (± 3 weeks) and have 14 clinic visits to the St. Jude&#xD;
      outpatient Hematology Clinic during that time. After the 56 weeks, participants will be&#xD;
      followed for an additional 30 days for side effects and will then be taken off study.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study planned to enroll up to 65 children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) to get 50 randomized in a 27-month period. All eligible participants who consented were enrolled on the study. The duration of the study is based on sample size of 50 patients randomized and/or 27-month period, whichever comes first. Actual recruitment occurred 5/3/2017 to 6/3/2019 and 58 subjects were enrolled to yield 51 randomized at 4 clinical centers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants without toxicity or with toxicity which requires discontinuation of hydroxyurea (HU) but resolved and participant continuing HU during those eight weeks (±2 weeks), were randomized to receive standard or intensive therapy based on a block randomization (block size of 4 used in each stratum) stratified by clinical center and by baseline age of the participant (9 to &lt;24 months and 24 to 36 months) because of the natural physiologic decline of HbF with increasing age.</pre_assignment_details>
