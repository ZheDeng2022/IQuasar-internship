    <textblock>
      This study will assess the immunomodulatory activity of entinostat in patients with advanced&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma receiving the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab. The overall hypothesis is&#xD;
      that entinostat will increase the immune response and anti-tumor effect induced by the PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibition by suppressing Treg function. We have chosen renal cell carcinoma that has been&#xD;
      reported to respond to PD1/PD-L 1 inhibition. The schedule of entinostat is based on our&#xD;
      previous experience with this agent. Based on our working hypothesis that low dose HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitors will have a suppressive function on Tregs but not on T effector cells, the&#xD;
      starting dose of entinostat will be 1 mg and will be escalated up to 5 mg rather than the 10&#xD;
      mg dose. The combination also with bevacizumab will provide an effective VEGF inhibition that&#xD;
      may potentiate the immune response and anti-tumor effect induced by atezolizumab. The&#xD;
      proposed dose and schedule for atezolizumab and bevacizumab has been shown to be well&#xD;
      tolerated in prior Phase/I/II studies and is currently tested in a Phase III randomized study&#xD;
      in patients with renal cell carcinoma with sunitinib as a control arm. The highest proposed&#xD;
      dose level for entinostat (5 mg) represents 50% of the recommended Phase II dose for this&#xD;
      compound as a single agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase l/II, open-label, safety, pharmacodynamics and efficacy study of atezolizumab&#xD;
      in combination with entinostat and bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. This clinical study will be composed of a Dose Finding Phase (Phase I) and a&#xD;
      two-stage Phase (Phase II) portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1 Combination Phase), patients will be treated with oral entinostat every 7 days,&#xD;
      with bevacizumab at the fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks and with atezolizumab at the&#xD;
      fixed dose of 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Each cycle length is 21 days. Three dose levels of&#xD;
      entinostat will be tested in 3-design patient cohorts according to the 3 + 3 standard design&#xD;
      (1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg). For the Dose Finding Phase, the starting dose level of pill be 1 mg by&#xD;
      mouth every 7 days. The first dose level will have a minimum of 3 patients treated (unless&#xD;
      the first 2 patients experience DLT(s) before the 3rd patient is enrolled). DLTs attributable&#xD;
      to entinostat and/or bevacizumab and/or atezolizumab will be evaluated during the first 21&#xD;
      days of the combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a DLT occurs in 1 patient treated at the starting dose level, a minimum of 3 additional&#xD;
      patients will be treated at this dose level. If DLTs occur in 2 or more of the first 6&#xD;
      patients, the study will be terminated. If a DLT occurs in 1 out of 6 patients, 3 additional&#xD;
      patients will be treated at the next dose level (level 2). If no DLTs occur at the starting&#xD;
      dose level 1, 3 additional patients will be treated at the next dose level (level 2). If no&#xD;
      DLTs occur at the dose level 2, 3 additional patients will be treated at the next dose level&#xD;
      (level 3). If no DLTs occur at dose level 3, this dose level will be recommended for the&#xD;
      Phase II portion of the study. Patients who experience Grade ≥ 3 toxicity and recover to ≤&#xD;
      Grade 1 (or to pretreatment baseline level toxicity) may continue treatment at the next lower&#xD;
      level. The Phase II Dose will be RP2D of entinostat (i.e., the highest tested dose that is&#xD;
      declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and Sponsor-Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D is identified, the Phase II portion (Simon's two stage design) will be opened.&#xD;
      During Phase II, Cohorts A and B will have a Run-In period with entinostat for one cycle&#xD;
      followed by atezolizumab and bevacizumab for the second cycle, and then the Combination&#xD;
      Phase. The reason for the Run-In period is to obtain data on the immunomodulatory effects of&#xD;
      entinostat separately from bevacizumab and atezolizumab. The run-in period will be optional&#xD;
      for patients, including those who are rapidly progressing, or if it is in the patient's best&#xD;
      interest clinically as determined by the treating physician's discretion. In Stage I, 27&#xD;
      patients with prior treatments will be enrolled in two Phase II cohorts: 18 treatment naïve&#xD;
      (anti-PD1/PDL1 naïve) patients (Cohort A), and 9 anti-PD1 resistant (defined as patients who&#xD;
      have been on PD1 inhibitors for at least 3 months and have progressed by either clinical or&#xD;
      radiographic assessment) patients (Cohort B). If ≥ 5 responses are observed and confirmed in&#xD;
      Cohort A, Stage II will be conducted with 15 additional patients. In Cohort B, if any&#xD;
      patients has a response that is observed and confirmed, Stage II will be conducted with 7&#xD;
      additional patients. Patients will be treated on Cohort B with the same combination therapy&#xD;
      as in Cohort A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B is a pilot arm which aims to test atezolizumab in anti-PD1 resistant patients. If&#xD;
      there is no response to atezolizumab, then the RP2D dose of entinostat will be added to the&#xD;
      standard dose of atezolizumab. If there is a response to atezolizumab, patients will continue&#xD;
      to be treated with atezolizumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RP2D is the dose of entinostat, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab in combination chosen for&#xD;
      further clinical development. Further experience in the Dose Expansion Cohort may result in a&#xD;
      RP2D dose lower than the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Phase I: To assess the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab in combination&#xD;
           with entinostat and bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary Phase II: To assess the objective response rate of atezolizumab in combination&#xD;
           with entinostat and bevacizumab in anti-PD 1 naïve patients and atezolizumab in&#xD;
           combination with entinostat in anti-PD 1 resistant patients with advanced renal cell&#xD;
           carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secondary: To assess the objective response rate (Phase I only), progression-free&#xD;
           survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlative: To characterize PD-L1/2, immune cell subsets, and miRs in tumor and/or&#xD;
           blood in correlation with response.&#xD;
