  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will evaluate the effect of high-dose, intermittent sunitinib&#xD;
      versus treatment with lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that sunitinib, when given in a high-dose, intermittent schedule,&#xD;
      will achieve adequate concentration levels in the tumor and will, besides its anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      properties, inhibit gliomagenesis by inhibition of multiple kinases.&#xD;

      Study design: Multicenter, phase II/III, randomized clinical trial with high-dose sunitinib&#xD;
      versus lomustine (CCNU) in patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Sunitinib, when given in a high-dose, intermittent schedule, may exhibit improved&#xD;
      efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM with an acceptable toxicity profile, compared to&#xD;
      lomustine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the effect of high-dose sunitinib versus lomustine on six-month&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS6) in patients with recurrent GBM, using the RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of high-dose sunitinib on overall survival (OS 9, OS 12) in&#xD;
           patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the objective radiological response rate, using the RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess toxicity, using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
           version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess patient-oriented criteria: steroid use and health-related quality of life&#xD;
           (reported by patients and caregivers/relatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the potential value of blood markers for molecular diagnostics, disease and&#xD;
           response monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore if MGMT promoter methylation status modulates the response to sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: After randomization, 100 patients will be divided equally over two treatment&#xD;
      groups and will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (experimental arm): Sunitinib, 700 mg administered orally every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (control arm): Lomustine 110 mg/m2, taken orally on day 1 every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease will be assessed by MRI according to an uniform neuro-oncology protocol every 6 weeks&#xD;
      for the first 6 months and every 12 weeks until documented progression. Safety profile of&#xD;
      both treatment strategies will be assessed separately for each cycle of therapy and every 12&#xD;
      weeks after the end of treatment if adverse effects have not resolved or are newly emerging.&#xD;
      Furthermore, quality of life assessment takes place every 6 weeks using questionnaires.&#xD;

             phenobarbital and phenytoin. If a patient uses one or more of these specific&#xD;
             antiepileptic drugs, they must switch to an antiepileptic drug that does not interact&#xD;
             with cytochrome P450 (CYP450) liver enzymes, such as levetiracetam, prior to the start&#xD;
             of study treatment.&#xD;
