  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (BioFire; a bioMerieux company), has developed a multiplexed&#xD;
      molecular-based in vitro diagnostic platform for infectious disease testing known as the&#xD;
      FilmArray. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) EZ is a test designed for use with the&#xD;
      FilmArray 2.0 EZ Configuration instrument that identifies common bacterial and viral&#xD;
      microorganisms associated with respiratory tract infections from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)&#xD;
      specimen collected in viral transport media (VTM). The RP EZ was granted CLIA-waived&#xD;
      classification by the FDA in October 2016 and is the first highly-multiplexed molecular test&#xD;
      to receive this designation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to measure patient outcomes following implementation of the RP&#xD;
      EZ test and to also gather data about physician office workflow and user interactions with&#xD;
      the device. These data will be used to understand how the adoption of such tests may&#xD;
      influence patient care in the CLIA-waived setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FilmArray RP EZ may offer improvements over conventional CLIA-waived testing for&#xD;
      respiratory infections. Molecular-based testing provides increased sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity relative to current clinical reference methods and multiplexed panels offer a&#xD;
      greater breadth of organism identification and diagnostic yield than is available using&#xD;
      standard methods available in the CLIA-waived setting. Because of these attributes, the&#xD;
      results from this test have the potential to enable clinicians to more accurately diagnose&#xD;
      and treat respiratory illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the sensitive, specific, and comprehensive results provided by&#xD;
      FilmArray RP EZ will allow clinicians to more rapidly diagnose respiratory illness and&#xD;
      implement appropriate therapy, as well as provide subjects with appropriate expectations&#xD;
      about their course of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This interventional clinical trial that will be initiated during the 2016-2017 respiratory&#xD;
      illness season to measure the utility of FilmArray RP EZ when implemented in an outpatient&#xD;
      care setting. At least three different outpatient or urgent care clinics within the UCLA&#xD;
      Health system will be selected for participation. Subjects will be randomized into two groups&#xD;
      within each site. The control group will receive standard of care according to the subject's&#xD;
      provider's determination. The intervention group will receive testing with FilmArray RP EZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include (but are not limited to) total healthcare costs, antimicrobial&#xD;
      prescription rates, timeliness, and appropriateness of therapy, clinician attitudes towards&#xD;
      laboratory test capabilities, and subject satisfaction with their healthcare encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As specimens will be collected specifically for this research study, written informed&#xD;
      consent, assent, and/or parental permission will be obtained from all study participants.&#xD;
