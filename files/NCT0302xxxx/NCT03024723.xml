  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of Upper airway obstruction (UAO) during anesthesia shares many similarities&#xD;
      with the upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway&#xD;
      patent with near 100% success in patients with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia.&#xD;
      The investigators hypotheses that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients&#xD;
      under anesthesia. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of nCPAP on maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general&#xD;
      anesthesia compared with CPAP administering face mask.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is an unpredictable and frequently occurring complication&#xD;
      during induction of general anesthesia. Since obese patients are more vulnerable to develop&#xD;
      airway obstruction either during sleep1 or under anesthesia, and the segment of obese&#xD;
      individuals in the entire population keep growing, difficult airway management under&#xD;
      anesthesia becomes even more challenging than ever. The most serious event related to&#xD;
      difficult airway management under anesthesia is &quot;cannot intubate, cannot ventilate&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Obese patients are a&#xD;
      high-risk group for perioperative airway catastrophe and prone to develop progressively&#xD;
      narrower pharyngeal airways due to an increase of soft tissue volume surrounding the&#xD;
      pharyngeal airway. The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the&#xD;
      upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near&#xD;
      100% success in patients with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypotheses that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients&#xD;
      under anesthesia. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of nCPAP on maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;

    <description>This group of the subjects will start with nasal mask or face mask CPAP ventilation. The anesthesia care team does whatever they routinely do, including adjusting the patient's position (as to reverse Trendelenburg position), pre-oxygenation, pre-medication, as usual with intravenous anesthetics and analgesics. When the patient is apneic, CPAP ventilation will be initiated with pressure support mode at PIP 25 cmH2O, ventilation rate 10 BPM, PEEP 10 cmH2O and slope 1 second for 1 min. If ventilation is effective in one of the first three breaths, the ventilation will continue for 1 min. If effective ventilation cannot be produced in any of the first three breaths, the study will be terminated and routine care will be provided.</description>

    <description>The area under the airway pressure curve (AUC) defined as the area from the baseline pressure to the peak pressure during inspiration was calculated for evaluating pressure applied during inspiration. The AUC is a reflection of the change in mean airway pressure.</description>
