    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to either one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of care sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Audiovisual distraction during surgery and in the recovery room using video goggles and&#xD;
           headphones; patients can choose a movie from a preexisting library&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and anesthesia regimen will be standardized&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before consent patients will be thoroughly informed about possible risks or benefits and&#xD;
      about their possibilities to end the study at any time point or to ask for additional&#xD;
      sedation if they feel uncomfortable or anxious. After they consent, they will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either receive standard sedation (Group 1) or audiovisual distraction (Group 2).&#xD;
      Each group will consist of 30 patients. The randomization schedule will be created by a&#xD;
      member of the Healthcare Research Institute using SAS software, who is not otherwise involved&#xD;
      in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of care sedation with an initial dose of midazolam in preparation for the&#xD;
           administration of the neuraxial anesthesia; propofol infusion titrated to effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Audiovisual distraction during surgery and in the recovery room using video goggles and&#xD;
           headphones; patients can choose a movie from a preexisting library; with an initial dose&#xD;
           of midazolam in preparation for the administration of the neuraxial anesthesia,&#xD;
           additional sedation with midazolam in 1 mg increments if requested by the patient or&#xD;
           deemed necessary by the anesthesia provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative anesthesia regimen will be standardized:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be monitored according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
           standard, receive either a radial arterial line or non-invasive blood pressure&#xD;
           measurement according to the preferences of the anesthesia provider and O2 via nasal&#xD;
           cannula or face mask in the operation room and the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ondansetron,decadron and ketorolac may be administered as per clinical judgment of the&#xD;
           attending anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in both groups will receive neuraxial anesthesia. The attending&#xD;
           anesthesiologist is free to add an ultrasound guided peripheral nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neuraxial anesthesia (combined spinal-epidural, epidural or spinal) as preferred by&#xD;
                the attending anesthesiologist. Decadron may be used as in addition to the local&#xD;
                anesthetic if the anesthesia provider wishes to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If a peripheral nerve block is performed the appropriate amount of bupivacaine will&#xD;
                be administered under ultrasound-guidance as a single shot.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In case an epidural catheter was placed patients will receive a patient controlled&#xD;
                epidural analgesia immediately after arrival at the recovery room for postoperative&#xD;
                pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opioids and other medications with sedative or respiratory depressant side effects that&#xD;
           are not specifically mentioned above should be omitted (if possible without harm for the&#xD;
           patient) Patients in the audiovisual distraction group will choose a movie, start&#xD;
           watching it in the holding area and continue watching it in the operation room as well&#xD;
           as the first 30 min in the recovery room. Audiovisual equipment will be removed for&#xD;
           transfers or at patient request.&#xD;
