  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From 3 large patient databases, patients diagnosed with AMD who have never taken&#xD;
      levodopa(L-DOPA) containing medications have a mean age of diagnosis at 71 years. Patients&#xD;
      who have been treated with L-DOPA containing medications have a mean age of diagnosis of AMD&#xD;
      at 79 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA binds to GPR143 in the retinal pigment epithelium, and releases PEDF, which protects&#xD;
      the retina and downregulates VEGF, which is the cause of neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of carbidopa-levodopa in patients&#xD;
      with Neovascular AMD, and measure the effects on visual acuity and retinal abnormalities due&#xD;
      to &quot;wet&quot; (neovascular) AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of carbidopa-levodopa in patients&#xD;
      with Neovascular AMD who are already on treatment with anti-VEGF intraocular injections, and&#xD;
      measure the effects on visual acuity, retinal abnormalities due to &quot;wet&quot; AMD, and document&#xD;
      the number of anti-VEGF injections required during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness, in individuals&#xD;
      over the age of 50, in the developed world. AMD becomes more common as people age, and is&#xD;
      more common in lightly pigmented individuals. AMD appears more common in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease, than in those without. The AREDS nutritional supplements are effective&#xD;
      in slowing the progress of intermediate AMD(5). Most AMD is &quot;dry AMD&quot;, which progresses&#xD;
      relatively slowly and may impair vision, but usually does not lead to legal blindness. There&#xD;
      are two forms of AMD, &quot;wet AMD&quot; and geographic atrophy (GA), that can cause more profound&#xD;
      vision loss. In aggregate they occur in about 25% patients with AMD. Wet AMD is due to new&#xD;
      growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina. The new blood vessels are believed to be&#xD;
      due to an excessive release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelium(RPE) cells. Wet AMD is now effectively treated with intraocular injections&#xD;
      of VEGF inhibitors. Geographic Atrophy, the other form of advanced AMD, represents focal&#xD;
      death of the RPE cells and overlying neurosensory retina. There is no current treatment for&#xD;
      GA. It is suspected that GA is due in part to a localized inflammatory response, damage to&#xD;
      RPE cells and loss of RPE cell function. It may also be speculated that stimulation of RPE&#xD;
      cells to release a potent neurotrophic factor, pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) may&#xD;
      slow progression of GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, Dr. Brian McKay identified a receptor, G protein coupled receptor #143(GPR143), on&#xD;
      the surface of RPE cells and discovered that L-DOPA was the natural ligand or stimulator of&#xD;
      GPR143. Dr McKay showed that treatment of RPE cells with exogenous L-DOPA resulted in the&#xD;
      release of additional PEDF. In subsequent work Dr McKay's group also showed that L-DOPA&#xD;
      stimulation of PEDF in RPE cells was also associated with a decrease in VEGF. Thus, Dr McKay&#xD;
      hypothesized that exogenous L-DOPA may prevent the onset of AMD or progression to wet AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, Dr McKay and his associates published a paper that showed that patients, who had&#xD;
      been treated with L-DOPA, had a delay in the onset of AMD by 8 years, compared to patients&#xD;
      who had not been treated with L-DOPA. In addition, those who had AMD and went on to develop&#xD;
      wet AMD, did so 5 years later than those with no history of L-DOPA treatment. L-DOPA is an&#xD;
      intermediate in the pigmentation pathway. Dr McKay and his associates suggested that the&#xD;
      reason darkly pigmented races do not get AMD nearly as frequently as lighter pigmented races,&#xD;
      is that they produce more pigment, and thus more L-DOPA to stimulate GPR143 on RPE cells.&#xD;
      According to this hypothesis, the stimulated RPE cells release PEDF and decrease VEGF, which&#xD;
      together are responsible for the protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacology of L-DOPA and carbidopa:&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA is formed by 3-hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine-3-monooxygenase (tyrosinase).(18)&#xD;
      The primary metabolic pathway of L-DOPA is decarboxylation by amino acid decarboxylase to&#xD;
      dopamine, which is responsible for most, but not all, of its pharmacologic effects and&#xD;
      toxicity. When carbidopa is administered with L-DOPA, systemic levels of L-DOPA double and&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) L-DOPA increases from about 1% of the administered dose to about&#xD;
      4%. Levodopa freely passes from the systemic circulation into the retina and brain, but&#xD;
      dopamine and carbidopa do not. Adverse events are markedly decreased when carbidopa is&#xD;
      administered with L-DOPA, because systemic levels of the toxic metabolite of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      dopamine, are markedly reduced. In most patients, 25 mg of carbidopa is sufficient to control&#xD;
      side effects of 100 mg of L-DOPA, primarily nausea, by 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA is the natural ligand for GPR143 in the RPE cells. The Investigators' intent is to&#xD;
      increase the L-DOPA available to RPE surface receptors (GPR 143) while minimizing peripheral&#xD;
      toxicity. This concept is unique, because all other uses of L-DOPA rely on CNS conversion of&#xD;
      L-DOPA to dopamine, in order to produce the desired effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathogenesis of Neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excess VEGF is the mediator of the retinal neovascularization and other retinal pathological&#xD;
      changes in &quot;wet&quot; AMD. Intraocular injections of anti-VEGF antibodies is the standard of care&#xD;
      in &quot;Wet&quot; AMD. Several publications, including Lim et al, show that with careful monitoring of&#xD;
      the visual acuity and retinas of patients with wet AMD, if there is no progression, there are&#xD;
      no long-term adverse consequences of delaying initiation of anti-VEGF therapy for up to 4&#xD;
      weeks. The patients will all have had anti-VEGF therapy initiated. The patients will be&#xD;
      monitored at monthly intervals, for up to 3 months, for indications for administration of&#xD;
      anti-VEGF injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there are no established animal models for AMD, and L-DOPA has a good safety profile in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease, the Investigators propose a&#xD;
      prospective experiment to determine the safety and tolerability of L-DOPA, in a population of&#xD;
      patients with AMD. The participants will be made aware of potential side effects of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      which are listed in the Informed Consent, during the consent process. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      elicited by questioning the participants at each visit. The participants will also be advised&#xD;
      to call the site, if they have any medical problem between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will also use this study to examine whether L-DOPA has a positive effect on&#xD;
      visual acuity and pathologic retinal changes of &quot;wet&quot; AMD. The parameters to be evaluated are&#xD;
      best corrected ETDRS visual acuity, macular thickness by spectral domain optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (SD OCT), new blood (hemorrhage) by direct retinal examination, or subjective&#xD;
      decrease in vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive open label, commercially available carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg, one&#xD;
      tablet once daily hs for one month, followed by one tablet dosed TID (three times daily), in&#xD;
      the morning, with supper and hs for one month, followed by two tablets dosed three times&#xD;
      daily, in the morning, with supper and hs for one month (100-600 mg of levodopa daily). This&#xD;
      is the equivalent of very low to moderate doses of carbidopa-levodopa in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (daily dose of levodopa 200-800 mg). Patients entering this study after&#xD;
      completing Study 001 will receive one month of the dose that he or she received in Study 001,&#xD;
      and one month each of any doses higher than the dose that he or she received in Study 001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the patient received carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg once daily in Study 001, he or she&#xD;
           will receive one month of treatment with each of the 3 daily doses of&#xD;
           carbidopa-levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient received carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg TID in Study 001, he or she will&#xD;
           receive one month of carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg TID, followed by one month of&#xD;
           carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg, 2 tablets TID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive an injection of anti-VEGF medication on the day carbidopa-levodopa&#xD;
      dosing begins in this study. Each patient will be evaluated at monthly (25-35 day) intervals&#xD;
      and injected or not, based upon the criteria listed below, which are based on clinical&#xD;
      practice standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for anti-VEGF injections&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have had at least one anti-VEGF intraocular injection prior to entering the&#xD;
      study. Additional injections will be based on: monthly evaluation of ETDRS visual acuity&#xD;
      (decrease of 5 letters from previous visit); increased macular thickness (compared to normal&#xD;
      and previous visit as measured by SD OCT; new blood (hemorrhage) on direct retinal&#xD;
      examination; or subjective decrease in vision. If any of these criteria are met, or if, in&#xD;
      the opinion of the Ophthalmologist, the patient requires anti-VEGF therapy, the patient will&#xD;
      have an anti-VEGF intraocular injection. If none of these criteria are met at visits 2, 3 or&#xD;
      4, with patient agreement, anti-VEGF injection will not be done, and the patient will be&#xD;
      reevaluated in 1 month. The study will end at Visit 5, and patients will begin standard of&#xD;
      care treatment with anti-VEGF injections. Patients who have completed Study 0001, Short term&#xD;
      effects of carbidopa-levodopa in Neovascular AMD, will be eligible to enroll in the current&#xD;
      study, Study 0002, Proof of Concept and Dose Ranging Study of carbidopa-levodopa in&#xD;
      Neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 52 completed Duration: up to 112 days of treatment. Primary Endpoint: A&#xD;
      statistically significant improvement (5 letters) by carbidopa-levodopa treatment in ETDRS&#xD;
      visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Informed Consent at Baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ophthalmic history and comprehensive eye examination; including visual acuity, wearing&#xD;
           any prescription lenses, using an EDTRS chart, in both eyes prior to randomization, and&#xD;
           ophthalmoscopic examination, and SD OCT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Repeat assessment of visual acuity using an EDTRS chart, ophthalmoscopic examination,&#xD;
           and SD OCT at monthly visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Demographics at Baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;

        7. Dispense study medication at visits 2, 3 and 4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Pill count at visits 3, 4 and 5;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Non-directed assessment of adverse events at each visit, including classification as to&#xD;
           severity, seriousness and body system.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Concomitant medications at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. If a patient had the baseline evaluation in Study 001, that will be used as the baseline&#xD;
           evaluation for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Descriptive statistics will be generated for, at a minimum, ETDRS visual acuity,&#xD;
      central retinal thickness, amount of intraretinal and subretinal fluid and presence of&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Within patient trajectories for these outcomes will be plotted, incorporating&#xD;
      information on dose and duration. Due to the small sample size, model-based analyses will be&#xD;
      considered only to be exploratory. Analysis of Variance may be conducted to relate logarithm&#xD;
      of dose and duration of treatment to the outcomes listed above.&#xD;
