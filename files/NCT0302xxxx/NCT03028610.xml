        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are premenopausal and aged 18 to 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have already consented to have their fibroids treated with the Acessa™ procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Desire pregnancy within two years following Acessa™ treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a normal endometrial cavity as delineated by sonohysterogram within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a uterine size relating to ≤14 weeks of pregnancy, as determined by palpatory&#xD;
             pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have fibroids identified by transvaginal ultrasound with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≤6 (six) fibroids of ≤5 cm at the major diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. a total uterine volume of no greater than 300 cc&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with type 2 fibroids are acceptable for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are current in their screening for cervical cancer precursors (i.e. PAP 1 or 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Are capable of providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Are willing and able to comply with all study tests, procedures, and assessment tools&#xD;
             during screening and up to 3 years post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Are able to pass a pre-operative health exam (ASA I-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who are currently undergoing fertility treatments (e.g. Clomid, IVF, etc.) or&#xD;
             who are planning such treatments may be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Have contraindications for laparoscopic surgery and/or general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have cervical myomas or Type 0 or Type 1 myomas. Type 0 and Type 1 myomas are excluded&#xD;
             as these are generally accessible to hysteroscopic approaches. Cervical myomas are&#xD;
             difficult to treat and present a greater risk of bladder or urethral injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have one or more Type 0 (completely intracavitary) or Type 1 resectable submucous&#xD;
             fibroids.&#xD;

             laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have known or suspected untreated intra-uterine adhesions or uterine septum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have previously undergone endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, or&#xD;
             uterine artery ligation/occlusion, high-intensity focused ultrasound, laparoscopic,&#xD;
             hysteroscopic or abdominal myomectomy, or any other uterine-preserving technique for&#xD;
             reduction of menstrual bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects taking platelet-inhibiting drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             (NSAIDs), aspirin, and clopidogrel&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Have had pelvic radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have a persistent and undiagnosed complex adnexal mass.Are unable to give informed&#xD;
