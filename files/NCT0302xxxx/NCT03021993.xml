    <measure>Objective response rate using pathological response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate: the sum of patients with either a pCR defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals present in the surgical specimen or partial pathologic response defined at least a 30% reduction in the size of the lesion in the surgical specimen. The reduction in size will be determined by comparing the pretreatment clinical measurements (the sum of the greatest axial measurement obtained with calipers at the time of initial evaluation) with the final pathologic measurements.</description>

             trigone, and buccal mucosa.&#xD;
