      It's prospective Cohort study to compare maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant females&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart disease is one of the most important medical complications during pregnancy as it is&#xD;
      one of the common, indirect obstetric causes of maternal death. Approximately 1% of&#xD;
      pregnancies are complicated by cardiac disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the most common acquired heart disease in pregnancy RHD is a&#xD;
      chronic acquired heart disorder resulting from acute rheumatic fever. In developing&#xD;
      countries, RHD continues to be a major cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality especially&#xD;
      among young adult females In pregnancies complicated with cardiac disorders, maternal and&#xD;
      perinatal mortality and morbidity depend on the type of disorder, the functional status of&#xD;
      the patient and the complications associated with the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitral stenosis is the most common valvular lesion in women with rheumatic heart disease,&#xD;
      remains the most common acquired valvular lesion in pregnant women and the most common cause&#xD;
      of maternal death from cardiac causes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mortality is not high in women, the rate of fetal morbidity rises with the severity&#xD;
      of mitral stenosis from 14% in pregnant patients with mild mitral stenosis , to 28% in women&#xD;
      with moderate mitral stenosis and 33% in pregnant patients with severe mitral stenosis (area&#xD;
      &lt;1.5 CM2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second and third trimesters, when maternal blood volume and cardiac output peak, heart&#xD;
      failure may occur in pregnant women with moderate or severe mitral stenosis, even in&#xD;
      previously asymptomatic women .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of prematurity in fetus of women with rheumatic heart diseases are 20% to 30%,&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction 5% to 20%, and stillbirth (1% to 3%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advancement in cardiology and obstetrics has provided major improvements in the&#xD;
      management of pregnant patients with cardiac disorders. Now we are facing more women with&#xD;
      previous history of surgical correction of rheumatic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal delivery is considered In women with mild mitral stenosis, and in patients with&#xD;
      moderate mitral stenosis ,. Even in women with severe MS in whom symptoms are New York Heart&#xD;
      Association (NYHA) Class I-II without pulmonary hypertension, vaginal delivery is considered&#xD;
      Cesarean section may be preferred in patients with severe mitral stenosis with NYHA Class&#xD;
      III-IV symptoms, or who have pulmonary hypertension despite medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic options for in women with rheumatic heart disease include both medical and&#xD;
      surgical alternatives, as well as catheter-based interventions The choice dependent on the&#xD;
      degree of valvular affection and patient symptoms. There are few studies that compare the&#xD;
      Maternal and fetal outcomes in women with rheumatic heart disease between patient with&#xD;
      corrected and uncorrected valve lesions&#xD;
