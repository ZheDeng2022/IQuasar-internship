      The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, feasibility study is to develop&#xD;
      data to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ExAblate 4000 treatment of benign intracranial&#xD;
      tumors which require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication of Use: Ablation of benign intracranial tumors in children and young adults which&#xD;

      The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, feasibility study is to develop&#xD;
      data to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ExAblate 4000 treatment of benign intracranial&#xD;
      tumors which require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication of Use: Ablation of benign intracranial tumors in children and young adults which&#xD;
      are ExAblate accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study intended to collect data for use in the development of future&#xD;
      studies. As such, no formal statistical hypothesis or hypothesis testing is proposed. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of managing benign brain&#xD;
      tumor size using ExAblate 4000 treatment of progressing benign intracranial tumors which&#xD;
      require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.&#xD;
