  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine whether exercise while receiving doxorubicin or&#xD;
      Adriamycin chemotherapy for breast cancer can reduce the cardio-toxic effects of this&#xD;
      treatment on the heart and improve other outcomes related to cancer such as tumor markers,&#xD;
      nausea, fatigue and the ability to tolerate chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot study that looks at the effect of exercise, while receiving&#xD;
      anthracycline therapy, on mitigating the cardio toxic effects of anthracyclines as assessed&#xD;
      by serial echocardiographic strain analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified during chart review in advance of a routine clinic&#xD;
      visit or during a routine clinic visit with a provider. Individuals will be approached by the&#xD;
      provider or study team to determine willingness to learn more about a study for which they&#xD;
      may be eligible. Discussions regarding study participation will take place privately and&#xD;
      individuals will be provided with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, potential participants may contact the study team directly. This contact may be&#xD;
      in the form of telephone, email, etc. Initial discussions regarding study participation may&#xD;
      take place by phone, email, etc., and individuals may be provided with the IRB approved&#xD;
      consent form and other IRB reviewed and approved materials (e.g., Patient Handout), as&#xD;
      applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, as much time as is needed to consider study participation will be allowed to&#xD;
      possible participants; resulting in multiple phone calls, visits, emails, or other&#xD;
      communication, as necessary. For individuals who choose to take part, informed consent will&#xD;
      happen as per the consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center,&#xD;
      Sibley Memorial Hospital and the community. The investigators anticipate that among roughly&#xD;
      60 subjects approached for enrollment, 30 will be part of the final study. Participants who&#xD;
      agree to participate will be asked to provide written consent. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized by an online system to one of the following two groups in a 1:2 ratio. Group&#xD;
      1(Usual care group) will receive a fitness tracker and flyers that reference the American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for exercise and&#xD;
      physical activity for the general population. In addition to fitness tracker and flyers,&#xD;
      Group 2 (10,000 steps group) will receive additional messages and phone calls for motivation.&#xD;
      This group of participants will also be asked to take part in 30 minutes of continuous&#xD;
      exercise daily as part of their intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For motivation, messages will be sent to study participants in group 2 via the messaging&#xD;
      center in the Under Armour application three times a week. With the application, study&#xD;
      participant will receive a phone alert and an email message to which they may respond if&#xD;
      needed. The frequency of messaging will be increased for participants who fail to meet their&#xD;
      goals for three consecutive days. In addition to the Under Armour application, participants&#xD;
      will be provided with a log sheet for recording their daily steps, whether 30 minutes of&#xD;
      continuous activity daily was completed and the type of the activity done for the 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Group two study subjects will also receive a weekly call to assess for side effects and&#xD;
      provide additional encouragement. Log sheets will be collected during oncology clinic visits&#xD;
      and the aforementioned intervention will be continued for the duration of their chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. Group 1 study participants will be assessed for side effects through a phone call&#xD;
      every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, women will be given an Under Armour band that will monitor daily steps, amount&#xD;
      of sleep and heart rate. Participants will be asked to download the Under Armour application&#xD;
      to their mobile phones so the data from their bands can be synced with the application daily.&#xD;
      For the intervention, study subjects will be asked to achieve a goal of 10,000 steps a day&#xD;
      and to engage in 30 minutes of continuous exercise every day and this can be any form of&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who agree to participate will be invited to the Johns Hopkins Hospital medical&#xD;
      campus where all the testing will be performed. The investigators expect to complete the&#xD;
      study in 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants who agree to participate will have the following assessments performed at&#xD;
      baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Cardiopulmonary Exercise Stress Test done using the standard protocol and supervised&#xD;
           by an exercise physiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 2D echocardiogram. The echocardiogram will include assessment of strain using speckle&#xD;
           tracking and tissue Doppler and the determination of systolic ejection time. All&#xD;
           patients routinely have an echocardiogram performed prior to the initiation of&#xD;
           cardio-toxic chemotherapy such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin), trastuzumab (Herceptin) and&#xD;
           pertuzumab (Perjeta), however, for the study, strain analysis will be performed off line&#xD;
           on the images obtained during the clinically indicated baseline echocardiogram.&#xD;
           Echocardiograms will be performed by experienced sonographers and on the same model echo&#xD;
           machine to reduce variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bone densitometry assessment via a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure total and&#xD;
           regional body composition in the frontal plane to determine bone, fat and fat-free mass.&#xD;
           The Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan takes about 8-10 minutes. The total radiation&#xD;
           dose is approximately 1 millirem, which is very small.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Muscle strength will be measured using a hand grip tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Habitual activity levels will be assessed using the Rapid Assessment of Physical&#xD;
           Activity questionnaire, which categorizes activity levels on a scale from 1-7 (sedentary&#xD;
           to active).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quality of life will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast&#xD;
           survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Fatigue level will be performed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom&#xD;
           Inventory-Short Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. All patients routinely have blood work collected, and as part of this research protocol,&#xD;
           the investigators will also collect blood to determine baseline tumor markers (&#xD;
           high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, Insulin-like growth factor 1, interleukin -6,&#xD;
           interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, leptin, adiponectin, estradiol, DNA&#xD;
           extraction, lymphocyte telomere length) and cardiac biomarkers (high sensitivity&#xD;
           troponin, troponin, pro-brain natriuretic peptide). The investigators will also collect&#xD;
           and store blood in order to keep open the possibility of doing a more extensive study to&#xD;
           look at any future genes that might be related to the phenotypes in this study (cancer,&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy, exercise response, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Cardiac history will be obtained at recruitment, including clinical risk factors for&#xD;
           heart disease (hypertension, diabetes and smoking history) and participants will be&#xD;
           evaluated throughout the study for any cardiac symptoms especially those of Heart&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the above assessments will all be performed at baseline and repeated within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      the women completing their anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The investigators will also&#xD;
      track the clinical echocardiograms obtained at 12 months, but these results are not required&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies: Serum troponin levels will be checked with each cycle of chemotherapy. Height&#xD;
      will be measured upon recruitment and weight and blood pressure will be measured at the time&#xD;
      of each echocardiogram.&#xD;
