  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) and serum leptin levels at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis of ovarian, primary peritoneal, and/or fallopian tube cancer as well as vitamin D&#xD;
      receptor mutation status (FokI SNP genotype). The study will evaluate the impact of vitamin D&#xD;
      repletion on serum vitamin D levels, serum leptin levels, and treatment-related morbidity in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will contain 2 cohorts: those with normal serum 25(OH)D and those with low serum&#xD;
      25(OH)D at enrollment. The study will take place in women with ovarian, primary peritoneal,&#xD;
      and fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have given written consent to enroll in the study will have a serum 25(OH)D&#xD;
      levels, serum leptin levels, and vitamin D receptor FokI single nucleotide polymorphism&#xD;
      analyzed at the time of diagnosis. Patients with vitamin D deficiency will be prescribed&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation according to current guidelines. Treatment with cholecalciferol&#xD;
      will not impact cancer therapy. Participants treatment course information will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively, but will not be dictated by this study. Serum 25(OH)D and leptin levels will&#xD;
      be collected again at the completion of primary therapy, 6 months after the completion of&#xD;
      primary therapy, and at the time of disease recurrence. If patients remain vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient at any of these follow-up time points, they will be referred to an endocrinologist&#xD;
      for further work-up and treatment of their vitamin D deficiency. Data collection will&#xD;
      continue for up to 1 year after enrollment.&#xD;
