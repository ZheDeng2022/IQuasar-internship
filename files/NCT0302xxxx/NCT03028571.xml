  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the null hypothesis that there will be no changes in the&#xD;
      insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) in response to autonomic&#xD;
      blockade. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to determine the role of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system in hepatic insulin resistance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will test the null hypothesis that there will be no changes&#xD;
      in the insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) in response to&#xD;
      autonomic blockade. The investigators will measure EGP at baseline (EGPBsl) and during the&#xD;
      last 30 minutes of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (EGPClamp) on two different occasions&#xD;
      (intact and Blocked study days). A double blinded randomize cross-over design will be used.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to either the intact or blocked days and a month later will be&#xD;
      crossed-over to the other arm. The investigator performing the analysis will also be blinded&#xD;
      to the treatments received. At baseline in both study days it is expected to see any&#xD;
      differences since the same subject will serve as his own control. During the clamp, insulin&#xD;
      suppresses EGP. In obese insulin resistant subjects this suppression should be blunted. If&#xD;
      the hypothesis is correct, it is expected an improvement in the suppression by insulin of EGP&#xD;
      during autonomic blockade only. For this study, the primary endpoint therefore, will be the&#xD;
      EGP during the clamp between the intact and blocked days.&#xD;
