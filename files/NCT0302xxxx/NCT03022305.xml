    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular realignment of the pelvis bones will be more&#xD;
      effective in improving range of motion and torque production at the shoulder joint than&#xD;
      traditional exercises for improving hip internal rotation and adduction range of motion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current literature shows a relationship between hip joint flexibility and shoulder range of&#xD;
      motion and torque production in athletes and the general population. It is well established&#xD;
      that limited hip joint internal rotation and adduction, specifically in baseball players,&#xD;
      results in limited trunk rotation during pitching phase of throwing. Due to restricted&#xD;
      rotation range at the hip joint, athletes try to compensate for the diminished rotational&#xD;
      momentum of the trunk by producing excessive external rotation at the shoulder joint during&#xD;
      the cocking phase of throwing. Such compensation results in laxity and overstressed shoulder&#xD;
      joint structures. In the long term, increased laxity of the joint affects normal muscle&#xD;
      mechanics and results in decreased torque production at the shoulder joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular realignment of the pelvis bones will be more&#xD;
      effective in improving range of motion and torque production at the shoulder joint than&#xD;
      traditional exercises for improving hip internal rotation and adduction range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An equal number of male and female subjects will be randomly assigned into one of three&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group one will have standard treatment for improving hip range of motion. Group two will&#xD;
      receive the new neuromuscular approach for improving pelvic alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group three will receive no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and the examiners will be blinded to subjects' group assignment. Researchers&#xD;
      will inform the subjects that they will be randomly assigned to a group with an exercise&#xD;
      program in one of two timeframes: immediately after the initial assessment or after a&#xD;
      one-week waiting period. Subjects in the control group will wait for one week, and then they&#xD;
      will be asked to be tested one more time to make sure that the subject's physical condition&#xD;
      did not change. At this time, these subjects will be informed of participation in the control&#xD;
      group and will be given the option of going through the treatment program of choice. The&#xD;
      neuromuscular treatment will also be offered to subjects in the standard group at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the data collection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pretest session, the examiner, using a standard goniometer, will measure each&#xD;
      participant's hip flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, internal rotation, and external&#xD;
      rotation passive range of motion in seated position. Then the examiner will assess each&#xD;
      participant's pelvic alignment using the Ober test and Thomas test. Shoulder range of motion&#xD;
      will also be assessed using the standard goniometry procedures in the seated position.&#xD;
      Shoulder torque production will be assessed using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be assessed using standard physical therapy techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip Joint Assessment Hip range of motion assessment Hip Flexion Hip Extension Hip abduction&#xD;
      Hip adduction Hip internal rotation Hip external rotation Ober test: [While the lower&#xD;
      extremity is still neutral in the transverse plane, the examiner will allow the leg to slowly&#xD;
      be lowered into full adduction. The test is considered positive if the knee joint does not&#xD;
      reach the examination table. This test will be conducted for both sides.] Thomas test: [While&#xD;
      holding the flexed knee to the chest, the participant will slowly lie back into a supine&#xD;
      position on the examination table with the opposite leg hanging freely over the edge of the&#xD;
      table. The test is considered positive if the free hanging leg is raised off the table with&#xD;
      subject lying in supine position. This test will be conducted for both lower extremities.]&#xD;
      Shoulder Joint Assessment Shoulder range of motion assessment Shoulder Flexion Shoulder&#xD;
      Extension Shoulder Abduction Shoulder Internal Rotation Shoulder External Rotation Assessment&#xD;
      of shoulder torque production: [Assessed by a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedure for group one:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the standard treatment group will perform 10 repetitions of active hip internal&#xD;
      rotation, external rotation, abduction, adduction, flexion and extension exercises daily,&#xD;
      under supervision of the treating therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment neuromuscular training for group two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in this group will perform the neuromuscular treatment for pelvic alignment, as&#xD;
      suggested by Postural Restoration Institute, once a day under treating therapist supervision&#xD;
      for one week. Subject will flex the hip and knee joints to 90Â° and will rest both feet&#xD;
      against the wall with a standard 4 - 6&quot; ball will be placed between the subject's knees. At&#xD;
      this position, the subject is instructed to squeeze the ball between the knees and to perform&#xD;
      an isometric hamstring muscle contraction (statically pulling the feet downward without&#xD;
      pressing to the wall). At this point, the subject will be instructed to perform a gentle&#xD;
      posterior pelvic tilt while avoiding abdominal muscle contraction. While maintaining this&#xD;
      position, the subject is instructed to take a deep breath in through the nose and then slowly&#xD;
      blow out into the balloon. The subject will be instructed to pause for 3 seconds while&#xD;
      pressing the tongue to the roof the mouth to prevent airflow out of the balloon. After the&#xD;
      4th breath in, the subject will pinch the neck of the balloon and remove it from the mouth.&#xD;
      Then subject will relax and take the feet off the wall. This exercise will be repeated daily&#xD;
      for one week (Monday through Friday). Following neuromuscular training exercise, the patient&#xD;
      will perform a coordinated hip internal and external rotation exercise in side lying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no treatment group will act as a control group. Both the standard and no treatment group&#xD;
      will be offered free neuromuscular treatment at the conclusion of posttest data collection.&#xD;
