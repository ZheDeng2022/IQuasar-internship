    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is the most commonly used and validated assessment for grading the severity of psoriasis in clinical studies. The PASI quantifies the severity and extent of the disease and weighs these with the percentage of body surface area (BSA) involvement. The percent area of involvement (BSA%) is estimated across 4 body areas; head (10%), upper limbs (20%), trunk (30%), and lower limbs (40%) and then transferred into a grade. The Investigator assesses the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions in each body area (each on a 5 point scale); 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, and 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72 with a higher score indicating increased disease severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 28</title>
        <description>The PASI is the most commonly used and validated assessment for grading the severity of psoriasis in clinical studies. The PASI quantifies the severity and extent of the disease and weighs these with the percentage of body surface area (BSA) involvement. The percent area of involvement (BSA%) is estimated across 4 body areas; head (10%), upper limbs (20%), trunk (30%), and lower limbs (40%) and then transferred into a grade. The Investigator assesses the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions in each body area (each on a 5 point scale); 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, and 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72 with a higher score indicating increased disease severity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a 75% or Higher Improvement From Baseline in PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI75 response assessments are based on at least 75% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>
