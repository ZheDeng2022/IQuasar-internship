  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The immune system in the ageing population becomes compromised with age (termed&#xD;
      &quot;Immunosenescence&quot;). Therefore, elderly people have a decreased ability to respond to&#xD;
      infection and vaccination. Furthermore, many of the health issues associated with ageing are&#xD;
      linked to inflammation (&quot;Inflammaging&quot;). It has been suggested that this compromised immune&#xD;
      function is in part due to reduced Toll-like receptor (TLR) function, which is part of the&#xD;
      innate immune system. Milk and dairy based products have been shown to have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on inflammation and immunity. This effect may be mediated via support of the innate&#xD;
      immune response and promotes TLR7 signaling in in vitro assays (unpublished observation).&#xD;
      Also prebiotics have been suggested to influence markers of innate immune function.&#xD;
      Furthermore, TLR function has been suggested to be correlated to vitamin D status. Therefore,&#xD;
      in the current pilot study, the potential of milk protein, prebiotics and vitamin D to&#xD;
      support innate immune function in elderly will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of milk protein on the innate&#xD;
      immune response in elderly in a pilot study. Furthermore, support of this effect by&#xD;
      prebiotics and Vitamin D will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study will be a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. Study&#xD;
      population: Healthy female elderly subjects of 65-85 years of age. Intervention: Period 1:&#xD;
      Milk protein or placebo. Period 2: Milk protein + prebiotics or placebo. Period 3: Milk&#xD;
      protein + prebiotics + Vitamin D or placebo.&#xD;
