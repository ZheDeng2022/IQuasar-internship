  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of intrathecal nivolumab, and&#xD;
      how well it works in combination with intravenous nivolumab in treating patients with&#xD;
      leptomeningeal disease. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and/or recommended dose of intrathecal (IT) nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination with systemic nivolumab treatment in patients with leptomeningeal disease (LMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival with combined intrathecal and systemic administration of&#xD;
      nivolumab in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the immunological effects of this treatment on immune cells in the cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) to those observed in the peripheral blood and in non-LMD tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluation of predictors (clinical, molecular, and/or immune) of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of nivolumab on subsequent treatment. IV. To compare levels of&#xD;
      nivolumab in the CSF and peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase Ib study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab IT over 5 minutes on day 1 of every cycle. Beginning in cycle 2,&#xD;
      patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 (4 hours after&#xD;
      the IT dose). Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 4 weeks and then every&#xD;
      12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
