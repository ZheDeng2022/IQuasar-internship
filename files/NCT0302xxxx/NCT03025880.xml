      Study Design and Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter phase II trial, with an initial exploratory run-in-phase, to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-negative ABC that have previously received anthracyclines and taxanes (unless clinically&#xD;
      contraindicated). In hormone receptor positive patients, previous treatment with 2 or more&#xD;
      lines of hormone therapy will also be required. Patients must have at least one measurable&#xD;
      lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment by&#xD;
      CT, MRI or plan X-ray. Approximately 53 patients (up to a maximum of 65 patients depending on&#xD;
      the results of the run-in-phase) will be included in this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design and Treatment (continuation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include two cohorts of patients: i) Triple Negative and ii) Luminal A+B, with&#xD;
      an approximate 1:1 distribution between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety dose testing or &quot;run-in-phase&quot;, with a 6+6 design, in which toxicity will be&#xD;
      evaluated within the first cycle, will be performed since pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine has not been previously tested. Initially 6 patients will be included in the&#xD;
      study at dose level 0 (gemcitabine at a dose of 1,250mg/m2 as an IV infusion on day 1 and 8&#xD;
      of each 21-day cycle and pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg as an IV infusion on day 1 of each&#xD;
      21-day cycle):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≤ 2 patients experience Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), 6 additional patients will be&#xD;
           included at the current dose level. If there is a confirmation of this dose to be safe&#xD;
           (≤ 3 patients experiencing DLT), this will be considered the RP2D and it will be used&#xD;
           for the following recruited patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥ 3 patients experience DLT within the first 6 patients, or ≥ 4 within the first 12&#xD;
           patients included at dose level 0, a de-escalation to dose level -1 (gemcitabine at a&#xD;
           dose of 1,000mg/m2 as an IV infusion on day 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle and&#xD;
           pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg as an IV infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) will&#xD;
           be performed. In this case, a group of 12 additional patients will be included at dose&#xD;
           level -1, if ≥ 4 experience DLT, this combination will be considered too toxic and the&#xD;
           study will be stopped. If ≤ 3 experience DLT with this combination, this will be&#xD;
           considered the RP2D and it will be used for the following recruited patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially 3 patients will be allowed for inclusion simultaneously. These 3 patients will be&#xD;
      followed closely during the first cycle to observe the occurrence of any DLT. At the times&#xD;
      these 3 patients are completing the first cycle, the next 3 patients will be included one by&#xD;
      one, until the first cohort is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of these 6 patients have a DLT, up to 4 patients will be allowed for inclusion from&#xD;
      the second cohort of 6 patients; they will follow the same procedure as in the first cohort.&#xD;
      If one of these patients from the second cohort has a DLT, the inclusion will be in smaller&#xD;
      groups (with a maximum number of 4 patients with DLT) and following the same procedure as in&#xD;
      the first cohort of 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An internal committee will periodically review the safety data in order to take the decision&#xD;
      to maintain or decrease the dose level. This internal committee will consist of the chief&#xD;
      investigator, the Grupo Español de Cáncer de Mama (GEICAM) Scientific Director and the study&#xD;
      statistician. The meetings will be performed by teleconference to take these decisions as&#xD;
      quickly as possible once the last patient finishes the first cycle of treatment. Other&#xD;
      meetings will be considered ad-hoc whenever necessary (i.e when new DLTs appear).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the run-in-phase at the same dose than that in the phase II will be&#xD;
      considered for the phase II analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug/Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled and treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg as an intravenous (IV) infusion on day 1 of each 21-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in combination with Gemcitabine at a dose of 1,250mg/m2 or 1,000mg/m2 (this dose will be&#xD;
      explored in combination with pembrolizumab in the initial exploratory run-in-phase if&#xD;
      necessary) as an intravenous (IV) infusion on day 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be repeated on day 1 of each 21-day cycle until objective disease progression,&#xD;
      clinical progression (under investigator criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. Patients completing 24 months of uninterrupted&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab or 35 administrations of study medication will stop&#xD;
      pembrolizumab treatment (though may continue with gemcitabine). Subjects who stop&#xD;
      pembrolizumab after 24 months may be eligible for up to one year of additional pembrolizumab&#xD;
      treatment if they progress after stopping it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial exploratory run-in-phase will be performed to test the safety of the combination&#xD;
      and determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of gemcitabine in combination with fixed&#xD;
      doses of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Run-in-phase: To determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of gemcitabine in&#xD;
           combination with fixed doses of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: To assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine in&#xD;
           terms of Objective Response Rate (ORR) in patients with HER2-negative ABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Run-in-phase: To determine the incidence rate of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) within the&#xD;
           first cycle of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as Complete Response (CR) plus&#xD;
           Partial Response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours&#xD;
           (RECIST) version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary objectives will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess other efficacy measures of the combination in patients included in the phase&#xD;
           II (including those in the run-in-phase at the same dose that in the phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine safety and tolerability of the combination in all patients included in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary end-points will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 by the&#xD;
                investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) defined as Complete Response (CR) plus Partial Response&#xD;
                (PR) plus Stable Disease (SD) lasting ≥ 24 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Response Duration (RD) assessed according to RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall Survival (OS). With special interest on long term responders (i.e. alive&#xD;
                and without disease progression after 24 months of study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety will be assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests (haematology, serum&#xD;
           chemistry). Adverse Events (AE) grade will be defined by the NCI CTCAE (National Cancer&#xD;
           Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exploratory objectives will be studied in all patients included in the study&#xD;
      unless otherwise specified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess other efficacy measures of the combination based on immune-related (ir)&#xD;
           response criteria in patients included in the phase II (including those in the&#xD;
           run-in-phase at the same dose that in the phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To search for tumour tissue and peripheral blood biomarkers of clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare biomarkers data from cohorts of healthy volunteers (if available) with data&#xD;
           from patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory End-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exploratory end-points will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ORR is defined as immune-related Complete Response (irCR) plus immune-related&#xD;
                Partial Response (irPR) according to immune-related RECIST (irRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed according to irRECIST by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) defined as irCR plus irPR plus immune-related Stable&#xD;
                Disease (irSD) lasting ≥ 24 weeks according to irRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Response Duration (RD) assessed according to irRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A set of immune biomarkers will be analysed and correlated with evolution of the disease&#xD;
           and efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine (ORR and other efficacy&#xD;
           end-points: PFS, CBR and RD), paying special attention to long term responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This set of immune biomarkers will be compared with those from healthy volunteers (if&#xD;
           available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Simon's minimax two-stage design will be employed with the possibility of stopping early&#xD;
      due to lack of response. Results from previous studies showed that gemcitabine produced a&#xD;
      response rate of around 20%, this will be our expected H0. With the combination of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and gemcitabine, we expect to increase this rate to 35% what will be our H1 (an&#xD;
      absolute increase of 15%), with an alpha error of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%, we&#xD;
      will need to include 53 evaluable patients in this trial. The first stage will include 31&#xD;
      evaluable patients, if at least 7 present a response, recruitment will continue to include&#xD;
      the 53 evaluable patients. The null hypothesis of H0=20% will be rejected if 16 or more&#xD;
      responses are observed in 53 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and Baseline Characteristics: Standard descriptive statistics, such as the mean,&#xD;
      median, range and proportion, will be used to summarize the patient sample and to estimate&#xD;
      parameters of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analyses: AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be reported in frequency tables&#xD;
      (overall and by intensity). The safety analysis will be performed in the population that has&#xD;
      received at least one dose of any of the study drugs/medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analyses: All efficacy endpoints will be evaluated in the Per-protocol and Intent to&#xD;
      treat (ITT) populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker analysis:The biomarker analysis will be exploratory and descriptive. For continuous&#xD;
      variables, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values will be provided.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be summarized by numbers and proportions. Biomarker endpoints will&#xD;
      be evaluated in all patients enrolled in the study with available samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end date of study is date of last patient´s death or the date when there is sufficient&#xD;
      data to achieve the primary and secondary objectives and all patients have ended the study&#xD;
      treatment, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing exploratory objectives will be independent of the date of the end of the study.&#xD;
