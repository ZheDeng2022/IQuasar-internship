  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine if MEDI8852 administered with standard of care&#xD;
      (oseltamivir) will reduce the time to normalization of respiratory function for adults who&#xD;
      are hospitalized with influenza caused by Type A strains and to determine if MEDI8852 has an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile in adults who are hospitalized with influenza caused by Type A&#xD;
      strains.&#xD;

      The MEDI8852 phase 2b study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) dose of MEDI8852 or placebo administered in conjunction with oseltamivir in adult&#xD;
      subjects who are hospitalized with influenza caused by Type A strains. Approximately 450&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at study centers in North America, Europe, and other regions.&#xD;
