      Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition where intestinal and extraintestinal&#xD;
      symptoms are triggered by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat&#xD;
      allergy. Despite the great interest in NCGS, much remains unknown about the pathogenesis.&#xD;
      Some studies seem to suggest that wheat components other than gluten (i.e. amylase/trypsine&#xD;
      inhibitors, ATIs) can cause the symptoms, and therefore the term &quot;non-celiac wheat&#xD;
      sensitivity&quot; (NCWS) has been proposed instead of NCGS. It is believed that this condition is&#xD;
      worldwide increasing, due to the evolution of wheat breeding (i.e. consumption of wheats with&#xD;
      high gluten content), and that ancient wheats are better tolerated by NCWS patients than the&#xD;
      modern ones. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine whether the common belief&#xD;
      regarding the fact that ancient wheats are better tolerated by NCWS patients than the modern&#xD;
      ones is confirmed by scientific data, and to identify the wheat kernel components triggering&#xD;
      this pathology. The availability of wheat materials with opposite characteristics, such as&#xD;
      the period of development (ancient vs. modern), or the technological properties (cultivars&#xD;
      with weak glutens vs. strong gluten), or the presence/absence of specific ATIs polypeptides,&#xD;
      will allow to define the role played by these factors. Therefore, the study has two&#xD;
      objectives: 1) extraction and testing of total kernel proteins, in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to gluten and non-gluten proteins by peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMC) and immunocytes extracted by the rectal mucosa of NCWS patients and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects, and 2) clinically testing two wheat genotypes, selected on the basis of the&#xD;
      previous in vitro studies, showing the highest and the lowest in vitro inflammatory response,&#xD;
      in order to verify their effect in triggering NCWS symptoms.&#xD;

      Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition where intestinal and extraintestinal&#xD;
      symptoms are triggered by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat&#xD;
      allergy. Despite the great interest in NCGS, much remains unknown about the pathogenesis.&#xD;
      Some studies seem to suggest that wheat components other than gluten (i.e. amylase/trypsine&#xD;
      inhibitors, ATIs) can cause the symptoms, and therefore the term &quot;non-celiac wheat&#xD;
      sensitivity&quot; (NCWS) has been proposed instead of NCGS. NCWS pathogenesis has been attributed&#xD;
      to very different mechanisms: innate or adaptive immunity, incomplete digestion and/or&#xD;
      absorption of fermentable oligosaccharides and disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols,&#xD;
      and, finally, psychological effect. In addition, it is believed that this condition is&#xD;
      worldwide increasing, due to the evolution of wheat breeding (i.e. consumption of wheats with&#xD;
      high gluten content), and that ancient wheats are better tolerated by NCWS patients than the&#xD;
      modern ones. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine whether the common belief&#xD;
      regarding the fact that ancient wheats are better tolerated by NCWS patients than the modern&#xD;
      ones is confirmed by scientific data, and to identify the wheat kernel components triggering&#xD;
      this pathology. The availability of wheat materials with opposite characteristics, such as&#xD;
      the period of development (ancient vs. modern), or the technological properties (cultivars&#xD;
      with weak glutens vs. strong gluten), or the presence/absence of specific ATIs polypeptides,&#xD;
      will allow to define the role played by these factors. The researchers take into&#xD;
      consideration different tetraploid wheat genotypes derived from the Italian breeding activity&#xD;
      carried out during the 20th century in comparison with landraces, primitive and old wheat&#xD;
      cultivars previously cultivated and used mostly in Southern Italy for pasta and bread&#xD;
      production, together with an experimental genetically modified (GM) wheat line expressing a&#xD;
      lower amount of ATIs. For the purpose of the study, the collection has been subdivided into 5&#xD;
      groups, according to the breeding period. Wheat genotypes will be also evaluated for several&#xD;
      parameters: protein content, gluten index, quantitative analysis of ATIs proteins by Mass&#xD;
      Spectrometry, etc. The project has two objectives, related to the influence of wheat&#xD;
      consumption on health: 1) extraction and testing of total kernel proteins, in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the inflammatory response to gluten and non-gluten proteins by peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and immunocytes extracted by the rectal mucosa of NCWS patients and&#xD;
      healthy control subjects, and 2) clinically testing two wheat genotypes, selected on the&#xD;
      basis of the previous in vitro studies, showing the highest and the lowest in vitro&#xD;
      inflammatory response, in order to verify their effect in triggering NCWS symptoms.&#xD;
