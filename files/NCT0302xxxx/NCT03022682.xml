  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects over one third of US adults (&gt;72 million, with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), and the&#xD;
      proportion of US adults with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 has doubled in the last 20 years. Obesity is&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality through its linkage to comorbidities including diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and psychosocial disturbances. Given&#xD;
      its prevalence, impact on morbidity and mortality, and economic cost, limiting the spread of&#xD;
      obesity and its consequences is one of the most important problems of our time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study, investigators will recruit participants from a wide range of body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI), ethnicity and Diabetes risk to collect data and blood, stool and adipose&#xD;
      tissue samples in the San Francisco bay area.&#xD;

      The Inflammation, Diabetes, Ethnicity and Obesity (IDEO) cohort is recruiting 350 individuals&#xD;
      from various ethnicities, covering a spectrum of weight and Diabetes risk. The study is&#xD;
      looking for participants between the ages of 18-75 years that are healthy with or without&#xD;
      diabetes with a stable weight. The study will also like to include people who are slated to&#xD;
      undergo any type of bariatric surgery for obesity or any other type of abdominal surgery at&#xD;
      UCSF.&#xD;

    <description>Adipose tissue samples are collected from all participants, including aspirational subcutaneous biopsies from nonsurgical participants and excisional biopsies, performed intra-operatively by surgical collaborators as required.&#xD;
Participants also undergo anthropometric measurements, stool collection, blood sample collection for circulating blood cells, serum, and plasma.&#xD;
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan for amount and distribution of body fat as well as bone density is performed.&#xD;
Study participants complete validated questionnaire inventories to measure bio-behavioral issues such as depression, stress, health locus of control, and dietary habits.</description>
