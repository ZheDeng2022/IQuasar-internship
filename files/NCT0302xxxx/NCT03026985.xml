    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the changes in quadriceps muscle size and quality&#xD;
      over the first 10 days on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) using ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging. This study will also examine the relationship between those changes and muscle&#xD;
      strength and level of physical function at day 10 and day 20 after ECMO commencement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of ECMO has increased dramatically in the past decade with improvements in technology&#xD;
      and survival. Whilst it is a potentially life-saving intervention in a group of patients at&#xD;
      high risk of death, it is both highly invasive and expensive. ECMO poses a dramatic&#xD;
      physiological burden on patients with major long-term consequences. Among these, severe&#xD;
      prolonged neuromuscular weakness is perhaps the most significant complication. Described&#xD;
      clinically as intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW), it is associated with prolonged&#xD;
      weaning from mechanical ventilation, delayed rehabilitation, increased hospital length of&#xD;
      stay, and mortality with residual deficits in physical functional ability persisting up to 5&#xD;
      years following the ICU admission. The health value, to both patients and society, could be&#xD;
      substantially improved if more patients achieved a complete recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength testing in the early stages of critical illness is limited, as it requires&#xD;
      the patient to be awake, alert and cognitively intact, therefore delayed diagnosis of ICUAW&#xD;
      due to inability of patients to complete muscle strength testing is common. Consequently,&#xD;
      there is growing interest in the utility of ultrasound imaging to monitor the trajectory of&#xD;
      muscle wasting and inform development of targeted interventions in these critically ill&#xD;
      patients. Ultrasound imaging of skeletal muscle is a non-invasive, painless and radiation&#xD;
      free technique that can provide objective, accurate and reliable data on skeletal muscle in&#xD;
      these critically ill patients. This study will use ultrasound imaging to quantify the early&#xD;
      change in skeletal muscle size and quality, and the relationship to strength and physical&#xD;
      function in patients on ECMO. Risk stratification of patients with peripheral muscle wasting&#xD;
      is vital for optimising clinical management, including development of improved rehabilitative&#xD;
      strategies to improve recovery and optimise the risk/benefit profile of ECMO.&#xD;
