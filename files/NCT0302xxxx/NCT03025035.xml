  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the use of immunotherapy and PARP inhibition in a population with&#xD;
      incurable advanced breast cancer associated with a germline BRCA mutation or HDR-defect. The&#xD;
      main objective is to examine overall response rate of pembrolizumab (immunotherapy) in&#xD;
      combination with Olaparib (PARP inhibitor) in advanced BRCA-mutated or Homology-directed&#xD;
      repair (HDR)-defect breast cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two BRCA genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, and they play a role in protecting cells from&#xD;
      cancer. HDR-defect is another type of gene mutation that can contribute to development and&#xD;
      progression of cancer. If one of these genes is mutated, cells may rapidly change and divide,&#xD;
      which can lead to cancer. Pembrolizumab is a drug that works with the immune system to target&#xD;
      the tumor (immunotherapy). The investigators want to know if combining pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      Olaparib therapy will be able to reduce the size and amount of cancer cells with fewer side&#xD;
      effects than standard treatment by targeting the tumor. This research study is designed to&#xD;
      test the investigational use of pembrolizumab and Olaparib in breast cancer.&#xD;
