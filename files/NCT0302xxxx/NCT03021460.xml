    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose of ibrutinib when given together with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced melanoma. (Phase I) II. To estimate the overall response rate treated&#xD;
      at the maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced melanoma. (Dose expansion cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and adverse-event profiles of combination of ibrutinib with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in patients advanced melanoma receiving&#xD;
      ibrutinib and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma receiving ibrutinib and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the effect of treatment with ibrutinib and pembrolizumab on Th1/Th2 immune&#xD;
      polarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the CD8 T cell response to multiple melanoma-associated antigens, and to&#xD;
      correlate CD8 T cell responses with changes in Th1/Th2 immune polarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess changes in plasma cytokines induced by treatment with ibrutinib and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the change in potential biomarkers, such as tumor-bound and soluble PD-L1&#xD;
      levels and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, that may correlate with treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and days 1-21 of cycle 2&#xD;
      and subsequent cycles. Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes&#xD;
      on day 8 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycle 2 and subsequent cycles. Cycle 1 continues for 28 days&#xD;
      and subsequent cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.&#xD;
