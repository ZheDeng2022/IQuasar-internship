  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (combined with chemotherapy) is commonly used in the curative treatment of&#xD;
      pelvic tumours, such as in cervical, vulvar and anal cancer. In these patients, cure rates&#xD;
      are high but may be associated with significant treatment-related toxicities, especially&#xD;
      dermatologic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate treatment planning and dose delivery is essential for radiotherapy in order to be&#xD;
      effective in terms of local tumour control and to reduce radiation-induced side effects.&#xD;
      However, accuracy is challenged by tumour and organ motion from fraction to fraction&#xD;
      (interfraction movements). At present, radiotherapy treatment planning is typically performed&#xD;
      on one planning-CT scan which is performed before the start of the treatment. However,&#xD;
      interfraction set up variations and organ motions can lead to differences between the&#xD;
      calculated dose distribution on the planning-CT and the radiation dose actually received by&#xD;
      the tumour and normal organs (actual given dose). Current photon radiotherapy of the pelvic&#xD;
      area is relatively insensitive to these changes and margins from CTV to PTV ensures an&#xD;
      adequate dose coverage of the tumour area. Despite newer techniques in photon therapy, like&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), critical organs still receive a substantial amount&#xD;
      of dose leading to clinically relevant acute and late side effects. With proton beam therapy,&#xD;
      the amount of radiation dose to the organs at risk can be significantly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For proton beam therapy (PBT) however, knowledge of tumour and organ motion will be more&#xD;
      important. The major potential advantages of PBT for tumours in the pelvic area in terms of&#xD;
      prevention of radiation-induced side effects are challenged by differences in bladder volume,&#xD;
      rectal filling and air gaps especially in the small bowel, sigmoid and rectum. Setup errors&#xD;
      and organ motion cause geometric displacement of the tumours and normal tissues, which&#xD;
      deteriorates the dose gradients from target volume to normal tissue. Furthermore, it can&#xD;
      result in changes in tissue densities in the beam path, which can alter the position of the&#xD;
      Bragg peaks, in turn leading to distorted dose distributions, usually manifesting as&#xD;
      significant local under and/or over dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to evaluate the impact of inter and intrafractional&#xD;
      tumour and organ motion on photon and proton radiotherapy treatment planning in order to&#xD;
      create robust intensity modulated photon- and/or proton treatment plans (IMRT, IMPT) with the&#xD;
      final aim to lower treatment related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To explore the extent of inter- and intrafraction anatomical changes of the tumour&#xD;
      and surrounding normal tissues, throughout the full course of treatment, and to subsequently&#xD;
      assess the impact of these changes on the nominal planned dose. This information is required&#xD;
      to design robust treatment plans (photon and/or proton) that will ensure optimal local tumour&#xD;
      control while reducing toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Pilot-study (40 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with cervical, vulvar or anal cancer, who are planned for&#xD;
      radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Robustness parameters (homogeneity index; coverage of&#xD;
      clinical target volume), dose to organs at risk (OARs), such as the small bowel, rectum,&#xD;
      bladder and bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: During the radiotherapy treatment course, patients will undergo weekly repeat&#xD;
      planning CT scans without contrast agents in order to evaluate the impact of intra and&#xD;
      inter-fraction tumour and organ motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional radiation dose of these 5 extra CT's is relatively low (5 x 8 mSv, plus 1 x 22&#xD;
      mSv for the 4D CT scan) in relation to the therapeutic radiation dose (50.4-85 Gy). The risks&#xD;
      are therefore negligible and the burden is low.&#xD;
