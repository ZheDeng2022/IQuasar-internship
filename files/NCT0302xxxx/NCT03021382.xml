  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the precision of semi-automated lumen boundary&#xD;
      identification from coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) by current version of&#xD;
      HeartFlow software and the impact on fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) by using optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) as reference standard.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of cCTA and OCT was conducted under blind in independent organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After unblinding the cCTA and OCT case identification number, the OCT image was co-registered&#xD;
      to cCTA data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After co-registration of cCTA and OCT lesion locations, the minimal lumen area (MLA) was&#xD;
      detected with both modalities. FFROCT was calculated using OCT-updated models in which&#xD;
      cCTA-based lumen geometry was replaced by OCT-based lumen geometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions were grouped according to their severity of calcification (using Agatston score) and&#xD;
      minimum lumen diameter.&#xD;
