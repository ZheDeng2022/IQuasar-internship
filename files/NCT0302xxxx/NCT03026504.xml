  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of baricitinib in the treatment of&#xD;
      giant cell arteritis. All participants will be taking prednisone at the start of the study.&#xD;
      The prednisone will be reduced according to a standardized tapering schedule while&#xD;
      participants continue to take one tablet of baricitinib daily for 52 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baricitinib, an orally administered, potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and&#xD;
      JAK2 has shown preliminary safety and efficacy in chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This small molecule is uniquely suited&#xD;
      as a potential novel therapeutic agent in GCA because of its suppressive effect on both the&#xD;
      Th17 (IL-6, IL-23) andTh1 (IL-12, IFN-γ) pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of baricitinib in a population of&#xD;
      patients with relapsing GCA. The study is an open-label pilot study assessing the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of baricitinib (4 mg daily, oral, for 52 weeks) in addition to a standardized&#xD;
      glucocorticoid taper. It is anticipated that adjunct baricitinib will be safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated by patients with GCA and demonstrate preliminary efficacy as measured by reducing&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, decreasing steroid requirements and increasing relapse-free survival.&#xD;

             interpretation of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Are largely or wholly incapacitated permitting little or no self-care, such as being&#xD;

             clinically significant malignancy for &lt; 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease for at least 3 years may participate&#xD;
                  in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects with basal cell or squamous epithelial skin cancers which have been&#xD;

                  tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, or atypical&#xD;
                  mycobacteria).&#xD;
&#xD;

                  antimicrobials within 30 days of baseline visit for treatment of an active&#xD;
                  infection. This does not include the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis against&#xD;
                  pneumocystis pneumonia since this is considered standard of care for patients on&#xD;
                  prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day for longer than 3 consecutive months.&#xD;

             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Have known or documented diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Have known or documented primary immunodeficiency.&#xD;

             receive appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Have had evidence of active TB or have previously had evidence of active TB and did&#xD;
             not receive appropriate and documented treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Have evidence of latent TB as documented by a local lab positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold&#xD;
             test and a normal chest x-ray, unless a patient completes at least 4 weeks of&#xD;
             appropriate treatment prior to study entry and agrees to complete the remainder of&#xD;
             treatment while in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test results are positive, the patient will be&#xD;
                  considered to have latent TB and will be excluded. If the test is indeterminate,&#xD;
                  the test may be repeated once within 2 weeks of the initial value. If the repeat&#xD;
                  test results are again not negative, the subject will be considered to have&#xD;
                  latent TB (for purposes of this study) and will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Exceptions include subjects with a history of active or latent TB who have&#xD;
                  documented evidence of appropriate treatment and with no history of re-exposure&#xD;
                  since their treatment was completed. (Such subjects would not be required to&#xD;
                  undergo the protocol specific TB testing, but would require a baseline chest&#xD;
                  x-ray).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Have a positive test for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) If any of the Hepatitis B&#xD;
                  tests have an indeterminate result, confirmatory testing will be performed by an&#xD;
                  alternate method.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Have Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody with confirmed&#xD;
             presence of HCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Have any of the following specific abnormalities on screening tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ALT or AST &gt; 2 x ULN&#xD;

&#xD;
               8. eGFR &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m²&#xD;
&#xD;
             In the case of any of the aforementioned laboratory abnormalities, the tests may be&#xD;
             repeated once within approximately 2 weeks from the initial values, and values&#xD;
             resulting from repeat testing may be accepted for enrollment eligibility if they meet&#xD;
             the eligibility criterion.&#xD;
