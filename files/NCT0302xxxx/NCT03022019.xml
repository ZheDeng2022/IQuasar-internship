      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting is an effective method of surgical treatment in&#xD;
      vitiligo, which is suitable for treating large areas with good cosmetic results. The&#xD;
      RenovaCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita Medical Europe Limited, Cambridge, UK)&#xD;
      (previous name: ReCell) is a device which, compared to other forms of autologous epidermal&#xD;
      cell suspension grafting, is easier in use showing similar results. Efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the ReCell device was proven in segmental vitiligo and piebaldism. However, the efficacy in&#xD;
      non-segmental vitiligo is not yet confirmed in randomized controlled trials. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that grafting using the ReNovaCell device in combination with&#xD;
      standard of care is also effective in stable non-segmental vitiligo and more effective than&#xD;
      standard of care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: to assess the efficacy and safety of ReNovaCell grafting combined with 311 nm UVB&#xD;
      therapy and topical anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of stable non-segmental&#xD;
      vitiligo. Secondary: to assess, satisfaction, cosmetic acceptability, noticeability and&#xD;
      persistence of repigmentation after ReNovaCell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, observer-blinded, randomised, within subject, controlled, study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 20 patients ≥ 18 years with stable non-segmental vitiligo receiving&#xD;
      standard of care (311 nm UVB therapy and topical anti-inflammatory therapy) for at least 6&#xD;
      months at the Netherlands Institute for Pigment Disorders (NIPD) at the Academic Medical&#xD;
      Centre, University of Amsterdam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In patients already receiving standard of care (311 nm UVB therapy + topical&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapy) 2 comparable depigmented regions are randomised to receive&#xD;
      ReNovaCell grafting or no grafting. Standard of care will be given according to the standard&#xD;
      treatment protocol of our institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective assessment of the degree of repigmentation three and six months after ReNovaCell&#xD;
      grafting with a digital image analysis system. To assess the pigmentation, the contours of&#xD;
      pigmentation are copied on a transparent sheet before, three and six months after treatment,&#xD;
      after which the sheets are scanned and digital image analysis is used to compute the affected&#xD;
      surface. By comparing pre- and post-treatment pictures, the relative surface showing&#xD;
      repigmentation expressed as percentage of the selected treated patch is computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Reported Outcomes: satisfaction, cosmetic acceptability, noticeability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General patient assessed outcome per treatment region on a scale from 0-3 (poor,&#xD;
           moderate, good or excellent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual assessment of percentage repigmentation by blinded observer and color match to&#xD;
           normal skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual assessment of side effects per treatment region (hyperpigmentation,&#xD;
           hypopigmentation and scarring on a scale from 0-3) by a blinded investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small amount of the suspension of the included patients and the redundant lesional&#xD;
           punchgrafts of all patients will be used for flow cytometric analyses of the cellular&#xD;
           composition of the grafted cell suspension, and expression analysis of melanin&#xD;
           synthesis-related genes. These data will be correlated to the clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: As the study involves large depigmented lesions, which are too large to treat in&#xD;
      regular surgical treatment (punch grafting), patients will not miss any regular treatment.&#xD;
      The time investment for the patient will be approximately 20 minutes for the punchgrafting&#xD;
      session, 75 minutes for the cell suspension grafting session and 15 minutes for the three&#xD;
      follow-up visits. Two of the five visits are part of the standard of care UVB follow-up&#xD;
      regimen and are therefore not additional due to the study. Infection in the grafted area or&#xD;
      the donor site may occur but is very rare; the risk of mild textural changes in the donor&#xD;
      site is moderate. Hyperpigmentation of the treated area does occur often, although this&#xD;
      improves over time in most cases. In case of improvement of the depigmentation, patients may&#xD;
      receive another treatment for the (contralateral) untreated side.&#xD;
