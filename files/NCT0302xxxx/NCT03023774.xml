      Prospective analytical study which will be conducted at a private IVF center starting from&#xD;
      june 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study will be recruited from both the fertility clinics and centers by fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria , all patient will be subjected to complete history taking&#xD;
      medical and fertility history including previous induction or implantation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into two groups, group A will be treated with neupogen 30&#xD;
      international unit (IU) and group B will be treated with clexane 40mg and estrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      study procedure: ovaries were stimulated with standard protocol (long GnRH Agonist) or&#xD;
      gonadotrophic releasing hormone (GnRH Antagonist, when at least 3 follicles achieved 18 mm&#xD;
      diameter, Human chorionic gonadotrophic (hCG) (10000 IU) was administered for ovulation&#xD;
      triggering, transvaginal oocyte retrieval was performed at 36-38 hours after injection of hCG&#xD;
      . the oocytes were fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) method. the&#xD;
      thickness of endometrium was evaluated on the day of oocyte retrieval and syringe which&#xD;
      containing (300 mcg/1 ml) GCSF (neupogen) was infused slowly in the uterine cavity and after&#xD;
      5 days (before embryo transfer) endometrial thickness was evaluated again. all patients&#xD;
      received oral and parenteral progesterone for luteal phase support.&#xD;
