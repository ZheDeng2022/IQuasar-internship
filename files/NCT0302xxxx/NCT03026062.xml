  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well durvalumab and tremelimumab work in treating&#xD;
      participants with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back or&#xD;
      does not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab&#xD;
      and tremelimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether give durvalumab&#xD;
      and tremelimumab in combination or sequential administration works better in treating&#xD;
      participants with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the median immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) in the&#xD;
      experimental arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of grade III or higher treatment related toxicity in each&#xD;
      experimental arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the immunological and gene expression changes induced by tremelimumab and the&#xD;
      combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tumor tissues&#xD;
      and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) IV. To determine&#xD;
      the proportion of patients that discontinue treatment due to side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine second progression-free survival (PFS) (PFS2) following initial progression&#xD;
      in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the response rate to durvalumab (MEDI4736) following treatment with&#xD;
      tremelimumab (in the sequential arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the patient reported symptom burden in each experimental arm. To better&#xD;
      assess the relationship between somatic tumor mutations in the PPP2R1A gene and response and&#xD;
      survival following combination therapy with tremelimumab and durvalumab in two molecularly&#xD;
      defined expansion cohorts: (a) subjects with ovarian clear cell carcinoma and (b) subjects&#xD;
      with uterine serous carcinoma. (This objective will represent an expansion cohort in Arm 2&#xD;
      and will be independent of enrollment to the main study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (SEQUENTIAL): Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day&#xD;
      1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Upon progression, patients then receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 9 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. This arm is closed to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (COMBINATION): Patients receive tremelimumab IV and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes (for&#xD;
      each drug) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 9 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 2&#xD;
      months thereafter&#xD;
