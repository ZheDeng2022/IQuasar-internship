      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain stomach cancers are rare, but they have high mortality rates. Researchers want to&#xD;
      learn more about gastric (stomach) tumors. In this study, they want to collect data from&#xD;
      people who have stomach cancer or are at risk to get it. This data will be used to see if the&#xD;
      people can be in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study tissue from stomach tumors and find people eligible for more studies on gastric&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age greater than or equal to 2 years old who have or may have stomach cancer, lesions that&#xD;
      may be related to stomach cancer, or an inherited disorder that leads to stomach cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans or ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the scans, participants lie in a machine that takes pictures. For some scans, they will&#xD;
      swallow or be injected with a small amount of radioactive material. Special cameras will show&#xD;
      the material in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample taken with a needle or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have an endoscopy. A long, flexible tube with a camera will be&#xD;
      inserted through the mouth into the stomach. The tube will collect tissue from the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may have follow-up visits. Some may be invited to join other studies.&#xD;
      Others will be contacted by phone to see how they are doing.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater than 90% of gastric tumors are of epithelial origin and are classified as&#xD;
           adenocarcinomas; the remainders include GIST, carcinoid and lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric adenocarcinoma is rare in the United States (incidence 7.4 per 100,000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality rates are high with an estimated 5-year overall survival of 25% - 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 3% of gastric adenocarcinomas occur as part of a heritable cancer syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular sub-classification of gastric adenocarcinomas has been reported, however&#xD;
           translation of these findings into clinical management of patients has yet to occur&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To permit clinical and laboratory evaluation and molecular profiling of tumor tissue&#xD;
           from patients with gastric malignancies or non-invasive (neoplastic) conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess eligibility for enrollment in studies of gastric cancer conducted in the CCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To allow long-term follow up of patients with gastric tumors, or heritable gastric&#xD;
           malignancy syndromes, to support clinical and preclinical research particularly related&#xD;
           to molecular alterations in gastric tumors and their response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malignant or non-invasive, neoplastic lesions of the stomach confirmed by histopathology&#xD;
           or cytopathology;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspicious lesion not yet confirmed, but considered likely related to the stomach&#xD;
           pending further evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed, deleterious germline mutation (including but not limited to HDGC, GAPPS)&#xD;
           known to predispose to gastric tumors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed or suspicious heritable gastric malignancy disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically suspicious personal or family medical history of gastric cancer or gastric&#xD;
           cancer syndrome that warrants genetics evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol is designed to facilitate clinical evaluation, molecular tumor profiling,&#xD;
           and long-term follow up of patients with gastric tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be screened and clinical evaluation performed to determine eligibility for&#xD;
           other CCR trials for gastric tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No investigational treatment will be administered and no procedures will be done for&#xD;
           only research purposes on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that the protocol will enroll a maximum of 250 patients.&#xD;
