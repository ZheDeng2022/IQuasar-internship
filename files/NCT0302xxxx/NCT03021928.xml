      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal Delay Time to Initiate Anticoagulation after Ischemic Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation&#xD;
      (START): a pragmatic, adaptive randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the optimal time to initiate anticoagulation with a Non-Vitamin K Oral&#xD;
      Anticoagulant (NOAC) after ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the rates of primary adverse outcomes in a per protocol analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare 30 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the&#xD;
           time-to-treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare 30 day clinical outcomes by the PROMIS-10 scale among the time-to-treatment&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare 90 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the&#xD;
           time-to-treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the optimal timing in subgroups of age, sex, outcome category, and NOAC&#xD;
           choice&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term oral anticoagulation is standard for secondary stroke prevention in patients with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AFib). However, there is limited data and no consensus on the timing of&#xD;
      when to initiate anticoagulation therapy, and concern that starting too soon risks&#xD;
      symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. These data are derived almost exclusively from&#xD;
      heparins and Vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,warfarin). Now that NOACs have become the mainstay&#xD;
      of stroke prophylaxis in AFib and have more rapid and consistent anticoagulation and fewer&#xD;
      strokes (hemorrhagic especially), the question of optimal timing of NOAC initiation is of&#xD;
      increasing importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine the time-to-treatment interval with the lowest associated&#xD;
      risk for adverse events in the context of anticoagulation therapy with NOACs for acute stroke&#xD;
      patients with non-valvular AFib. The question will be investigated with a prospective,&#xD;
      adaptive, randomized, controlled &quot;dose-exploration&quot; trial with the time to treatment with&#xD;
      NOAC therapy treated as the incremental &quot;dose&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adaptive, pragmatic trial will be performed that will not deviate from the treating&#xD;
      physicians' usual practice except for randomizing the time to start the NOAC. Data collection&#xD;
      will be limited to those fields necessary for the planned primary and secondary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composite primary outcome event will be any of the following within 30 days of the index&#xD;
      stroke: Ischemic Events (symptomatic ischemic stroke or systemic embolism), Hemorrhagic&#xD;
      Events (symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of index ischemic stroke, other symptomatic&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage, or major extracranial hemorrhage), or all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four time-to-treatment intervals, i.e. study arms, between 2 and 14 days will be&#xD;
      investigated: 60 hours, 132 hours, 228 hours, and 324 hours. An innovative adaptive design&#xD;
      will be used which includes response adaptive randomization and modeling of ischemic and&#xD;
      hemorrhagic outcome events. The ischemic and hemorrhagic events within the composite primary&#xD;
      endpoint are modeled separately using their known monotonic property that the risk of an&#xD;
      event increases (ischemic) or decreases (hemorrhage) as the time-to-treatment interval&#xD;
      lengthens. Interim analyses will occur after every 100 subjects are randomized, where the&#xD;
      primary outcome will be analyzed and new randomization probabilities will be calculated to&#xD;
      favor the arms that have a better risk-profile.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. New disabling neurological deficit attributable to new ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Minimum lesion diameter of 1.5cm on qualifying imaging. If lesion not visible on&#xD;
             imaging, NIHSS must be greater than 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Not currently anticoagulated and/or will not be anticoagulated prior to starting their&#xD;
             NOAC at the randomized time of initiation (except for DVT prophylaxis).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients who had been taking an anticoagulant prior to their qualifying index&#xD;
             event (for any reason) are eligible for START, assuming the drug is no longer having a&#xD;
             therapeutic effect in the patient's system by 48 hours from stroke onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treating physician plans to anticoagulate with a FDA-approved novel oral anticoagulant&#xD;
             (NOAC): apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, or other FDA-approved NOAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Qualifying brain CT or MRI scan &lt; 48hr from stroke onset (time last known well). If&#xD;
             patient has been treated with thrombolytic or endovascular therapy for this stroke,&#xD;
             then the qualifying scan is that which is performed after therapy to rule out&#xD;
             clinically significant hemorrhagic transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to randomize within 60 hours of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinical or imaging evidence of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in the&#xD;
             previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients with hemorrhagic transformation of current or previous ischemic stroke&#xD;
             may be included per Investigator's judgment. Sporadic microbleeds may be included per&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment. As a general recommendation, a cerebral microbleed is&#xD;
             considered to be ≤ 5mm, but sometimes up to 10mm, in greatest diameter on gradient&#xD;
             recalled echo (GRE), or T2*, MRI sequences. Any blood visualized on a CT will be&#xD;
             classified as a macrobleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infarct volume (estimated) is greater than 50% of middle cerebral artery territory on&#xD;
             qualifying scan. If the full extent of the lesion is not visible, any patient with a&#xD;
             NIHSS &gt; 23 must be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: The lesion does not need to be restricted to the mCA, but if the lesion volume&#xD;
             is estimated to be greater than half of the mCA territory, the patient should be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In non-EVT patients, any NIHSS following the index stroke may be used to qualify&#xD;
             the patient for START. For example, a patient that presents with a NIHSS of 10 who&#xD;
             then receives tPA and improves to a NIHSS of 2 is still eligible for START. For&#xD;
             patients whom had endovascular therapy, the qualifying NIHSS assessment is that which&#xD;
             is obtained with their qualifying scan following therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Anticipated need for major surgery over the next 30 days that would require delay,&#xD;
             discontinuation, or extended suspension of anticoagulant of more than 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Symptomatic edema expected from size and location of ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Decreased level of consciousness present or expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy less than 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Follow-up in person or by telephone for 90 days is not feasible.&#xD;
