  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a common complication of pregnancy that increases risks for both the mother and&#xD;
      baby. Poorly controlled diabetes has been associated with very large babies, congenital heart&#xD;
      defects, stillbirth, birth trauma, and maternal infections among other complications.&#xD;
      Patients with diabetes in pregnancy require more frequent prenatal visits and fetal&#xD;
      evaluation, and must shoulder the burden of mastering management of a complicated care&#xD;
      regimen. With the ever-expanding world of technology, more healthcare practices are using&#xD;
      cell phones, texting, and social media to interact with patients. Use of this technology has&#xD;
      been successful in management of chronic diseases and as reminder systems. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a randomized clinical trial to investigate patient adherence to recommended care&#xD;
      regimen after intervention of a text message reminder and education system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a part of routine care, pregnant women without known diabetes undergo screening and&#xD;
      testing for gestational diabetes either with a two-hour glucose tolerance testing or a&#xD;
      one-hour glucose challenge test followed by a three-hour glucose tolerance test in the event&#xD;
      of failure of the one-hour test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have been given the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by failing&#xD;
      this diabetes testing and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria shall be approached&#xD;
      and offered enrollment in the study. Women with known type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)&#xD;
      (pre-gestational diabetes) and women diagnosed elsewhere with GDM who meet the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be offered enrollment when they establish prenatal care. Patients who&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study shall be randomized to either the intervention or the&#xD;
      contact control group. For randomization purposes, an equal number of notecards will be made&#xD;
      for the two groups. These will all be placed in sealed envelopes and shuffled. At the time of&#xD;
      patient inclusion, an envelope will be selected by the consenting practitioner. If a patient&#xD;
      declines receiving text messages but consents to have her medical record reviewed for&#xD;
      adherence to her diabetes care regimen and glycemic control, she will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      standard of care control group. A baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in all groups shall receive initial diabetes education and started on an&#xD;
      individualized diabetic diet regimen. Patients with GDM who develop a requirement for either&#xD;
      oral medication or insulin will remain in the same group to which they were initially&#xD;
      randomized. An HbA1c level is obtained every one to three months during pregnancy as well as&#xD;
      near the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive reminders based on their individual disease&#xD;
      treatment. A text message shall be sent one day (12 to 36 hours) before appointments to&#xD;
      remind about the appointment and with instructions to bring glucose and food records to the&#xD;
      appointment. If medication changes are made at the appointment, the patient will receive a&#xD;
      text message reminder the day after her appointment to reinforce the regimen. Postpartum&#xD;
      patients who had GDM will receive a text message reminder to complete their glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test. A reminder will be sent at 2 weeks postpartum followed by a reminder at 6 weeks and 10&#xD;
      weeks postpartum if the testing is not completed. Women with T2DM will be reminded to bring&#xD;
      glucose and food records to their postpartum visits. Participants will be contacted through&#xD;
      Google Voice which is a Google system requiring a secure login and password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the contact control group will be enrolled in the text4baby program with&#xD;
      assistance from a healthcare provider. As the study will conclude upon the patient's&#xD;
      postpartum visit, she will be offered the option of discontinuing messages, which otherwise&#xD;
      would continue through the infant's first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalizations Patient hospitalization for diabetic control shall be recorded for data&#xD;
      collection. Patients in the intervention group will not be contacted during their&#xD;
      hospitalization. If medicine adjustments are made during their hospitalization, a reminder&#xD;
      text message with the new regimen shall be sent the day after discharge. Contact will then&#xD;
      resume by the above stated schedule. If a patient is hospitalized temporarily for a reason&#xD;
      other than diabetes, contact will resume upon discharge. If the patient is hospitalized for&#xD;
      the remainder of the pregnancy, the patient will be removed from the study. Triage visits&#xD;
      will not be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery Delivery details will be abstracted from patient charts and shall include&#xD;
      gestational age at delivery, fetal weight, vaginal versus cesarean delivery, incidence of&#xD;
      shoulder dystocia, APGAR scores, and umbilical cord blood gases. The newborn chart shall be&#xD;
      reviewed for the number of days spent in the neonatal intensive care unit, incidence of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and whether IV dextrose was required, and need for ventilator support or&#xD;
      surfactant administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal Complications Incidence of postpartum wound infections or dehiscence shall be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum The postpartum glucose tolerance tests of women who had GDM will be reviewed to&#xD;
      determine her glucose tolerance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires/Surveys The participating patients will be asked to complete a survey upon&#xD;
      entry into the study to identify barriers to their healthcare and their baseline knowledge of&#xD;
      diabetes. A survey at the completion of their study (the postpartum visit or later) will be&#xD;
      requested to evaluate patient perspectives on the study, their pregnancy and any perceived&#xD;
      benefit from participation. The postpartum survey will be either completed at a postpartum&#xD;
      visit, mailed to subjects, completed on line or subjects will be contacted by phone to&#xD;
      complete the survey. If subjects do not return for a postpartum visit or do not complete the&#xD;
      survey at that visit, three attempts will be made to contact subject for completion of the&#xD;
      departure survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who did not sign a version of the consent form that allowed for completion&#xD;
      of the departure survey over the phone or online:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If their participation is ongoing, they will be approached at one of their visits and asked&#xD;
      to review and sign an updated version of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who have completed the pregnancy portion of their participation in the study but&#xD;
      who did not complete a departure survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted over the phone to obtain permission to allow completion of this&#xD;
      survey over the phone, by mail or online. A phone script will be used to contact patients. If&#xD;
      subjects cannot be reached by phone, a letter will be sent to their home address. A maximum&#xD;
      of three phone attempts will be made to contact subject.&#xD;
