    <textblock>
      However, there is only very sparse information regarding the atherosclerotic burden and&#xD;
      cardiovascular biomarkers in the early stages of type-2 diabetes, as the vast majority of&#xD;
      studies have concerned diabetes populations with more than 5 years average diabetes age or&#xD;
      high-risk subgroups, who at inclusion already had atherosclerotic disease manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, this study aims on evaluating the occurrence of early-stage subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes with special emphasis on coronary plaque&#xD;
      characteristics by modern imaging techniques. These findings will be compared to the&#xD;
      functional status of various peripheral arterial segments and biomarkers in the&#xD;
      cross-sectional part of this study. The 5-year follow-up study intends to describe&#xD;
      relationships between these selected measures for general atherosclerotic involvement and the&#xD;
      progression of the coronary atherosclerotic burden by contemporary techniques.&#xD;

      THE AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I: Compare the prevalence and complexity of coronary plaques in patients with newly&#xD;
      discovered type-2 diabetes with a healthy control group matched for age and gender, as&#xD;
      evaluated by coronary computed tomography angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II: Describe the relationship between morphological, functional and biochemical&#xD;
      estimates of arteriosclerosis in newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III: Characterize the progression of coronary plaques in patients with newly discovered&#xD;
      type-2 diabetes in a 5-year follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Coronary plaque morphology and plaque progression in patients with newly diagnosed type-2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus&quot; (DD2-plaque study) is a prospective cohort follow up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion phase will run for 2 years. The follow-up phase is 5 years from inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DD2-plaque study (diabetic patient's cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment in this cohort will take place in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. From the &quot;Danish centers for strategic research in type 2 diabetes&quot; (DD2) - patients who&#xD;
           agreed to be contacted for participation in a future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Direct from outpatient clinics in The Region of Southern. Patients will either be&#xD;
           recruited through general practitioners or from outpatient clinics in The Region of&#xD;
           Southern Denmark. The investigators expect to be able to include 100 asymptomatic&#xD;
           patients with newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Newly diagnosed (&lt; 1 year) diabetes patients clinically classified as type-2 diabetes&#xD;
           patients of both sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age 18 +.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type 1 diabetes (or have age&lt;30 years and C-peptid&lt;300pmol/l and GAD-ab titer&gt; 20&#xD;
           IU/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Renal insufficiency (GFR &lt; 45 or se-creatinine &gt;140 micromol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pregnancy at time of or planned at inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patients with a history of prior atherothrombotic disease (including acute coronary&#xD;
           syndromes, prior revascularization, ischemic stroke or peripheral arterial disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DD2-plaque study (control patients cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 controls will be recruited from the general population by advertisement in the local&#xD;
      press. Controls with cardiovascular disease (criteria consistent with those described for&#xD;
      patients with type-2 diabetes) and type-2 diabetes (undiagnosed type-2 diabetes in this group&#xD;
      was excluded by fasting plasma glucose and by an oral glucose tolerance test) will be&#xD;
      excluded. In addition, exclusion criteria are also consistent with those described for&#xD;
      patients with type-2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal measurements will be done at the screening visit and after 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proxy statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will fill in a questionnaire concerning:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiovascular and diabetes hereditary&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alcohol and drugs consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Smoking habits (current, prior and never smokers)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Family history (cardiac events or strokes for women &lt; 65 years of age and men &lt; 55&#xD;
                years of age in first generation relatives)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical examination will include measurement of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Height, weight, BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Waist/hip ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Brachial blood pressure will be measured by oscillometric technics during 24 hours using&#xD;
           TM-2430 (A&amp;D CO., LTD, Saitama, Japan) or BDM Mobil-O-Graph® NG Classic (IEM GmbH,&#xD;
           Stolberg, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blood samples: Procedures for handling and shipping samples is available in the trial&#xD;
           master and at www.DD2.nu under &quot;blodprøvetagning&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An exception to these procedures are that the blood samples will be frozen at site and&#xD;
           send on ice to the biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2 x 9 ml. containers with green lid (Li-hep) 2 x 2.7 ml. containers with blue lid&#xD;
           (Na-citrat) 2 x 9 ml. containers with purple lid (EDTA) 2 x 4 ml. containers with&#xD;
           purple/dark purple lid (EDTA) 2 x 3 ml. containers with pink lid (Fluoridcitrat) 2 x 9&#xD;
           ml. containers with brown lid (Serum)&#xD;
&#xD;
           1 container for urine with yellow lid 10 ml of morning midstream urine will be sampled.&#xD;
           Urine sticks will be used to rule out urinary tract infection. If this is present the&#xD;
           urine should be resembled. A total of 73.4 ml + 10 ml of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For a subset of patients the DD2 cohort registration and the baseline visit will take&#xD;
           place in the same day. These patients will have 146.8 ml of blood drawn on the same day.&#xD;
           Containers will be sent to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Biochemical analysis: total cholesterol, S-LDL-cholesterol, S-HDL-cholesterol and&#xD;
           S-triglycerides, HbA1c, glucose, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, creatinin and fibrinogen.&#xD;
           All analyses are performed at our local Dept. of Clinical Biochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. All patients will undergone:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Carotid intima media thickness (IMT) will be measured by B-mode ultrasound (Model IE33,&#xD;
           Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) using a linear array&#xD;
           transducer, L11-3 with a frequency up to 11 MHz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Pulse wave velocity: Using sphygmocor (ArtCor, Sydney, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Ankle brachial index.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Albumin creatinine ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Coronary atherosclerosis is evaluated by measurement of calcium in the coronary arteries&#xD;
           and by evaluation of coronary plaques using contrast enhanced cardiac CT. Coronary&#xD;
           artery calcifications will be estimated by the Agatston score while the evaluation of&#xD;
           coronary plaques will be performed by a dedicated plaque-analysis tool, Auto-Plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimations are performed for comparison of calcium scoring between patients with&#xD;
      type-2 diabetes and normal controls (Un-paired evaluation) and comparison of calcium scoring&#xD;
      between type-2 diabetes patients at inclusion and at follow-up (Paired). From previous&#xD;
      studies on calcium scoring in the Danish Risk Score Study cohort, the standard deviation, SD,&#xD;
      on coronary calcification is known to be 32.7 UE (Agatston Score). It is supposed that SD in&#xD;
      the diabetic patients is equal to the figure in controls. Under the assumptions that 15% will&#xD;
      drop-out, a MIREDIF of 20 (twice the threshold for registering the occurrence of coronary&#xD;
      calcification in the central West Danish Heart Registry, VDH), beta= 0, 1 and alfa= 0.02&#xD;
      (Planned comparative analysis of 2-3 plaque-components) it is calculated, that it is needed&#xD;
      to include 41 patients in each group for the un-paired analyses and to follow 41 diabetic&#xD;
      patients for 5 years (Paired analysis). It is supposed, that app. 40% of type-2 diabetes&#xD;
      patients meet the age criteria (55+/-5 years or 65+/-5 years) for comparison with the&#xD;
      background population, which means that app. 100 type-2 diabetes patients should be included&#xD;
      in the DD2 plaque study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students T-test will be used for comparison of normally distributed continuous variables and&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney test will be used for comparison of continuous variables that are not&#xD;
      normally distributed. The χ2- test is performed for comparison of dichotomous variables.&#xD;
      Continuous variables are presented as either mean or standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range. P-values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Stepwise&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression will be performed for analysis of which factors are&#xD;
      associated with coronary atherosclerosis using either presence coronary artery calcification&#xD;
      or other plaque variables as dependant variables.&#xD;
