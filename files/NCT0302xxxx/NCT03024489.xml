  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclin D kinase 4 (CDK4) is a key regulator of the G1-S transition in the cell cycle.&#xD;
      Alterations in CDK4-cyclin D-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway may lead to carcinogenesis in many&#xD;
      cancers. Several mechanisms have been described: (i) Amplification or overexpression of&#xD;
      cyclin D1, (ii) Amplification of CDK4, (iii) Activating mutation of CDK4, and (iv) Loss of&#xD;
      the CDK4 inhibitor, p16 (CDKN2A). Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) plays a major role in squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) carcinogenesis. It induces many alterations in the&#xD;
      CDK4-Cyclin D-Rb and apoptotic pathways such as up-regulation of p16, loss of Rb and p53&#xD;
      functions. A novel therapy for HPV-negative SCCHN is clearly an unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib (PD 0332991) is an orally active, highly selective inhibitor of the CDK4/6 with&#xD;
      ability to block Rb phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range. The most advanced development&#xD;
      is in a treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In addition, palbociclib showed a&#xD;
      radiosensitization property. Since combination of cetuximab and radiation improved PFS and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in locally advanced SCCHN when compared with radiation alone, these&#xD;
      provide a strong rationale to evaluate a combination of palbociclib, cetuximab, and radiation&#xD;
      for locally advanced SCCHN. Because many genetic alterations in SCCHN significantly involve&#xD;
      in the CDK4-cyclin D-Rb pathway, predictive biomarker(s) of palbociclib in this combination&#xD;
      will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators propose a non-randomized, dose escalation, phase I study designed to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of palbociclib, cetuximab, and IMRT&#xD;
      for locally advanced SCCHN.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The enrollment of an initial patient cohort of 3 or 6 patients will follow the traditional &quot;3&#xD;
      + 3&quot; dose escalation scheme (see table below). The patients will be treated with palbociclib,&#xD;
      cetuximab, and IMRT at starting at Dose Level (DL) 1. Subsequent patient cohort(s) will be&#xD;
      enrolled depending on the safety and tolerability of the initial cohort. If &lt;33% patients&#xD;
      treated at Dose Level 1 experience DLT (see definition below) by the end of treatment (56&#xD;
      days), then next cohort of 3 patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 2. If 2&#xD;
      treatment-related DLTs are observed at Dose Level 1, patients will be accrued to Dose Level&#xD;
      -1. The MTD is defined as the maximum dose level at which ≤1/6 patients have DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the MTD or RP2D, we will accrue up to 15 locally advanced unresectable p16-negative SCCHN&#xD;
      patients to allow for definitive evaluation of tolerability, correlative endpoints and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy. CT/PET scan will be performed at 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
      radiation to evaluate residual disease. Patients with residual disease will be considered for&#xD;
      salvage surgery following standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IMRT will be administered 5 days on/2 days off with a total dose of 70 Gy for 33-35&#xD;
           fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab will be administered 400 mg/m2 IV at 7 days before (day -7) starting radiation&#xD;
           and then 250 mg/m2 IV weekly for 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palbociclib will be administered orally daily 3 week-on and 1-week of during IMRT (Day&#xD;
           1-21 and Day 29-49).&#xD;
