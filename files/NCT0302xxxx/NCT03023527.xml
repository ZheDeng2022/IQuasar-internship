  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 study evaluating the role of two regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Nivolumab in combination with Pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone and B) Nivolumab +&#xD;
      Elotuzumab + Pomalidomide + dexamethasone in the treatment of relapse or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in 10 sites in Spain. First, the MTD for the Nivo-Pom-Dex&#xD;
      combination will be determined using a 3+3 scheme. Once the MTD has been determined both&#xD;
      Regimes (A and B) will be open for full accrual and patients will be included in an&#xD;
      alternating way in both regimes simultaneously. In the case that an unacceptable toxicity was&#xD;
      seen in the Lead-in phase (Nivolumab + Pomalidomide + low dose dexamethasone), the other&#xD;
      phase would not be open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety analysis by an internal review committee will be performed once the first six&#xD;
      patients included in the regimen B have completed the first two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to analyze the proportion of subjects, with refractory or&#xD;
      relapsed multiple myeloma, receiving the combination Nivo-Pom-dex or Nivo-Pom-dex-Elo&#xD;
      experience one or more haematological and non haematological SAE (grade 3 or higher).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, other&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of nivolumab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone will demonstrate adequate&#xD;
      safety and tolerability to permit further testing of these combinations in subjects with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. The addition of elotuzumab to nivolumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      will not change the safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will remain open for enrolment for 15 months (estimated), or until the planned&#xD;
      total number of 40 subjects is reached if this happens first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up of the last recruited patient will be up to 3 years, being the Final analyses&#xD;
      performed 1,5 years after the last patient is included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female adult patients with Multiple Myeloma in first or subsequent relapses,&#xD;
      previously exposed to both a proteasome inhibitor and a IMID (Lenalidomide). Patients may be&#xD;
      exposed, relapsed or refractory to Lenalidomide.&#xD;

      Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is using a modified 3+3 design and has 2 parts. First (Lead-In phase), the MTD for&#xD;
      the Nivo-Pom-dex combination will be determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A: The treatment regimen will include Pomalidomide, Nivolumab and low dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone. There will be three different dose levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First dose level (DL1): Nivolumab 240mg intravenous infusion, every other week;&#xD;
           Pomalidomide at the standard dose of 4 mg/day from day 1 to 21 in a 28-day cycle and&#xD;
           Dexamethasone 40mg weekly except for patients older than 75 or with comorbidities who&#xD;
           will received 20 mg weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled and treated. If not DLT, 3 additional patients will be&#xD;
      included at the same dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the case there is DLT, the dose level will be de-escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the DLT is haematological or non-hematological attributable to Pomalidomide, the&#xD;
                dose level will be DL-1P (Pomalidomide 2 mg/d from day 1-21, Nivolumab 240mg every&#xD;
                other week and Dexamethasone 40mg weekly or 20 weekly in patients older than 75 or&#xD;
                with comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the case the DLT is non-hematological, and attributable to Nivolumab, this&#xD;
                combination arm will be stopped. No Nivolumab dose reductions are allowed in the&#xD;
                trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been determined, both regimens A and B will be open for full accrual and&#xD;
      patients will be included in an alternating way in both regimens simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen B: The treatment regimen will include Pomalidomide and Nivolumab at the selected dose&#xD;
      level from the previous arm of the study. Dexamethasone will be given in the standard dose of&#xD;
      40mg weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle and could be reduced to 20mg weekly&#xD;
      in case of age above 75 year-old or comorbidities. Elotuzumab will be given at the standard&#xD;
      dose of 10mg/kg weekly for the first two cycles, and then on days 1 and 15 for the subsequent&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be maintained until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for 100 days&#xD;
           after the last treatment. Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of&#xD;
           MedDRA and reviewed for potential significance and importance. Adverse events will be&#xD;
           evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0. Subjects should be followed until all&#xD;
           treatment related adverse events have recovered to grade ≤ 1 or baseline, or are deemed&#xD;
           irreversible by the investigator. Safety assessments will be based on medical review of&#xD;
           adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical&#xD;
           examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: Disease assessment will be performed with serum and urine myeloma lab tests,&#xD;
           bone marrow assessment and computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI), as appropriate. Myeloma responses will be based on investigator assessment and&#xD;
           determined as defined by IMWG criteria. Any initial assessment will be confirmed by a&#xD;
           repeat evaluation every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarker Assessments: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples will be collected from&#xD;
           subjects to assess mechanisms of primary resistance (cell surface protein analyses and&#xD;
           transcriptome analyses) and mechanisms of chemosensitivity to NivoPomDex combination&#xD;
           (10-colour flow cytometry, TCR clonality by NGS).&#xD;
