      Background (brief):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global burden of depression accounts for 2.5% of global DALYs, and in South Asia the&#xD;
      estimate is 13.3 % of DALYs per 100,000 populations. Mothers of children with Autism Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder (ASD) have reported higher level of depression than mothers of children with other&#xD;
      developmental disorder and the prevalence of ASD is high in Asian countries. In Bangladesh&#xD;
      16% of adults suffer from depression and a recent study conducted in Bangladesh has&#xD;
      documented a high prevalence of depression among mothers of children with ASD (45%). Mothers&#xD;
      are the life time care givers of children with ASD, and a high burden of depression is likely&#xD;
      negatively impact on the ability of the mothers to provide care to children at home. Mental&#xD;
      health is not addressed in Bangladesh and there is scarcity of qualified providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to pilot the feasibility of a package intervention including&#xD;
      implementation of mental health care and home based training program for the mothers of&#xD;
      children with ASD integrated in the regular activities of the special schools that offer ASD&#xD;
      care in Dhaka city in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 selected special schools over 15 months. In the first stage,&#xD;
      the investigators will set up the study in two schools and identify various stakeholders for&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of the barriers of implementing the intervention at the institutional&#xD;
      level, individual level, family level, provider level, policy maker level and at the level of&#xD;
      the state. Research staff will identify mothers 18 years of age or older who has a child with&#xD;
      ASD between 3 and 17 years of age enrolled in the school. Following consent, data collector&#xD;
      will obtain data and assess current major depressive episode (MDE) of the eligible mothers&#xD;
      following a standard diagnostic tool (SCID-I). All mothers diagnosed as having MDE will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the intervention (intervention mothers) and the investigators will&#xD;
      assess the performances in children with ASD by applying ASD Diagnostic Check-list (ADCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, investigators will implement interventions over 4-6 months, including&#xD;
      (a) implementing mental health care services at the selected schools targeting the&#xD;
      intervention mothers, and (b) organizing training sessions of the intervention mothers for&#xD;
      supporting child care at home for enhancing child performances. Every month a psychiatrist&#xD;
      will visit each school for providing necessary advice and treatment to the intervention&#xD;
      mothers or suggest referral to hospital care, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One special educator will be deployed at each school who will organize structured training&#xD;
      sessions for educating the intervention mothers by using BCC materials developed and&#xD;
      validated by icddr,b in the local setting. The special educators will conduct multiple group&#xD;
      sessions including 5-8 mothers in each group for covering the 6 modules over 2 weeks time,&#xD;
      and follow up intervention mothers at home every month for conducting refresher's training,&#xD;
      documenting the need of additional training supports, and linking mother with an ASD expert&#xD;
      for helping mothers taking a decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage 3, investigators will conduct post intervention qualitative survey with various&#xD;
      stakeholders who would be involved with implementing the intervention and participated in the&#xD;
      baseline qualitative survey. End line assessment will be conducted of current major&#xD;
      depressive episode (MDE) among all mothers and assess the performance of the children of&#xD;
      intervention mothers in order to assess the impact of the training at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is to assess the feasibility of institutionalizing the&#xD;
      combined intervention of mental health care supports and the home based training program of&#xD;
      the mothers who would be diagnosed as having major current major depressive episode. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be assessed by obtaining the perspectives of various stakeholders. The&#xD;
      following parameters will be assessed for measuring feasibility of the proposed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability, Adaptability, Demands, Practicality, Implementation, Integration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will include estimating the impact of the combined interventions on&#xD;
      the prevalence rate of maternal depression (MDE), individual performances of children, and&#xD;
      cost of intervention. Adaptation of the proposed strategy, if feasible will help the mothers&#xD;
      of children with ASD become skilled workforces for filling in the gap of the special&#xD;
      educators in resource poor settings, and extension of these services to more children with&#xD;
      ASD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 selected special schools in Dhaka city, (i) Autiam welfare&#xD;
      Foundation (AWF: http://awfbd.com/) and (ii) Society for the Welfare of Autistic Children&#xD;
      (SWAC: http://www.ASDbd.com/swac-bd/) who have more than 10 years of experiences with&#xD;
      offering quality services for ASD care in Bangladesh. The investigator will conduct the study&#xD;
      in both schools in 3 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preparatory phase and baseline assessment (stage 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation of intervention (stage 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End line assessment (stage 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will set up the study in two schools and identify various stakeholders&#xD;
      including the managers of the schools, special educators, psychologists, psychiatrists,&#xD;
      medical doctors, parent of children with ASD, policy makers etc. Data collector will obtain&#xD;
      written const from them and conduct in depth interviews for assessing barriers of&#xD;
      implementing the intervention at institutional level, individual level, family level,&#xD;
      provider level, policy makers level and at the level of the state prior to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will identify those mothers who are at least 18 years of age and has a child&#xD;
      with ASD between 3 and 17 years of age enrolled in the school. The staff in the intervention&#xD;
      phase would not be involved in the baseline or end line surveys. The investigator will&#xD;
      recruit separate staff for conducting baseline and end line surveys. Data collector will&#xD;
      obtain additional school based information regarding the children's ASD diagnosis and an&#xD;
      expert from IPNA will reconfirm their ASD by ADCL in order to further validate and rate the&#xD;
      ASD diagnoses with health and education related information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collector will obtain written consent from the eligible mothers who have child with ASD&#xD;
      and obtain essential socio demographic and other relevant data, and perform clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and current major depressive episode (MDE)&#xD;
      following a standard diagnostic tool (SCID-I) based on DSM-IV criteria as it has already been&#xD;
      validated through several studies in Bangladesh. All mothers diagnosed as having MDE will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the intervention following a written consent (intervention&#xD;
      mothers). However, any mother identified with severe forms of depression with any suicidal&#xD;
      ideation or unsafe thoughts will be referred for urgent hospital based mental health services&#xD;
      in the community (as per standard of care and ethical obligations), and they will not be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. The selected schools would have at least 100-150&#xD;
      children with ASD enrolled in a given year, and we anticipate that a total of ~ 54 to 80&#xD;
      mothers will participate in the intervention. Data collector will interview the intervention&#xD;
      mothers in order to assess the individual performances of their children by using a standard&#xD;
      tool ADCL (ASD Diagnostic Check-list). ADCL is a standard tool applied by ASD experts in&#xD;
      Bangladesh to track improvement in performances in children with ASD [22].This tool comprises&#xD;
      of 60 items focusing on 6 major areas of ASD, including (i) General Observation (13 items),&#xD;
      (ii) Cognition (10 items), (iii) Emotion (8 items), (iv) Social/Self Help (8 items), (v)&#xD;
      Communication (12 items), and (vi) Sensory deficiency (9 items).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 0 of the study period investigator will initiate setting up the intervention in two&#xD;
      schools, which will include two components; (a) Implementing mental health care services at&#xD;
      schools targeting the mothers diagnosed as having depression who have consented to&#xD;
      participate in the study (intervention mother) and (b) Organizing training sessions of the&#xD;
      intervention mothers for supporting enhanced child care at home. Although the mental health&#xD;
      services will target mothers who would volunteer to participate in the intervention. The&#xD;
      proposed intervention will be implemented over 4-6 months period; the two components of the&#xD;
      package have been described below in details.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Implementing mental health care services at school&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will develop a counseling centre at each school by deploying one&#xD;
           trained female psychologists who would provide counseling to the intervention mothers.&#xD;
           Investigator will adopt the psychological management procedures that have been commonly&#xD;
           administered by the experts of National Institute of Mental Health, Bangladesh (NIMH,&#xD;
           B). Intervention guidelines will be submitted to ERC for reviewing and necessary&#xD;
           approval of the document before the final application in the study. The mental health&#xD;
           services counseling module will comprises of the following topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Psycho education&#xD;
&#xD;
                Psycho education refers to the education offered to individuals with a mental&#xD;
                health condition and their families to help empower them and deal with their&#xD;
                condition in an optimal way. Psycho education will be given by a trained&#xD;
                psychologists under the guidance of a psychiatrists to increase the self esteem of&#xD;
                the mothers, which will include the brief concept on depression, the probable&#xD;
                etiology, how to mitigate the symptoms, compliance to the therapeutic process and&#xD;
                the consequences. This method of psychological management is commonly practiced by&#xD;
                the psychologists and also has been used in the former studies in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Assessment of the strength and weakness of the mothers&#xD;
&#xD;
                The psychologists will assess the strengths and weakness of the mothers, and&#xD;
                discover their personal obstacles, issues that might hinder their progress in terms&#xD;
                of social context, family support, financial state, educational qualification,&#xD;
                empowerment etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sharing the management plan with the mothers The psychologists will share the whole&#xD;
                management processes with the mothers and any opinion from the mother could be a&#xD;
                part of the management. The goal is to empower mothers and include them as a part&#xD;
                of the management team counseling other mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Reconstruction of the cognition Cognitive restructuring is a psychotherapeutic&#xD;
                process of learning to identify and dispute irrational or maladaptive thoughts&#xD;
                known as cognitive distortions. It is a core part of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
                (CBT). CBT is a structured method and one of the most effective psychological&#xD;
                treatments commonly used by the psychiatrists and psychologists of Bangladesh to&#xD;
                intervene depression. To manage depression minimum 12 sessions are required which&#xD;
                can be more upon the severity of the clients. CBT mainly deals with exploring&#xD;
                problems, thoughts, feelings and behavior of the clients. It is one of the major&#xD;
                components of our intervention protocol based on the standard practice of the&#xD;
                experts of Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Behavior therapy- graded activity Graded activity is a principle of therapeutic&#xD;
                intervention in which tasks are classified and gradually presented according to the&#xD;
                client's level of function and the challenge or degree of skill (physical, social,&#xD;
                or cognitive) required by the task. In this study after assessing the strengths and&#xD;
                weaknesses of the mothers their functional activity also be monitored and will try&#xD;
                to increase. The graded activity starts from personal care, daily household&#xD;
                activities, child care, engagement in small and easy tasks and complex and&#xD;
                productive tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Developing a mother's community and engaging depressed mothers in community related&#xD;
                activities&#xD;
&#xD;
           The psychologist will arrange a workshop in each participating school at two months&#xD;
           interval for enabling mothers meet other mothers in the intervention and create a common&#xD;
           platform where they can share their experiences , success stories and encourage a&#xD;
           positive reinforcement on the depressed mothers. The mothers will be encouraged to&#xD;
           participate in the social awareness or other activities arrange by the schools, so that&#xD;
           the mothers refrain from social isolation and rebuild their self esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Every month a psychiatrist of NIMH, B will visit each school for reviewing the records&#xD;
           maintained by the psychologist and provide necessary advice to the psychologist for&#xD;
           additional care of the depressed mother as and when required. The psychiatrist will&#xD;
           reassess the additional need of a mother following face to face consultation if&#xD;
           suggested by the record review, or identified by the psychologist. The medical care will&#xD;
           specially focus on management of depression with varying degree of severity as listed&#xD;
           below, including care for common mental disorders (neurosis), if exists. Mothers will be&#xD;
           referred to the National Institute of Mental Health for providing advanced mental health&#xD;
           care if necessary and be provided with free medicines that are available at the NIMH&#xD;
           including anti- depressant, anxio-lytic, anti-psychotic etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The medical care will follow the management guideline adopted in NIMH for treating the&#xD;
           following conditions, including referral to the National Institute of Mental Health for&#xD;
           advanced mental health care if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If mild to moderate: field psychologist: counseling and Cognitive behavior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If moderate to severe (without suicidal tendency): Counseling and Cognitive behavior&#xD;
           therapy. Drugs prescribed by psychiatrists during the periodical visits at the school.&#xD;
           If mothers have a suicidal tendency she will be immediately referred to NIMH or other&#xD;
           collaborative institutes. For other psychiatric disorders, such as, major mental&#xD;
           disorder or psychosis), the psychiatrist will prescribe drugs during their periodic&#xD;
           visits and refer a mother to NIMH or any other hospital that a mothers prefers, if fund&#xD;
           necessary by the discretion of the psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Organizing training of the intervention mothers in the schools for supporting child care&#xD;
           at home A parental training module was developed in the local language (Bangla) by&#xD;
           icddr,b led by Naheed et al in 2015 and customized according to the local context under&#xD;
           the guidance of an Expert Working Group comprised of experts in various relevant&#xD;
           disciplines. The module was piloted with 56 parents and validated for its application in&#xD;
           the local setting. Investigator will deploy one special educator at each school who will&#xD;
           organize structured training sessions for the intervention mothers by using BCC&#xD;
           materials. The special educator will conduct multiple group sessions including 5-8&#xD;
           mothers in each group for covering the 6 modules over 2 weeks time. The special&#xD;
           educators will follow up with mothers at home every month for conducting refresher's&#xD;
           training and document the need of additional training supports for an individual child&#xD;
           as advised by the mother or observed by the educator herself. The special educator will&#xD;
           consult with one of the Co Investigators who is an ASD expert and incorporate necessary&#xD;
           aids or additional training for a specific child as advised by the expert, and link&#xD;
           mother with the ASD expert for helping mothers taking a decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimating the cost of the pilot intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will estimate the overall costs that would incur to an individual institution due&#xD;
      to introduction of the combined services at the school. As such, research staff will track&#xD;
      costs of mental health services throughout the intervention period of 6 months and cost of&#xD;
      conducting training of mothers at school over 4 months period. Costs related to mental health&#xD;
      services will include counseling sessions, psychiatrists' visits, facility, training, special&#xD;
      educators, training materials and any other cost that might be potentially borne by the&#xD;
      institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will also include a qualitative end line survey conducted with the intervention mothers,&#xD;
      special educators, psychologists, psychiatrists and principals of the school who would be&#xD;
      involved with implementing the intervention and participated in the baseline qualitative&#xD;
      survey. The end line qualitative survey will assess views of various stakeholders about the&#xD;
      directions for institutionalizing the proposed intervention based on their experiences in the&#xD;
      intervention, particularly aligned with the barriers documented during the intervention&#xD;
      period. Research staff will also conduct an end assessment of current major depressive&#xD;
      episode (MDE) among all mothers in the selected schools including the mothers participated in&#xD;
      the intervention, and assess the performance level and degree of ASD in their children to&#xD;
      assess the impact of the training module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey for the maternal depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Research staff will conduct in depth interviews with the above listed participants for&#xD;
      assessing barriers of implementing the intervention at institutional level, individual level,&#xD;
      family level, provider level, policy makers level and at the level of the state prior to&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychologists will identify those mothers who would be diagnosed as having a current major&#xD;
