  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to detect cell free DNA (cfDNA) in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, and&#xD;
      to determine whether cfDNA can be used for concomitant diagnosis to improve the treatment&#xD;
      efficacy and prognosis of patients with brain (meningeal) metastasis by monitoring&#xD;
      tumor-related genetic mutations in cfDNA in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;

      This study planned to enroll 50 patients with lung cancer diagnosed with brain (meningeal)&#xD;
      metastases, and all cases were slated to receive radiotherapy and targeted therapy. Patients'&#xD;
      clinical data were collected (including but not limited to: age at diagnosis with brain&#xD;
      (meningeal) metastases, KPS score, smoking history, stage of disease at diagnosis, time to&#xD;
      progress to brain metastases, number of brain metastases, extracranial metastases (ECM), and&#xD;
      systemic disease at the time of brain metastases. Anticoagulated whole blood and&#xD;
      anticoagulated cerebrospinal fluid were collected before local treatment (samples of primary&#xD;
      cancer tissue and metastatic carcinoma of some patients were preserved) and at 7 days, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months, as well as 6 months after the treatment (time of sample retention was to be&#xD;
      determined, Figure 2). DNA was extracted from tumor tissues, genomic DNA was extracted from&#xD;
      leukocytes, and cfDNA was extracted from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, for complete&#xD;
      quantitative detection of DNA, DNA library construction, as well as targeted capture&#xD;
      sequencing. Tumor-related genes were analyzed, and changes in the tumor burden during the&#xD;
      treatment process were evaluated. The clinical significance of cfDNA in the plasma and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid for treatment efficacy and prognosis was evaluated, and compared with&#xD;
      that of clinical indicators of treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involved two stages. The first stage was a pre-experiment: samples were retained&#xD;
      from 3-5 cases, and mutations in tumor-related genes in the cfDNA in plasma and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid were compared. The investigators analyzed, combined with clinical indicators, whether&#xD;
      mutations of cfDNA in plasma accord with that of the cerebrospinal fluid and whether&#xD;
      mutations of cfDNA in cerebrospinal can reflect the mutational status of tumor cells. The&#xD;
      second phase was conducted by expanding the number of cases, based on the first stage.&#xD;
