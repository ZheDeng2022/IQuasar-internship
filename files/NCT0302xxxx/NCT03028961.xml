  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research study is to evaluate whether bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      patients prefer the Stanford letter advance care planning tool to the standard Advance&#xD;
      directive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of advance care planning prior to BMT is very important, but not often done. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that the Stanford Letter will be preferred by patients and will allow&#xD;
      them to feel more comfortable and share more of their wishes with family members and the&#xD;
      medical team.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To compare advance care planning (ACP) completion rate amongst bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant (BMT) recipients receiving the Stanford Letter versus the traditional&#xD;
      advance directive (AD) through a prospective, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate differences in patient preference for choice to prolong life following&#xD;
      completion of the ACP tool in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess uncertainty with decision making regarding end of life care following&#xD;
      completion of the ACP tool in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore patient understanding of and satisfaction with the ACP tool in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (INTERVENTION): Patients listen to a dialogue on the purpose of ACP. Patients receive&#xD;
      a paper copy and online web link to the Stanford Letter and complete and return the form by&#xD;
      the day of BMT. After completion of the Stanford Letter, patients undergo a semi-structured,&#xD;
      research staff-led interview to evaluate personal perceptions of uncertainty with end-of-life&#xD;
      decisions, understanding of the ACP form received, and satisfaction with the ACP form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (CONTROL): Patients listen to a dialogue on the purpose of ACP. Patients receive a&#xD;
      paper copy and online web link to the California (CA) Advance Health Care Directive Form and&#xD;
      complete and return the form by the day of BMT. After completion of the CA Advance Health&#xD;
      Care Directive Form, patients undergo interview as in Group I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <measure>Uncertainty with decision making regarding end of life care measured related to the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) results</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to BMT day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured using the DCS uncertainty sub-scale (score 0-15; higher score indicates greater uncertainty). Scores from each group will be compared by t-tests.</description>

    <measure>Understanding of the ACP tool measured using qualitative and quantitative data obtained through the semi-structured interview and DCS</measure>
    <time_frame>within 28 days of ACP completion</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured using the DCS effective decision-making sub-scale (score 0-15; higher scores indicate 6 less effective decision-making). Likert scores of understanding of the ACP from each group will be summarized and compared by t-tests.</description>
