        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients 18 years or older with at least one diagnosed breast fibroadenoma.&#xD;
             Diagnosis of fibroadenoma must be based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  clinical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  women ≤ 40 years of age: ultrasound image alone; women &gt; 40 years of age: ultrasound&#xD;
             image and mammogram,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  histological confirmation of fibroadenoma of the breast. Patient's fibroadenoma size&#xD;
             as determined by ultrasound imaging: the longest diameter is limited to 25 mm. Women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours&#xD;
             prior to HIFU treatment. Patient must be able to understand the nature and the extent&#xD;
             of the study and the procedures required and be willing and able to complete the&#xD;
             screening and study procedures. Patient must give written informed consent (personally&#xD;
             signed and dated) before completing any study-related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who is pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with history of ipsilateral breast cancer within 5 years prior to study&#xD;
             inclusion or radio therapy to the target breast within 5 years prior to study&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with implant on the treated breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with target fibroadenoma pre-treated by cryoablation or interstitial laser&#xD;
             therapy within 12 month before recruiting for HIFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's fibroadenoma not clearly visible on the ultrasound images (in B mode) at the&#xD;
             inclusion visit. Patient participating in other studies using drugs or medical devices&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to study inclusion or during study participation including the&#xD;
             follow-up period.&#xD;
