      Main objectives: Comparing levels of F-DOPA reuptake rate as an indicator for Dopamine&#xD;
      metabolism of un-medicated Depressed patients to healthy individuals in the Mesocorticolimbic&#xD;
      System (VTA-NAc-PFC) and assessing structural differences between the two groups in the&#xD;
      Hippocampus, Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland and Mesocorticolimbic System (VTA-NAc-PFC) and&#xD;
      resting state fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: 1. Comparing the differences of DNA Methylation in the plasma and serum&#xD;
      of patients compared to healthy controls. 2.Assessing the correlation between symptoms'&#xD;
      severity score (evaluated based on Hamilton Rating Scale) at base line and 6 months following&#xD;
      treatmnt to PET 18F-DOPA uptake repertoire in the Mesocorticolimbic System, structural&#xD;
      measurements and DNA Methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Study Design: A prospective, pilot study. 30 un medicated Depressed patients and&#xD;
      30 Healthy volunteers will perform a [18F] FDOPA PET/MRI scans following a HAM-D&#xD;
      questionnaire (Hamilton rating scale of depression) and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-MR (Biograph mMR, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) scans will be performed using the tracer&#xD;
      of dopamine precursor 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ([18F] FDOPA) that&#xD;
      reflects L-dopa transport, L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity, vesicular uptake and&#xD;
      the number of dopamine nerve terminals. Measurements of dynamic F-DOPA parameters (Ki) and&#xD;
      quantitative measurements of static F-DOPA ( SUVmax and SUVmean) will be performed in the&#xD;
      ventral tagmental area (VTA), nucleus accombens (NAc) and pre-frontal cortex (PFC)which&#xD;
      comprise the Mesocorticolimbic System, bilaterally. MRI sequences of T1, T2 3D measurements&#xD;
      (assessing Volume) of the hippocampus, Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland and Mesocorticolimbic&#xD;
      system, DTI measurements in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic tract and BOLD (resting-state&#xD;
      f-MRI) in those brain networks. whole genome DNA Methylation from whole blood will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there is no quantative standard of care evaluation tool that serves psychiatrists&#xD;
      when assigning medication for newly diagnosed depressed patients. The manner in which&#xD;
      medications are assigned are threw symptom evaluation and trial and error. Only a third of&#xD;
      the patients achieve remission after the first line of treatment. SSRI's are most common type&#xD;
      of medication used to treat Major Depression today. One third of patients remains un&#xD;
      responsive even after the fourth line of treatment (of different types of medications). Anti&#xD;
      depression medications way of action requires time to reach its effect and in many patients&#xD;
      with no avail or even causing symptom's severity. The PET-MR multimodality imaging tool&#xD;
      offers a cutting edge technology ideally fitted to measure brain disorders. The use of F-DOPA&#xD;
      radio-ligand with the PET-MR constitutes a novelty in the imaging of the depressed brain.&#xD;
      Dopamine is one of three of the monoamine neurotransmitters targeted by anti-depressive&#xD;
      medication, sharing metabolistic agents. dopamine has been proven to be connected to the&#xD;
      processing of emotion, motivation, hedonism and reward threw its action in the&#xD;
      Meso-cortico-limbic system. Epigenetics is a regulatory system that determines gene&#xD;
      expression. It is heritable in the one hand and reacts to environmental changes on the other.&#xD;
      It has been shown to be involved in psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-MR scans will be performed. DNA samples will be extracted from subject's whole blood&#xD;
      samples taken prior to scans. Then it will be analyzed for whole genome DNA methylation.&#xD;
      Taken together this novelty imaging technique and epigenetic mapping of peripheral markers&#xD;
      can be used to better understand and personalize anti-depressive treatment compatibility.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a versatile psychiatric disorder with a prevalence of 8-12&#xD;
      % of the population in many countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current approach MDD is characterized by lowered activity of monoamine&#xD;
      neurotransmitters, it is undetermined whether it is as a result of differences in sensitivity&#xD;
      of their receptors or depletion in the synaptic cleft due to low expression or mao-a/mao-b&#xD;
      hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most antidepressant medication used today are based on the monoamine depletion theory of&#xD;
      depression. These medications include selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),&#xD;
      serotonine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI's) or Tricyclics anti-depressants (TCAs),&#xD;
      all of which inhibit the reuptake of some or all of these monoamines, inducing elevated&#xD;
      levels in the synaptic cleft. Some medications affect the monoamines receptors directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysfunctional dopamine neurotransmission has an essential role in deficits with attention,&#xD;
      motivation and anhedonia which are core symptoms of depressive disorder. Pre-synaptic D2r&#xD;
      (Dopamine 2 receptor) density in the pre frontal cortex (PFC) has shown to be significantly&#xD;
      lower in depressed patients versus healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, most studies using imaging techniques in depressed patients use mainly different&#xD;
      types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or separate nuclear medicine imaging with positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) tracers. The role of traditional MRI in the evaluation of&#xD;
      depression and other psychiatric disorders, in different studies, is aimed mainly to&#xD;
      differentiate structural features and therefore help strengthening the diagnosis in that&#xD;
      aspect. There are several structural changes measured in the brains of MDD patients compared&#xD;
      to controls. Among them decreased hippocampal volume shown also compared to remitted&#xD;
      patients, increased Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland volume, decreased Pre Frontal Cortex (PFC)&#xD;
      and Basal-Ganglia volume. These findings are also established in accordance to the largest&#xD;
      meta-analysis study of structural changes using MRI and CT scans performed to date. PET scans&#xD;
      give indications regarding brain's general or agent specific metabolism. Most PET scans&#xD;
      performed on depressed patient uses FDG or 11-C Serotonine radioligands. Only a few studies&#xD;
      examine F-DOPA PET uptake in depressed patients, mostly with Parkinsonian depression and one&#xD;
      with affective flattening or impulsive symptoms on a very small sample size (n=6). Most of&#xD;
      the studies showing indication of decreased DOPA uptake in the striatum specifically in the&#xD;
      Nucleus Accombens (NAc). Additional information is required indicating F-DOPA uptake in&#xD;
      relevant regions of the brain in MDD. To the best of our knowledge this will be the first&#xD;
      study using [18F] F-DOPA PET/MRI in depressed patients. PET/MRI offers true multimodality&#xD;
      imaging by combining anatomy, function and molecular processes that will allow more accurate&#xD;
      identification of disease assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fact that is well established is that genetic factors together with environmental factors&#xD;
      occurring across the lifespan likely underlie the vulnerability for depression. However in a&#xD;
      mega-analysis of several genomewide association studies (GWAS), which analyzed 1.2 million&#xD;
      autosomal and X chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found no SNP achieving&#xD;
      genome-wide significance. This discrepancy between the consistently observed substantial&#xD;
      heritability of major depression(18) and the fact no specific genetic variants have been&#xD;
      identified to robustly contribute to the disorder suggests other mechanisms at work.&#xD;
      Epigenetics refers to the changes in chromatin structure that underlies changes in gene&#xD;
      expression and that are not associated with alterations in DNA sequence. DNA methylation is&#xD;
      one of the systems underlies epigenetics. Methylation of the DNA requires the addition of a&#xD;
      methyl group at the 5' position of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides. Following cytosine&#xD;
      methylation, access of transcription factors to regulatory elements is reduced due to steric&#xD;
      interference. DNA methylation patterns are hereditable on the one hand and dynamically react&#xD;
      to the environment in the other hand. This trait of Epigenetics makes it a regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms, determining gene expression, that is congruent to the nature of psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. Diverse patterns of DNA methylation is observed in different tissues subjected to&#xD;
      different environments. It is even different between separate brain regions. An&#xD;
      Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are on there way. In one of them in PFC tissue of&#xD;
      post mortem depressed subjects researchers found enrichment in neuronal growth and&#xD;
      developmental genes sites such as Brain drived neurotrophic factor .(BDNF) Decreased BDNF&#xD;
      levels are a well established marker for depression. Lower levels of BDNF protein have also&#xD;
      been reported in the hippocampus of animals exposed to chronic stress. Interestingly,&#xD;
      administration of antidepressants increased hippocampal BDNF, preventing the stress-induced&#xD;
      decrease. These findings are intriguing given the hippocampal volume loss observed in mood&#xD;
      disorders and decreased BDNF serum levels in individuals with mood disorders or depressive&#xD;
      personality traits. Based on these convergent preclinical and clinical data, the BDNF gene&#xD;
      represents a logical target for genetic investigations of mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another Epigenome-wide association study analyzing whole blood DNA found IL-6 and C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) plasma levels were increased in those persons with lifetime depression, and&#xD;
      among those with depression only, IL-6 methylation showed an inverse correlation with plasma&#xD;
      IL-6 and CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there is no common imaging practice in the psychiatric clinic allowing&#xD;
      differentiating which medicated therapy is optimal for which patient. To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, this will be the first study to evaluate treatment compatibility using the&#xD;
      combination of [18F] F-DOPA PET/MRI imaging and symptoms assessment pre-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of the modality imaging and symptom&#xD;
      evaluation in the prediction of treatment compatibility. Dopamine metabolism measured in the&#xD;
      mesocorticolimbic system (VTA-NAc-PFC) by 18F-FDOPA PET with structural and functional MR&#xD;
      findings in patients diagnosed with depression pre-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Comparing naïve levels of F-DOPA reuptake in healthy individuals to untreated Depressed&#xD;
      patients in the Mesocorticolimbic System (VTA-NAc-PFC) and assessing structural differences&#xD;
      between the two groups in the Hippocampus, Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland and Mesocorticolimbic&#xD;
      System (VTA-NAc-PFC) and resting state fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparing the differences of DNA Methylation in the plasma of patients compared to&#xD;
           healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessing the correlation between symptoms' severity score (evaluated based on Hamilton&#xD;
           Rating Scale) at base line and after 6 months to PET 18F-DOPA uptake repertoire in the&#xD;
           Mesocorticolimbic System, structural measurements and DNA Methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A prospective, pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quantitative measure of symptoms' burden will be determined threw clinical assessment based&#xD;
      on &quot;Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression&quot; and based on DSM-V criteria at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-treatment), 3 months and 6 months after treatment initiation. According to DSM-5 the&#xD;
      diagnosis of depression requires five (or more) of the following symptoms that are present&#xD;
      during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning: (1) depressed&#xD;
      mood (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (3) Significant weight loss or weight. (4) Insomnia or&#xD;
      hypersomnia . (5) Psychomotor agitation or retardation.(6) Fatigue or loss of energy nearly.&#xD;
      (7) Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt.(8) Diminished ability to&#xD;
      think or concentrate. (9) Recurrent thoughts of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom evaluation of Hamilton Rating Scale will be done by a psychiatrist. Finally we will&#xD;
      attempt to link specific clusters of symptoms to treatment compatibility in accordance to&#xD;
      imaging and molecular findings. The compatibility of treatment with these medication will be&#xD;
      compared to percentage of treatment success in the clinic in a 'standart of care' manner.&#xD;
      Assessment of the patient's progress will be determined by change in symptoms and/or a second&#xD;
      scan through follow up visits after 3,6 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Imaging diagnostic PET/MR protocol: We would use the evaluation of the dopamine precursor&#xD;
      3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ([18F] FDOPA) uptake rate constant (K(i)) that&#xD;
      reflects L-dopa transport. L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity, vesicular uptake and&#xD;
      the number of dopamine nerve terminals. we would like to measure and compare the [18F] F-DOPA&#xD;
      uptake in the Mesocorticolimbic network in depressive unmedicated patients and healthy&#xD;
      individuals. We will then examine [18F] F-DOPA uptake repertoire and characterize a typical&#xD;
      spatiotemporal pattern along different depressive brains in accordance to the many kinds of&#xD;
      symptoms' manifestation and molecular and demographic data. In addition, we would implement,&#xD;
      new MR sequences such as diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging&#xD;
      (SWI) to evaluate the mesocoticolimbic dopaminergic tract and use T1, T2 sequences to measure&#xD;
      Hippocampal and Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland volumes in these patients compared to healthy&#xD;
      individuals. Furthermore we will use T2* sequence to evaluate resting state&#xD;
      Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast imaging. In addition scan results will be&#xD;
      correlated to clinical evaluation of symptoms unmedicated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All scans will be performed in the department of Nuclear Medicine at Tel-Aviv Assuta Medical&#xD;
      Center using a PET/MR scanner (Biograph mMR, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) in accordance&#xD;
      with the manufacturer's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are required to fast at least 4 hours prior to arrival to the department. Upon&#xD;
      arrival an intravenous catheter will be placed for radiopharmaceutical and gadolinium&#xD;
      administration. Patients will receive an intravenous injection of 10 mCi of 18F-FDOPA on the&#xD;
      PET MR table and scanning will begin immediately. Dynamic PET parameters will be acquired&#xD;
      along with the different MR sequences. MR of the brain will include the following sequences:&#xD;
      T1, T2 and T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence (FLAIR), susceptibility-weighted&#xD;
      sequences (SWI), Diffuse Tensor Imaging (DTI), blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)&#xD;
      signals for resting-state functional imaging. In addition, perfusion of the brain will be&#xD;
      evaluated with and without gadolinium. Aa anatomical stereotactic map of the brain will be&#xD;
      layered in congruence to the scans using ExploreDTI Software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For contrast-enhanced sequences we use Dotarem (gadoteric acid) (0.2 ml/kg ,0.1 mmol/kg at&#xD;
      2ml/s, 20ml saline flush) The total scan time will be about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For eligible healthy volunteers, the following data will be recorded at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline parameters: date of birth, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, smoking,&#xD;
           alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detailed medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. List of medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Symptom's Evaluation using Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      For eligible depressed patients, the following data will be recorded at baseline, after 3&#xD;
      months and after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline parameters: date of birth, sex,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detailed medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical diagnosis and symptoms onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn from patients and healthy controls prior to scans for the&#xD;
      assessment of Whole genome DNA methylaion in plasma of peripheral blood. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken on from healthy controls and depreesed patients on base line. From depressed&#xD;
      subjects ,blood will be drawn olso after 6 months of treatment start date for the evaluation&#xD;
      of gene expression mRNA or protein of specific markers based on epigenetic findings from base&#xD;
      line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of genome-wide promoter DNA methylation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure used for MeDIP analysis was adapted from previously published protocols.(13,14)&#xD;
      Brieﬂy, 2μg of DNA is sonicated, and methylated DNA is immunoprecipitated using&#xD;
      anti-5-methyl-cytosine (Eurogentec, Fremont, CA, USA). The DNA-antibody complex was&#xD;
      immunoprecipitated with protein G, and the methylated DNA is then resuspended in digestion&#xD;
      buffer (50mM TRisHCl pH8; 10mM EDTA; 0.5% SDS) and treated with proteinase K overnight at&#xD;
      55°C. The input and bound fraction is puriﬁed, ampliﬁed using the Whole Genome Ampliﬁcation&#xD;
      Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and labeled for microarray hybridization with&#xD;
      Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP, respectively, using the CGH Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent&#xD;
      Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) in accordance with the manufacturer´s instructions.&#xD;
      Custom designed tiling arrays were used (Agilent Technologies). All steps of the&#xD;
      hybridization, washing, scanning and feature extraction procedures is performed in accordance&#xD;
      with the Agilent Technologies protocol for chipon-chip analysis. Extracted microarray&#xD;
      intensities is processed and analyzed using the R software environment for statistical&#xD;
      computing (http://www.r-project.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene-speciﬁc Validation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      validation of MeDIP data will be performed applying quantitative-real time PCR (QPCR) using&#xD;
      the 2-ΔΔCt method. Data will be expressed as group means±s.e.m. The Graphpad 5 software will&#xD;
      be used to perform one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA extraction from human blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood for RNA extraction will be collected before injection of the radioligand and drawn into&#xD;
      PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). RNA is extracted using the&#xD;
      PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen). The quality and quantity of RNA samples will be analyzed&#xD;
      using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of gene expression in human blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reverse transcription will be performed using the high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription&#xD;
      Kit (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). Gene expression levels will be analyzed using&#xD;
      QPCR and the 2-ΔΔCt method. Data will be expressed as group means±s.e.m. Statistical&#xD;
      signiﬁcance will be tested using one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyrosequencing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The promoter region of specific genes will be analyzed by pyrosequencing. In brief, fragments&#xD;
      of bisulﬁte-treated DNA(EpiTect Bisulﬁte Kit, Qiagen) will be ampliﬁed by PCR (HotStar Taq&#xD;
      DNA Polymerase, Qiagen) primer information using an unmodiﬁed forward primer and a&#xD;
      biotin-labeled reverse primer (Euroﬁns, Ebersberg, Germany). Pyrosequencing will be performed&#xD;
      using a PyroMark Q24 Advanced system (Qiagen; primer information see Supplementary Table S2)&#xD;
      in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Methylated and unmethylated EpiTect control&#xD;
      DNA samples (Qiagen) will be used as controls for bisulﬁte conversion, ampliﬁcation and&#xD;
      pyrosequencing. The percentage of methylation at each CpG site will be quantiﬁed using the&#xD;
      PyroMark Q24 Advanced software version 3.0.0 (Qiagen) Sequencing will be performed in&#xD;
      triplicate. Quality control ﬁltering and statistical analyses of the pyrosequencing results&#xD;
      will be conducted using R Version 2.15.3 (http://www.r-project.org). Measurements marked as&#xD;
      unreliable by the Pyromark software will be removed from the data set. Triplicate&#xD;
      measurements will be averaged after the removal of outliers (values deviating more than 3%).&#xD;
      A Mann-Whitney U-test will be used to compare the mean percentage of methylation of CpG sites&#xD;
      for the ELS versus control groups. Data will be presented as the mean±s. e.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotypes will be investigated using GWAS data of a previous study of MDD. dbSNP of chosen&#xD;
      genes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) will be searched for SNPs (single-nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms) across the genes. The setbased test, as implemented in PLINK (v1.0.7)39 will&#xD;
      be performed (with default options and 105 permutations), to test for association between MDD&#xD;
      and the whole set of genetic variants in the data set&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1,T2 3D measurements (assessing Volume) of the hippocampus, Hypothalamic-Pituitary&#xD;
           gland and Mesocorticolimbic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DTI measurements in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of resting-state f-MRI (BOLD) brain networks in patients with depression with&#xD;
           normal maps&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual assessment and quantitative measurements of static F-DOPA (e.g., SUVmax and&#xD;
           SUVmean) will be performed in the VTA, NAc, PFC bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurements of dynamic F-DOPA parameters such as Ki when available (e.g., time to peak,&#xD;
           peak value etc.) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Quantitative&#xD;
      variables will be presented as mean and SD, qualitative variables will be presented as&#xD;
      frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to measure the strength of the relationship&#xD;
      between the PET in the different brain areas and the cluster symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A t-test will be used to compare the mean values of the different parameters. Sample size:&#xD;
      This is a pilot study for which a sample size of 60 subjects (30 healthy individuals and 30&#xD;
      patients) is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Sampling: All patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and providing informed&#xD;
      consent will be consecutively enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data will be coded and subject will be identified only by the subject's initials and&#xD;
      by the subject's study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
