      Objective: To compare the efficacy of topical 10% nifedipine versus 5% sildenafil in patients&#xD;
      with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study took place in 10 patients&#xD;
      with secondary RP. Topical 10% nifedipine on one hand and 5% sildenafil on the other hand&#xD;
      were applied. The thumbs didn't receive any cream and served as a control group. The primary&#xD;
      outcome was the improvement of blood flow and vessel diameter of the digital arteries&#xD;
      measured by high frequency color Doppler ultrasound before and 1 hour after treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is an exaggerated vascular response characterized by at least&#xD;
      biphasic change (pallor and cyanosis) in the skin color of the digits, induced by cold&#xD;
      temperature or emotional stress, The prevalence varies from 3 to 5%. In primary RP, there is&#xD;
      no evidence of a secondary cause and patients have a younger age at onset (between 15 and 30&#xD;
      years), whereas in secondary RP, patients are older and have a connective tissue diseases&#xD;
      (CTD), such as systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis&#xD;
      (DM), Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. In secondary RP there are endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and intimal fibrosis that compromise capillary blood flow. The treatment includes&#xD;
      maintaining warmth of the whole body, smoking cessation and avoiding cold exposure,&#xD;
      sympathomimetic medications and emotional stress. When these measures fail, the first line&#xD;
      drugs are calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), eg. nifedipine. If CCBs are ineffective or not&#xD;
      tolerated, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE-5), eg. sildenafil, or a topical nitrate&#xD;
      should be used alone or in combination with CCBs. Other drugs includes serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and prostaglandins. Unfortunately, secondary RP in&#xD;
      patients with CTD most often is refractory to standard therapies, becoming a therapeutic&#xD;
      challenge for clinicians. Based on the pathophysiology, topical vasodilators may act as an&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy. Several randomized trials have demonstrated the benefit of various forms of&#xD;
      topical nitrates (eg. nitroglycerin). In relation to other topical agents, solid evidence is&#xD;
      lacking. Color Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive imaging method that allows observation&#xD;
      with good definition of skin and deep planes, including vascularization in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of topical 10% nifedipine versus 5%&#xD;
      sildenafil in patients with secondary RP using high-frequency color Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      Patients The inclusion criteria considered patients with secondary RP associated with a CTD&#xD;
      diagnosed and under follow-up in the Department of Dermatology. Diagnosis of CTD was made&#xD;
      according to the ACR classification criteria for SSc, the Mixed Connective Tissue Disease&#xD;
      criteria proposed by Kasukawa et al, the Bohan and Peter DM criteria and the SLICC SLE&#xD;
      criteria. The exclusion criteria were primary RP patients; concurrent infection of any digit;&#xD;
      allergic reaction and current use of any CCB or PDE-5 inhibitor;, , pregnancy, hypo and&#xD;
      hypertension, history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia. All&#xD;
      patients signed a written informed consent. The Ethics Committee of Pontificia Universidad&#xD;
      Católica de Chile approved the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This prospective study was conducted in August 2016 (winter). After screening,&#xD;
      patients who were being treated with a vasodilator were required to discontinue it for at&#xD;
      least 24 hours before randomization. All patients were receiving immunosuppressive treatment&#xD;
      for their underlying disease. Patient hands (right versus left) were randomized to treatment&#xD;
      with topical sildenafil or nifedipine cream. The thumbs of both hands didn't receive any&#xD;
      cream so that each subject served as her own control. Subjects were instructed to apply 5&#xD;
      grams of 10% nifedipine cream in one hand and 5 grams of 5% sildenafil cream to the opposite&#xD;
      hand. Vinyl gloves were supplied to improve the absorption of the cream into the hand,&#xD;
      leaving the thumb of both hands out of the glove without any cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments The temperature of the examination room was set at 19ºC (66ºF) for ≥ 30&#xD;
      min and all patients underwent a high-frequency color Doppler ultrasound examination before&#xD;
      and 1 hour after the topical treatments. The same radiologist with extensive experience in&#xD;
      dermatologic ultrasound, performed all sonographic examinations. The radiologist was blinded&#xD;
      to the clinical data of the study and the senior dermatologist in charge of the supervision&#xD;
      of the application of the topical treatments was blinded to the color Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      results. The ultrasound equipment was a Logic E9 XD Clear working with a high frequency&#xD;
      (upper range 18 MHz) compact linear probe (General Electric Health Systems, Waukesha, WI).&#xD;
      The ultrasound protocol included grey scale, color Doppler and spectral curve analysis of the&#xD;
      arterial flow using the settings of the machine for studying skin and superficial structures.&#xD;
      The ultrasound device automatically provided the values. The primary outcome was the&#xD;
      improvement of blood flow in the digital arteries. For Doppler sonography, peak systolic&#xD;
      velocity (PSV, cm/sec) and diameter (mm) were measured at the palmar proper digital (PPD)&#xD;
      arteries (proximal phalanx level) of radial aspect of the index, middle and thumb fingers of&#xD;
      both hands. Also, PSV and diameter were measured at the dorsal (PD) arterial arch of the&#xD;
      proximal nail fold of the index, middle and thumb fingers of both hands. Immediate and late&#xD;
      adverse effects were monitored in all patients until 3 months after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis PSV of the PPD artery and PD arterial arch of the index and middle&#xD;
      fingers were added for a total PSV. The diameter of the PPD artery and PD arterial arch of&#xD;
      the index and middle fingers were added for a total diameter. Due to the low velocity ranges,&#xD;
      the values of peak systolic velocities in cm/sec were transformed into mm/sec. Treatment&#xD;
      efficacy was assessed by using the differences in digital artery blood flows (total PSV) and&#xD;
      diameters (total diameter) at baseline (time [t] = 0) and after 60 minutes (t = 60).&#xD;
      Difference in digital artery blood flow and the digital artery diameter was defined as (t =&#xD;
      0) minus (t = 60); thus, the efficacy of the treatment was reflected by a negative&#xD;
      difference. In all cases, mean differences less than zero indicates that the study drug cream&#xD;
      was effective; mean differences greater than or equal to zero indicates that the study drug&#xD;
      cream was ineffective. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and paired t-tests were used to assess&#xD;
      the changes in outcomes within the group before and after treatment as appropriate. All tests&#xD;
      were performed using two-tailed probabilities and p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
