      In this retrospective cohort study, we plan to examine the relationship between buprenorphine&#xD;
      dose adjustments, gestational age, urine buprenorphine levels and the rate of neonatal&#xD;
      abstinence syndrome in opioid-maintained pregnant women&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of opioid use disorder in pregnancy was four per 1000 deliveries in 2011 and&#xD;
      has increased to 5.4% in 2013. Repeated, acute withdrawal during pregnancy is not recommended&#xD;
      as it is may be associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm labor and&#xD;
      delivery. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends methadone&#xD;
      as the first line treatments for opioid use during pregnancy and buprenorphine as an&#xD;
      alternative. Methadone therapy has been used since the 1970's for the treatment of heroin&#xD;
      addiction during pregnancy and efficacy is well documented. Prescribing methadone has&#xD;
      barriers, such as significant drug interactions and enrollment in a registered substance&#xD;
      abuse treatment program. Emerging evidence supports the use of buprenorphine for opioid use&#xD;
      disorder in pregnancy. Buprenorphine has some distinct advantages over methadone which&#xD;
      include a lower risk of overdose, fewer drug interactions, and no need for registration into&#xD;
      a methadone treatment program. However, buprenorphine has a lower rate of retention in&#xD;
      treatment than methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid use disorder increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to women who do&#xD;
      not use opioids.One such outcome is neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) which affects&#xD;
      approximately 55% to 94% of neonates exposed to addictive medications during pregnancy. A&#xD;
      2016 review of five trials involving buprenorphine and methadone in pregnant patients found&#xD;
      that buprenorphine significantly improved or had similar outcomes to methadone for neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. Buprenorphine exposed infants required less treatment for NAS (20%-47% vs&#xD;
      45.5%-57%, respectively) and experienced a shorter duration of NAS (4.1-5.6 vs 5.3-9.9 days,&#xD;
      respectively) compared to methadone exposed infants. Buprenorphine is associated with fewer&#xD;
      preterm deliveries and adverse fetal outcomes including the rate of NAS, medication&#xD;
      assistance for NAS, and total dose of morphine used to treat NAS. There are currently no&#xD;
      studies evaluating the level of buprenorphine doses on the rate of NAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pharmacokinetic changes occur during pregnancy which impact medications and increase&#xD;
      the risk for subtherapeutic levels. Subtherapeutic buprenorphine levels may increase the risk&#xD;
      for withdrawal symptoms and cravings, which may increase the risk for relapse. The volume of&#xD;
      distribution increases for both hydrophilic and lipophilic medications throughout pregnancy&#xD;
      due to increased body fluid, increased adipose tissue, and decreased protein binding.&#xD;
      Buprenorphine is metabolized through cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 3A4, UGT1A1, 1A3, and 2B7.&#xD;
      Pregnancy increases hepatic metabolism of the CYP450 3A4 and UGT2B7. Buprenorphine is&#xD;
      eliminated 70% through the feces and 30% through the urine. Pregnancy increases hepatic and&#xD;
      renal elimination. Elimination is increased partly due to increased cardiac output secondary&#xD;
      to increased plasma volume. Cardiac output reaches its maximum at approximately 32 weeks,&#xD;
      whereas peak renal elimination occurs at 36 weeks. These pharmacokinetic changes typically&#xD;
      require doses to be increased as pregnancy progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limitation of methadone therapy is the unpredictable pharmacokinetics during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Methadone is a lipophilic and highly protein-bound medication, making the medication less&#xD;
      available during pregnancy. It is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, which leads to decreased&#xD;
      concentrations of methadone in the plasma during pregnancy. One study performed by Pond and&#xD;
      colleagues examined methadone serum concentrations during the second and third trimesters and&#xD;
      at two separate time points post-partum. They found plasma trough methadone concentrations&#xD;
      were lower and methadone renal clearance was higher in the second and third trimesters than&#xD;
      in the post-partum time period, supporting the finding that methadone requires dose increases&#xD;
      as pregnancy progresses. A literature review explored studies related to dosing and&#xD;
      monitoring of methadone in pregnancy. This review included a a study that found a methadone&#xD;
      plasma trough level of 0.78 µmol/L was required to prevent withdrawal. The authors of the&#xD;
      review found evidence to support that methadone pharmacokinetics appear to be altered in&#xD;
      pregnancy but that there is a lack of evidence to support routine serum monitoring. Although&#xD;
      based on the Drozdick study they do endorse monitoring trough levels when withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      are apparent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies evaluated the effect of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine. Based&#xD;
      on the characteristics of the medication it would be expected that pharmacokinetic changes in&#xD;
      pregnancy would be similar to those of methadone. One difference is that buprenorphine has an&#xD;
      active metabolite which may make buprenorphine dosing more predictable. the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of buprenorphine in plasma, oral fluid, and sweat of pregnant women (n=9). At 28-29 and 34&#xD;
      weeks gestation and 2 months postpartum, plasma, oral fluid and sweat levels were collected&#xD;
      over 24 hours. The maximum concentration and total amount of buprenorphine and&#xD;
      norbuprenorphine in plasma were lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum levels&#xD;
      (buprenorphine Cmax 0.2ng/mL/mg vs 1ng/mL/mg and Tmax 1.5h*ng/mL/mg vs 7h*ng/mL/mg,&#xD;
      norbuprenorphine Cmax 3ng/mL/mg vs 13ng/mL/mg and Tmax no change). Therefore, these&#xD;
      significant metabolic changes during pregnancy and immediately postpartum could indicate the&#xD;
      need for dose adjustment of buprenorphine. Another small trial of nine pregnant women on&#xD;
      buprenorphine maintenance therapy assessed the urinary excretion of buprenorphine and its&#xD;
      metabolites every 12 days from the second trimester through 6 weeks postpartum. The mean&#xD;
      ratio of urine buprenorphine to norbuprenorphine was significantly higher in the second&#xD;
      trimester compared to the third trimester in all patients. Additionally, the mean dose of&#xD;
      buprenorphine increased from the second to the third trimester in seven of the nine women. In&#xD;
      a subset of 3 patients, 24-hour buprenorphine and metabolite excretion was collected.&#xD;
      Buprenorphine levels were higher during pregnancy than postpartum in all three (0.8 mg, 5.0&#xD;
      mg, 2.0 mg vs 0.55 mg, 4.0 mg, 0.8 mg, respectively). The uncorrected buprenorphine urine&#xD;
      concentrations ranged from 5.5 to 12.1 µg/L [mean 7.0 (2.8) µg/L], although they did not&#xD;
      evaluate if withdrawal symptoms occurred below a certain threshold. The buprenorphine dose in&#xD;
      this study was flexible, with increases or decreases made through clinical decisions based on&#xD;
      compliance in taking medication, participant requests, urine toxicology, and participant&#xD;
      self-reports of opioid withdrawal symptoms or craving. Buprenorphine dose was positively&#xD;
      correlated to creatinine-corrected norbuprenorphine (P &lt; 0.001, R = 0.197),&#xD;
      buprenorphine-glucuronide (P &lt; 0.002, R = 0.143), and norbuprenorphine-glucuronide (P &lt;&#xD;
      0.001, R = 0.182) concentrations across the study. However low correlation coefficients&#xD;
      indicate that prediction of metabolite concentrations in urine based on buprenorphine dose,&#xD;
      or vice versa, would be unreliable. These studies support the need for increased doses of&#xD;
      buprenorphine throughout pregnancy, but may have been too small to determine whether a&#xD;
      relationship between buprenorphine urine levels and dose adjustments exists. Currently, no&#xD;
      studies examined the relationship between gestational age and buprenorphine dose adjustments&#xD;
      after having achieved maintenance dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information could assist providers in optimizing monitoring of pregnant women and&#xD;
      informing providers regarding dose adjustments. Preventing subtherapeutic levels may decrease&#xD;
      the risk for withdrawal symptoms, craving, and risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data are available to evaluate whether a particular gestational age requires dose&#xD;
      adjustments due to pregnancy-related pharmacokinetic changes. The program obtains&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine urine levels at each visit.&#xD;
      These data are used to confirm that she is taking her buprenorphine prescription. No data are&#xD;
      available to determine if there is a lower threshold in urine buprenorphine and metabolite&#xD;
      that levels correlate with symptoms that require dose increases. Additionally, no data are&#xD;
      available evaluating if rates of NAS, treatment for NAS, or total dose of morphine for NAS&#xD;
      correlates as a function of maternal dose.&#xD;
