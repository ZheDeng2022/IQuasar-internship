  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment with stenting is currently used in the treatment of femoro-popliteal&#xD;
      lesions. This technique tends to extend to lesions for which the gold standard remains until&#xD;
      now the open surgery treatment (lesions TASC C and D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy at 12 months of the&#xD;
      SuperA stent (Abbott) in the treatment of long de novo atherosclerotic lesions TASC C and D&#xD;
      in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the SuperA stent at 24 months, according to clinical,&#xD;
      morphological and haemodynamic criteria, the possible influence of calcifications and the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SuperA stent treatment is not specifically provided for by the Protocol but is carried&#xD;
      out within the framework of the care. This study is an observationnal study.&#xD;

      Patient will be recruiting during 1 year. Patient will be followed in the study during 2&#xD;
      years. Pre-operative exams are collected. Patients are asked to give their oral authorization&#xD;
      to participate in the study by their surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient can be included up to the next day of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal lesion with SuperA stents during medical care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will be achieved in operative room, under local anesthesia and sedation or&#xD;
      general anesthesia. An angio-CT or an arteriography is necessary to attest the presence for&#xD;
      TASC C or D lesion involving the superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long femoropopliteal lesion must be pre-dilated during 3 minutes with a balloon of 1mm&#xD;
      diameter more than the stent to be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control arteriography will be done before the implantation of the stent and at the end of&#xD;
      the intervention to assess the success of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If needed, endovascular treatment could be realized on the inflow or outflow in the same&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up is performed at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Follow-up will systematically&#xD;
      include a clinical evaluation and a duplex scan with the ankle brachial index (ABI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The x-rays and the quality of life questionnaire will be done at 1, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical surveillance events, complications and re-hospitalizations will be collected.&#xD;

        The patients included in this study are major patients and have lower limb arteriopathy&#xD;
        requiring a therapeutic gesture in the femoro-popliteal segment. The inclusion in this&#xD;
        study will be proposed to the patients during the consultation of preoperative vascular&#xD;
        surgery or during the hospitalization, until the day after their intervention. The number&#xD;
        of subjects planned is 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the case where the patient has bilateral femoropopliteal lesions, the limbs being&#xD;
        treated in separate hospitalizations, both members may be treated with SuperA stents. The&#xD;
        two members will then be considered independently of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with associated lesions requiring treatment, any artery confused, may be treated&#xD;
        at the same operative time if deemed necessary by the surgeon.&#xD;
