  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper digestive bleeding. Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a common cause of&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis and is associated with a high mortality rate among cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients. Its leading cause is the rupture of gastro-esophageal varices due to portal&#xD;
      hypertension. In cirrhotic patients, the management of acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage is&#xD;
      challenging as they often present with coagulation (or haemostasis abnormalities)&#xD;
      abnormalities such as hyperfibrinolysis, especially when the cirrhosis is decompensated.&#xD;
      Beyond life support measures, therapeutic modalities of upper gastrointestinal bleeding rely&#xD;
      on both endoscopic and pharmacological interventions. Tranexamic acid (TA) is an&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic that may help control the bleeding in this setting, as it showed an&#xD;
      unquestionable benefit in other indications. TA has previously been studied in both upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal haemorrhage from any causes and in liver transplantation of cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients. However, there is a lack of data to conclude on its effectiveness (or efficiency)&#xD;
      in the early treatment of acute bleeding in cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that, when given early, TA would be beneficial for cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage , by controlling the&#xD;
      haemorrhage, avoiding rebleeding episodes and reducing mortality within 5 days after its&#xD;
      administration. Moreover, TA could prevent early cirrhosis complications (such as hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, sepsis and ascites liquid infection, hepatorenal syndrome), could reduce&#xD;
      indications to transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS), shorten the length of stay in&#xD;
      intensive care unit and the length of hospitalization, and decrease late relapses and&#xD;
      one-year mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (UGIH) is frequent, with an estimated annual&#xD;
      incidence of 150/100 000 in France. Its second etiology is the rupture of portal&#xD;
      hypertension-related gastro-esophageal varices, accounting for 20 % of the patients and&#xD;
      responsible for more than 50 % of the hospitalizations in intensive care unit (ICU) for UGIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cirrhotic patients, variceal bleeding is the main cause of UGIH (over 70 %) and death (30&#xD;
      %), which occurs in the most severe patients (Child-Pugh score B or C and/or high MELD score,&#xD;
      and high levels of portal hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute UGIH is directly responsible for 50 % of the deaths, either because it remains&#xD;
      uncontrolled during the acute phase (within 5 days), or because of early relapses (within 6&#xD;
      weeks). Every episode of acute UGIH worsens the middle and long-term vital prognosis: about&#xD;
      60 % of the patients present with UGIH recurrence within one year and the survival rate is&#xD;
      only 30 % 3 years after the first episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, acute UGIH is a triggering factor for several severe cirrhosis-specific&#xD;
      complications (such as hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis and ascites liquid infection,&#xD;
      hepatorenal syndrome), which themselves lead to high mortality rates. Despite the improvement&#xD;
      of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, UGIH remains stable in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The haemostasis of cirrhotic patients is often abnormal at baseline : thrombopenia, decrease&#xD;
      of factors II, V, VII, IX, X and XI, decrease of fibrinolytic proteins, increase of factor&#xD;
      VIII and spontaneous fibrinolysis. When compensated, the cirrhotic's haemostasis remains&#xD;
      globally preserved, due to the balance of pro and anticoagulant alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every cause of cirrhosis decompensation, such as acute PHT-UGIH, can increase hemostatic&#xD;
      disorders, leading to hyperfibrinolysis. This could slow down or inhibit the clotting, thus&#xD;
      disrupting pharmacological control of acute UGIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TA could be efficient in acute UGIH of cirrhotic patients. It is a simple antifibrinolytic&#xD;
      which showed clinical benefits on haemorrhage and/or mortality in several other indications&#xD;
      (surgical, obstetrical and traumatic). It is now widely used according to recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early administration of TA seems to be beneficial in UGIH haemorrhage. Despite theoretical&#xD;
      efficiency, 4 recent Cochrane meta-analysis concluded to the lack of significant data (poor&#xD;
      overall trials quality). The benefit of the use of TA in acute UGIH (and acute PHT-UGIH)&#xD;
      remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this day, TA has still not been studied in acute UGIH of cirrhotic patients, although it&#xD;
      showed benefits on blood transfusion's requirements and on haemorrhagic complications during&#xD;
      liver transplantation (for which cirrhosis most frequent cause).&#xD;
