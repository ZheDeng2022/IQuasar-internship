  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common symptom that is experienced by patients with advanced cancer. Whilst mild&#xD;
      pain can usually be controlled with simple analgesics, more severe pain may require&#xD;
      initiation of opioid analgesics. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a specific&#xD;
      guideline for titration of analgesics. Known as the WHO Pain Ladder, patients who have severe&#xD;
      pain despite non-opioid and weak opioid analgesics are advised to step up to level 3 -&#xD;
      &quot;Strong Opioids&quot;. Morphine is the most common opioid strong analgesic prescribed in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. To the best of our knowledge, there is no formal opioid pain control guideline&#xD;
      developed for cancer patients in Hong Kong. The prescription practices of various physicians&#xD;
      who treat advance cancer patients, including oncologists and palliative care physicians have&#xD;
      never been audited or standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are inherent issues with the administration of oral morphine. Currently,&#xD;
      only one fixed concentration is available in a liquid formulation. Patients are known to have&#xD;
      difficulties in receiving the appropriate dose. Accurate measurement of the volume required&#xD;
      is extremely difficult, and many a times patients will report to have spilled the oral&#xD;
      morphine during decanting, or will report that they have not been taking adequate doses&#xD;
      because they are worried that they will decant too much into a spoon or syringe and overdose&#xD;
      themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxycodone is a semisynthetic strong opioid analgesic, which has recently been introduced to&#xD;
      Hong Kong. It is formulated as a capsule, and again, 2 preparations (sustained-release&#xD;
      (Oxycontin) and immediate release (Oxycodone IR)) are available. Inherent advantages include&#xD;
      ease of administration; different groups have previously reported less adverse effects and&#xD;
      better treatment compliance. However, to date, there has been no prospective 'head-to-head'&#xD;
      comparison have ever been carried out comparing this with the traditional, well-accepted&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether or not the use of Oxycontin and Oxycodone IR&#xD;
      may be superior to traditional medication choices and schedules in terms of time required for&#xD;
      onset of pain control, the side effect profile, patients' tolerability and compliance to&#xD;
      treatment. Interestingly, through this randomized open-label prospective study, we also aim&#xD;
      to capture information on current opioid prescription practices by clinicians who manage&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancers, which will be useful for us to consider the establishment of&#xD;
      territory-wide treatment guidelines at a later juncture.&#xD;
