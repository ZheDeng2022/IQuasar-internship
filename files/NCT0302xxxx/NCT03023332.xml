      How do varying levels of participation in selecting self-management interventions (ranging&#xD;
      from no input into the selection to selection based on need or preference) affect health&#xD;
      risks and physical and mental health over time in family caregivers of persons with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder? Caregivers will be randomized to: 1) a control group (no intervention); 2)&#xD;
      education (usual care); 3) self-management intervention based on need (SM-need); or 4)&#xD;
      self-management intervention of their preference (SM-preference).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two aims: The primary aim (A1) is to examine differences across the four groups&#xD;
      (control, usual care, SM-need, and SM-preference) on caregiver health (health risks and&#xD;
      mental and physical health) over time. We hypothesize that the caregivers who receive a&#xD;
      self-management intervention based on need (SM-need) or preference (SM-preference) will have&#xD;
      better health outcomes than those in the usual care or control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to: A2) explore whether caregiver baseline need or preference for&#xD;
      intervention (i.e. choice) is associated with: a) care recipient's symptoms; b) caregiver&#xD;
      reactions; and c) caregiving involvement, and A3) build caregiver profiles from demographic/&#xD;
      contextual factors that are associated with their needs and preferences for the&#xD;
      self-management interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All caregivers will complete assessment measures and measures of health risks, and physical&#xD;
      and mental health at baseline (T1), 6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3). Caregivers will&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of four groups. The control group will receive no intervention. The&#xD;
      usual care group will receive bipolar education. The SM-need group will receive a&#xD;
      self-management intervention tailored to meet their need for bipolar education, biofeedback&#xD;
      training, or resourcefulness training, as determined by baseline cut scores. Caregivers in&#xD;
      the SM-preference group will choose one of the three self-management intervention according&#xD;
      to their personal preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three self-management interventions (bipolar education, biofeedback training,&#xD;
      resourcefulness training) are delivered over four weeks (between T1 and T2). Caregivers may&#xD;
      use the one SM intervention whenever and as often as they wish (i.e. self-tailoring) for the&#xD;
      remainder of the study period. The bipolar education and resourcefulness training&#xD;
      interventions will be delivered initially using an iPad. These interventions involve&#xD;
      providing educational information about bipolar disorder or teaching self-help&#xD;
      (stress-management, problem-solving) and help-seeking skills, respectively. Biofeedback&#xD;
      training consists of use of a hand-held device that shows the participant their changes in&#xD;
      heart rate based on changes in their breathing pattern (as they relax); caregivers who need&#xD;
      or prefer the biofeedback will be given a device to use for 28 days. All study participants&#xD;
      receiving the intervention will also be asked to keep a journal to record their experience&#xD;
      with the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Use of a heart-rate variability (HRV) tracking device to enable one to learn to alter physiology to improve health. Devices are used to measure physiological activity, e.g., breathing and heart function, and provide rapid, accurate &quot;feedback&quot; to the user, thereby enabling desired physiological changes that can endure over time without continued use of the device and continue to influence behavior.</description>
