      Objectives: To assess the predictive value of IUS in children with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective longitudinal cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Institute of Gastroenterology, Nutrition and Liver Diseases, Schneider Children's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Children 2 years to 17 years (up to 200 patients) who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      either CD or UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: The changes in bowel wall thickness, assessed by IUS, during 2-year&#xD;
      follow-up according to therapeutic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: Correlation of sonographic measures to clinical disease indices,&#xD;
      serum inflammatory and other laboratory markers, fecal calprotectin, endoscopic and other&#xD;
      radiologic measures performed as part of routine care.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that bowel wall thickness as measured routinely by IUS has a&#xD;
      role in predicting short- and long-term disease outcomes such as flares, hospitalizations,&#xD;
      treatment escalation and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the changes in bowel wall thickness, assessed by IUS, during 2-year follow-up,&#xD;
      according to therapeutic regimen and to evaluate its predictive significance on disease&#xD;
      outcomes (flares, hospitalizations, treatment escalation and surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the correlation of sonographic measures to clinical disease&#xD;
      indices, serum inflammatory and other laboratory markers, fecal calprotectin, endoscopic and&#xD;
      other radiologic measures performed as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: A prospective longitudinal cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients: Children at age 2 year to 17 years diagnosed with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children diagnosed with either CD or UC under follow-up at the Institute of Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Nutrition and Liver Diseases, Schneider Children's Hospital, will be enrolled. Patients can&#xD;
      be enrolled at diagnosis or at any time point during follow-up. Patients' characteristics&#xD;
      will be retrieved from their medical files including demographic details, disease phenotype,&#xD;
      endoscopic and radiologic variables, anthropometric measures, laboratory evaluation,&#xD;
      complication and therapeutic regimens. At enrollment and every 3 months for a total period of&#xD;
      2 years all patients will perform IUS during regular clinic visits. All other measures&#xD;
      including laboratory exams, anthropometric measurements and disease activity indices (either&#xD;
      wPCDAI for CD or PUCAI for UC) will be performed as part of standard of care and not for the&#xD;
      purpose of the study. If endoscopic evaluation or an MRE are necessary according to the&#xD;
      treating physician discretion for assessment of disease activity, these will not be performed&#xD;
      as part of the study but the results will be recorded and included in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS (version 23.0, SPSS, Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) and r-project&#xD;
      version 3.1.1. Continues variables will be presented as either mean±SD or median with&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) depending on the data approximation to normal distribution.&#xD;
      Agreement between IUS and MRE (when available) will be assessed using Bland-Altman plot and&#xD;
      Concurrent Validity quantified by correlation coefficient and concordance correlation&#xD;
      coefficient. Associations of therapeutic intervention and other variables with outcome&#xD;
      measures will be examined using repeated measures ANOVA. p-values &lt;0.05 is considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pediatric IBD patients at Schneider Children's Hospital, fulfilling the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are eligible for the study. For assessment of therapeutic interventions of IUS the&#xD;
      investigators will use mixed model ANOVA. Sample size was calculated for repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA with in-between interactions. Assuming effect size F 0.25 (or partial η2=0.06), an&#xD;
      alpha of 5% and statistical power of 80% and a correlation of 0.5, the investigators will&#xD;
      need at least 34 CD patients and 34 UC patients.&#xD;
