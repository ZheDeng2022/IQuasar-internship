  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) is described firstly in 1908 by August Bier. It is&#xD;
      simple, safe, reliable, less cost, efficient method in forearm surgery. The advantage of this&#xD;
      method has fast return of motor and sensory function which enables patients for earlier&#xD;
      discharge. However, this method has disadvantages such as tourniquet pain, insufficient&#xD;
      muscle relaxation and postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine inhibits action potential propagation within neuronal tissue by binding to&#xD;
      receptors in Na+ channels located on the nerve cell membrane. Lidocaine IVRA is safe and&#xD;
      effective and is associated with a rapid onset (4.5 minutes) of anesthesia after injection&#xD;
      and termination of analgesia (5.8 Â± 0.5 minutes) once the tourniquet is deflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neostigmine is a typical cholinesterase inhibitor. It increases the level of acetylcholine&#xD;
      (Ach) and indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. In anesthesia,&#xD;
      neostigmine is a drug that has been used for reversal of residual neuromuscular block.&#xD;
      Administration of neostigmine by intrathecal and epidural routes has been found to cause&#xD;
      analgesia by inhibition of the breakdown of Ach in the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is commonly used in anesthesia to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV). Two recent meta-analyses have documented that dexamethasone also reduced&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Intravenous dexamethasone has also been shown to&#xD;
      improve postoperative pain control in patients receiving spinal or epidural morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hong et al reported that intravenous dexamethasone in combination with a caudal block with&#xD;
      ropivacaine prolonged the duration of postoperative analgesia without adverse effects in&#xD;
      children undergoing orchidopexy. So the investigators expect that addition of dexamethasone&#xD;
      or neostigmine will affect duration and postoperative analgesia in bier block.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective clinical randomized controlled double-blind study using a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization. Neither the doctor &quot;investigator&quot; nor the participant&#xD;
      &quot;patient&quot; will be aware of the group allocation or the drug used. The study drugs will be&#xD;
      prepared by one of the supervisor anesthesiologists (not included in the procedure,&#xD;
      observation or data collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in Assiut University Hospital after approval from our local&#xD;
      ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be classified in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to sample size calculator. Group D: will include 30 patients and will receive&#xD;
      intravenous 3mg/kg lidocaine 2 % (diluted with normal saline to 40 ml) + 8 mg dexamethasone&#xD;
      for bier block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group N: will include 30 patients and will receive intravenous 3mg/kg lidocaine 2 % (diluted&#xD;
      with normal saline to 40 ml) + 0.5 mg neostigmine for bier block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the procedure, the patient should be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Starved for 6-8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitored closely (standard monitoring applied: HR, NIBP, SaO2 and RR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequately informed about the procedure and have consented to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipments required for IVRA include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pneumatic tourniquet (checked for leaks before the procedure) and a pressure gauge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esmarch bandage or Rhys-Davis exsanguination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local anesthetic solution and the adjuvants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resuscitation equipments and drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVRA of the arm: a 22 G cannula is placed intravenously as distal as possible in the arm to&#xD;
      be anesthetized. Venous access is established in the opposite arm to allow administration of&#xD;
      fluids or other drugs if necessary. The double tourniquet (two tourniquets each 6 cm wide) or&#xD;
      a single one (14 cm wide) is applied on the operated arm with generous layers of padding,&#xD;
      ensuring that no wrinkles are formed and the tourniquet edges do not touch the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arm is exsanguinated either by using the Esmarch bandage or a Rhys-Davis exsanguinator.&#xD;
      If this is impossible, exsanguination can be achieved by elevating the arm for 2-3 minutes&#xD;
      while compressing the axillary artery. The distal tourniquet is inflated to at least 100 mm&#xD;
      Hg higher than the patient's systolic blood pressure (250 - 300 mmHg). The proximal&#xD;
      tourniquet is inflated to the same pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ensuring inflation, the distal cuff is deflated. Before injecting local anesthetic, it&#xD;
      must be confirmed that no radial pulse is palpable. The local anesthetic is then injected&#xD;
      slowly. A standard volume for injection into the upper limb is 40 ml, which can be increased&#xD;
      to 50 ml in a fit, large adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the injection is too rapid, the venous pressure may exceed the tourniquet pressure and the&#xD;
      local anesthetic solution may escape into the systemic circulation. Surgical anesthesia is&#xD;
      usually achieved within 15 minutes. The distal tourniquet, which overlies part of the&#xD;
      anesthetized arm, can then be inflated and the proximal one deflated to relieve tourniquet&#xD;
      pain. The cuff should not be deflated until 20 minutes after local anesthetic injection&#xD;
      because systemic toxic doses of local anesthetic may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cuff deflation should be performed in cycles with deflation/inflation times of less than 10&#xD;
      seconds until the patient no longer exhibits signs of systemic toxicity (e.g. tingling of the&#xD;
      lips, tinnitus or drowsiness). Therefore, the patient should be monitored closely for 30&#xD;
      minutes following tourniquet release. So, the investigators expect that addition of&#xD;
      dexamethasone or neostigmine will affect duration and postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient's data: include patient's gender, age, weight, height, BMI and ASA&#xD;
           classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Basic Monitoring: heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), arterial&#xD;
                oxygen saturation (SaO2), respiratory rate (RR) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Preoperative investigations: prothrombin time, prothrombin concentration and INR to&#xD;
                avoid any risk of internal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Basal assessment of motor power and sensation of the limb:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Motor power: Motor block was evaluated by thumb abduction (radial nerve), thumb&#xD;
           adduction (ulnar nerve), thumb opposition (median nerve), and flexion at the elbow&#xD;
           (musculocutaneous nerve) on a 3-point scale for motor function (0: normal motor&#xD;
           function, 1: reduced motor strength but able to move fingers, 2: complete motor block).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sensation: Sensory block (4 nerves) was assessed by ice packs using a 3-point scale: 0:&#xD;
           normal sensation, 1: loss of sensation of cold (analgesia), 2: loss of sensation of&#xD;
           touch (anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
           d- The standard value of visual analogue scale will be set as the score during passive&#xD;
           exercise before the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Introperative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Basic Monitoring: heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), arterial&#xD;
                oxygen saturation (SaO2), respiratory rate (RR) will be recorded every 10 minutes&#xD;
                till the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sensory and motor block: Sensory and motor blocks will be evaluated every 5 minutes&#xD;
                until 20 minutes after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Onset time will be defined as the time interval between the end of total local&#xD;
           anesthetic administration and complete sensory block. Complete sensory block will be&#xD;
           defined by anesthetic block (score 2) on all nerve territories.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complete motor block will be defined as absence of voluntary movement on hand and&#xD;
           forearm (score 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
           c- Duration of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Postoperative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Duration of sensory and motor block:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Duration of sensory block will be defined as the time interval between the end of&#xD;
                local anesthetic administration and the complete resolution of anesthesia on all&#xD;
                nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Duration of motor block will be defined as the time interval between the end of&#xD;
                local anesthetic administration and the recovery of complete motor function of the&#xD;
                hand and forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Duration of analgesia: interval between onsets of the block to the time of the&#xD;
                first analgesic requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Analgesia assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postoperatively, a Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) nurse will assess the quality of&#xD;
           analgesia. The pain score will be recorded using the Visual Analouge Scale (VAS) 2, 4,&#xD;
           6, 12 and 24 hours after surgery. Significant pain is defined as one that has a score of&#xD;
           â¥ 4 and as a consequence required a supplementary dose of analgesia. Intravenous&#xD;
           Paracetamol 15 mg/kg, will be administered and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d- Documentation of any complications: Includes local anesthetic toxicity &amp; drug&#xD;
           additives complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Local anesthetic toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â¢ Initial symptoms are subjective and include perioral tingling or numbness,&#xD;
           lightheadedness, tinnitus, metallic taste, slurred speech, auditory and visual&#xD;
           disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â¢ Minor symptoms usually do not require treatment. If any of these occur observe patient&#xD;
           closely and identify any potential reasons for systemic toxicity eg: check for cuff&#xD;
           failure - re-inflate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Significant neurotoxicity: Objective signs are usually excitatory: twitching,&#xD;
                fasciculation and seizures:&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Check for cuff failure - re-inflate immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Administer Midazolam 2.5-5.0 mg iv&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Support the ABC's as indicated Most seizures are self-limiting but can be&#xD;
                     potentiated by hypoxia, acidosis and hypercarbia so these should be treated&#xD;
                     aggressively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Significant cardiotoxicity: if occurs (eg: hypotension, bradycardia and&#xD;
                arrhythmias):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Give oxygen and adopt an ACLS approach Check for cuff failure - re-inflate immediately&#xD;
           Bicarbonate may be indicated to address acidaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug additives complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be monitored for any complications that may occur from any adjuvant&#xD;
           drugs used in the study and will be treated promptly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis All data will be collected and analyzed using SPSS version 20&#xD;
           (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinios, USA). Normally distributed data will be expressed as&#xD;
           mean Â± standard deviation, range, numbers and percentages. A probability (p) value of&#xD;
           less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
