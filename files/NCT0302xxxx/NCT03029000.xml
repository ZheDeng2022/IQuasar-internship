      A multi-center, open-label, single-arm clinical study to assess effects of a 5-day regimen of&#xD;
      10 micrograms per kilogram (mcg/kg) of tbo-filgrastim administered subcutaneously daily on&#xD;
      the mobilization of cluster of differentiation 34+ (CD34+) cells in at least 60 healthy male&#xD;
      and female participants. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of tbo-filgrastim will be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive tbo-filgrastim 10 mcg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously on the morning of Days 1 to 5.&#xD;
The actual dose of tbo-filgrastim administered to each, individual participant will be calculated at baseline according to his or her body weight and that specific dose (10 mcg/kg of body weight) for each, individual participant will remain the same for all consecutive daily doses.&#xD;
If the collection goal will not meet after the first apheresis on Day 5, tbo-filgrastim 10 mcg/kg of body weight will be administered subcutaneously for up to 3 additional days (Days 6 to 8) followed by daily apheresis to reach the cumulative collection goal.</description>
