    <textblock>
      The main goal of the research is to apply and evaluate the web-based preventive intervention&#xD;
      (the Be a Mom program), in terms of its efficacy, acceptability and feasibility (user's&#xD;
      adherence, dropout), and user's satisfaction. Prior to the randomized controlled trial (RCT),&#xD;
      the investigators will conduct a pilot trial to evaluate the preliminary version of the Be a&#xD;
      Mom program in high-risk women (random assignment to the intervention or to the control&#xD;
      condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will be a two-arm prevention trial. Women who have had a child during the prior month&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. A minimum number of 1000 women will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      After agreeing to participate in the study, the women will be screened for the presence of&#xD;
      risk factors for PPD and early-onset PPD symptoms (using self-report questionnaires) by a&#xD;
      researcher (licensed psychologist). In case of a negative screen, women's participation in&#xD;
      the study will end. In case of a positive screen (high-risk women), women will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the conditions: the intervention (Be a Mom program) or the control&#xD;
      condition. The sample will be recruited online and at the maternities of Coimbra University&#xD;
      Hospitals-CHUC, EPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will last 11 months. The Be a Mom program will last 5 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants in both conditions will be invited by the researchers via email to complete&#xD;
      baseline, post-intervention and follow-up (4-months and 12-months after childbirth)&#xD;
      assessments. Assessments will include self-report questionnaires to assess several indicators&#xD;
      (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms, dyadic adjustment, mother-child bonding, and maternal&#xD;
      confidence), mechanisms that may be involved in the treatment response (e.g., npsychological&#xD;
      flexibility, emotional regulation) and user's acceptability and satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, a web-based intervention to prevent PPD (the Be a Mom program) will be&#xD;
      tested. The design and content development of the Be a Mom program was conducted through a&#xD;
      formative evaluation process (including a systematic literature review about the&#xD;
      characteristic and content of existing effective preventive interventions for PPD and a focus&#xD;
      group with stakeholders to identify the perceived needs of the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be a Mom is self-guided intervention grounded on CBT principles, and besides addressing the&#xD;
      key topics in the prevention of depression, it also addresses key content areas that are&#xD;
      associated with risk for PPD (e.g., communication skills that may help women to manage the&#xD;
      transition to motherhood). Moreover, it also includes recent developments in acceptance and&#xD;
      commitment based-therapies, specifically for the perinatal context. Be a Mom has a modular&#xD;
      set-up that is updated weekly, with each module addressing one or two specific thematic&#xD;
      contents (Changes and reorganizations during the transition to parenthood; Emotional&#xD;
      diversity; Cognitions; Relationship with others [social support and communication]; Couple&#xD;
      relationship; Signs and symptoms of depression and help-seeking). In each module,&#xD;
      participants will be provided with both psychoeducational content and therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
      Informational material will be given in text format, combined with audio, video and/or&#xD;
      animations. The Be a Mom program will also include interactive tools and feedback tools to&#xD;
      support learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Be a Mom program will be delivered during the postpartum period, as this was identified&#xD;
      as privileged time for the implementation of preventive approaches for PPD. Moreover, the Be&#xD;
      a Mom program is recommended to target high-risk women (i.e., women who present antenatally&#xD;
      identified risk factors for PPD or with early-onset depressive symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the research is to apply and evaluate the web-based preventive intervention&#xD;
      (the Be a Mom program), in terms of its efficacy, acceptability and feasibility (user's&#xD;
      adherence, dropout), and user's satisfaction. The efficacy of the program will be assessed&#xD;
      considering two indicators: a) absence of clinically significant depressive symptoms at&#xD;
      post-intervention and throughout the first postpartum year; and b) post-intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up improvements in mother's psychosocial adjustment indicators (anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      maternal confidence and dyadic adjustment). The present study will also aim to investigate&#xD;
      the mechanisms explaining the treatment response (e.g., negative automatic thoughts,&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, self-compassion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design of the trial followed the methodological recommendations for the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of web-based interventions. Prior to the randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT), a pilot trial to evaluate the preliminary version of the Be a Mom program will&#xD;
      be conducted. The pilot study will be conducted with women presenting high-risk for PPD or&#xD;
      early-onset depressive symptoms (assessed one-month postpartum through self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires). The investigators will randomly assign high-risk women to the intervention&#xD;
      (the Be a Mom program) or to the control condition, and women will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      and post-intervention concerning adjustment outcomes, acceptability, feasibility and user's&#xD;
      satisfaction. After completing the assessments, the control group will be provided with the&#xD;
      Be a Mom program. The sample will be collected at the Maternity Daniel de Matos and Maternity&#xD;
      Bissaya Barreto (both maternities of Coimbra University Hospitals -CHUC, EPE) and online.&#xD;
      Data collection methods will include several self-administered questionnaires. Based on&#xD;
      research results the modifications will be identified and conducted to develop the final&#xD;
      version of the Be a Mom program, allowing for further efficacy studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will be a two-arm prevention trial, conducted in high-risk women (i.e., presenting&#xD;
      risk factors for PPD and/or early-onset postpartum depressive symptoms). The intervention&#xD;
      condition (the Be a Mom program) will be compared with a control condition (Treatment as&#xD;
      Usual). The sample will include women who delivered an healthy baby in the early postpartum&#xD;
      period (up to 3 months postpartum). Women will be enrolled both online and at the maternities&#xD;
      of Coimbra University Hospitals -CHUC, EPE. A minimum number of 150 women per condition will&#xD;
      be required (N=300). Accounting for the proportion of high-risk and low-risk women and the&#xD;
      50% of attrition rate over time, an anticipated sample of 1000 women will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A researcher (licensed psychologist) will conduct an interview with women who demonstrate&#xD;
      interest in the study, aiming to explain the study goals, the structure and arms of the&#xD;
      research and the researchers' and participants' roles. Women who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study will sign an informed consent form. All ethical requirements for research with humans&#xD;
      are guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After women's agreement to participate in the study, the researcher (licensed psychologist)&#xD;
      will screen women for the presence of risk factors for PPD and early-onset PPD symptoms&#xD;
      (using self-report questionnaires). In case of a negative screen, women's participation in&#xD;
      the study will end. In case of a positive screen, high-risk women will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (blocked randomization, with allocation concealment) to one of the conditions: the&#xD;
      intervention (Be a Mom program) or the control condition. The randomization will be conducted&#xD;
      by a different researcher who will be blind to the assessment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will last 11 months. The Be a Mom program will last 5 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants in both conditions will be invited via email to complete baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up (4-months and 12-months after childbirth) assessments.&#xD;
      Assessments will include self-report questionnaires to assess several indicators (e.g.,&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety symptoms, dyadic adjustment, mother-child bonding, and maternal&#xD;
      confidence), mechanisms that may be involved in the treatment response (e.g., psychological&#xD;
      flexibility, emotional regulation) and user's acceptability and satisfaction. The necessary&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be conducted, using the intention-to-treat principles.&#xD;
