      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the 30-day mortality outcome of the septic shock&#xD;
      patients who are treated with ultrasound-assisted fluid management using change of the&#xD;
      inferior vene cava (IVC) diameter during respiratory phases in the first 6 hours compared&#xD;
      with those treated with &quot;usual-care&quot; strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock (SS) is globally prevalent in with high mortality rate.The current focuses on&#xD;
      initial treatment of this condition emphasize on the early recognition, prompt administration&#xD;
      of antibiotic, and restoration of hemodynamic with aggressive fluid resuscitation and&#xD;
      vasopressor. Regarding the initial fluid therapy, administration of empirical crystalloid at&#xD;
      the dose of 30 ml/kg is recommended in the guideline. The ultrasound-assisted management of&#xD;
      shock patients has been introduced in the past decade and now is widely used. By using the&#xD;
      measurement of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter change during respiratory phases, physicians&#xD;
      can predict the fluid responsiveness in the shock patients and tailor the fluid therapy&#xD;
      during the resuscitation.Unfortunately, clinical outcome related to the use of this concept&#xD;
      in SS resuscitation has not been well studied. Inadequate resuscitation with fluid therapy is&#xD;
      related with higher mortality; however, fluid bolus or positive fluid balance that may result&#xD;
      from &quot;too aggressive&quot; fluid administration is also associated with increased mortality in SS&#xD;
      patients. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the 30-day mortality outcome of the&#xD;
      SS patients who were treated with ultrasound-assisted fluid management using change of the&#xD;
      IVC during respiratory phases in the first 6 hours compared with those who were treated with&#xD;
      &quot;usual-care&quot; strategy. The secondary outcomes were to compare the rate of the need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (MV) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) as well as the 6-hours&#xD;
      lactate clearance and the change in Sequential Organ Failure (SOFA) score in 72 hours.&#xD;

    <description>The change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score between the score at initial presentation and 72 hours after treatment, determined by SOFA score at presentation minus the SOFA score at 72 hours after treatment. The possible minimum and maximum value of the change in SOFA score are -24 and +24, respectively. The higher value means the more relative reduction in SOFA score at 72 hours and indicates a better clinical outcome.</description>

A previous study showed that IVCCI &gt; 40% were strongly associated with fluid responsiveness.

IVC Ultrasound-guided: IVC is identified in longitudinal section in the subcostal area of a patient using the curvilinear probe of standard ultrasound. The selected area of IVC diameter measurement is set at 2 centimeters distal to the confluence of hepatic vein by M-mode coupled by two-dimensional mode on frozen screen images using the Sonosite® X-porte.&#xD;

        <title>Change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score in 72 Hours After Treatment</title>
        <description>The change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score between the score at initial presentation and 72 hours after treatment, determined by SOFA score at presentation minus the SOFA score at 72 hours after treatment. The possible minimum and maximum value of the change in SOFA score are -24 and +24, respectively. The higher value means the more relative reduction in SOFA score at 72 hours and indicates a better clinical outcome.</description>

            <title>IVC Ultrasound-guided</title>
            <description>The treating physician will promptly assess the IVC diameter to obtain the collapsibility index (IVCCI) (or distensibility index, IVCDI) of an eligible patient. A previous study showed that IVCCI &gt; 40% were strongly associated with fluid responsiveness. Accordingly, the patient will be given 10 ml/kg of bolus of 0.9% normal saline solution (NSS) each time when the IVCCI &gt; 40% is discovered and serial measurements will be done after each intravenous bolus is achieved until the IVCCI &lt; 40 % during our protocol. Prompt empirical antibiotics will be given to the patients within one hour before the treatment allocation.&#xD;
IVC Ultrasound-guided: IVC is identified in longitudinal section in the subcostal area of a patient using the curvilinear probe of standard ultrasound. The selected area of IVC diameter measurement is set at 2 centimeters distal to the confluence of hepatic vein by M-mode coupled by two-dimensional mode on frozen screen images using the Sonosite® X-porte.&#xD;
Antibiotics: Prompt empirical antibiotics will be given to the patients within one hour before the treatment allocation.&#xD;
Vasopressor: The threshold to the need of a vasopressor is set at mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg if a patient's condition does not response to the fluid therapy.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was conducted with the specific study protocol at a single, tertiary-care hospital. Second, physicians should use cautious clinical judgment or different approaches in different types of patients.
