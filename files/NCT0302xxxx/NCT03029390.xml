  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre diabetes (PD) is a term that refers to alterations in glucose homeostasis, including&#xD;
      impaired fasting glucose (IFG), Imparied glucose tolerance (IGT) or both, involving a higher&#xD;
      risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of pharmacotherapy in the prevention of diabetes in adults with prediabetes has&#xD;
      been demonstrated, the first line of pharmacology treatment is metformin, on the other hand,&#xD;
      the traditional Chinese and Ayurverica medicine offer potential active substances for the&#xD;
      treatment of hyperglucemia like berberine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berberine is an extract with hypoglycemic effects in animal models as well as in clinical&#xD;
      trials in type 2 diabetes mellitus even compared to metformin, for this reason comparing it's&#xD;
      activity against metformin in prediabetes would provide impact information on a new&#xD;
      alternative treatment and compare with the standard pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study evaluate the effect of administration of berberine versus metaformine on&#xD;
      glycemic control, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in patients with pre diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that the administration of berberine versus metformin&#xD;
      modifies glycemic control, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in patients with&#xD;
      prediabetes.&#xD;

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 28 patients with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of prediabetes (IFG and IGT) in accordance with the American Diabetes Association with out&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be assigned randomly two groups of 14 patients, one of the groups will receive 850&#xD;
      mg of metformin twice at day (before breakfast and before dinner) and one pill of placebo&#xD;
      (before lunch) for 14 weeks. There will be a running period, starting with a dose of 500 mg&#xD;
      the first week, the second week increasing to 1000 mg and from the third to the fourteenth&#xD;
      week will be a dose of 1500 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other group will receive 500 mg of berberine three times at day (each one before the&#xD;
      mealtime) for14 weeks. There will be a running period, starting with a dose of 850 mg the&#xD;
      first week, the second week dose of 850 mg of metformin plus one placebo pill and from the&#xD;
      third week to the fourteenth week will be a dose of 1700 mg ( two 850 mg metformin pills)&#xD;
      plus one placebo pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be measured fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose levels and glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin, and will be calculated Area Under Curve of glucose and insulin, total insulin&#xD;
      secretion (Insolinogenic index), first-phase of insulin secretion (Strumvoll index) and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol it's already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed&#xD;
      consent it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,&#xD;
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentage for&#xD;
      qualitative variable. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2, will be used for&#xD;
      differences inter-group Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon Test for the within-groups&#xD;
      differences. It will be considered statistical significance p≤0.05.&#xD;
