      The main purpose of this study is to compare Echo-guided testing to the Hemodynamic-Echo Ramp&#xD;
      Tests to determine which method of testing provides better information for adjusting pump&#xD;
      speed and medical treatment for Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) patients. Better&#xD;
      adjustments may provide better quality of life, exercise tolerance and reduced unwanted&#xD;
      cardiac events over a 6-month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)patients undergo testing to determine the best&#xD;
      pumping speed for their Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) and to gather measurements that&#xD;
      help guide medical treatment. The testing uses echocardiography (&quot;echo&quot;, ultrasound images of&#xD;
      the heart) to create heart images and make measurements while gradually increasing the Left&#xD;
      Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) heart pump speed. Each time the pump speed is increased,&#xD;
      images and measurements are taken. This is called a ramp test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ramp testing may also be performed during a right heart catheterization procedure. In a&#xD;
      catheterization procedure, a doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein or&#xD;
      artery in the upper leg (groin), arm or neck and guides it to the heart using X-ray imaging.&#xD;
      Doctors normally perform this procedure to measure the pressure and blood flow in the heart&#xD;
      (otherwise called hemodynamic measurements). If the ramp testing is performed during this&#xD;
      procedure, then the doctors have additional measurements to consider before choosing a final&#xD;
      speed for the Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) pump and appropriate medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the procedures in this study are considered standard of care. The research part is&#xD;
      randomly assigning the subject to one of the two methods of testing in this study. Subjects&#xD;
      have a 50/50 chance of being in either testing group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit (1 - 3 months after Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implant)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to sign this consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam with an assessment of heart failure symptoms, and medical history will be&#xD;
           recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests (about 1 tablespoon will be drawn)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two testing groups. If there is time,&#xD;
           the ramp test can be performed at this visit, but usually it will be scheduled to occur&#xD;
           a different day in about 1 to 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 Minute Walk Test. This test measures how far the subject can walk in 6 minutes. If&#xD;
           needed, this can be completed the day of the ramp test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their current quality of life.&#xD;
           This will take about 10 minutes. If needed, this can be completed the day of the ramp&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramp Testing Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Echo Guided Testing - This testing uses echocardiography to create images of the heart&#xD;
           and make measurements while gradually increasing the heart pump speed. The final pump&#xD;
           speed and medical treatment are determined using the echo measurements. This will take&#xD;
           about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hemodynamic-Echo Ramp Testing - This testing is performed during a right heart&#xD;
           catheterization procedure which provides hemodynamic measurements (pressure and blood&#xD;
           flow) in addition to the echocardiography measurements. With this method, more echo&#xD;
           images and measurements are taken. The final pump speed and medical treatment&#xD;
           adjustments are made using the hemodynamic measurements as well as the information from&#xD;
           the echo. This test will take about 1 hour and 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Months after Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam with an assessment of heart failure symptoms, and medical history will be&#xD;
           recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests (about 1 tablespoon will be drawn)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 Minute Walk Test. This test measures how far the subject can walk in 6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their current quality of life.&#xD;
           This will take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will undergo a Hemodynamic-Echo Ramp Test at 6 months after the baseline&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
