      The overall objective of the present study is to examine the effects of umbilical cord&#xD;
      milking at birth in preterm infants to prevent and decrease anemia using a multi-center&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled trial comparing immediate cord clamping (standard at&#xD;
      present) with umbilical cord milking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a significant problem for pre-term infants and a major risk factor for preterm&#xD;
      babies mortality and morbidity in neonatal intensive care unit(NICU). the majority of&#xD;
      pre-term babies will require one or more blood transfusions during in NICU. Blood transfusion&#xD;
      is a safe procedure but like all therapeutic interventions has risks associated with it and&#xD;
      effort is made to reduce the number of transfusions that infants require during their stay on&#xD;
      the neonatal unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed cord clamping has a beneficial effect on prevention of anemia in later infancy&#xD;
      because of increased iron stores at birth. However there are controversies in incorporating&#xD;
      delayed cord clamping practice in the management of third stage of labour globally.&#xD;
      Concerning about the need for urgent resuscitation and temperature management, attendants&#xD;
      encouraged to clamp the umbilical cord immediately so that post-natal resuscitation and care&#xD;
      can start as soon as possible.However,umbilical cord milking allows for swift intervention&#xD;
      and resuscitation and attention to thermal care and should take less than 10 seconds to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this study is to investigate the effects of umbilical cord milking on&#xD;
      preventing and decreasing anemia in very pre-term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (Hct) and serum iron levels at birth, at 1 week,at 2 weeks of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin,hematocrit levels at 6 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anemia at 1 week of life and 6 months follow-up, defined as hemoglobin levels below the&#xD;
           respective cutoffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of blood transfusions until 3 months corrected gestational age (CGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  short term clinical profile of neonates like jaundice, polycythemia etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preterm infant complications such as lung function as assessed by oxygen dependency at&#xD;
           36 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA), and cardiovascular function as assessed by the&#xD;
           need for volume expansion, inotropes, or clinically suspected patent ductus&#xD;
           arteriosus(PDA )requiring intervention prior to discharge home,incidence of&#xD;
           intraventricular hemorrhage and late-onset sepsis,etc.&#xD;
