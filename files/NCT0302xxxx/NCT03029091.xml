    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of Losartan potassium in&#xD;
      subjects with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) including those with a connective tissue&#xD;
      disorder (CTD) and those without a CTD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effects (good and bad) of&#xD;
      Losartan potassium on participants with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). If a participant has&#xD;
      a connective tissue disorder (CTD) the researchers want to see what effects (good or bad)&#xD;
      Losartan has on EoE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EoE is an inflammatory disease of the esophagus that is typically triggered by exposure to&#xD;
      food. Connective tissue disorders (CTDs) are disorders that affect the connective tissues in&#xD;
      the body such as tendons and ligaments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protein called transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is associated with both EoE and CTD.&#xD;
      Losartan may decrease the amount of TGF-beta and therefore help EoE and CTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Losartan is a drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for use in adults and children over 6 years of age who have high blood pressure. This&#xD;
      medication has not been studied in people with EoE.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Peak Eosinophil Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Peak esophageal eosinophil counts were obtained at baseline and 16 weeks. Change in peak eosinophil count is defined as peak count at 16 weeks minus peak count at baseline. A reduction (negative change) in peak count indicates improvement. Peak count is defined as the highest count between the distal and proximal esophageal eosinophil counts.</description>

    <measure>Percent of Participants in Complete and Partial Histologic Remission at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of participants in complete and partial histologic remission. Complete remission is defined as esophageal peak eosinophil count ≤ 1 eosinophils per high powered field (eos/hpf). Partial remission is defined as esophageal peak eosinophil count of 2 - 14 eos/hpf.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Histology Scoring System</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The histology scoring system (HSS) measures the severity (grade) and extent (stage) of eight histologic abnormalities in the esophagus including eosinophilic inflammation, eosinophilic abscess, eosinophilic surface layering, surface epithelial alteration, dilated intercellular spaces, basal zone hyperplasia, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, and lamina propria fibrosis. Total score is the sum of grade and stage scores from the esophageal biopsy (distal, mid, or proximal) with the highest score (worst abnormalities) divided by the maximum possible score for the biopsy. Total scores range from 0 - 2 with higher scores indicating worse abnormalities. Histology scores were obtained at baseline and 16 weeks. Change in total histology scoring system (HSS) is defined as total HSS score at 16 weeks minus total HSS score at baseline. A reduction (negative change) in score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Endoscopic Reference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The endoscopic reference score (EREFS) utilizes standardized criteria for the presence and degree of 5 major endoscopic features (edema, fixed rings, exudates, furrows, strictures). Total score is the sum of the five feature scores from the distal and proximal esophagus. Total scores range from 0 - 18 with higher scores indicating worse features. Endoscopic features were assessed at baseline and 16 weeks. Change in total endoscopic reference score is defined as total score at 16 weeks minus total score at baseline. A reduction (negative change) in score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PEESS V2.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Score (PEESS) V2.0 questionnaire captures EoE-specific symptoms (dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, nausea/vomiting, and pain) as reported by their parents (for children 2-18 years of age). The range for PEESS v2.0 scores is 0 to 100, with a higher score being indicative of more frequent and/or severe symptoms. Scores were obtained at baseline and 16 weeks. Change in score is defined as total score at 16 weeks minus total score at baseline as completed by parent proxy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PedsQL EoE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL EoE) measures symptoms and problems related to treatment, worry, communication, food/eating, and feelings. The range for PedsQL 3.0 EoE scores is 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life. Scores were obtained at baseline and 16 weeks. Change in score is defined as the PedsQL EoE total score at 16 weeks minus total score at baseline as reported by parent proxy.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Histology Scoring System</title>
        <description>The histology scoring system (HSS) measures the severity (grade) and extent (stage) of eight histologic abnormalities in the esophagus including eosinophilic inflammation, eosinophilic abscess, eosinophilic surface layering, surface epithelial alteration, dilated intercellular spaces, basal zone hyperplasia, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, and lamina propria fibrosis. Total score is the sum of grade and stage scores from the esophageal biopsy (distal, mid, or proximal) with the highest score (worst abnormalities) divided by the maximum possible score for the biopsy. Total scores range from 0 - 2 with higher scores indicating worse abnormalities. Histology scores were obtained at baseline and 16 weeks. Change in total histology scoring system (HSS) is defined as total HSS score at 16 weeks minus total HSS score at baseline. A reduction (negative change) in score indicates improvement.</description>

Endoscopic features were assessed at baseline and 16 weeks. Change in total endoscopic reference score is defined as total score at 16 weeks minus total score at baseline.
