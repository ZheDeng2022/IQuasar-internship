    <textblock>
      Conventional chemotherapeutic regimens designed for aggressive B-cell lymphomas are generally&#xD;
      less effective when applied to mature T-cell or NK-cell lymphomas. The treatment outcome for&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory disease is especially poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory mature T-cell or&#xD;
      NK-cell lymphomas. Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200mg i.v. once every 3 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline radiological assessment by positron emission tomography / computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) scan is obtained before commencement of treatment. Tumor response and progression&#xD;
      are evaluated by physical examination, standard laboratory tests, and PET/CT scan according&#xD;
      to standard criteria. Standard response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphomas are used for&#xD;
      assessment . PET/CT scan will be done at week 12, week 24, week 36 and every 18 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

      Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the&#xD;
      IgG4/kappa isotype against PD-1, designed to directly block its interaction with PD-L1 and&#xD;
      PD-L2. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for the&#xD;
      treatment of melanoma that is unresectable or metastatic, or has progressed following&#xD;
      ipilumumab and, (if BRAF V600 mutation positive), a BRAF inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature T-cell and nature killer (NK)-cell lymphomas are lymphoid malignancies that are&#xD;
      derived from T-cell and NK-cell lineages. They are less prevalent than B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
      Interestingly, there are distinct geographic differences in their distribution and&#xD;
      prevalence. Nodal lymphomas including peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified&#xD;
      (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)&#xD;
      and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) predominate in Western populations, accounting for&#xD;
      about 10% of all lymphomas. In Asian countries, however, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal&#xD;
      type, is much more prevalent, constituting 10% of all lymphomas; with AITL, ALCL and PTCL-NOS&#xD;
      accounting for another 10%. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection is found in all cases of&#xD;
      extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas, the majority of AITL, and a significant proportion of&#xD;
      PTCL-NOS, implying that it plays an important pathogenetic role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional chemotherapeutic regimens designed for aggressive B-cell lymphomas are generally&#xD;
      less effective when applied to mature T-cell or NK-cell lymphomas. The treatment outcome for&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory disease is especially poor. In a recent retrospective analysis, the&#xD;
      median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with disease&#xD;
      relapse were found to be only 5.5 and 3.1 months respectively. The efficacy of newly approved&#xD;
      agents such as pralatrexate and romidepsin for relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphomas is&#xD;
      modest, with an average overall response rate (ORR) of around 20-30% only. Novel therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches are therefore needed for this group of patients with dismal prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-1 blockade using anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has been shown to be highly effective for&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Furthermore, clinical response has also been&#xD;
      seen in relapsed T-cell lymphomas after treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody in phase I studies.&#xD;
      In addition, previous reports have shown that EBV infection may enhance the expression of&#xD;
      PD-L1 in tumour cells, and that some EBV-associated lymphomas such as NK/T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      express high level of PD-L1, suggesting that EBV-associated mature T-cell and NK-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas may be more susceptible to PD-1 blockade.&#xD;
