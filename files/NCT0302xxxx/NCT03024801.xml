      To analyze the effectiveness of intra-articular injection of autologous PRP on knee cartilage&#xD;
      repair and evaluating functional recovery of the knee joint in knee cartilage injury&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Recent studies have shown that platelets, which contain a large number of cytokines and&#xD;
      growth factors, can be beneficial in inflammatory response and postoperative bleeding,&#xD;
      infection, bone formation, injury, muscle strain, and soft tissue healing. Platelets release&#xD;
      a plethora of biologically active proteins to aggregate macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (MSCs) and osteoblasts, thereby promoting degradation and clearing necrotic tissue, thus&#xD;
      further activating wound healing. In fact, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is now used clinically&#xD;
      to promote cartilage repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By retrieving the Web of Science, a study by Havva et al. reported the clinical use of&#xD;
      autologous PRP in 82 patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis with good outcomes. However,&#xD;
      the clinical applications of this treatment have not been adequately investigated in&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials. Given this, additional studies on the exact efficacy of this&#xD;
      treatment are indispensible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three similar trial protocols to the current trial include 'Treatment of Osteoarthritis by&#xD;
      Intra-articular Injection of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells With Platelet Rich Plasma&#xD;
      (NCT02365142)', 'PRP vs HA Intra-articular Knee Injections for Cartilage Defects&#xD;
      (NCT02012530)', and 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhanced With PRP Versus PRP In OA Knee&#xD;
      (MSCPRPOAK) (NCT01985633)'. In these trial protocols, knee injury extent and treatment&#xD;
      success were assessed by Osteoarthritis Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score as outcome measures.&#xD;
      However, there are several differences in the inclusion criteria and randomization of these&#xD;
      trials in comparison with the current trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since autologous PRP predominantly functions to relieve pain and inhibit inflammatory&#xD;
      responses, clinical injection of autologous PRP for cartilage injury can stimulate&#xD;
      chondrocyte growth and matrix metabolism. Existing evidence has shown that autologous PRP can&#xD;
      increase type II collagen production and reduce apoptosis in chondrocytes when combined with&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow-MSCs. Furthermore, PRP can improve cartilage degeneration and inhibit&#xD;
      the development of osteoarthritis (OA) when combined with hydrogel microspheres. Accordingly,&#xD;
      the clinical use of autologous PRP can alleviate the symptoms of OA, promote recovery of&#xD;
      motor function, and ultimately improve patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the clinical use of low-dose autologous PRP has been reported to alleviate pain at&#xD;
      the injury site in the treatment of articular cartilage injury, and achieve cartilage repair&#xD;
      and proliferation by releasing growth factors that promote extracellular matrix synthesis and&#xD;
      vascular reconstruction. However, the clinical applications of autologous PRP have not been&#xD;
      systemically reported in randomized controlled clinical trials, leading to a lack of&#xD;
      objective evidence on its effectiveness.&#xD;
