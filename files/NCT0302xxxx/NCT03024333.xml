      This study is aimed to establish and identify the normal pattern of swallowing sounds and&#xD;
      analyze swallowing sounds of different textured foods and viscous liquids in healthy subjects&#xD;
      to provide clinical evidence to update dysphagia patients' food.&#xD;

      Upon accepted and consented, the investigators will measure the neck circumference, height&#xD;
      and weight of all participants. Then, a sound detection device (iASUS NT3-R Throat Mic&#xD;
      Headset, CA, USA) will be attached on the participant's neck. This non-invasive and&#xD;
      lightweight (2.3oz) device will record sound vibration signals using a pair of 20mm-diameter&#xD;
      sound sensors. The device will record three times of swallowing sounds at three placements&#xD;
      (Apleft, Apright, B) separately with participants' head-trunk in neutral position and also&#xD;
      record sounds in the neck such as breathing sound, throat clearing and cough sounds. (Apleft,&#xD;
      Apright) is the intersection of lateral border of trapezius muscle and intermediate line&#xD;
      between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae in the posterior neck region. B is at the&#xD;
      lateral cricoid cartilage in the anterolateral neck. Participants will use 5ml spoon to&#xD;
      intake foods or liquids at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects will conduct the research in the Student Living Center Room 1036/1041 at&#xD;
      UNMC. Healthy subjects will be required to swallow different consistency liquids and foods&#xD;
      with their head-trunk in neutral position. Participants will also perform one of the&#xD;
      following randomly after swallowing foods or liquids: throat clearing after coughing or cough&#xD;
      after throat clearing. Before subjects start swallowing test, subjects can try several times&#xD;
      if subjects want.There will be 2 sections to complete the whole process. Each section will&#xD;
      take 2 hours.The device will record three times of swallowing sounds of each foods and&#xD;
      liquids at three placements (Apleft, Apright, B) separately with participants' head-trunk in&#xD;
      neutral position.The foods and liquids preparation are also listed at the end of this&#xD;
      section.The PI and faculty advisor of the research team will be present during recording&#xD;
      swallowing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sound detection device will record sounds which occur in the neck such as swallowing&#xD;
      sounds, breathing sound, talking sounds, throat clearing and cough sounds when dysphagia&#xD;
      patients intake foods and drinks. The conversation will also be recorded using a Sony&#xD;
      recorder (ICD-SX713) in each data collection session.The voice recording will not be&#xD;
      analyzed, which only provides the additional information about which foods or liquids&#xD;
      subjects swallow or at which placement sensor records swallowing sounds. Recordings will be&#xD;
      saved as digital sound wave files and segmented into individual anonymized clips for data&#xD;
      analysis. The digital sound wave files will be achieved in the secured server at UNMC until&#xD;
      completion of the data analysis, and then removed from the server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim1: Investigators will record the swallowing sound vibrations at the anterior and posterior&#xD;
      neck in healthy subjects, and analyze the duration, amplitude, mean frequency and power&#xD;
      spectrum of swallowing sounds generated by various viscous foods and liquids through the&#xD;
      pharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim2: Investigators will compare the differences in sound duration, mean frequency and power&#xD;
      spectrum of swallowing sounds between throat clearing and coughing in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Foods and Liquids Prepared for Healthy Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foods and liquids respectively are divided into 5 levels in the International Dysphagia Diet&#xD;
      Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) and level 3, 4 are two overlapping levels in foods and&#xD;
      drinks Level 0 (Thin liquid) All liquid can flow through syringe Level 1 (Slightly thick&#xD;
      liquid) There is between 1 and 4 ml remaining Level 2 (Mildly thick liquid) There is between&#xD;
      4 and 8 ml remaining Level 3 (Moderately thick liquid/ Liquidize) There is more than 8 ml&#xD;
      remaining, but some liquid still flows through Level 4 (Extremely thick liquid/ Pureed) If no&#xD;
      liquid flows at all Level 5 (Minced &amp; Moist) Pressed with a fork the particles should easily&#xD;
      be separated between and come through the prongs of a fork Level 6 (Soft) Sample squashes and&#xD;
      does not return to its original shape when pressure is released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 7 (Regular) No texture restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid Samples Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to drink details provided in the IDDSI, investigators will choose a food&#xD;
      polysaccharide thickener xanthan gum (UPC784672647311, Anthony's, Gluten-Free, USA) to&#xD;
      prepare different viscous solutions. Firstly, dispersing xanthan gum in de-ionized water at&#xD;
      185 F for 10 min then carrying out solution in a 1.5 liter plastic beaker at 2000 rpm with a&#xD;
      four-blade propeller (60 mm in diameter) using a 6-Speed blender (XJ-14402C, Mainstays,&#xD;
      Walmart Inc., Bentonville, AR 72716) to ensure no lumping. After that, cool the solution to&#xD;
      room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow testing: Before flow testing, we will use 10ml water flows completely through the&#xD;
      syringe (A 10 ml slip tip syringe international standards (ISO 7886-1)) within 10 seconds to&#xD;
      check whether the nozzle is clear and free from any plastic residue or manufacturing defects&#xD;
      that vary occasionally occur. After checking, firstly, get a stopwatch and 2 of 10ml slip-tip&#xD;
      syringes. Secondly, remove the plunge from one of the syringes (Syringe A). Thirdly, cover&#xD;
      the nozzle of the syringe A with finger which makes a seal. Then using another syringe B to&#xD;
      add the syringe A up to the 10 ml line with fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to gravity flowing test, we select the following drinks. Level 0 is de-ionized&#xD;
      water Level 1 is xanthan gum: de-ionized water = 1oz: 5000ml Level 2 is xanthan gum:&#xD;
      de-ionized water = 1oz: 4000ml Level 3 is xanthan gum: de-ionized water = 1oz: 3000ml Level 4&#xD;
      is xanthan gum: de-ionized water = 1oz: 1000ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Samples Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fork Testing: The slots/gaps between prongs of a standard metal fork are typically in 4 mm.&#xD;
      Pressure applied to the food sample is quantified by assessment of the pressure needed to&#xD;
      make the thumb nail blanch noticeably to white color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to food details provided in IDDSI, we will use IDDSI Flow Test (Syringe Test), Fork&#xD;
      (The slots/gaps between the tines/prongs of a standard metal fork typically measure 4 mm)&#xD;
      Drip Test and Fork Pressure Test selects food as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 5 (Minced &amp; Moist) cereal: de-ionized water = 2:1 Dispersing xanthan gum in de-ionized&#xD;
      water at 185 F for 10 min then carrying out solution in a 1.5-liter plastic beaker at 2000&#xD;
      rpm with a four-blade propeller (60 mm in diameter) using a 6-Speed blender to ensure cereal&#xD;
      is fully moist &amp; minced and less than 1.5cm*1.5cm. After that, cool the solution to room&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 6 (Soft) Banana Level 7 (Regular) White bread&#xD;
