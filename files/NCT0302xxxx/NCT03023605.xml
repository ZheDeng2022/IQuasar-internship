    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical impact of an educational intervention on&#xD;
      adherence to Clinical Practice Guidelines in an Emergency Department (ED), by using a&#xD;
      standardized training, for improving diagnostic sensibility and reducing unnecessary scans,&#xD;
      adverse effects and stays in the ED.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau Emergency Department (ED) implemented a training&#xD;
      program between May and June 2015 to improve compliance and adherence to recommended clinical&#xD;
      practice and optimize the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected Pulmonary&#xD;
      Embolism (PE). The training program was standardized, systematic and continuous, with&#xD;
      subsequent reinforcement to ensure implementation. This paper aims to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      impact of the training intervention. The establishment of training measures to improve&#xD;
      adherence to guidelines implies clinical practice improvement and benefits patients and&#xD;
      health system. Moreover, it is a simple and inexpensive intervention, and can be easily&#xD;
      reproduced in other ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients (&lt;18 y) with suspected pulmonary embolism attended at Emergency Department&#xD;
      will be included. Retrospective information from two different periods (before and after the&#xD;
      training intervention) will be collected. First period: 1/1/2012 - 31/12/2012 and second&#xD;
      Period: 01.06.2015 - 30/11/2015, pre and post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze adherence to guidelines for the evaluation of suspected PE in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the clinical impact of training intervention (change in adherence to&#xD;
           guidelines after training measures among staff in Emergency Department)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implementation and consolidation of a systematic, standardized, continuous training&#xD;
           intervention for improving processes and results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.- Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze PE cases (presentation, clinical features, treatment, clinical evolution)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. analyze the clinical differences in three subgroups of patients with PE: young patients&#xD;
           (&lt;50 years), elderly patients (&lt;65 years) and cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze the value of D-dimmer corrected by age in diagnostic algorithms&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analyze the results of a new algorithm (EPC + Dimmer corrected age) in the elderly&#xD;
           population group (&lt;65 years).&#xD;
