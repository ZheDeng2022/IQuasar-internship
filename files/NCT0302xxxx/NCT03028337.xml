  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether delivering spine radiosurgery in&#xD;
      a single large dose is better than delivering spine radiosurgery over 3 smaller doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn about the effects of a single dose on participant's symptoms,&#xD;
      pain, and quality-of-life.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This&#xD;
      is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is in Group 1, they will receive spine radiosurgery in a single large&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is in Group 2, they will receive spine radiosurgery over 3 smaller doses,&#xD;
           which is standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking part in the study as the doctor thinks it is in their best&#xD;
      interest. Participant will no longer be able to take part if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on the study will be over after participant's last follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiosurgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have spine radiosurgery in either 1 or 3 treatments as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will sign a separate consent for the surgery that explains the procedure and the&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, at Months 3,6,9,12,18, and 24 and then every 6 months after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam (tests to check the&#xD;
           functioning of their nerves, including tests of their strength and sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will complete the same questionnaires they completed at the beginning of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Delivering spine radiosurgery in a single large dose rather&#xD;
      than over three smaller doses is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. All patients must have radiographic evidence of progression at a spinal site&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. All patients must sign informed consent verifying that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the rules and policies of MD&#xD;
             Anderson Cancer Center. The only acceptable consent is the one approved by MD Anderson&#xD;
             IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients undergoing prior surgery or laser interstitial thermotherapy are allowed&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients unable to lie flat comfortably for 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy status will be obtained at time of consent as is routine for all radiation&#xD;
             patients. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation has the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a histology of lymphoma and myeloma histologies&#xD;
