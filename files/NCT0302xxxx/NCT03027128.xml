      the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 trial in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in two parts: part 1 will involve dose escalation using a 3 + 3&#xD;
      design, and part 2 will involve the expansion of the MTD or HTD to further evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of haNK. In part 1, 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled starting at dose&#xD;
      cohort 1, and subjects will be assessed for DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 2 x 10^9 cells per infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 4 x 10^9 cells per infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If needed, subjects will be enrolled into a dose de-escalation cohort (cohort -1): 1 x&#xD;
           10^9 cells per infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part 2, dose expansion will occur when the MTD or HTD has been determined. An additional 4&#xD;
      subjects may be enrolled in part 2, for a total of up to 10 subjects at the MTD or HTD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant&#xD;
             IRB or IEC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically confirmed, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
             malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have at least 1 measurable lesion and/or non-measurable disease evaluable according to&#xD;
             RECIST Version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have a recent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsy specimen&#xD;
             following the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment. If an historic&#xD;
             specimen is not available, the subject must be willing to undergo a biopsy during the&#xD;
             screening period, if considered safe by the Investigator. If safety concerns preclude&#xD;
             collection of a biopsy during the screening period, a tumor biopsy specimen collected&#xD;
             prior to the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be willing to provide pre- and post-infusion blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have received treatment with at least 1 prior line of therapy in the metastatic&#xD;
             setting or not be a candidate for therapy of proven efficacy for their disease. Prior&#xD;
             immune therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Resolution of all toxic side effects of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgical&#xD;
             procedures to CTCAE grade ≤ 1, with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required&#xD;
             by this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential are&#xD;

             surgical sterilization. Female subjects of child-bearing potential and non-sterile&#xD;
             male subjects must agree to use effective contraception for at least 60 days (female)&#xD;
             and 120 days (male) after the last dose of haNK. Effective contraception includes&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods&#xD;
             (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and&#xD;

             resulting from previous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the&#xD;
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for&#xD;
             treatment-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's&#xD;
             disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase levels &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver&#xD;
