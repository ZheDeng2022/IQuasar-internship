  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to quantify salivary oxidative stress biomarkers in patients&#xD;
      with temporomandibular disorders and to quantify recently isolated endogenous peptide&#xD;
      opiorphin in saliva of these patients. As chronic exposure to stress may cause hyperalgesia&#xD;
      as a result of the stress response in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, aim is to test&#xD;
      this as an underlying mechanism by correlating opiorphin and oxidative stress markers to&#xD;
      salivary cortisol levels. The aim is to assess the association of oxidative stress salivary&#xD;
      biomarkers with muscle and joint pain and to measure opiorphin, a potential biomarker of&#xD;
      different pathological states.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are most common chronic orofacial pain conditions of&#xD;
      non-dental origin, with prevalence in the general population of 3.6% to 7%. Despite signs and&#xD;
      symptoms being well described in the literature, there is still an absence of underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms. Evidence based strategies for diagnosis and management of&#xD;
      temporomandibular pain still aren't available. Psychological and mechanical stress factors&#xD;
      could contribute to oxidative stress (OS) and lead to TMD. Therefore, identification of&#xD;
      oxidative stress biomarkers would objectively indicate implication of OS in TMD pain onset&#xD;
      mechanisms, and provide a basis for early detection, and a potential target for therapeutic&#xD;
      agents to prevent progression to more severe dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim is to quantify salivary OS markers and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as well as&#xD;
      recently isolated endogenous peptide opiorphin (OP) (2006 Inst. Pasteur), in TMD patients and&#xD;
      compare them to controls. As chronic exposure to stress may cause hyperalgesia as a result of&#xD;
      the stress response in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, aim is to test this as&#xD;
      an underlying mechanism by correlating OP and OS markers to salivary cortisol (SC) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: OS has a role in TMD onset and maintenance, thus salivary markers of OS will&#xD;
      increase and/or TAC will decrease; OP influences orofacial pain syndromes, such as TMD, and&#xD;
      its salivary level will differ between TMD patients and controls. If decreased OP levels in&#xD;
      TMD patients were encountered, we hypothesize that OP downregulation contributes to TMD onset&#xD;
      as its analgesic effect is absent. Conversely, increased OP levels would suggest that OP is&#xD;
      upregulated merely as a reaction to painful stimuli. Disbalanced SC levels in TMD patients&#xD;
      would corroborate involvement of HPA axis in TMD mechanism, which is known to affect the&#xD;
      intensity of OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva of 50 TMD patients (diagnosed by validated diagnostic criteria and MRI) and 50&#xD;
      controls will be collected. OS markers (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde, etc.) will&#xD;
      be assessed by ELISA with spectrophotometric detection and by spectrophotometric reagent&#xD;
      kits. OP levels will be measured by HPLC-MS/MS method, originally developed and validated by&#xD;
      team members. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ECLIA will be used for measuring SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and stress will be subjectively assessed using questionnaires: all subjects will fill in&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS-10); in TMD patients the worst experienced pain will be&#xD;
      recorded using Visual Analogue Scale at the initial and at subsequent visits, as well as&#xD;
      Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Patient Health Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PHQ), Jaw function limitation scale (JFLS), Oral Behaviours Checklist and Oral Health Impact&#xD;
      Profile (OHIP)-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMD patients will be randomized in 2 treatment groups (1: stabilization splint + placebo&#xD;
      pills; 2: placebo splint + 1g of vitamin C daily). Measurements will be repeated after 3 and&#xD;
      6 months of treatment. Monitoring of OP, OS markers and SC during that period will, depending&#xD;
      on observed changes in TMD symptoms, further elucidate underlying proposed mechanism by&#xD;
      performing multivariate analyses including treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This translational research aims to make basic science findings useful for clinical&#xD;
      applications. Findings of higher concentrations of OS biomarkers would, besides their&#xD;
      significance as &quot;a piece of puzzle&quot; of TMD mechanism, could also be important in&#xD;
      establishment of TMD diagnosis and as prospective therapeutic targets. Salivary opiorphin,&#xD;
      due to its proven analgesic effect might additionally serve as a possible drug for orofacial&#xD;
      pain syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel approach to understanding neuroendocrine mechanisms in TMD and their links to OS, as&#xD;
      well and use of saliva as non-invasively available diagnostic biofluid represent significant&#xD;
      scientific advances.&#xD;

    <description>Oxidative stress markers will be measured using spectrophotometric methods.

The change of the single marker (opiorphin) concentration between the two time points is a measure of clinical efficacy of applied treatment modality.&#xD;
In control group (healthy patients) measurement of oxidative stress markers and opiorphin will be performed only at first appointment in order to compare them with TMD patients baseline levels.</description>
