    <textblock>
      1. This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical&#xD;
           trial on type 2 diabetic non-proliferative retinopathy to evaluate the therapeutic&#xD;
           effect of tang wang prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Through the calculation of sample size, 384 participants with type 2 diabetic&#xD;
           non-proliferative retinopathy will be recruited for the study, all participants were&#xD;
           randomly divided into 2 groups, and both of groups would be performed on a basic&#xD;
           treatment (including diabetes education, diabetes diet, rational control of blood&#xD;
           glucose (oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin injections to keep all participants keep&#xD;
           blood glucose stable in the study. If fasting blood glucose fluctuates more than 20%,&#xD;
           need to find and remove the factors as soon as possible, and adjust the dose and monitor&#xD;
           change of blood glucose, make it smooth in 4 weeks. Adjusted dose of the drug needs to&#xD;
           be detailed records in the combined medication table), and oral calcium dobesilate&#xD;
           treatment), study group take tang wang prescription, take one bag each time and twice on&#xD;
           day, control group take the same dose of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study will last for 48 weeks. Once every four weeks follow-up, color fundus&#xD;
           photography, fundus fluorescein angiography, and coherent optical tomography were&#xD;
           performed every six months; ETDRS international visual acuity test was performed every&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Curative effect evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Main evaluation criteria: the changes of degree of retinal microvascular lesions&#xD;
                before and after treatment, according to the change of degree of retinal&#xD;
                microvascular lesions (no, mild non proliferative phase, moderate non proliferative&#xD;
                phase, severe non proliferative phase, proliferative phase), divided into&#xD;
                aggravated, unchanged, reduce three conditions. Aggravated was defined as the&#xD;
                degree of retinal microvascular lesions severity more than grade 1 after treatment;&#xD;
                unchanged was defined as the degree of retinal microvascular lesions before and&#xD;
                after treatment did not change; reduce was defined as the degree of retinal&#xD;
                microvascular lesions reduced more than 1 grade after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Change of the number of micro hemangioma of diabetic retinopathy before and&#xD;
                     after treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Change of the number of microvascular bleeding of diabetic retinopathy before&#xD;
                     and after treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Change of the number of microvascular leakage of diabetic retinopathy before&#xD;
                     and after treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Degree of change of macular edema of diabetic retinopathy before and after&#xD;
                     treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Change of Vision before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diagnostic and monitoring indicators：blood pressure, fasting blood glucose test (every&#xD;
           one month); glycated hemoglobin, blood lipids (every three months); Routine eye&#xD;
           examination and fundus examination, including intraocular pressure, anterior segment,&#xD;
           lens, vitreous body, and lens, vitreous need describe the conditions of opacity (every&#xD;
           six months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The provisions of the combined therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All Chinese herbal medicines with the same efficacy as the study drug (including&#xD;
                Chinese herbal medicines with similar therapeutic and similar efficacy in&#xD;
                Instructions) were banned during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All combined therapy and Combined medication(treatment measure or treatment&#xD;
                medicine of other diseases) should be recorded in the combined medication table.&#xD;
