      Psoriasis vulgaris is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that results in scaly red&#xD;
      itchy plaques. In addition to affecting the skin, psoriasis can also cause disease in the&#xD;
      finger and toe nails. The most characteristic nail findings associated with nail psoriasis&#xD;
      are nail pitting, onycholysis with a rim of erythema, and oil spots. Because nail psoriasis&#xD;
      causes a substantial disease burden for patients, it is critical that safe and effective&#xD;
      treatments are found for this specific type of psoriasis. Unfortunately, nail psoriasis is&#xD;
      often difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apremilast is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) that&#xD;
      is FDA approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast has shown&#xD;
      promising results for treating psoriatic arthritis and nail disease; however more data is&#xD;
      needed regarding its effect on nail psoriasis (Kavanaugh, et al). We hypothesize that&#xD;
      apremilast will prove to be highly effective in treating nail psoriasis. We propose to&#xD;
      conduct an open label clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      apremilast in treating nail psoriasis, where we will follow the package insert guidelines for&#xD;
      treating patients with apremilast.&#xD;

      Psoriasis vulgaris is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that results in scaly red&#xD;
      itchy plaques. In addition to affecting the skin, psoriasis can also cause disease in the&#xD;
      finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis is a chronic disease and can present with the following&#xD;
      clinical findings: splinter hemorrhage, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, nail pitting,&#xD;
      nail plate crumbling, hyperkeratosis, and/or nail plate separation from the nail bed. The&#xD;
      most characteristic nail findings associated with nail psoriasis are nail pitting,&#xD;
      onycholysis with a rim of erythema, and oil spots. Special interest will be paid to&#xD;
      identifying these particular nail findings in patients, however all potential nail psoriasis&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed in patients in this study. Due to the highly visible nature of&#xD;
      disease in the fingernails, nail psoriasis often results in a substantial deleterious effect&#xD;
      on a patient's quality of life. Patients also can have significant pain and disability due to&#xD;
      nail psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis patients who have nail involvement are known to have more severe psoriasis disease&#xD;
      and diminished quality of life when compared to psoriasis patients without nail disease.&#xD;
      Patients with nail psoriasis often also have psoriatic arthritis, and untreated psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis is known to lead to joint destruction with potentially severe morbidity. Nail&#xD;
      psoriasis has a reported incidence of 80 to 90% (Jiaravuthiasan, et al). Because nail&#xD;
      psoriasis causes a substantial disease burden for patients, it is critical that safe and&#xD;
      effective treatments are found for this specific type of psoriasis. Unfortunately, nail&#xD;
      psoriasis is often difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apremilast is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) that&#xD;
      is FDA approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. PDE4 is one of the&#xD;
      main phosphodiesterases expressed in immune cells, and its inhibition by apremilast is&#xD;
      thought to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate and thereby decrease the inflammatory&#xD;
      response. Specifically, apremilast is believed to down regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      including TNF-Î±, (Tumor necrosis Factor) IL-23 (Interleukin), IL-17, and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apremilast has shown promising results for treating psoriatic arthritis and nail disease;&#xD;
      however more data is needed regarding its effect on nail psoriasis (Kavanaugh, et al). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that apremilast will prove to be highly effective in treating nail psoriasis. We&#xD;
      propose to conduct an open label clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      of apremilast in treating nail psoriasis, where we will follow the package insert guidelines&#xD;
      for treating patients with apremilast.&#xD;
