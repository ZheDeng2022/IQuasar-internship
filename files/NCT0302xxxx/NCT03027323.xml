    <textblock>
      Undifferentiated hypotension is a medical emergency where a patient's blood pressure drops to&#xD;
      critical levels due to several possible reasons. The medical staff treating the patient will&#xD;
      need to find out the reason for your drop in blood pressure as soon as possible. When&#xD;
      treating low blood pressure, the medical staff typically performs a procedure called central&#xD;
      venous cannulation (CVC). CVC involves accessing a large vein (usually the subclavian under&#xD;
      the collarbone) by inserting a needle into the vein. By doing this, the medical staff can&#xD;
      measure the pressures in the patient's veins or give medicine to the patient while they are&#xD;
      in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the time needed to complete CVC using the AxoTrack&#xD;
      device to CVC guided by landmarks on a patient's body. The investigators expect that there&#xD;
      will be a maximum of 30 patients enrolled in this study.&#xD;

      Central venous cannulation (CVC) is commonly performed to give volume resuscitation and&#xD;
      parenteral medications to patients with time sensitive conditions such as severe traumatic&#xD;
      injury or undifferentiated shock. CVC via the subclavian route is associated with more&#xD;
      frequent technical complications but less frequent infection or thrombosis as compared with&#xD;
      via the internal jugular or femoral veins. Traditionally CVC via the subclavian vein is&#xD;
      guided by anatomical landmarks. CVC guided by real-time use of traditional diagnostic&#xD;
      ultrasound device is associated with a lower technical failure rate (overall and on first&#xD;
      attempt), fewer punctures, faster access, and fewer mechanical complications as compared with&#xD;
      guidance by anatomical landmarks when performed via the internal jugular vein. It remains&#xD;
      unclear whether CVC guided by real-time ultrasound is associated with significantly lower&#xD;
      failure and complication rates as compared with CVC guided by landmarks when performed via&#xD;
      the subclavian vein. CVC guided by real-time ultrasound may reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      complications, number of punctures, and the time between skin penetration and the aspiration&#xD;
      of venous blood into the syringe as compared with guidance by landmarks. A limitation of&#xD;
      guidance by a traditional diagnostic ultrasound device is it that it may require an assistant&#xD;
      to perform, which may not be feasible when treating time sensitive conditions or in low&#xD;
      resource settings. In addition, most traditional ultrasound probes are not designed to image&#xD;
      the subclavian vein behind the clavicle. The AxoTrack system is a novel ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      system recently cleared for human use by the United States Food and Drug Administration. It&#xD;
      is intended to facilitate CVC by a single operator as well as to reduce complications and&#xD;
      time associated with CVC. The AxoTrack has a small ultrasound scan head which facilitates&#xD;
      imaging of the subclavian vein. It remains unclear whether CVC guided by AxoTrack reduces&#xD;
      procedure times and complication rates when compared with CVC using landmark guidance in&#xD;
      patients with undifferentiated hypotension.&#xD;
