      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva, blood, tissue, and cancer contain DNA. DNA makes the &quot;instruction book&quot; for the cells&#xD;
      in the body. Cancer is caused by changes in DNA that affect cell function. Researchers want&#xD;
      to test DNA of people with tumors. They want to look for genetic changes in tumors that could&#xD;
      be targets for treatment. Because DNA can change as cancer changes, more testing may be done&#xD;
      at different times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the DNA changes in cancer that may help guide treatment. To collect samples and data&#xD;
      to be used in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People any age with cancer or a pre-cancerous tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
           Participants will give a sample of their tumor. This is usually from a previous&#xD;
           procedure. Participants will give a saliva or blood sample. They cannot eat, drink,&#xD;
           smoke, or chew gum for 30 minutes before giving saliva. They will spit about 1 teaspoon&#xD;
           of saliva into a tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may have a punch biopsy instead. A small instrument will take a small&#xD;
           piece of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will collect data from participants medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their family health history. They will also&#xD;
           answer questions about their views on the study, including possible unexpected results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra blood or tissue samples may be taken at other times during the participants'&#xD;
           treatment. All samples will be saved in secure ClinOmics freezers to be used in future&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be told by their doctors if any test results affect their health or&#xD;
           their cancer treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory-based investigations have contributed to an improved understanding of the&#xD;
           biology of cancer and to the development of new therapies for malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omics investigation may identify novel drivers in the germline or tumor for high risk,&#xD;
           relapsed, refractory or rare cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omics investigation may identify germline or somatic alterations that are medically&#xD;
           actionable and or can enable precision therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives - Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Identify incidental and secondary findings in germline DNA and actionable somatic mutations&#xD;
      for reporting clinical results from a CLIA-certified lab into CRIS medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility - Adult or Pediatric patients of any age with one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of any tumor, malignancy, pre-malignant disorder, or suspected cancer&#xD;
           susceptibility familial syndromes, regardless of patient age; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals without history of malignancy who are undergoing surgery; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals without a history of cancer but evidence of an inherited cancer syndrome&#xD;
           based on family history and/or other manifestations of a pre-cancerous syndrome (e.g.&#xD;
           polyposis, plexiform neurofibromas, myelodysplastic disease); OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient enrolled in an approved companion protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue (including tumor, normal, blood, bone marrow, serum, plasma, or other tissues)&#xD;
           that has been previously collected under CLIA and maintained in a CLIA lab which is&#xD;
           available for CLIA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue (including tumor, normal, blood, bone marrow, serum, plasma, or other tissues)&#xD;
           that has been previously collected and is available for research analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biospecimens can be collected with minimal additional risk to the subject during&#xD;
           sampling or procedures required for routine patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual may be undergoing treatment for malignancy, premalignant condition or&#xD;
           receiving other care associated with an inherited cancer syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be referred to the Principal Investigator from outside institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the&#xD;
           willingness to sign a written informed consent OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IRB waiver of the requirement for informed consent for specific types of tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will allow for the collection of specimens for CLIA reporting of germline and&#xD;
           somatic mutations. The study will also collect specimens for a Tissue Repository, and&#xD;
           for other investigations as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLIA testing activities will include&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DNA extracted from a section of tumor, malignant tissue, blood, or bone marrow&#xD;
                samples for somatic mutation sequence analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Germline DNA extracted from lymphocytes, saliva, skin, or any normal uninvolved&#xD;
                tissues for sequence analysis to identify somatic alterations in the cancer and for&#xD;
                the reporting of incidental findings of established clinical validity and utility.&#xD;
