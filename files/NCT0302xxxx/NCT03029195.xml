  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cleft lip and palate (CLP) is the commonest craniofacial anomaly worldwide. Nasoalveolar&#xD;
      molding (NAM) therapy has emerged in the management of CLP as an early presurgical&#xD;
      intervention to provide symmetry to severely deformed nasal cartilage, achieve projection to&#xD;
      the flattened nasal tip, provide nonsurgical elevation for the columella, improve alignment&#xD;
      of the alveolar ridge, reduce the cleft gap and it could significantly reduce the number of&#xD;
      secondary surgeries. Despite that NAM therapy is becoming the treatment option for early&#xD;
      cleft care, there is growing debate about its efficacy due to lack of quantitative assessment&#xD;
      of these findings. To provide the highest levels of clinical evidence on NAM therapy, there&#xD;
      has been international call for Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of the problem: lack of quantitative data about the efficacy of the NAM therapy for&#xD;
      unilateral CLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: is to develop a standardized non-invasive quantitative assessment for two&#xD;
      different techniques of the NAM therapy in Egyptian infants that involves 3D laser&#xD;
      scanning/CAD analysis for maxillary geometry, and nasal anthropometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Trial design: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Settings: The&#xD;
      RCT will be performed through two phases; (Phase I: A controlled pre and post-RCT that will&#xD;
      be designed for the quantitative evaluation of the NAM therapy on the maxillary geometry),&#xD;
      and (Phase II: A post-test RCT will be designed for the quantitative evaluation of the NAM&#xD;
      therapy on the nasal anthropometry and comparing the outcome with the nasal anthropometry&#xD;
      that will be performed to age matched Egyptian norms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 30 Egyptian infants with nonsyndromic UCLP will be randomly allocated to study&#xD;
      groups (Group I, n=15) that will undergo NAM therapy before the primary surgical repair, and&#xD;
      control group (n=15) that will undergo the primary surgical repair without NAM therapy. And&#xD;
      15 Egyptian infants will act as norm group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: (phase I- T0: before NAM, T1: after 1 month and T2: before surgery). (Phase II-&#xD;
      T&quot;0: 10 days after surgery, and T&quot;1: 6 months after surgery).&#xD;

      o Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) will be performed through two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • RCT- (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A controlled pre- and post-clinical trial will be designed for the quantitative evaluation of&#xD;
      the NAM therapy on the maxillary geometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • RCT- (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-test controlled clinical trial will be designed for the quantitative evaluation of the&#xD;
      NAM therapy on the nasal anthropometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants with nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate UCLP will be selected from&#xD;
      those admitted to the Maxillofacial and Plastic surgery department- Faculty of Dentistry-&#xD;
      Alexandria University based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a power of 80% to detect clinically meaningful difference at the cleft gap distance&#xD;
      (D1-D2) before and after applying NAM therapy = 5.8, SD (standard deviation) =3.4, effect&#xD;
      size=1.2 and α=0.05. The minimal required sample size was calculated to be twelve per group&#xD;
      (increased to fifteen to avoid drop outs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using G*Power software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization for a total of 45 infants will be done as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty infants with nonsyndromic UCLP will be randomly allocated by using closed envelop&#xD;
      allocation concealment method. However, the fifteen normal infants will be only randomly&#xD;
      selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT- (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Study group&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Group I): 15 infants In this group infants will undergo presurgical nasoalveolar molding&#xD;
      before the primary surgical correction&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Group II): 15 infants This group, the infants will undergo primary surgical correction&#xD;
      without presurgical NAM procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT- (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Norm group: (Group III): 15 infants Age matched noncleft infants. A group of normal age&#xD;
           matched noncleft infants will be randomly selected to act norms for the nasal&#xD;
           anthropometry for the Egyptian model, and will be compared with will be compared with&#xD;
           the study and the control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Procedures and Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
                RCT- (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
                1.1. Case history, examination, and diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
                1.2. Impressions and working cast:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Following evaluation and a thorough explanation of the treatment goals and the&#xD;
                procedure to the parents, an impression of an intraoral cleft defect will be made&#xD;
                using fast setting alginate impression material loaded on a custom made tray made&#xD;
                from wax.&#xD;
&#xD;
                With the infant fully awake and without any anesthesia in a clinical setting&#xD;
                prepared to handle an airway emergency with a surgeon present as a part of the&#xD;
                impression team.&#xD;
&#xD;
                During impression making, the infant will be held in an inverted position to keep&#xD;
                the tongue forward and to allow fluids to drain out of the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Once the impression material has been set, the tray will be removed, and the oral&#xD;
                cavity will be examined for the residual impression material in the cleft region.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Intraoral impressions will be carefully poured in regular dental stone, and the&#xD;
                casts will be recovered carefully.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1.3. Fabrication of the appliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The fabrication of the NAM appliance will be done following the technique described&#xD;
                by Grayson et al. It includes an intraoral molding acrylic palatal plate and a&#xD;
                nasal stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All casts will be marked and stored for measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • The oral molding appliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The cleft region of the palate and alveolus will be filled in with wax to&#xD;
                approximate the contour and topography of an intact arch. The cast will be&#xD;
                duplicated to obtain a working cast on which two layers of wax will be adapted and&#xD;
                laboratory processed using clear heat-cure acrylic resin to fabricate the molding&#xD;
                prosthesis of 2 to 3 mm thickness to provide structural integrity and to permit&#xD;
                adjustments during the molding therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The appliance will be finished and polished to ensure that all tissue borders are&#xD;
                smooth and that the oral portion of the appliance that would be in contact with the&#xD;
                dorsum of the tongue is given a high polish.&#xD;
&#xD;
                At the insertion appointment, the appliance will be carefully fitted in the&#xD;
                infant's oral cavity and observed for few minutes. The infant should able to suckle&#xD;
                without gagging or struggling.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Extraoral retentive button:&#xD;
&#xD;
                An extraoral retentive button will be fabricated with self polymerizing clear&#xD;
                acrylic resin (*) and positioned facing downward on the labial flange, at an angle&#xD;
                40◦ relative to the plate, allowing clearance for upper and lower lips that will&#xD;
                facilitate the positive seating of the appliance to the palatal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The appliance will be then secured extraorally to the cheeks and bilaterally by&#xD;
                surgical tapes with orthodontic elastics at each end.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The use of skin barrier dressing tapes will be advocated to reduce cheek&#xD;
                irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Retentive taping with adhesive tapes and orthodontic elastics:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The skin barrier dressing tapes will be first applied to the infant's cheeks,&#xD;
                lateral and superior to the commissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
                These base tapes will also serve to anchor the thinner (0.25 × 4 inch) tapes of&#xD;
                suture strips used to hold the appliance against the palate.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Small orthodontic elastics (inner diameter 0.25 inch, wall thickness heavy) will be&#xD;
                incorporated into the loops of thinner tapes folded over them.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The elastic band will be placed over the retentive button, and the thinner tapes&#xD;
                will be pulled and secured to the base tapes on the infant's cheeks posteriorly and&#xD;
                superiorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
                An additional broader tape will be applied over the ends of the thinner tapes to&#xD;
                anchor suture strips and elastic bands to the base tapes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The parents will be provided with detailed instructions on the proper method of lip&#xD;
                taping along with taping materials and adhesive. The patient will be recalled on a&#xD;
                weekly basis for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Before any adjustments, the appliance will be cleaned with soap and water. Adhesive&#xD;
                tapes and elastics will be changed every week to maintain the proper activation&#xD;
                force to mold the alveolar segments. Instructions will be given to keep the&#xD;
                appliance in the oral cavity for 24 hours except during cleaning. The tissue&#xD;
                surface of the appliance will be modified to allow selective pressure on the&#xD;
                greater and lesser alveolar segments on either side of the cleft for correct&#xD;
                alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Nasal stent&#xD;
&#xD;
                Within the first month of treatment, the phase of active nasal cartilage molding&#xD;
                begins when the intraalveolar gap reduced to approximately 6 mm by incorporation of&#xD;
                the nasal stent component.&#xD;
&#xD;
                A nasal stent will be constructed from 0.019 inch round stainless steel wire. It&#xD;
                will be extended forward and then curved backward in the form of a &quot;swan neck&quot;&#xD;
                entering 3 to 4 mm past the nostril aperture.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Finally, the superior aspect of the nasal stent will be covered with a thin layer&#xD;
                of soft liner to ensure positive elastic pressure to the internal tissues of the&#xD;
                nasal dome.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The upper lobe will be inserted into the nose and gently lifted toward the dome&#xD;
                until a moderate amount of tissue blanching is evident. The lower lobe of the nasal&#xD;
                stent will lift the nostril apex and define the top of the columella. Periodic&#xD;
                examination of the tissues and adjustment of the appliance will be continued every&#xD;
                week to mold the nasoalveolar complex into the desired shape and position.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The endpoint for the treatment of patients with NAM will be when the inter-segment&#xD;
                distance will have been less than 3 mm and the nasal cartilages, columella, and&#xD;
                philtrum will have been properly repositioned, ensuring a clinically desirable&#xD;
                approximation of the alveolar segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The infant will scheduled for surgical repair with the plastic surgeon after&#xD;
                parents' consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1.4. Weekly adjustment visits&#xD;
&#xD;
                Weekly adjustments are required for maximum effectiveness of the presurgical&#xD;
                appliance. On each visit, a new impression will be taken and poured with dental&#xD;
                stone. This will be done to examine cleft closure and guide adjustment to the&#xD;
                appliance modifications. . Sporadic emergency appointments are also needed to&#xD;
                resolve any ulceration which may develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
                RCT- (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
                1.5. Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
                The primary surgical closure of the lip and nose will be performed at 3 months of&#xD;
                age.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The surgical technique will be performed according to Millard's&#xD;
                rotation/advancement technique. Because the alveolar segments will be in&#xD;
                approximation, a gingivoperiosteoplasty will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Digital photos with a submento-vertical view will be taken to the infants face&#xD;
                after the surgical closure. ( T&quot;0 = 10 days post-surgery) and (T&quot;1= 6 months&#xD;
                post-surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
                2.1. Quantitative 3D maxillary geometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2.2. Quantitative nasal anthropometric analysis on photographs. (Photogrammetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
                RCT- (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
                2.1. Quantitative 3D maxillary geometric analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The impressions for the maxillary casts that would have been taken at the initial&#xD;
                visit (T0; pre-NAM therapy), (T2 during NAM therapy) and (T3 before surgery) will&#xD;
                undergo 3D laser scanning and computer aided design (CAD) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The 3D models will be constructed using a laser scanning machine (3Shape) and 3D&#xD;
                software for CAD analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Reference points and lines, which are based on the anatomic structures, will be&#xD;
                identified and digitized on the 3D model. The linear, angular, midline deviation,&#xD;
                distance, and curvature of the arch will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
                After laser scanning, the reference base plane will be set by. The plane containing&#xD;
                the points located at the incisal point (A) and the tuberosity points on the&#xD;
                noncleft and cleft sides (T1, T2) defined the XY-plane (horizontal reference&#xD;
                plane).&#xD;
&#xD;
                On the 3D image, the outline of the upper alveolar arch will be marked using six&#xD;
                points that contained the anatomical landmarks (D1, A, C1, M1, and T1 on the major&#xD;
                segment and D2, C2, M2, and T2 on the minor segment).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The curvature radius of the appropriate circle of the upper alveolar arch on each&#xD;
                major and minor segment (R and r, respectively) will be calculated using the&#xD;
                software.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The symmetry of the upper alveolar arch will be analyzed by calculating the ratio&#xD;
                of the curvatures of the upper alveolar arch on the major and minor segments (R/r&#xD;
                ratio) by using the following formula: R/r ratio = the curvatures of the&#xD;
                appropriate circle of the upper alveolar arch on the major segment (R)/the&#xD;
                curvatures of the appropriate circle of the upper alveolar arch on the minor&#xD;
                segment (r). The R/r ratios at the time of lip and palatal repair will be compared&#xD;
                between the NAM and non-NAM groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
                RCT- (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
                2.2. Quantitative nasal anthropometric analysis on photographs (Photogrammetry):&#xD;
&#xD;
                Comparing the affected and unaffected sides after surgery by direct digitization&#xD;
                process of the nasal morphology after surgical repair through quantifying the&#xD;
                geometry of the nasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Digital photographs will be taken after the primary surgical repair for the infants&#xD;
                head to obtain submento-vertical views including the recommended landmarks.&#xD;
                Landmarks, constructs and reference lines anthropometric landmarks on face and nose&#xD;
                will be selected as extracted from the geometrical condition of the discriminated&#xD;
                nostril coordinates.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The algorithm aims to simplify the process of extracting Area Of Interest (AOI), in&#xD;
                our case is the face, extracting Region(s) Of Interest (ROI), in our case are the&#xD;
                eyes, nose, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
                There are two main steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
                I- Pre-processing steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. This is about identifying the AOI through Image threshold where face&#xD;
                     boundaries are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Within AOI, facial features are identified such as eyes to be used as&#xD;
                     reference points to define the horizontal baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Vertical symmetry axis is identified as the perpendicular line on horizontal&#xD;
                     baseline passing through the mid point between eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     II- Processing steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Get nose data (ROI).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Mirror the normal side.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Mark the difference between the normal and actual state.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. Calculate statistics and geometrical parameters.&#xD;
