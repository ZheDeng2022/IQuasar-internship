      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible patients with Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program is designed to provide access to niraparib prior to approval by the US Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible, patients with Recurrent Ovarian Cancer following a partial (PR) or complete&#xD;
      response (CR) to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy and must have experienced a PR&#xD;
      or CR after the penultimate (next to last) platinum-based chemotherapy for at least 6 months&#xD;
      without disease progression after this chemotherapy.&#xD;

      If a patient qualifies for participation in an ongoing niraparib clinical trial or is already&#xD;
      participating in a niraparib clinical trial, she will not be able to participate in the EAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing clinical trials for niraparib include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase 3 trial in patients who have received first-line treatment for ovarian cancer&#xD;
           (the PRIMA trial, NCT # 02655016)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase 2 trial in patients who have received multiple lines of treatment for ovarian&#xD;
           cancer (the QUADRA trial, NCT # 02354586)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase 1/2 trial in patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer&#xD;
           or recurrent ovarian cancer. (the TOPACIO trial, NCT # 02657889)&#xD;
