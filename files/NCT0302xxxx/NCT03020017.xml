  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug, NU-0129,&#xD;
      based on Spherical Nucleic Acid (SNA) platform when infused in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. The SNA consists of nucleic acids arranged on the&#xD;
      surface of a small spherical gold nanoparticle. This is a first-in-human trial to determine&#xD;
      the safety of NU-0129. NU-0129 can cross the blood brain barrier (a filtering mechanism that&#xD;
      carry blood to the brain). Once within the tumor, the nucleic acid component is able to&#xD;
      target a gene called Bcl2L12 that is present in glioblastoma multiforme, and is associated&#xD;
      with tumor growth. This gene prevents tumor cells from apoptosis, which is the process of&#xD;
      programmed cell death, thus promoting tumor growth. Researchers think that targeting the&#xD;
      Bcl2L12 gene with NU-0129 will help stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of intravenous NU-0129 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To analyze drug concentration in serum at specific time points after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To demonstrate intratumoral penetration of NU-0129. III. To assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      giving NU-0129 as a standard treatment for recurrent GBM or GS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To analyze tumor tissue for Bcl2L12 expression levels after NU-0129 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Preliminary response (progression free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS] at 6&#xD;
      months; overall response rate [ORR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive NU-0129 intravenously (IV) over 20-50 minutes and undergo standard of care&#xD;
      tumor resection within 8-48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days and&#xD;
      then every 84 days for up to 2 years.&#xD;
