  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to learn if taking part in guided relaxation&#xD;
      programs helps to reduce anxiety and pain during stereotactic breast biopsy. The study will&#xD;
      also examine whether the guided relaxation programs change brain activity, heart rate, and&#xD;
      blood pressure.&#xD;

      Baseline Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant chooses to take part in this study, they will be asked to fill out several&#xD;
      questionnaires on an MD Anderson computer. Participant will be asked questions about anxiety,&#xD;
      pain, and spirituality. The questionnaires will take about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have their heart rate and blood pressure taken, which will take about 3&#xD;
      minutes to complete. Participant will then have an electroencephalogram (EEG) done. An EEG is&#xD;
      used to view a person's brain waves. The EEG should take about 5 minutes to complete. During&#xD;
      the EEG, a snug cap which contains small electrodes will be placed on the head to measure the&#xD;
      electrical patterns coming from the brain--much like the way a doctor listens to&#xD;
      participant's heart from the surface of their skin. The EEG cap will stay on participant's&#xD;
      head until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline information is collected, participant will be randomly assigned (as in the&#xD;
      role of a die) to 1 of 3 study groups: 2 relaxation training groups or a standard care group.&#xD;
      Based on the way the study is designed, there is a 1 in 5 (or 20%) chance that participant&#xD;
      will be assigned to the standard care group, and a 4 in 5 (or 80%) chance that participant&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of the relaxation groups. Both relaxation groups will focus on&#xD;
      helping participant to relax by focusing on their breath. At the end of participation, all&#xD;
      groups will be given a 25 minute relaxation audio CD created by the MD Anderson Integrative&#xD;
      Medicine Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Breast Biopsy Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the relaxation groups will be guided through relaxation techniques&#xD;
      for 10 minutes before the biopsy. Participants assigned to the third group will listen to 10&#xD;
      minutes of National Public Radio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's heart rate and EEG activity will be recorded during this 10-minute period of&#xD;
      time. At the end of the 10-minute period before the breast biopsy, participant's blood&#xD;
      pressure will be taken again and they will complete a 5 minute questionnaire about anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast Biopsy Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it is time for the biopsy procedure, the research assistant will go with participant to&#xD;
      their procedure room. In the procedure room, the research assistant will continue to monitor&#xD;
      participant's heart rate and EEG activity throughout the biopsy time. If participant is in&#xD;
      one of the relaxation groups, the relaxation guide will also accompany participant to the&#xD;
      procedure room and will continue to be guided through relaxation during the biopsy procedure.&#xD;
      If participant is in the standard care group, they will be provided with the usual breast&#xD;
      biopsy care. Participant will be asked to talk about any anxiety and pain at several times&#xD;
      during the procedure. Participant will also be asked to rest with their eyes closed during&#xD;
      the biopsy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the biopsy is finished, the research assistant will go with participant to a separate&#xD;
      room, and they will have 5 minutes of EEG activity recorded, and their blood pressure will be&#xD;
      taken. The EEG cap will then be removed, and participant will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their experience that will take less than 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 85 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
