      Explore the unmet needs of patients admitted to the hospital for severely inflamed skin of&#xD;
      the lower legs, often described as 'bilateral cellulitis&quot;. These patients usually have&#xD;
      intractable lower extremity edema, stasis dermatitis and sometimes allergic contact&#xD;
      dermatitis rather than an infectious process; readmission is common. Investigators will&#xD;
      create patient and provider education materials to align dermatological, home health, and&#xD;
      other resources and measure reduction in hospital re-admission rate and length of stay.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS 2.1.1 Understand the unmet needs for stasis dermatitis care from the patient&#xD;
      and provider perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1: Patients Access problem: Severe stasis dermatitis is a multifactorial condition that&#xD;
      can mimic &quot;bilateral cellulitis&quot;. However, true bilateral cellulitis is exceedingly rare and&#xD;
      in most cases, is a misdiagnosis. The diagnosis of cellulitis is based primarily on clinical&#xD;
      appearance, sharing many features with severe stasis dermatitis. Objective measures for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of cellulitis are rarely helpful, with low sensitivity and specificity rates for&#xD;
      fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, blood cultures, and imaging studies. Admissions for&#xD;
      cellulitis and &quot;bilateral cellulitis&quot; in the United States are frequent, representing nearly&#xD;
      4% of all emergency admissions in 2010, with hospital stays averaging 5-7 days. Among the&#xD;
      factors most highly associated with increased length of hospital stay in these patients, the&#xD;
      top four include chronic edema, use of diuretics, elderly age, and living alone2. These&#xD;
      patients are likely to have severe lower extremity swelling, complicating stasis dermatitis,&#xD;
      and the most difficulty managing chronic health conditions. In a recent study of 145 patients&#xD;
      admitted for cellulitis, it was found that 28% were incorrectly diagnosed with lower limb&#xD;
      cellulitis, with venous stasis dermatitis being the most common diagnosis mistaken for&#xD;
      cellulitis in 37% of cases. This is costly to patients, providers, hospitals, and the&#xD;
      healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In outpatient and inpatient settings, internists frequently prescribe diuretics to reduce&#xD;
      lower extremity edema without awarding the problem a comprehensive evaluation for underlying&#xD;
      causes. This chronic condition requires ongoing treatment, in many forms, which must address&#xD;
      the primary cause. Gradient compression is the most effective means to achieve relief, but&#xD;
      long-term management with this form of treatment requires a breadth of knowledge on behalf of&#xD;
      providers and patients. For providers for example, multi-layer bandages must be used during&#xD;
      the acute phase to reshape and reduce the size of the limb, appropriate stocking compression&#xD;
      grade and length must be chosen, and patients and potential caregivers should be educated on&#xD;
      donning and doffing stockings, application aids, appropriate hosiery care, skin care, use of&#xD;
      emollients, limb massage, and exercise. Additionally, this requires stockings not covered by&#xD;
      many insurance plans. Many patients are non-adherent because the patients do not have a&#xD;
      family member or home health aide to assist, or the patients do not understand the importance&#xD;
      of stockings as a treatment for the patients disease. Providers may not have knowledge of who&#xD;
      to contact to get patients assistance in these situations. As a result, the edema gets worse,&#xD;
      and patients are admitted and readmitted to the hospital with relapsing &quot;bilateral&#xD;
      cellulitis&quot; of the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 of this study was approved by the University Hospitals Institutional Review Board in&#xD;
      January 2016 and under this protocol investigators have interviewed 27 inpatients (28&#xD;
      admissions) using a structured survey. The results of these interviews informed the&#xD;
      development of a tool kit to improve care for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tool kits consists of a patient brochure, a list of stockings and services available at&#xD;
      local medical supply houses, and an order set that includes patient education including an&#xD;
      Expectation Management and Medical Information (EMMI) module on compression stockings, a&#xD;
      video patient story, and training of University Hospitals Home care aides in motivational&#xD;
      interviewing to support adherence to regular use of gradient compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2: Focus Groups Using in-depth interviews for our inpatients selected using the same&#xD;
      criteria as in Phase 1 and independent focus groups of providers, the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      will obtain feedback to refine the items in our toolkit before implementing them in January&#xD;
      2017. The focus groups will be conducted with assistance from the Clinical and Translational&#xD;
      Science Collaborative (CTSC) Behavioral Measurement and Resource Center. The in-depth&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted either at patient homes or as inpatients. The interviews may be&#xD;
      recorded as in Part 1. The recordings and data will be downloaded into REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a focus group comprised of providers. This focus group will explore the&#xD;
      perceptions of the providers and what unmet needs remain for the patients. With this&#xD;
      information, investigators will design educational materials to help align resources in a&#xD;
      timely fashion and avoid admission when possible. The order set will include guidance on when&#xD;
      to obtain consultations as well as specific orders for reduction of lower extremity edema and&#xD;
      monitoring for side effects of compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2 Design education for patients and providers to cue them when additional care is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 3: Tools &amp; Education Access problem : Patients are often admitted to the hospital for&#xD;
      &quot;bilateral cellulitis&quot; despite the fact that most of these patients do not have true skin&#xD;
      infections. A research study published in 2015 demonstrated that 75% of inpatient dermatology&#xD;
      consultations for 'cellulitis&quot; resulted in a diagnosis of &quot;pseudocellulitis&quot; . Our data from&#xD;
      phase 1 confirms that 75% of patients admitted for lower extremity cellulitis at University&#xD;
      Hospitals do not in fact have cellulitis, although 90% receive antibiotics during a mean&#xD;
      length of stay of 8.3 days. Patients and providers may not even be aware of this&#xD;
      misdiagnosis, as stasis dermatitis will improve with leg elevation alone during a hospital&#xD;
      stay. As a result, care givers erroneously give intravenous antibiotics all of the credit for&#xD;
      the condition's resolution. When it recurs, a history of &quot;recurrent cellulitis&quot; is added to&#xD;
      the patient's chart, and the cycle is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers may also struggle with a lack of objective measures that can be used in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of cellulitis and its severity, depending primarily on clinical appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unnecessary admission and testing is expensive in many ways. For patients admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital, standard treatment for cellulitis is IV antibiotics for a week or more. Prolonged&#xD;
      bed rest in the hospital with potent antibiotics is problematic, especially for older&#xD;
      patients. It puts them at risk for impaired mobility, deep venous thrombosis, nosocomial&#xD;
      infections, particularly with Clostridium difficile, and is monetarily costly for all parties&#xD;
      involved. Alternative diagnoses need to be considered. Allergic contact dermatitis, which is&#xD;
      known to complicate stasis dermatitis, is one possibility. Patients can easily develop&#xD;
      contact allergies to components of topical steroids and topical antibiotics prescribed in an&#xD;
      attempt to treat dry, cracked, or fissured skin on an outpatient basis. However, many&#xD;
      inpatient facilities do not have access to regular dermatological consultation, and local&#xD;
      dermatologists may not have the appropriate patch tests or experience with patch testing to&#xD;
      identify contact allergen in the setting of stasis dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education materials and toolkit will help patients know who to contact when the edema&#xD;
      progresses, what patients can do at home, when to go to the hospital, as well as information&#xD;
      on financial and home care assistance as it relates to managing chronic condition. Provider&#xD;
      education materials will assist providers with making the correct diagnosis, ordering&#xD;
      appropriate testing, understanding when to consider admission, especially in cases of&#xD;
      &quot;bilateral cellulitis&quot;, involving specialty providers, and aligning assistance for patients.&#xD;
      The goal is to help providers when the patients feel stuck in attempting to help patients&#xD;
      manage this chronic condition, especially after the patient has already had multiple&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure the value of services identified in steps 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will track the number of patient admissions for antibiotics for &quot;bilateral&#xD;
      cellulitis&quot; and length of stay at two different time points: (1) before and (2) after&#xD;
      provider education ( e.g. clinical decision support in the electronic health record, an&#xD;
      contact information guides for trained home health aides). Investigators will also track the&#xD;
      number of readmissions and length of stay for patients at two time points: (1) before and (2)&#xD;
      after patient education materials are implemented (e.g. educational brochure, information&#xD;
      guides for community medical supply houses, and improved access e.g to increase use of patch&#xD;
      testing for inpatients). Investigators will stratify patients who have been seen in wound&#xD;
      care centers and those who have had patch testing and compare them to patients who have not,&#xD;
      to help better understand the value of these services.&#xD;
