  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal, exploratory, open study with a 6-month follow-up period&#xD;
      to explore via a specific Smartphone© application the evolution of a child's behavior over 6&#xD;
      months and the (psychological and social) effects of these changes on the family.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal, exploratory, open study with a 6-month follow-up period&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility of using a Smartphone© application designed for parents of patients&#xD;
      with ASD and to longitudinally collect data on the quality of life and anxiety of parents of&#xD;
      children with ASD and the children's functional symptoms over multiple weeks under natural&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study individuals diagnosed with ASD based on National Health&#xD;
      Authority (HAS) recommendations (on ADI-R diagnoses) from 3-16 years of age in the Pays de la&#xD;
      Loire region. The investigators propose to include 100 families. The study is exploratory in&#xD;
      nature; thus, randomizing patients is unnecessary. The investigators will include the first&#xD;
      100 families agreeing to participate in the study and meeting the inclusion criteria. All&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of&#xD;
      University Hospital of Nantes and from the Regional Center for Autism (CRA des Pays de la&#xD;
      Loire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the inclusion visit, parents will receive a code to download the app from the &quot;application&#xD;
      store&quot; of their choice (depending on their Smartphone©) and sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All type 1 data from the inclusion visit will be stored in an electronic database and in the&#xD;
      Smartphone© application (during the setup process).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial evaluation by the investigator will include the following type 1 data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sibling rank and marital status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifestyle: rural or urban; single or multiple occupants of the chid's bedroom and&#xD;
           housing type and surface,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational and teaching load and conditions (special education, inclusive education,&#xD;
           partial or full time, etc.), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The therapeutic management (speech therapy, psychomotor therapy, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 data will be stored in the electronic database only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at diagnosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current drug treatments (name, starting date and dose),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities (associated epilepsy, mental retardation and organic pathology),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and psychiatric family antecedent (ATCD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Original scores on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Autism Diagnostic&#xD;
           Observation Schedule (ADOS) at the time of diagnosis, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scores on the French version of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)&#xD;
           (http://www.autisme.qc.ca) at baseline and at the end of the study.&#xD;
