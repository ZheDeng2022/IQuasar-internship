  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a pilot prospective randomized study using a peer mentor with or without&#xD;
      Transcendental Meditation as compared to usual care for men and women with a new diagnosis of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD). The study is designed to explore between cohort comparisons of&#xD;
      perceived stress and a number of additional outcomes. The results of this pilot study will be&#xD;
      used in the design of larger future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is adult men and women with a new diagnosis of CAD made on the basis of&#xD;
      a myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, acute coronary syndrome, or&#xD;
      imaging test suggestive of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the addition of a peer mentor and training in&#xD;
      Transcendental Meditation to usual care will improve perceived stress and medication&#xD;
      adherence for men and women with newly diagnosed CAD as compared with usual care.&#xD;

      The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the addition of a peer mentor and training in&#xD;
      Transcendental Meditation to usual care will improve perceived stress and medication&#xD;
      adherence for men and women with newly diagnosed CAD as compared with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - Standard Of Care (SOC) Arm 3 - SOC, assignment of a peer mentor, and the opportunity&#xD;
      to receive training in transcendental meditation&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are no longer enrolling in Arm 2 of the study (SOC and subjects addition of a peer&#xD;
      mentor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months with surveys and&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOC may include routine outpatient physician assessment, preventive medications with&#xD;
      appropriate titration, routine blood draws, advice on lifestyle change, referral to cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation, use of commercially available medical apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation - use of peer mentor and use of transcendental meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peer mentor: These are volunteers with CAD, who will undergo training prior to be&#xD;
           assigned a mentee. Content of the training will focus on a review of health counseling,&#xD;
           basics of CAD pathophysiology and medications, information on situations where the&#xD;
           mentor should advise the subject to contact her doctor, and confidentiality. Mentors are&#xD;
           intended to provide psychosocial and limited educational support for subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transcendental meditation (TM). TM is a standardized meditation technique done 20&#xD;
           minutes twice each day while sitting with the eyes closed. Although data are&#xD;
           heterogeneous, TM has been demonstrated to reduce blood pressure in several small&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;

    <description>Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)&#xD;
Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from never (0) to almost always (4). Positively worded items are reverse scored, and the ratings are summed, with higher scores indicating more perceived stress.&#xD;
Total scale range: 0-40. Scores around 13 are considered average. Scores of 20 or higher are considered high stress.</description>
