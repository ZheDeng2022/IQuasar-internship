  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill-II&#xD;
      as an autologous bone-regenerating graft in the reconstruction of deficient bone in two&#xD;
      clinical indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Long and short bone extra-articular comminuted fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Long and short bones extra and intra articular defect /Gap or non-union, incapable of&#xD;
           self-regeneration&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: to establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is safe&#xD;
      under the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment-related appearance of heterotrophic bone ossification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No excessive bone formation at the transplantation sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No abnormalities in the treated sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: to establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is&#xD;
      effective under the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone continuity rate, measured radiographically by CT at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Surgery will be performed under local or general anesthetics according to the Investigator's and anesthesiologist discretion.&#xD;
A standard orthopedic approach will be made according to the fracture site.Then the transplantation of BonoFill-II into the fracture site and the fixation of the fracture by intramedullary nail or plate and screws or external fixator as required will be performed.&#xD;
internal fixation (plate and screws and intramedullary nails) will not be routinely removed. External fixators will be removed upon achievement of satisfactory bone union.</description>
