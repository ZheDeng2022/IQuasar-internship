      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of MR screening for asymptomatic head &amp;&#xD;
      neck (or CNS) second primary cancers occurring in hereditary retinoblastoma patients&#xD;
      previously treated by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hereditary retinoblastoma treated during infancy by external beam radiation&#xD;
      therapy (EBRT) the risk of second primary cancer occurring within radiation fields is high.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to depict by MRI secondary tumors as early as possible, before the&#xD;
      occurrence of clinical symptoms. Affected patients will be further managed in a national&#xD;
      expert center with dedicated diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, the benefit of&#xD;
      such management has to be assessed in terms of prognosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal history of hereditary retinoblastoma (i.e., familial history of&#xD;
             retinoblastoma, or bilateral retinoblastoma, or unilateral multifocal retinoblastoma,&#xD;
             or identified germline RB1 mutation or 13q deletion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) used for retinoblastoma treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age at inclusion greater or equal to 7 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Time period between the end of EBRT and inclusion date of 5 years or more&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent signed by patient (or legal representative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal history of non-familial unilateral unifocal retinoblastoma without RB1&#xD;
             germline mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal history of second primary neoplasm occurring within radiation fields&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication for MRI (pacemaker, intraocular metallic foreign body, defibrillators&#xD;
             or other implanted electronic devices, intracranial ferro-magnetic clips) or&#xD;
             associated conditions preventing from MR examination (intraocular prostheses and&#xD;
             implants are not a contraindication for MRI; orthodontic metallic devices are not a&#xD;
             contraindication but might decrease the image quality and should be removed, if&#xD;
             possible)&#xD;
