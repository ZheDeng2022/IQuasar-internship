  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1948, health has been defined as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental and social&#xD;
      well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity&quot; . However, a growing school&#xD;
      of thought suggests that health represents an ability to be adaptable and flexible in&#xD;
      response to daily stressors. It has been proposed that instead, the view of health should be&#xD;
      &quot;towards the ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of social, physical and emotional&#xD;
      challenges&quot;, which has been termed &quot;resilience&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theory of &quot;resilience&quot; relates health to the body's capacity to manage daily stressors&#xD;
      (such as physical activity or oxidative fluctuations) that challenge homeostasis, with the&#xD;
      return to homeostasis resulting from several physiological stress responses. Although this is&#xD;
      an all-encompassing model, and the effects of pathogens and other stress factors are also&#xD;
      relevant, this study will centre on the physiological aspects on this theory, focussing on&#xD;
      the disruption through exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Nrf-2 pathway is the major cellular defence against oxidative and electrophilic stresses.&#xD;
      Briefly, following dissociation from Keap1 (a scaffolding protein which binds Nrf2 and Cul3&#xD;
      ubiquitin ligase for proteasome degradation), Nrf-2 accumulates in the nucleus where it&#xD;
      activates the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of many antioxidant&#xD;
      genes, including catalase, glutathione peroxidases (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). As&#xD;
      such, it is an attractive target for both dietary and pharmacological interventions aiming to&#xD;
      increase resilience to oxidative stress. Most diet-derived bioactive Nrf-2 inducers contain&#xD;
      Michael acceptor groups (an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety). Curcumin, for example,&#xD;
      contains two Michael acceptor groups and is a known activator of Nrf-2. An additional&#xD;
      bioactive with a Michael accepter group is trans-cinnamaldehyde (CA) (a component found in&#xD;
      the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia), which, like curcumin, is an Nrf-2 activator in a&#xD;
      dose-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to assess the effect of bioactive Nrf-2&#xD;
      inducers, based on the presence of an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, on resilience markers&#xD;
      such as antioxidant enzyme activities and markers of oxidative stress, such as TBARS, to an&#xD;
      exercise challenge. The hypothesis is that specific plant bioactive increase the production&#xD;
      of antioxidant enzyme activities at baseline, and thereby decrease levels of TBARS upon an&#xD;
      exercise challenge. Ultimately, the use of novel resilience markers and signatures could&#xD;
      significantly improve the ability to prove the efficacy by which pro-oxidant dietary&#xD;
      bioactive improve lifelong health, as well as targeting those with lowest resilience as a way&#xD;
      to make best use of limited healthcare resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention supplement will consist of a mix of dietary bioactive with an α,&#xD;
      β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety (provided in individual capsules), of which the efficacy to&#xD;
      beneficially affect platelet activity, with and without a H2O2 (Hydrogen Peroxide) challenge,&#xD;
      was recently established: sulforaphane (SUL), green tea extract (epigallocatechin gallate)&#xD;
      (EGCG) and cinnamaldehyde (Cin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to use a mix of dietary bioactive for the proposed human intervention study,&#xD;
      as different compounds could affect multiple pathways and therefore, have a broader efficacy.&#xD;
      In addition, bioavailability of compounds may be influenced by presence of other compounds,&#xD;
      as has been suggested in the literature (effect of piperine on EGCG bioavailability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioavailability data for each of these compounds were extracted from the literature and these&#xD;
      have been used, alongside practical considerations, to decide on the dosing strategy. The&#xD;
      desired composition of the supplement mix has been set as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUL: ~ 14mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGCG: ~ 400mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CIN: ~ 15mg These daily intakes should be sufficient to achieve micromolar quantities in&#xD;
           blood plasma for between 1 and 6 hours after ingestion, and perhaps longer. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable food ingredients which can be used in the study to achieve these intakes have been&#xD;
      sourced from reputable suppliers. These ingredients will be used to give desired intakes as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EnduraCell broccoli sprout powder (with added myrosinase): 1.5g (sufficient to provide ~&#xD;
           45mg glucoraphanin, the precursor to SUL, which should release approximately ~14mg SUL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bulk Powders Green tea extract: ~ 900mg (containing approximately 400mg EGCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bulk Powders Cinnamon Bark Extract: 0.75g (containing ~15 - 20mg Cin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to envisaged difficulties with palatability, the ingredient mix will be encapsulated.&#xD;
      While one of the ingredients (green tea extract) is available pre-encapsulated from the&#xD;
      supplier, it is preferred to obtain all ingredients as free powder, and encapsulate them into&#xD;
      size 00 capsules at Science in Sport. This will avoid difficulties with placebo blinding, as&#xD;
      the capsules can all be given a similar appearance. Tests indicate that daily doses of&#xD;
      cinnamon bark extract and of green tea extract will be represented by 2 capsules, each&#xD;
      containing 375mg (cinnamon bark extract) and 450mg (green tea extract), while a daily dose of&#xD;
      broccoli sprout powder will be represented by 6 capsules containing 250mg each. Placebo&#xD;
      capsules will be prepared using food grade microcrystalline cellulose. Microbial testing will&#xD;
      be carried out on all supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For presentation to volunteers, the daily capsules will be divided into two servings, one&#xD;
      serving to be taken in the morning with breakfast, and one serving to be taken in the evening&#xD;
      with dinner. Each serving containing 5 capsules, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EnduraCell broccoli sprout powder: 3 capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bulk Powders Green tea extract: 1 capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bulk Powders Cinnamon Bark Extract: 1 capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
      One serving of the placebo intervention contains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Placebo (microcrystalline cellulose): 5 capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will take 5 servings just prior to the exercise challenge tests as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -2: two servings (one in the morning and one in the evening) Day -1: two servings (one in&#xD;
      the morning and one in the evening) Day 0: one serving (one in the morning with the first&#xD;
      meal)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each serving of capsules will be individually bagged and labelled with a unique identifier.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be instructed to take a serving of capsules twice per day, with a small&#xD;
      volume of water. They will be asked to record the unique identifier of each capsule serving&#xD;
      after consumption, along with the time at which it was consumed. Compliance will be monitored&#xD;
      via this daily supplement log, as well as by measuring plasma SUL metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be encouraged to minimise, as far as is possible, a high intake of products&#xD;
      rich in sulforaphane (cruciferous vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage,&#xD;
      cauliflower, bok choy, kale, collards, broccoli sprouts, chinese broccoli, broccoli raab,&#xD;
      kohlrabi, mustard, turnip, radish, rocket), epigallocatechin gallate (green tea) and&#xD;
      cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon), during the 2.5 days prior to the challenge test days.&#xD;
