    <textblock>
      The use of fluorescence for real-time evaluation of organ and tissue vascularization and&#xD;
      lymph node anatomy is a recent technology with potential for the surgical treatment of&#xD;
      cancer. The real-time analysis of tissue vascularization allows immediate identification to&#xD;
      the surgeon of areas with greater or lesser blood circulation, favoring surgical decision&#xD;
      making and prevention of complications related to tissue ischemia (necrosis, dehiscences and&#xD;
      infections). It is a technology with potential application in the areas of Digestive Surgery,&#xD;
      Repairing Plastic Surgery in Oncology, Head and Neck Surgery. In addition, fluorescence can&#xD;
      be used as a method to identify lymph node structures of interest in the oncological&#xD;
      treatment of patients with urologic, gynecological and digestive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduced by Pestana et al. In the late 2000s, the perfusion mapping system through&#xD;
      intraoperative indocyanine assisted laser angiography (SPY Elite System © LifeCell Corp.,&#xD;
      Branchburg, N.J.) had its initial application in repairing surgery after breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment. The method proved to be useful in the prevention of ischemic and infectious&#xD;
      complications in cancer surgery. Pestana, in a prospective clinical series of 29&#xD;
      microsurgical flaps used in several reconstructions, observed a single case of partial loss&#xD;
      of the flap, the present technology having a relevant role in intraoperative decision making.&#xD;
      In the same year, Newman et al. The first application of the system in breast reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery. In an initial series of 10 consecutive cases of reconstruction with microsurgical&#xD;
      flaps, in 4 cases the system allowed the intraoperative identification of areas of low&#xD;
      perfusion, thus changing the surgical procedure. According to the authors, there was a 95%&#xD;
      correlation between indocyanine laser assisted and subsequent development of mastectomy skin&#xD;
      necrosis, with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91%. Similarly, Murray et al. Evaluated&#xD;
      the intraoperative perfusion, however, of the areola-papillary complex in patients submitted&#xD;
      to subcutaneous mastectomies with satisfactory results in terms of predictability of&#xD;
      cutaneous circulation. Other authors in larger clinical series and evaluating other&#xD;
      procedures have observed valid results in terms of prevention of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular perfusion of anastomoses and fistulas following bowel surgery for cancer remain a&#xD;
      serious and common complication. These fistulas can be caused by insufficient perfusion of&#xD;
      the intestinal anastomosis. Intraoperative angiography with indocyanine assisted laser can be&#xD;
      used to visualize the blood perfusion following intravenous injection of the indocyanine&#xD;
      green contrast. Several groups reported the ability to assess blood perfusion of the&#xD;
      anastomotic area after bowel surgery. Although they studied retrospectively, Kudszus and&#xD;
      colleagues described a reduction in the risk of revision due to fistula in 60% of patients&#xD;
      whose anastomosis was examined using laser fluorescence angiography compared to historically&#xD;
      paired patients without this method. The same principle can be used to evaluate the tubulized&#xD;
      stomach to be transposed to the cervical region after subtotal esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node mapping has been studied in breast cancer&#xD;
      as well as investigative character in colorectal cancer, skin cancer, cervical cancer, vulvar&#xD;
      cancer, head and neck, lung cancer, penile cancer, cancer Endometrial cancer, gastric cancer&#xD;
      and esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These early studies demonstrated the feasibility of this methodology during surgery.&#xD;
      Comparison of laser fluorescence images on blue dyes indicate that fluorescence images can&#xD;
      replace blue dyes because they exceed them due to increased tissue penetration depth and&#xD;
      absence of staining in the patient and cleaning of the operative field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no clinical studies involving intraoperative perfusion mapping and&#xD;
      identification of lymph node structures with the SPY Elite System © system or other platforms&#xD;
      (Pinpoint or Firefly) in Brazil that evaluate the Brazilian population. In an objective way&#xD;
      the influence of this technology as predictive in the better or worse evolution of the&#xD;
      oncologic surgery as well as in the prevention of the local ischemic complications by means&#xD;
      of intraopeal change of conduct&#xD;
