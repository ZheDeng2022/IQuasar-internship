  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coenzyme Q10 (or CoQ10) is a marketed supplement in US even though it can be synthesized in&#xD;
      the body via complicated biochemical pathways. It exists in both reduced and oxidized states,&#xD;
      namely ubiquinol and ubiquinone, respectively. It is commonly present in all cell membranes.&#xD;
      The main function of CoQ10 is to participate in energy production. Further, the reduced form&#xD;
      of CoQ10, ubiquinol, is appreciated as an important lipophilic antioxidant to protect free&#xD;
      radical induced damages to DNA, lipid, and proteins. Given that older adults have increased&#xD;
      production of free radicals, suboptimal antioxidant defenses toward free radicals, and a&#xD;
      decreased capability to replenish utilized CoQ10, CoQ10 supplementation can be one of&#xD;
      feasible ways to increase CoQ10 status in order adults. Most supplements available for&#xD;
      consumers are in the oxidized form. While the ubiquinol form is also available, whether the&#xD;
      reduced form will be more effective to replenish CoQ10 status in older subjects remains to be&#xD;
      explored. Thus, investigators aimed to examine whether ubiquinol will be more effectively&#xD;
      absorbed in older adults with a low antioxidant defense status. To pursue this aim,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a double blind, randomized, crossover design trail with 5 study&#xD;
      visits (1 screening visit and 4 study visits). Ten older men (&gt;55 y, BMI: 25-5 kg/m2) with a&#xD;
      compromised antioxidant defenses will be recruited and complete the trial. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive 200 mg/d ubiquinol or ubiquinone for 2 weeks with 2-week&#xD;
      washout between crossover. Ubiquinol and ubiquinone in plasma and immune cells in blood will&#xD;
      be assessed to reveal whether the reduced form, ubiquinol, is more absorbable than the&#xD;
      oxidized form, ubiquinone in older adults.&#xD;
