  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational cohort study, will investigate the platelet phenotype,&#xD;
      platelet genetic composition, and role of platelets as effector cells in women and men with&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MINOCA or MI-CAD) and controls. This study, which will take place at&#xD;
      NYU and Bellevue Medical Center, and participating external sites. May have concurrent&#xD;
      enrollment with the HARP Main Imaging (NCT02914483). Additionally, a sex, group of age and&#xD;
      race matched disease controls 'CATH-NOCA' composed of women and men with stable angina&#xD;
      referred for cardiac catheterization, will be enrolled. Blood obtained during the initial&#xD;
      catheterization and 2 months post-MI will be utilized for platelet testing.&#xD;

        This study may have concurrent enrollment with the HARP Main Imaging (NCT02905357). This&#xD;
        study population includes women and men who present to the hospital with an MI, with&#xD;
        non-obstructive coronary artery disease or obstructive artery disease, are eligible for&#xD;
        blood collection. Additionally, a sex, group of age and race matched disease controls&#xD;
        'CATH-NOCA' will be composed of women and men with stable angina referred for cardiac&#xD;
        catheterization.&#xD;
