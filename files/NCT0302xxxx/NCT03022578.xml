    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well laser interstitial thermal therapy and lomustine work in&#xD;
      treating patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma that has come back. Using laser&#xD;
      to heat the tumor cells may help to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lomustine,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving laser interstitial&#xD;
      thermal therapy and lomustine may work better in treating patients with glioblastoma or&#xD;
      anaplastic astrocytoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the disease control rate at 6 months in patients with recurrent glioblastoma or&#xD;
      isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype anaplastic astrocytoma treated with Laser&#xD;
      Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) at recurrence, followed by salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent glioblastoma, or isocitrate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype anaplastic astrocytoma treated with LITT at tumor recurrence,&#xD;
      followed by salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate time to progression (TTP) of patients with recurrent glioblastoma, or isocitrate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype anaplastic astrocytoma that are treated with LITT at tumor&#xD;
      recurrence, followed by salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Analyze volumetric data consisting of thermal damage threshold lines and overall tumor&#xD;
      volume to determine any role of 'extent of ablation' in outcomes (OS and/or TTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Characterize the safety profile of LITT followed by treatment with lomustine chemotherapy&#xD;
      in the recurrent disease setting, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess the long-term steroid requirements following LITT, compared to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the radiographic evolution of LITT-treated glioblastoma over time, using&#xD;
      conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T1 pre and post-contrast images, T2-weighted&#xD;
      images [T2WI], fluid attenuating inversion recovery [FLAIR] images) and advanced brain tumor&#xD;
      imaging (ABTI) [magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion [dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC),&#xD;
      dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and arterial spin labeling (ASL)], MR-diffusion, and MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy), to include quantitative tumor metrics (volumetric extent of ablation and&#xD;
      Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology [RANO] criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Analyze health care utilization as measured by length of hospital stay following LITT&#xD;
      (including inpatient rehabilitation care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Evaluate patients' functional status (using the Karnofsky performance score [KPS] and&#xD;
      the occurrence of symptoms [using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module&#xD;
      (MDASI-BT[English])] self-reporting tool), and correlate to disease progression and tolerance&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify correlative tumor and peripheral blood molecular markers that impact outcomes,&#xD;
      etc, and identify inflammatory/immunologic markers to assess neoantigen expression, etc, if&#xD;
      sufficient tissue is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify and characterize changes in tumor tissue following LITT, by analyzing and&#xD;
      comparing pre- and post-procedure tissue samples, if sufficient tissue is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo LITT at baseline and receive lomustine orally (PO) on day 1. Treatment with&#xD;
      lomustine repeats every 42 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
