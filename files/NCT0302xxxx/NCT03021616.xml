  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the cardiovascular effects of energy drink consumption in healthy&#xD;
      individuals through electrocardiogram (ECG), central blood pressure assessment, and ROTEM®&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, controlled, crossover study evaluating the&#xD;
      electrocardiographic, blood pressure, and hematological effects of an energy drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who have contacted the PI/AI/SC for consideration of participation in this&#xD;
           study will be scheduled a time to come to the Clinical Investigation Facility (CIF)&#xD;
           Interview Room, which is a private room located on the David Grant Medical Center&#xD;
           campus, for an initial evaluation for inclusion eligibility determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the initial evaluation subjects will be informed about the details of the study, be&#xD;
           presented with the Informed Consent Document (ICD) and HIPAA documents and be asked to&#xD;
           sign the appropriate forms voluntarily if they want to be a part of this study. Once&#xD;
           consented, subjects will then be asked a series of questions to see if they qualify for&#xD;
           inclusion in the study. A baseline ECG, Chem 7, and a peripheral blood pressure will be&#xD;
           obtained to rule out everything but normal sinus rhythm, normal potassium level, and&#xD;
           blood pressure less than 140/90. A cardiologist will approve every baseline ECG to allow&#xD;
           the participant to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the subject meets inclusion criteria and are approved by the cardiologist, they will&#xD;
           be enrolled, and allocated a randomized participant ID number. They will also be given&#xD;
           the &quot;Participant Instruction Sheet&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to document their normal baseline caffeine consumption on the&#xD;
           initial questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will randomly be assigned to consume either two-16 oz. containers of&#xD;
           Monster Energy® drink, original flavor, two-16 oz. containers of an active control&#xD;
           drink, or two 16 oz. containers of a placebo drink during their first day of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The blinding and randomization will be performed by a member of the pharmacy staff who&#xD;
           will have the randomization code in a sealed envelope in the pharmacy. The PI, AIs and&#xD;
           SC will be blinded. In the event of a medical emergency, unblinding a particular subject&#xD;
           may occur upon request to the pharmacy staff from an investigator or study coordinator.&#xD;
           Only the requested subject will be unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control drinks will comprise an equivalent volume. The active control drink 16 oz.&#xD;
           bottle will contain: 200 mg moxifloxacin (dissolved tablet), carbonated water,&#xD;
           reconstituted lime juice (readily available from supermarkets), and cherry flavoring&#xD;
           (regularly used flavoring in compounding). The placebo drink will be the same except it&#xD;
           will not contain moxifloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The energy drink and control drinks will be repackaged by a member of the pharmacy staff&#xD;
           in identical 16 oz. bottles and checked by another staff member. The active and control&#xD;
           drinks will be made at least 24 hours but no more than 7 days in advance and will be&#xD;
           stored in a refrigerator in a designated area within the inpatient pharmacy. Study&#xD;
           drinks will be available for the investigator/coordinator for distribution to the&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be informed on the &quot;Participant Instruction Sheet&quot; to refrain from&#xD;
           caffeine or energy drink consumption for 48 hours prior to study days 1, 8, and 15. They&#xD;
           will need to have similar work shifts 48 hours before each study day (i.e. day or night&#xD;
           shift). In addition, participants will be instructed to be in the fasting state (no food&#xD;
           or drink other than water) for 12 hours prior to study days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 1, a baseline ECG, HR, peripheral and central blood pressures, and lab draw will&#xD;
           be obtained prior to consumption of the assigned study drink. The lab draw will be used&#xD;
           to determine baseline clotting time using ROTEM® analysis. After completion of baseline&#xD;
           readings, subjects will have 45 minutes to consume two-16 oz. containers of Monster&#xD;
           Energy® or either control drink as assigned. The time clock for study duration will&#xD;
           start when the participant is issued their study drink. Repeat measurements of ECG, HR,&#xD;
           peripheral and central blood pressures will be performed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours. In&#xD;
           addition, a second lab draw will be taken at 2 hours and submitted for ROTEM® analysis&#xD;
           to determine clotting time. At 2 hours the subject will also be provided a&#xD;
           study-controlled breakfast. During each measurement session, participants will also be&#xD;
           asked to &quot;describe any adverse effects you may be experiencing&quot;. All measurements taken&#xD;
           and responses from participants will be annotated on the participant treatment form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may eat after lunch between hours four and five after the energy drink was&#xD;
           consumed. They will be asked to eat approximately the same meals for lunch on the 3&#xD;
           study days. They may not consume additional caffeine or energy drinks not provided by&#xD;
           the study group until after the measurements are taken 6 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A minimum 6-day wash-out period must elapse prior to initiation of the second phase of&#xD;
           the study, at which time the same treatment/monitoring process will occur (i.e. Day 8 or&#xD;
           after). It will again be repeated on day 15 or after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements will include: ECG, BP, lab draw, and questions about side effects each&#xD;
           participant may be experiencing.&#xD;
