      The prospective observational study entitled &quot;Heidelberg Study on Diabetes and Complications&quot;&#xD;
      is designed to Monitor the presence and development of diabetic complications in type 1 and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic patients, as well as pre-diabetics. Mail Goal is to detect new metabolic&#xD;
      mechanisms or new risk factors for the development of diabetic complications in order to&#xD;
      identify risk-subgroups. Non-diabetic controls will be enrolled for reference and comparison.&#xD;

      The prospective observational study entitled &quot;Heidelberg Study on Diabetes and Complications&quot;&#xD;
      is designed to show that diabetes according to the current medical definition does not exist.&#xD;
      Without question, there is an autoimmune disease that destroys beta cells in the pancreas,&#xD;
      which leads to absolute insulin deficiency with consecutively elevated blood glucose levels.&#xD;
      This disease is defined as diabetes mellitus type 1. Insulin treatment is absolutely&#xD;
      necessary in this state, since absolute insulin deficiency leads to lipolysis with&#xD;
      consecutive ketoacidosis and eventually death. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      generally defined as relative insulin deficiency with consecutively elevated blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. This disease is often mentioned in the context of the metabolic syndrome, which&#xD;
      additionally comprises obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. Therefore, only the name &quot;diabetes mellitus&quot; is shared by these two diseases, which&#xD;
      means &quot;sweet flow&quot;, therefore only describing a symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple interventional studies were aimed on avoiding or reducing the development of late&#xD;
      diabetic complications (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy). This is true&#xD;
      for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Up to this day, no study was able to demonstrate that&#xD;
      treatment of normalization of blood glucose levels reduces or even reverses development of&#xD;
      these complications. Moreover, several type 2 diabetic patients developed typical diabetic&#xD;
      complications before definitive manifestation of the actual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we hypothesize that late diabetic complications stand in no primary context with&#xD;
      blood glucose control, but are associated with other metabolic disorders. One aspect are&#xD;
      reactive metabolites (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-DG), which are formed in glycolysis and&#xD;
      lipolysis in the context of energy production of cells. These metabolites are detoxified to&#xD;
      lactate by certain enzymes. In case this detoxification is compromised, or production of&#xD;
      these metabolites elevated, so called advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) can form.&#xD;
      Moreover, within the process of energy production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and&#xD;
      oxydative stress are more pronounced, which can have direct influence on cellular metabolism.&#xD;
      This interaction leads to inflammation and DNA damage. Survival of the cells is dependent on&#xD;
      defense mechanisms, which seem to be genetically determined, with cellular ageing playing a&#xD;
      role as well (cellular senescence). With advanced ageing, cells lose these defense mechanisms&#xD;
      against these permanent metabolic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the following hypotheses arise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is no independent disease, but a late complication of metabolic&#xD;
           imbalance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Typical &quot;late diabetic complications&quot; are not based on insufficient blood glucose&#xD;
           lowering therapy, but on the basis of this metabolic imbalance, and can therefore affect&#xD;
           every patient, even without manifested &quot;diabetes mellitus type 2&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diabetes mellitus type 1 is an autoimmundisease with consecutive absolute insulin&#xD;
           deficiency, however manifestation of late diabetic complications is based on the same&#xD;
           metabolic dysbalance (overlap with type 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate these hypotheses, study participants will be profoundly examined once&#xD;
      yearly concerning glycemic metabolic state and clinical findings related to micro- and&#xD;
      macrovascular diabetic complications, Moreover, reactive metabolites like AGEs, ROS,&#xD;
      methylglyoxal, and DNA damage as well as other parameters associated with cellular senescence&#xD;
      will be examined. We will also collect information concerning quality of life, well-being,&#xD;
      depression, and neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study of its kind to include non-diabetics, pre-diabetics, and diabetics&#xD;
      with the possibility to study differences and common ground regarding cellular metabolism.&#xD;
      Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no precise clinical characterization of&#xD;
      peripheral nerve function in pre-diabetics, although some of these patients already complain&#xD;
      about neuropathic symptoms. In addition to that, the natural clinical course not only in&#xD;
      diabetics, but also in pre-diabetics will be observed over a longer period of time. Finally,&#xD;
      changes in surrogate markers over the natural course of pre-diabetes can be observed for the&#xD;
      first time, onset of type 1 or type 2 diabetes can be registered immediately, and all&#xD;
      patients can be directly compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
