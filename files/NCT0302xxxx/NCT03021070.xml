  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery and postnatal care (PNC) are proven strategies that&#xD;
      can tackle the high burden of maternal and child mortality and morbidity currently witnessed&#xD;
      in sub-Saharan Africa. However very few pregnant women utilize these services. This study&#xD;
      aims to assess the impact, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of conditional cash transfers&#xD;
      (CCTs) to promote increased and uninterrupted contact between pregnant women and the formal&#xD;
      healthcare system in Siaya County, Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial with the intervention being a conditional&#xD;
      cash transfer to women each time they honour their health appointments for ANC, facility&#xD;
      birth and PNC visits until their new-borns reach 1 year of age. Study participants are&#xD;
      pregnant women identified during their first ANC visit (n = 7200), and their subsequent&#xD;
      new-borns. Mothers and their children are followed up throughout their health visits and at 3&#xD;
      additional time points. Trial clusters are 48 public primary health facilities, (24 in the&#xD;
      intervention arm and 24 in the control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are: a) proportion of all eligible ANC visits made during pregnancy; b)&#xD;
      delivery at health facility; c) proportion of all eligible PNC visits honoured; d) proportion&#xD;
      of referrals honoured during pregnancy and postnatal period; e) proportion of child&#xD;
      immunizations received. Secondary outcomes include; health screening and infection control,&#xD;
      live birth, maternal and child survival 48 hours after delivery, exclusive breastfeeding,&#xD;
      birth spacing and self-rated wellness of mother and new-born at respective time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be measured through abstraction of health records at the health&#xD;
      facilities attended by the women during the trial period and supplemented by data collection&#xD;
      using an electronic based system that comprises of a card and reader system installed at&#xD;
      recruited study facilities. Secondary data will be abstracted from the women's medical&#xD;
      records at the health facilities and supplemented by telephone surveys administered at three&#xD;
      time-points over the course of the study. Additional quantitative and qualitative data will&#xD;
      be collected through questionnaires and phone interviews for process and economic&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will contribute to evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of conditional&#xD;
      cash transfers in facilitating health visits and promoting maternal and child health in Kenya&#xD;
      and other similar contexts.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           A &quot;Continuum of Care&quot; for reproductive, maternal, new-born and child health (RMNCH)&#xD;
           includes integrated service delivery for mothers and children from pre-pregnancy to&#xD;
           delivery, the immediate postnatal period, and childhood (1). Assuring continuity of care&#xD;
           has become a key programme strategy for improving the health of mothers and new-borns,&#xD;
           and is an important measure of service quality for outcomes such as prevention of&#xD;
           mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) (2). Yet in many countries there remains&#xD;
           major gaps in seeking care along this continuum. Retaining women in this continuum even&#xD;
           during pregnancy has not been possible to achieve in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with only&#xD;
           44% of women making the recommended 4 minimum ANC visits (focused ANC) (3). Focused ANC&#xD;
           is a scheduled service, and when clients do not adhere to the recommended timing and&#xD;
           repeat visits as required, the very purpose of the service is challenged. A number of&#xD;
           treatments provided during ANC have to be delivered in sequence for them to be&#xD;
           effective. Post-natal services are equally essential, as half of all postnatal maternal&#xD;
           deaths occur during the first week after the baby is born, and one in four child deaths&#xD;
           occur during the first month of life (5). In SSA, postnatal care programmes are among&#xD;
           the weakest of all reproductive and child health programmes (6). Follow-up treatments&#xD;
           and services such as PMTCT; counselling on family planning, breastfeeding and infant&#xD;
           feeding practices; and childhood immunizations cannot be achieved if many women are lost&#xD;
           to care immediately after delivery, as is the current trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A major opportunity for altering the low care seeking behavior in SSA exists however,&#xD;
           since over two thirds of women come into contact with the formal healthcare system at&#xD;
           least once during pregnancy (3). A strategy that can retain these women in care, from&#xD;
           their first contact during pregnancy through to birth and childhood period could thus&#xD;
           alter considerably the negative trends in maternal and child health in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Personal financial incentives (PFIs) can offer a broad based solution that is needed to&#xD;
           tackle the challenge of low care seeking and retention of women in the care continuum.&#xD;
           It can tackle both the financial barriers to care seeking, as well as the motivational&#xD;
           barriers. A number of studies (30, 31, 32, 33) have demonstrated personal financial&#xD;
           incentives (PFIs) can help to increase adherence to lengthy treatment schedules.&#xD;
           Empirical evidence supports this rationale; although it is still an emerging field. In&#xD;
           developed countries, paying people to change their behaviour has been demonstrated as&#xD;
           effective with behavioural problems (10). Notable successes in developing countries are&#xD;
           in TB treatment programmes (11) (12). In sub-Saharan Africa, this is still a very new&#xD;
           concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Siaya County, which is located on the shores of Lake Victoria&#xD;
      in Western Kenya. The County is made up of 6 sub counties which are mostly rural, and has a&#xD;
      population of 8.3 million people (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Sample size determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 7200 women provides 80% power to detect a difference in the co-primary&#xD;
      outcomes if the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is either low (0.005) or moderate&#xD;
      (0.025), taking the standard 5% significance level. The expected prevalence of these&#xD;
      indicators in the control arm ranges between 30 and 80%. The average cluster size (48&#xD;
      clusters) is 150 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Data collection methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.1 Abstraction of health records&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary mode for data collection will be the health records of women held at the&#xD;
      facilities they visit during the study period. With the consent of the study participants and&#xD;
      approval of the ethics committee, health data that is relevant for answering both the primary&#xD;
      and secondary research questions and adjusting for confounders will be abstracted on a&#xD;
      monthly basis from participating facilities and on a quarterly basis from non-participating&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.3 Electronic capture of health visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary method for collecting data on the primary health outcomes is an electronic based&#xD;
      system that will be utilized primarily for cash transfers to participants, but with&#xD;
      additional capabilities of remotely tracking health visits made by the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system is capable of capturing data on health visits remotely and in real-time each time&#xD;
      a nurse touches the Afya Card on the NCF terminal reader as a means of validating a health&#xD;
      visit. The card readers will be installed in all participating health facilities (24&#xD;
      intervention and 24 controls), as well as all hospitals in the County where most referrals&#xD;
      take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.4 Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      During enrollment, after informed written consent has been obtained, the nurse at the&#xD;
      enrolling facility will enter the details of the participant into the card reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.5 Telephone Surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone survey will be administered to all participants to generate data on outcomes that&#xD;
      cannot be obtained for women who do not make health facility visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the survey will assess health care seeking between the time of enrollment&#xD;
      and the time of the interview and will be used to assess quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . 2.3.6 Data collection in sub-group of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional telephone surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a random sub-sample of participants (50%), there will be two additional phone surveys to&#xD;
      gather more data on the primary and secondary outcomes, as well as establish baseline and end&#xD;
      line data needed for cost-effectiveness analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 weeks after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first contact between the research team and a sub-group of the enrolled women will take&#xD;
      place two weeks after enrollment, which is the first follow-up period. A short questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to assess cost of health facility visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 months after the Actual Delivery Date&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a final exit survey with the same sub-group of participants to follow-up on&#xD;
      health visits and health status of the particpants, and to gather feedback on the experience&#xD;
      with the cash transfer project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High risk groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      High risk groups in this study include mothers with infections that can be transmitted from&#xD;
      mother to child, or that could cause severe complications in the mother that makes it&#xD;
      impossible to infer any positive benefit of our intervention on their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the methods already outlined for tracking health records of participants,&#xD;
      health visits of study participants who have permanently shifted to health facilities outside&#xD;
      the evaluation zone will also be tracked. This will be done through extra phone calls to the&#xD;
      participants (outside the regular phone surveys) to elicit information on health facilities&#xD;
      the study participants are currently receiving care in, and visits made to those facilities&#xD;
      to obtain records on a quarterly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.7 Economic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economics data will be collected that serves two purposes: a) Enable for an adjustment of&#xD;
      service provision when evaluating the impact of the intervention on the outcomes, and b) For&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will also be collected on health worker's motivation (22) in both arms of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethical approval for this study will be obtained from the Maseno University Ethics Review&#xD;
      Committee (MUERC) and UCL Ethics committee, before data collection commences. The MUERC&#xD;
      approved the pilot phase of the trial in which the aims of this main trial were clearly&#xD;
      outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.1 Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants will not be blinded to their study&#xD;
      allocation. The research team will however generally be blinded to the intervention&#xD;
      allocation status of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes data will be gathered using an electronic system designed by a third&#xD;
      party and the research team will remain completely blind to the intervention allocation&#xD;
      status of participants and their health visit outcomes until the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system will randomly select participants in the intervention and control groups for phone&#xD;
      interviews. The exception are specific cash transfer questions and usages. Data on the cash&#xD;
      transfer would be separated from the rest of the data, and only merged after the rest of the&#xD;
      data has been analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary data will be abstracted by a project implementing partner. The abstracted records&#xD;
      will not identify intervention allocation status of the woman. The cards will be mixed so&#xD;
      that they do not follow any sequence, to make it impossible to link the ID to an enrolling&#xD;
      facility. The trial statisticians will conduct interim and final analyses blind to&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2 Interim analysis and monitoring by DMC&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not expect any adverse effects of the intervention but plan to carry out&#xD;
      two interim analyses in 2018 and 2019, which will be reported to an independent Data&#xD;
      Management Committee (DMC) to be convened according to the DAMOCLES charter (27). For these&#xD;
      meetings, the DMC will be provided with a report on the two key safety measures for the&#xD;
      trial, presented separately by trial arm, which are infant and maternal mortality. The DMC&#xD;
      will decide at each meeting whether to request further analyses, which may include analysis&#xD;
      of the study primary outcomes, and will ultimately on each occasion recommend that the study&#xD;
      continues or stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.3 Final analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final analyses will be by intention-to-treat and include all mothers who were pregnant during&#xD;
      the recruitment period (January 2017 - September 2017) and their children, regardless of&#xD;
      whether they received the intervention or not. The investigators will test for differences&#xD;
      between intervention and control areas in the primary outcomes using logistic regression for&#xD;
      the binary outcome, and ordinal logistic regression for the ordinal outcomes, adjusting for&#xD;
      clustering using random effect models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also carry out sub-group analyses to examine whether the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention differs by wealth/multi-dimensional poverty quintile to understand the equity&#xD;
      impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final analysis will be presented according to the CONSORT requirements for cRCTs (28,&#xD;
      29). Both the interim and final analyses will be conducted by the trial statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared before analysis begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Process evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to enable replication and scale up of the intervention, a mixed method process&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted to document the design, implementation and mechanisms of the&#xD;
      intervention. Five main sources of data will be used: (a) project planning and monitoring&#xD;
      documents; (b) forms to capture attendance, problems and strategies identified by the women&#xD;
      and health facility staff; (c) phone surveys data; e) facility costs data and (e) field notes&#xD;
      from intervention team members to be reviewed through monthly debriefings will document&#xD;
      intervention events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Data and measurements related challenges&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Certain health outcomes will be difficult to assess in the project; such as prematurity,&#xD;
           since the last monthly period (LMP) used to estimate the expected delivery date (EDD) is&#xD;
           recall based and may not be accurate. To mitigate this, telephone surveys will be used&#xD;
           to obtain the actual birth date, and subsequent follow-ups will be based on actual&#xD;
           delivery date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There could be infections such as Malaria that occurred before the intervention, but&#xD;
           which have important consequences on the secondary outcomes of the study. It will not be&#xD;
           possible to make a retrospective identification of these type of health conditions if&#xD;
           they have not been captured in health records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will not possible to get detailed data on birth health outcomes for women that&#xD;
           deliver at home, who are more likely to be in the control than intervention groups. The&#xD;
           investigators will therefore utilize the phone surveys as a secondary method of&#xD;
           gathering data on these outcomes.&#xD;
