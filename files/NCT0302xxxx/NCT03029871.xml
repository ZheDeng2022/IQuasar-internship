  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase 1 trial is to determine the dose-dependent toxicity and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oncolytic adenovirus-mediated cytotoxic gene therapy in&#xD;
      combination with SBRT in medically inoperable stage I/IIA (T1A - T2B) NSCLC. To accomplish&#xD;
      this objective, 9 subjects will be enrolled in the study. We hypothesize that the combined&#xD;
      treatment will demonstrate acceptable toxicity, and that it will be feasible to quantify&#xD;
      adenovirus-mediated HSV-1 TK gene expression in the lung by PET. This phase 1 trial will lay&#xD;
      the foundation for a follow-up phase 2 trial designed to examine efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nine subjects (3 cohorts, 3 subjects/cohort) with medically inoperable stage I/IIA (T1a -&#xD;
      T2b) NSCLC with tumors measuring &gt; 2 to ≤ 5 cm will receive a single intratumoral injection&#xD;
      of the oncolytic Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenovirus at one of three dose levels (1 x 1011&#xD;
      vp, 3 x 1011 vp, 1 x 1012 vp). Depending on the location of the target lesion, the adenovirus&#xD;
      will be injected either transbronchially (central tumors) or percutaneously under computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT)-guidance (peripheral tumors). Two days later, subjects will be administered&#xD;
      (orally) a 10 day course of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and valganciclovir (vGCV) prodrug therapy&#xD;
      along with 48 Gy (4 fractions of 12 Gy) of SBRT. Prior to and following the adenovirus&#xD;
      injection, subjects will be administered [18F]-FHBG, a HSV-1 TK substrate, and will undergo&#xD;
      PET imaging to quantify HSV-1 TK gene expression. Toxicity assessments will occur twice a&#xD;
      week for the first 2 weeks and then at scheduled follow-up visits through 60 months. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is toxicity. Secondary endpoints include 1) tumor (radiological) response,&#xD;
      2) local, regional, and distal tumor control, 3) progression-free and overall survival, and&#xD;
      4) quality of life. Exploratory endpoints include 1) intensity, persistence, and&#xD;
      biodistribution of HSV-1 TK gene expression, and 2) association of select serum biomarkers&#xD;
      with toxicity and tumor response.&#xD;

             effective means of birth control throughout and for 60 days beyond the treatment phase&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must possess the ability to give informed consent and express a willingness&#xD;

          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free&#xD;
             for a minimum of 2 years (e.g., carcinomas in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or&#xD;
             cervix are permissible). Subjects with previous lung cancer are permitted if the&#xD;
             subject is disease-free for a minimum of 2 years or if this is a solitary recurrence&#xD;
             in the lung measuring &gt; 2 cm and ≤ 5 cm after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known metastatic disease. Subjects may have MX status (e.g., lung nodules that are&#xD;
             being observed).&#xD;
