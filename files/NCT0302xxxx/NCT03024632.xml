      This is a retrospective chart review. The purpose is to look at the outcomes for women and&#xD;
      newborns who decided to attempt a trial of labor after 3 or more previous cesarean sections.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 2006, the vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rate was 8.5%, compared to a rate of 28.3%&#xD;
      in 1996. This was also associated with a rise in the rate of cesarean section from&#xD;
      approximately 20% to 31.1% over that same period of time. In that 10 year period, some&#xD;
      hospitals stopped offering a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states in Practice&#xD;
      Bulletin 115 (2010), Vaginal Birth After Previous Cesarean Delivery, &quot;it is reasonable to&#xD;
      consider women with 2 previous low transverse cesarean deliveries to be candidates for&#xD;
      TOLACâ€¦Data regarding the risk for women undergoing TOLAC with more than two previous cesarean&#xD;
      deliveries is limited.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1994, a study reviewing10 years of data regarding trial of labor after cesarean. Of their&#xD;
      population with 3 or more previous cesarean deliveries, 30% of patients underwent a trial of&#xD;
      labor, with a 79% success rate. In this group, the uterine rupture rate was 1.2% with zero&#xD;
      perinatal deaths related to rupture, which is compared to a rupture rate of 1.8% and 1&#xD;
      perinatal death in the group of 2 previous cesarean deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2002, another study described the outcomes of women who underwent a trial of labor after 2&#xD;
      or more previous cesarean deliveries at two large university hospitals in the Netherlands,&#xD;
      but it included just 59 patients total and only 4 of these had 3 previous cesarean&#xD;
      deliveries. No patients with more than 3 previous cesarean deliveries had a trial of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in 2010, described a large cohort of women from the northeastern United States with 3&#xD;
      or more previous cesarean deliveries, including those attempting VBAC. This cohort included&#xD;
      89 women, of whom 79.8% had a successful VBAC. However, of the women who had a TOLAC, 40.4%&#xD;
      delivered in a university hospital and only 18.0% in a hospital with an OB/GYN residency,&#xD;
      compared to 56.9% and 25.4% of women who had an elective repeat cesarean section. In the&#xD;
      group that had a TOLAC, there were no cases of uterine rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There still remains a lack of data about the outcomes of the delivery of women who desire a&#xD;
      trial of labor after 3 or more previous cesarean deliveries at a single institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze and compare the management and outcomes of women and neonates&#xD;
      for patients who attempted a trial of labor after 3 or more previous cesareans. We will also&#xD;
      compare them to women and neonates of patients who underwent a repeat cesarean section&#xD;
      without a trial of labor.&#xD;
