      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the prevalence of azole resistance in Aspergillus clinical isolates&#xD;
           collected in participating hospitals in Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the prevalence of azole resistance in Aspergillus environmental isolates&#xD;
           in Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize the molecular mechanisms of azole resistance in Aspergillus isolates in&#xD;
           Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the clonality of Aspergillus clinical and environmental isolates in&#xD;
           Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe the genetic relationships between local resistant strains with global&#xD;
           strains&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of patients with proven&#xD;
           or probable invasive aspergillosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the clinical impact of azole resistance in patients with proven or probable&#xD;
           invasive aspergillosis in a case-control study&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cumulative evidence described the emergence and geographical expansion of azole-resistant&#xD;
      Aspergillus fumigatus associated with azole treatment failure. Multiple amino acid&#xD;
      substitutions in the cyp51A gene have been described to be associated with azole resistance&#xD;
      that emerges during azole treatment, while a resistance mechanism, TR34/L98H mutation in&#xD;
      cyp51A, has been linked to the agricultural use of azole fungicides in Europe, which have&#xD;
      also been widely used in Taiwan for years. The current prevalence of azole-resistant&#xD;
      Aspergillus isolates and mechanisms of azole resistance in Taiwan is not clear. Considering&#xD;
      the potential of geographic migration of resistant isolates from neighboring countries and&#xD;
      the possibility of emergence of locally revolved resistant strains, this 2-year multi-center&#xD;
      project aims to investigate the prevalence rate of azole resistance in Aspergillus clinical&#xD;
      and environmental isolates, to determine the molecular mechanisms of azole resistance, and to&#xD;
      describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of Aspergillus diseases in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Clinical and environmental Aspergillus isolates will be collected and examined, and&#xD;
      clinical data from patients with Aspergillus diseases or colonization will be retrieved and&#xD;
      analyzed. Through this study the investigators anticipate increase in awareness of prevalence&#xD;
      and impact of azole resistance in patient safety in participating hospitals. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators may update Taiwan treatment guideline for aspergillosis on the basis of these&#xD;
      evidence and knowledge.&#xD;
