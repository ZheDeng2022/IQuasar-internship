      Aims. This paper describes the study protocol of a manualized brief positive intervention&#xD;
      (BHI). In addition, it reports the on the modification of a hope intervention based on the&#xD;
      theoretical proposition - hope theory, and its feasibility when applying to palliative cancer&#xD;
      and non-cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Hope was found to account for therapeutic changes in clients with depressive&#xD;
      symptoms or chronic pain. Nevertheless, little is known about the integration of such active&#xD;
      ingredients to brief and low intensity psycho-therapeutic interventions to patients receiving&#xD;
      palliative care were not adequately tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The study included two stages: (1) manual development, and (2) a single blinded&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Participants will be randomly assigned in equal number into either the brief hope&#xD;
      intervention or the controlled arm on completion of the baseline assessment. Participants of&#xD;
      the intervention group will be receiving the four-week intervention, while those allocated to&#xD;
      the control arm will be receiving the routine care and social chats. The intervention is a&#xD;
      manualized program that consists of four sessions at weekly intervals (two face to face&#xD;
      sessions and two telephone follow up in between). The core content is modified from an eight&#xD;
      sessions hope therapy. Expert panel feedback and trial on targeted populations were&#xD;
      completed. Four participants received the program to determine its acceptability prior to&#xD;
      feasibility testing. The process and practical considerations were evaluated to allow&#xD;
      refinement of the program and to ensure the quality of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures comprise of changes in state hope score and the depression scores measured&#xD;
      respectively by State Hope Scale and Centre for Epidemiological Study Depression Scale. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are the common signs and symptoms in cancer patients measured by The&#xD;
      Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data collection will be done prior to the&#xD;
      intervention (baseline), immediately and one month after the intervention. Additional use of&#xD;
      qualitative interview to explore their experiences in the intervention, including&#xD;
      satisfaction with the intervention and the treatment fidelity will be conducted.&#xD;

      Introduction According to the Medical Research Council guidance, there are four critical&#xD;
      steps to systematically establish a standardize intervention content and mode of delivery&#xD;
      through phased approach. Theory and evidence-based practice, feasibility or piloting to test&#xD;
      the procedure, estimate recruitment/retention, determining sample size, evaluation and&#xD;
      implementation are the four keys of the best practice described in the guideline. In this&#xD;
      article, we reported three steps in developing an evidence-based intervention, namely brief&#xD;
      hope intervention that addresses the management of cancer and palliative care patients: (1)&#xD;
      preparation of the present program, (2) description of the protocol of the feasibility test,&#xD;
      and (3) an experimental study using wait list control design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Hope intervention is grounded on positive psychology and is mapped onto&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy. It aligns with the 2014-2018 Oncology Nursing Society research&#xD;
      priorities, which indicated the need for evaluating the efficacy of integrating protective&#xD;
      factors, such as hope, to the care delivery to the patient and family caregivers. In a&#xD;
      similar vein, growing evidence has shown the increasing needs of quality palliative care for&#xD;
      non-cancer patients, who suffer from complex illnesses and progressing to end-of-life. These&#xD;
      patients having unpredictable disease trajectories, significant loss and grief, and&#xD;
      anticipated death would lead to depression and hopelessness. As such, the intervention should&#xD;
      be extended to non-cancer patients in their last phase of life. The goal of health-promoting&#xD;
      palliative care is to create a supportive environment and strengthen actions that intervene&#xD;
      along the journey of care giving, loss and death and dying. In a systematic review, hope was&#xD;
      found to account for therapeutic changes in clients with depressive symptoms or chronic pain.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, such active ingredients of the psychotherapy are not standard elements of&#xD;
      multi-modal care management. This warrants the field testing of the present brief hope&#xD;
      intervention in patients receiving palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hope Theory Hope theory is adopted as the framework in the present study, where hope was&#xD;
      believed as the central agent to facilitate the change process. It focuses on three core&#xD;
      features: (1) goal setting (goals), (2) problem solving (pathways) and (3) positive self-talk&#xD;
      (agency). These elements underlie the key hope strategies used in the intervention. By&#xD;
      increasing hope level, the likelihood of therapeutic change will be increased. Its current&#xD;
      emphasis complemented the traditional cognitive behavioral therapy by shifting the primary&#xD;
      focus on positive potentials as the starting point, thereby promoting meaning in life,&#xD;
      fostering personal strengths, positive changes and improving well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some believed that being overly optimistic is harmful. However, nurturing hope was found to&#xD;
      be one of the significant elements in staying positive in the coping experiences of Chinese&#xD;
      couples living with cancer. Evidence has shown that high-hope individuals were found to be&#xD;
      more creative and effective problem solvers. More important, a number of studies have&#xD;
      reported the positive effect of hope in newly diagnosed cancer patient, for example, health,&#xD;
      quality of life, self-esteem, reduced major cancer symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, cough,&#xD;
      and depression in lung cancer patients or promoting positive changes in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. However, many of these researches are cross-sectional surveys or qualitative&#xD;
      studies; others are mindfulness-based or spiritual-based interventions where hope is only one&#xD;
      of the active components in the program. Whether improving the hopeful state of cancer&#xD;
      patients and palliative care patients would lead to better clinical outcomes remains under&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Hope Intervention The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a brief hope&#xD;
      intervention in improving the hope level and the physical and mental health of cancer and&#xD;
      non-cancer Hong Kong Chinese patients who are receiving palliative care. This low intensity&#xD;
      psychological intervention can be delivered by caregiver such as nurses to address the needs&#xD;
      of these patients and to build their mental and/or physical abilities. Additionally, the&#xD;
      skills could be streamlined in daily nursing practice and an ongoing self-help strategy.&#xD;
      Would brief hope intervention be as effective as the standard session in clinical population?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal Length of Hope Intervention Preliminary evidence was found. Literature showed that&#xD;
      the role and value of hope at the early counseling sessions enhanced a literal shift to&#xD;
      experience a sense of worthiness. Focused hope intervention (90 minutes) has led to higher&#xD;
      level of hope and increase in perceived life meaning. The statistical robustness is supported&#xD;
      by the comparable effect sizes achieved by both the eight 2-hours sessions and the 90-minute&#xD;
      single session in previous studies on hope therapy. The effect sizes on the agency and&#xD;
      pathway hope scale scores were 0.65 and 0.38 respectively in the long intervention, and were&#xD;
      0.43 and 0.38 in the brief interventions. One large scale brief positive psychology&#xD;
      intervention with hope-based intervention (single session plus one booster session) recruited&#xD;
      1,734 participants from the community, showed positive significant changes in well-being and&#xD;
      family happiness (ES 0.11-0.14) (Zhou et al., 2015). Encouraging results were also&#xD;
      demonstrated is other studies, which has tested a brief meaning in life intervention for&#xD;
      advanced cancer Chinese patients (2-sessions: 30-60 and 15-30 minutes respectively). It&#xD;
      showed improvement in quality of life and existential distress. Wong, Wong, &amp; Chang (2015)&#xD;
      also found a four-sessions program (one visit plus three telephone follow up) effective in&#xD;
      reducing hospital readmission in community dwelling patients with chronic illnesses.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence on the optimal length of hope intervention for&#xD;
      cancer and palliative patients that would produce the desired effect. Thus the present study&#xD;
      results could underpin effective palliative care provision across a range of services from&#xD;
      hospitalization to discharge facilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The primary research question is whether brief hope intervention would improve the&#xD;
      hopeful state and reduce physical symptoms and/or depression level of patients receiving&#xD;
      palliative care. Fidelity was assured at the design level and in intervention delivery to&#xD;
      establish a standardized procedure, skill adequacy and translating the intervention from&#xD;
      research into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Description of the intervention The present Brief Hope Intervention is a&#xD;
      four-weeks individual intervention, helping participants to develop positive thoughts through&#xD;
      skills in goal setting, problem solving and positive self-talk. The program consists of four&#xD;
      sessions in total: two face-to-face sessions (1-hour) and two telephone follow up sessions&#xD;
      (30 minutes) in between. This serves to create the momentum and continuity of intervention.&#xD;
      The first session is the core intervention and the final face-to-face session is a summary&#xD;
      talk. Two telephone follow up will review their progress and encourage the practice of hope&#xD;
      exercises. Hope enhancement strategies included sharing and recalling past successes,&#xD;
      hope-based goal mapping exercises, examining possible pathways to reach the targeted goals,&#xD;
      hope visualization exercise and positive self-talk. A booklet will be prepared for the&#xD;
      participants for reviewing their planned goals and recording achieved targets. Successful&#xD;
      experiences and solutions to perceived barriers are entered. Such take-home exercise helps to&#xD;
      extend the participants' practice of hope-based skills into their daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Randomization This study is a randomized controlled trial. On completion of the&#xD;
      baseline assessment and the screening procedure, eligible participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned in equal number into either a brief hope intervention or the control group using&#xD;
      sets of computer-generated random numbers. The research assistant conducting the assessments&#xD;
      will be blinded to the treatment type. However, participants are inevitably aware of the&#xD;
      conditions they have been randomized to. To reduce expectancy effects of the advantages of&#xD;
      the program, the control arm is casted as a social intervention. Figure 1 presented the data&#xD;
      collection using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, which will be done before&#xD;
      the commencement of the intervention (Time1), immediately post-intervention (Time2) and one&#xD;
      month after the completion of program (Time 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Chinese cancer and non-cancer patients in Hong Kong, who have completed the&#xD;
      curative treatment regimen (surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) or not eligible&#xD;
      for the aforementioned treatment, but receiving palliative care will be invited to join the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
