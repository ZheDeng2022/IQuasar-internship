  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the high prevalence of obesity its comorbidities in Brazil and in the world,&#xD;
      different therapeutic measures have been suggested. It is currently known that brown/beige&#xD;
      adipose tissue plays an important role in body weight control and there is strong evidence&#xD;
      that its activity is inversely associated with obesity and metabolic diseases. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown an important role foods and nutrients in the activation of brown/beige adipose&#xD;
      tissue, almost exclusively in animal models. The benefits of monounsaturated fatty acids to&#xD;
      metabolism have been described in several studies, however, the effects of consuming large&#xD;
      amounts of olive oil in the activity of brown/beige adipose tissue in humans have not been&#xD;
      explored. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the consumption of large amounts&#xD;
      of extra virgin olive oil in the activity of brown/beige adipose tissue in lean and obese&#xD;
      humans. This will be a clinical trial with a total duration of 4 weeks. Obese and controls&#xD;
      (normal weight) participants will undergo a dietary intervention for 4 weeks with extra&#xD;
      virgin olive oil. Before and after the intervention period several data will be collected:&#xD;
      dietary intake and physical activity data, evaluation of brown/beige adipose tissue (with&#xD;
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging -&#xD;
      PET/RMI), assessment of body composition (DXA), lipid profile and inflammatory markers as&#xD;
      well as hypothalamic inflammation (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and brown adipose&#xD;
      tissue biopsies in a subsample of 20 participants. The data will be expressed as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation and the variables compared by the Student t test or ANOVA for repeated&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

      1. HYPOTHESIS The effects of fatty acids consumption on brown / beige adipose tissue have&#xD;
           not yet been explored in humans. However, studies that evaluated the effects of&#xD;
           saturated fatty acid replacement by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or&#xD;
           polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on animal and human models have observed an&#xD;
           improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, such as reduction of subclinical&#xD;
           inflammation, improvement of lipid profile and increase in insulin sensitivity. The&#xD;
           mechanisms by which these fatty acids act in the improvement of risk factors have not&#xD;
           been completely clarified and it is possible that there is an association between the&#xD;
           reduction of cardiovascular risk factors and the activation of brown / beige adipose&#xD;
           tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our hypothesis is that consuming extra virgin olive oil in high amounts for one month&#xD;
           will promote increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity of the participants and&#xD;
           improve the cardiovascular risk profile, as assessed by inflammatory markers. It is&#xD;
           possible that the response of lean and obese subjects to dietary intervention is&#xD;
           different and that the behavior of BAT is not equal in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of the consumption of large amounts of extra virgin&#xD;
           olive oil (source of monounsaturated fatty acids) on the activity of brown / beige&#xD;
           adipose tissue in lean and obese humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Specific objectives • To investigate the activity of brown and beige adipose tissue&#xD;
           by FDG PET / RMI, before and after four weeks of intervention with high amount of extra&#xD;
           virgin olive oil; • To evaluate the expression of BAT activity markers: uncoupling&#xD;
           protein 1 (UCP-1), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), Peroxisome proliferator-activated&#xD;
           receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (Dio2) in&#xD;
           mononuclear cells in the whole sample;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate levels of fatty acids in the blood by gas chromatography, before and&#xD;
                after the intervention to evaluate changes in fatty acid intake;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate concentrations of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood&#xD;
                before and after 4 weeks of intervention: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),&#xD;
                interleukin 1-beta (IL1β), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1),&#xD;
                interleukin-6 and interleukin-10);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the effects of interventions on metabolic markers before and after the&#xD;
                intervention: leptin, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol and fractions,&#xD;
                triglycerides;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the effects of the intervention on anthropometry (weight, abdominal&#xD;
                circumference) and on the body composition evaluated by Dual-energy X-ray&#xD;
                absorptiometry (DXA);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the effects of dietary interventions on brain activity (by PET/MRi) in&#xD;
                a subsample of 15 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MATERIALS AND METHODS This will be an open clinical trial lasting for four weeks. The&#xD;
           study consists of two data collections before and after a 4-week dietary intervention in&#xD;
           which participants will be required to consume extra-virgin olive oil provided by the&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The collection of socio demographic, dietary and physical activity data, as well as the&#xD;
           PET / MRI and the blood collections of 50 participants will be carried out at the&#xD;
           Nuclear Medicine Center of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo. Bone&#xD;
           densitometry (DXA) will be performed at the School of Public Health of the University of&#xD;
           São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Selection of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The estimated number of individuals with a detectable brown adipose tissue (50) is 50%,&#xD;
           with the proportion of individuals with detectable brown adipose tissue. It will include&#xD;
           15 obese individuals (degree I obesity) and 35 control subjects (normal weight&#xD;
           individuals). Participants will be selected through print and electronic media.&#xD;
