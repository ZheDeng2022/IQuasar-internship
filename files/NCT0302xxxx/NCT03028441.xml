      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase 1, placebo- controlled, and dose comparison&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and schedule of MV-CHIK. Two dosage levels and 3&#xD;
      immunization schedules will be evaluated. This study will enroll up to 180 healthy subjects&#xD;
      aged 18 to 45 years.Study duration is approximately 22 months. Subject participation duration&#xD;
      is approximately 8-13 months. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of 5 x 10^4 TCID50 and 5 x 10^5 TCID50 MV-CHIK and placebo following two&#xD;
      consecutive intramuscular injections and to assess the CHIKV serum plaque reduction&#xD;
      neutralization test (PRNT50) antibody responses to 5 x 10^4 TCID50, 5 x 10^5 TCID50 of&#xD;
      MV-CHIK or placebo on day 29 following the first dose.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase 1, placebo- controlled, and dose comparison&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and schedule of MV-CHIK. Two dosage levels (5 x&#xD;
      10^4 or 5 x 10^5 TCID50) and 3 immunization schedules (days 1 and 29, days 1 and 85 or days 1&#xD;
      and 169) will be evaluated. The study will have 6 cohorts, each with 30 subjects, 25 of whom&#xD;
      will receive study vaccine and 5 of whom will receive placebo. Cohorts 1-3 will receive the&#xD;
      low dosage of the lyophilized vaccine product (5 x 10^4 TCID50) and cohorts 4-6 will receive&#xD;
      the high dosage (5 x 10^5 TCID50) of the lyophilized vaccine product. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive two study injections using one of the three dosing schedules outlined above. This&#xD;
      study will enroll up to 180 healthy subjects aged 18 to 45 years (inclusive). Subjects will&#xD;
      be counseled on the study and will then sign an informed consent prior to any study&#xD;
      procedures. Screening will be performed which will include evaluation of medical history,&#xD;
      travel history to countries with known CHIKV circulation, medication history, a physical&#xD;
      examination and safety laboratory evaluations. Study duration is approximately 22 months.&#xD;
      Subject participation duration is approximately 8-13 months. The primary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of 5 x 10^4 TCID50 and 5 x 10^5 TCID50 MV-CHIK and&#xD;
      placebo following two consecutive intramuscular injections and to assess the CHIKV serum&#xD;
      plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) antibody responses to 5 x 10^4 TCID50, 5 x 10^5&#xD;
      TCID50 of MV-CHIK or placebo on day 29 following the first dose. The secondary objectives are&#xD;
      to assess the CHIKV serum plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) antibody responses to&#xD;
      5 x 10^4 TCID50, 5 x 10^5 TCID50 MV-CHIK and or placebo using three dose schedules (days 1&#xD;
      and 29, days 1 and 85, or days 1 and 169) on day 29 following the second dose, assess CHIKV&#xD;
      serum PRNT50 antibody responses to 5 x 10^4 TCID50, 5 x 10^5 TCID50 MV-CHIK or placebo on&#xD;
      days 15, 85 and 169 following the second dose of vaccine, assess the CHIKV serum ELISA&#xD;
      antibody responses to 5 x 10^4 TCID50, 5 x 10^5 TCID50 MV-CHIK or placebo on day 29 following&#xD;
      the first dose of vaccine and days 15, 29, 85 and 169 following the second dose of vaccine,&#xD;
      and to assess the durability of CHIKV serum ELISA and PRNT50 antibody responses to 5 x 10^4&#xD;
      TCID50, 5 x 10^5 TCID50 MV-CHIK or placebo on day 85 (Groups 2+5) and day 169 (Groups 3+6)&#xD;
