      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disturbances of the heart's atrioventricular conduction - AV-block - may show by shortness of&#xD;
      breath, fainting or sudden death. If AV-block is diagnosed in time pacemaker therapy may be&#xD;
      lifesaving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AV-block in younger can be seen along with structural or ischemic heart disease, congenital&#xD;
      heart disease (incl. congenital AV-block) storage disorders, specific muscle diseases,&#xD;
      sarcoidosis, Borrelia infection or drug intoxication. AV-block in younger can also be seen in&#xD;
      conditions, primarily localized to the AV-node without other cardiac disease at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This form of AV-block is often hereditary and can be seen in families where relatives have&#xD;
      another types of heart disease in form of fore example, cardiomyopathy, ion channel disease&#xD;
      or sudden death. The different forms of presentation are due to the same gene mutation being&#xD;
      expressed differently within the same family. Thus, early onset of AV-block (&lt;50 years) may&#xD;
      indicate hereditary AV-conduction disorder but it can also be the first manifestation of&#xD;
      severe ion channel disease or cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denmark has annually over 50 individuals &lt;50 years treated with pacemaker due to advanced&#xD;
      AV-block. There have been no overall figures regarding the causes of advanced AV-block, and&#xD;
      therefore no systematic approach to diagnosing this group of patients. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      prevalence of individuals with a genetic cause of AV-block is unknown and presumably an often&#xD;
      overlooked diagnosis among younger patients with advanced AV-blok. There are no data on&#xD;
      disease progression after diagnosis, and therefore there is no evidence-based knowledge about&#xD;
      how these patients should be followed after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With modern gene technology, a range of new, yet unknown genes with potentially pathogenic&#xD;
      mutations is likely to be identified. Identification of such genes, and the development of a&#xD;
      strategy for systematic approach to diagnose younger patients with AV-block, will enable&#xD;
      presymptomatic genetic screening of relatives and implementation of evidence-based,&#xD;
      preventive treatment with pacemaker and/or medical treatment for heart failure based on a&#xD;
      specific genetic predisposition for development of AV-block with or without heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a significant proportion of younger patients with advanced AV-block the underlying cause&#xD;
      is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the prevalence and causes of advanced AV-block in younger patients in Denmark&#xD;
      and describe the current diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cross sectional study. The patients for this study are identified from Danish&#xD;
      Pacemaker and ICD Register. The investigators will review medical records and obtain clinical&#xD;
      information and test results (see detailed description).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first part of a large study of AV-block in younger patients in Denmark. The&#xD;
      overall goal, is to increase knowledge about the causes of and disease progression after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of advanced AV-block in young patients which could lead to a significant&#xD;
      improvement in the treatment of this patient group and may lead to a customized choice of&#xD;
      pacemaker type in the future and perhaps additional medical treatment in this patient group.&#xD;
      This could potentially lead to a reduction in both their morbidity mortality.&#xD;
