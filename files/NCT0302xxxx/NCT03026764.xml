      This study is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial comparing standard inpatient total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty with same day discharge. Patients who are medically well and have a good support&#xD;
      structure at home will be randomized to inpatient or same day discharge. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare patient costs from the perspective of the Ministry of Health, the institution,&#xD;
      society and the patient. The investigators will also record complications, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, functional ability and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is currently one of the most successful procedures in&#xD;
      orthopaedics. Over the last 40 years, postoperative care has significantly evolved.&#xD;
      Initially, the standard procedure following THA was that patients were required to stay in&#xD;
      the hospital to recover for 2.5 to 3 weeks. However, with the implementation of less invasive&#xD;
      techniques, coupled with early weight bearing and more comprehensive postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocols, inpatient stays have drastically decreased on average to 2 to 3&#xD;
      days. A new, minimally invasive surgical (MIS) technique has led to an even larger decrease&#xD;
      in hospital stays, culminating in a same day discharge. The possibility of early&#xD;
      mobilization, combined with an increasing push from patients to accelerate recovery and&#xD;
      return to activities, have led to the implementation of outpatient THA in select patients.&#xD;
      For same day discharge to succeed, extensive preoperative and perioperative care must&#xD;
      accompany the procedure. Furthermore, more aggressive rehabilitation and improved pain&#xD;
      control is crucial for successful outpatient THA. For younger patients that need to return to&#xD;
      work as early as possible, a quicker recovery time is essential. Perfecting outpatient THA is&#xD;
      a crucial step towards achieving these requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 major components to a successful THA: pain relief, functional recovery, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and durable reconstruction. Outpatient THA is a fairly new concept in&#xD;
      arthroplasty, and patient satisfaction has not been properly assessed following this new THA&#xD;
      protocol. Satisfaction in accordance with THA refers to a patient achieving their functional&#xD;
      and pain expectations. A similar study evaluating patient satisfaction of a randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) of inpatient versus outpatient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      reconstructions reported that outpatient satisfaction following surgery is higher than&#xD;
      inpatient satisfaction. Although this is a different procedure, it would seem outpatient ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction and outpatient THA has similar pain levels, safety and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      The goal with outpatient surgery with regards to satisfaction is providing patients with&#xD;
      relief of their anxiety, while allowing them earlier control of their independence. Potential&#xD;
      advantages of outpatient surgery include that patients are permitted to recover in a secure,&#xD;
      private and comfortable home environment, while surgeons will improve efficiency and time&#xD;
      management with the decreased responsibilities of having to visit their inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the potential satisfaction benefit, outpatient THA is a potential source of&#xD;
      cost savings for both the patient and the hospital. Numerous efforts by hospitals have been&#xD;
      made to decrease costs and increase available beds for additional patients. A previous study&#xD;
      investigating the financial effects of outpatient THA found that the average hospital bill&#xD;
      for outpatients was $4000 less than for the inpatients. Including preoperative physical&#xD;
      therapy and home healthcare, the total charges for outpatients was $2500 less than&#xD;
      inpatients. A similar study demonstrated that select individuals can successfully undergo THA&#xD;
      in an outpatient setting with no increase in complications, while also receiving a&#xD;
      substantial savings to the patient and the healthcare system. By reducing costs and&#xD;
      increasing healthcare staff availability, hospitals can allocate more money to areas in need&#xD;
      of funding, while wait times can drastically reduce for future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important part of preoperative care for a successful outpatient THA is giving the&#xD;
      patient appropriate goals and expectations. Patients should be educated by the&#xD;
      anaesthesiology team, the physical and occupational therapist, the surgeon, the nurses, and&#xD;
      anyone else involved in the surgery. Patients are required to attend classes explaining the&#xD;
      various aspects of the operative experience, as well as discharge goals and techniques for&#xD;
      postoperative home rehabilitation. Furthermore, functional and symptomatic goals need to be&#xD;
      clearly defined. In these educational sessions, pain management strategies are one of the&#xD;
      main focuses. To have a successful same day discharge, patients must be well versed in pain&#xD;
      management and proper rehabilitation strategies. Before the preoperative class, all patients&#xD;
      are instructed to practice certain skills, such as bed transfer, cane/crutches use and gait&#xD;
      training. Potential complications are discussed so that the patient is reassured with what is&#xD;
      normally supposed to happen following surgery. The goal of preoperative care is that the&#xD;
      patient has a defined set of goals and expectations for their surgery, medications, and&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outpatient THA surgery, it is preferred to perform the surgery in the morning to&#xD;
      facilitate same day discharge. Immediately following surgery, the primary goals are to treat&#xD;
      pain, nausea and hypovolemia. Prior to symptoms arriving, these issues have to be dealt with&#xD;
      using the proper fluids and medications. Physical therapy is usually initiated 3 to 4 hours&#xD;
      following surgery. The combination of this early rehabilitation program, combined with the&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgical technique is vital to the rapid recovery process. Home physical&#xD;
      therapy should begin immediately, with a focus on ambulation. The patient is then asked for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit within 1 week of the surgery to make sure all of the patient's goals have&#xD;
      been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary concern with outpatient THA is safety of the patient. There are also concerns&#xD;
      including emergency room readmissions in patients who have difficulty once home in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period. Furthermore, some patients will require transfer to an&#xD;
      inpatient facility when they are experiencing a delayed recovery after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecdotal data was collected prior to the start of this research project. Since there was a&#xD;
      clinical practice change, informal conversations with outpatient THA demonstrated that 10/11&#xD;
      patients would have outpatient surgery again, and 9/11 would recommend outpatient THA surgery&#xD;
      to others. These encouraging findings are an important justification for performing the&#xD;
      present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although previous THA outpatient studies have demonstrated successful results, it is&#xD;
      imperative to complete a RCT to diminish any bias associated with these findings. In the&#xD;
      absence of high quality comparative evidence, the success in same day discharge THA may be a&#xD;
      result of selection bias, since previous research is largely driven by observational studies&#xD;
      of highly selected populations. This would severely decrease the generalizability of previous&#xD;
      studies. To our knowledge, this will be the first level one study that will investigate the&#xD;
      cost, early complications and patient satisfaction associated with outpatient THA in a&#xD;
      pragmatic selection of patients. This study will answer important questions on how to best&#xD;
      treat patients undergoing THA, and whether an earlier discharge following surgery affects&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective analysis of over 50,000 THA and TKA procedures found no differences in 30-day&#xD;
      major complications or readmissions among patients with a zero to two-day hospital stay&#xD;
      compared to those discharged on day three or four postoperative. The rate of serious adverse&#xD;
      events in the inpatient group is expected to be greater than five percent. To define a&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin we agreed that no more than a five percent increase in the risk of&#xD;
      serious adverse event (RD ≥ 6% favoring inpatient care) was acceptable. If the risk in the&#xD;
      inpatient group ranges between five to eight percent and there is truly no difference in risk&#xD;
      of serious adverse event between the groups, then a maximum of 506 patients are required to&#xD;
      be 80% certain that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval will exclude a&#xD;
      difference in favour of the inpatient group of more than six percent. Given that the primary&#xD;
      outcome is being measured at 3-months postoperative, we anticipate a low lost-to-follow-up&#xD;
      rate. Previous studies conducted at the study site in similar patients demonstrate loss to&#xD;
      follow up rates less than one percent for the first 3 months. Therefore, to account for a&#xD;
      potential one percent dropout rate we inflated our sample size to 511.&#xD;
