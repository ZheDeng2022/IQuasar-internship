  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and carboplatin work in treating&#xD;
      patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving pembrolizumab and carboplatin with platinum resistant chemotherapy may work&#xD;
      better than platinum chemotherapy alone in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical response rate of platinum chemotherapy and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475) in platinum chemotherapy pretreated ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary&#xD;
      peritoneal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine whether retreatment with platinum chemotherapy in platinum resistant ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers improves progression free survival by&#xD;
      concurrent administration of MK-3475.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of concurrent administration of MK-3475 with&#xD;
      platinum chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube,&#xD;
      and primary peritoneal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the relationship between PD-L1 expression and response to the combination of&#xD;
      MK-3475 and platinum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the overall survival of patients treated with the combination of MK-3475 and&#xD;
      platinum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore whether treatment with MK-3475 and platinum alters soluble factors in sera,&#xD;
      peripheral immune responses and immune cell profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and carboplatin IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 8 and 15. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
