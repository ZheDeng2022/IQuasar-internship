  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) has been classically regarded as a &quot;movement disorder&quot;, so earlier&#xD;
      work has focused on treating motor symptoms only. As PD patients now have longer life&#xD;
      expectancy, the relatively slowly progressing cognitive deficits (compared to their motor&#xD;
      deficits) have become one of the major challenges. Approximately 80% of PD patients&#xD;
      eventually become demented. Therefore cognitive dysfunction is one of the most significant&#xD;
      factors affecting the quality of life of patients with PD. While dementia in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease is routinely treated by cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil and rivastigmine),&#xD;
      their efficacy on mild cognitive impairment found in non-demented PD is questionable.&#xD;
      Alternative approaches have been proposed including transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) but no consensus has been reached. This can be attributed mainly to: (1) imprecise&#xD;
      knowledge of the underlying functional circuitry mediating this disease manifestation and (2)&#xD;
      inter-individual variability. Here, the investigators will utilize a novel personalized&#xD;
      network analysis approach to elucidate on the underlying mechanisms of the effect of tDCS on&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction in non-demented PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been well documented that the caudate nucleus plays an important role in cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction found in PD. In the investigators' preliminary resting-state functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) study, they have shown that the connectivity of the right caudate&#xD;
      nucleus is correlated to cognitive status of PD patients measured by the Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MoCA). The investigators hypothesize that tDCS on the left and/or right&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may restore the functional connectivity of the right caudate&#xD;
      nucleus which may in turn improve patients' cognitive performance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet diagnostic criteria for idiopathic Parkinson's disease, defined as&#xD;
             the presence of two or more of the cardinal clinical features of PD in the absence of&#xD;
             known causes of parkinsonism such as encephalitis or neuroleptic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; DSM-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 40&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients' cognitive statuses will be evaluated by the participating neuropsychiatrist&#xD;
             or a trained psychiatry or neurology resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with dementia (defined as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 18)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Atypical parkinsonian features including myoclonus, apraxia, oculomotor abnormalities,&#xD;
             ataxia, sensory loss, or pyramidal signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  metal implants or a cardiac pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women (female subjects of child bearing potential will be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  severe dyskinesia that may interfere with the quality of the scan (e.g., dyskinesia&#xD;
             involving head movement).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of seizure, stroke, moderate to severe head injury, high&#xD;
             intracranial pressure, severe headaches, or presence of other neurologic disease that&#xD;
             may be associated with an altered seizure threshold; or concurrent medication use,&#xD;
             such as tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptic medications, or other drugs that are&#xD;
             known to lower seizure threshold&#xD;
