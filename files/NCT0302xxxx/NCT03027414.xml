      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to better understand brain processes related to fear and anxiety. They want&#xD;
      to find out if transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a type of brain stimulation, can&#xD;
      reduce anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see how TMS affects fear and anxiety through memory and attention tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-50 who are right-handed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened through another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the pilot study will have 1 visit. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires about mood and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shock and startle workup: Electrodes are taped to the wrists or fingers. Participants will be&#xD;
      shocked to find out what level of shock is uncomfortable but tolerable. They will hear loud,&#xD;
      sudden noises through headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS: A coil is held on the scalp. A magnetic field stimulates the brain. Sometimes they might&#xD;
      receive fake TMS. This feels the same as real TMS. They will perform simple tasks.&#xD;
      Participants in the main study will have 2 visits within 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires about mood and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Participants lie on a table that slides into a scanner. They will be in the scanner&#xD;
      about 1 hour. A computer screen in the scanner will tell them to perform simple tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shock and startle workup&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS&#xD;

      Objective: To determine the effect of non-invasive brain stimulation on anxiety and&#xD;
      anxiety-cognition interactions in healthy subjects. Toward this aim we will test the effect&#xD;
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on two outcome measures: 1) Fear and anxiety&#xD;
      during the threat of predictable and unpredictable shock (NPU threat test), and 2) Working&#xD;
      memory (WM) related anxiety downregulation while performing the Sternberg WM task under&#xD;
      threat of shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of up to 184 healthy volunteers between&#xD;
      the ages of 18-50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will consists of two (sub-studies 1 and 2) or three (sub-study 3)&#xD;
      outpatient visits (1 MRI, 1 or 2 TMS visits [2 for sub-study 3]). In this protocol we will&#xD;
      explore the effect of TMS in three sub-studies in the TMS study visit. The sub-studies will&#xD;
      contain either the NPU or the Sternberg task during the TMS visits. The first visit (MRI)&#xD;
      will consist of the same procedures for all sub-studies. Each subject will be assigned to&#xD;
      only one of the sub-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sternberg Task: Expose subjects to active or sham TMS to a region of the frontoparietal&#xD;
      attention network during the Sternberg WM task. Subjects will have to maintain a series of&#xD;
      letters in WM for a brief interval during blocks of safety and threat of shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPU Task: Expose subjects to active or sham TMS to a region of the frontoparietal attention&#xD;
      network during the NPU threat test. Subjects will be exposed to blocks in which they are&#xD;
      either 1) safe from shock (neutral), 2) at risk of shock delivered only during a cue&#xD;
      (predictable), or 3) at risk of shock presented randomly (unpredictable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: In both studies the primary outcome measure will be anxiety-potentiated&#xD;
      startle (APS), which is the increase in startle magnitude during periods of threat compared&#xD;
      to periods of safety. We expect active, but not sham TMS to increase activity in the dlPFC,&#xD;
      and therefore reduce APS in both studies&#xD;
