  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is the most common headache disorder, prevalent in 18% of females and 6% of males.&#xD;
      Emergency room visits, physician consults, hospitalizations, medications, and indirect costs&#xD;
      such as lost work days and decreased productivity place the global economic burden of&#xD;
      migraines at over 20 billion dollars. It is prevalent in 28 million people in the US alone.&#xD;
      Symptoms include unilateral, throbbing, debilitating headache pain accompanied by nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Upwards of 75% of migraine patients have reduced&#xD;
      functionability, have lost time at work, and 1/3 of patients require bed rest to manage the&#xD;
      symptoms. The health-related impact on quality of life was comparable with that experienced&#xD;
      by patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the burden of migraines on our society is clear, the pathophysiology of migraines&#xD;
      remains largely unknown. The trigeminovascular system, including the external and internal&#xD;
      carotid arteries and their associated sensory fibers which subserve the head have long been&#xD;
      implicated in the pain and cutaneous allodynia experienced by migraine patients. Wolff in&#xD;
      1953, was the first to posit that migraine headache pain is the caused by dilation or&#xD;
      circumferential expansion of the extracranial carotid artery. He demonstrated that&#xD;
      migraineurs had twice the pulse amplitude in their external carotid arteries compared to&#xD;
      control subjects and these changes were directly correlated to migraine symptoms. In a 2008&#xD;
      study, randomized migraineurs received nitroglycerin via peripheral IV or placebo for 20&#xD;
      minutes prior to obtaining magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Nitroglycerin, a potent&#xD;
      dilator of blood vessels, reliably induced migraine-like pain in up to 80% of patients, and&#xD;
      transient dilation of vessels of up to nearly 40%, mostly in the extracranial vessels.&#xD;
      Sumatriptan's efficacy in migraine relief provides further evidence for this theory, as it is&#xD;
      a selective extracranial vessel constrictor which does not cross the blood brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this current work is to utilize the direct, real-time angiography, which provides&#xD;
      a high resolution map of vasculature, and demonstrate changes in vessel flow in patients who&#xD;
      have migraine headache attacks. This information may guide therapeutic interventions in the&#xD;
      future in order to better treat these migraine patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the current study will be to demonstrate time-linked headache pain after&#xD;
      super-selectively administration of vasodilatory medications to external carotid artery&#xD;
      branches, and then observe vessel changes and presumed headache relief with transient&#xD;
      occlusion of the same vessel. This work will be the first study to attempt to correlate the&#xD;
      onset of headache pain with selective vessel dilation as seen on angiography, which has&#xD;
      spatial and temporal resolution far superior to MRA imaging. It will also test the effect of&#xD;
      transient vessel occlusion in this setting for possible relief of symptoms. This novel&#xD;
      approach to migraine evaluation could advance the understanding of the disorder and steer&#xD;
      future research towards more effective management of migraine pain. Only patients who have&#xD;
      failed all medical and non-invasive therapies will be considered for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated by history and physical during a clinic visit for their migraines&#xD;
      and the 'pre-angiography' screening will be performed at that time. A thorough history of&#xD;
      their migraine symptomatology, if they agree to participate, will be obtained via&#xD;
      questionnaire, including: severity, location, quality, alleviating and exacerbating symptoms,&#xD;
      medications used, associated symptoms, frequency, and degree of debilitation. This&#xD;
      information will be collected regarding their migraines uniquely for this study. The patients&#xD;
      will also be given a headache log with each one of these measures as a column with space in&#xD;
      each row to describe individual migraine episodes between their first clinic visit and their&#xD;
      angiogram date. After this clinic visit, they will be scheduled for angiography between 2 and&#xD;
      4 weeks for the evaluation of their migraines. Their headache logs will be collected prior to&#xD;
      their procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main portion of this study will occur during a single angiography session and the&#xD;
      following 5 hours post-procedure period during which the patient will be monitored closely as&#xD;
      part of standard post-angiogram care. An anesthesiologist will be present throughout the&#xD;
      procedure and available for medication review and administration as needed. The patients will&#xD;
      sign a consent form at the start of the day and will be reminded that they have the option of&#xD;
      not participating in the study and continuing their normal migraine treatment. If they do&#xD;
      choose to participate, the patients will be brought to the angiography suite and transferred&#xD;
      to the angiogram table. The patient will be prepped and draped in standard fashion for an&#xD;
      angiogram and given instructions regarding the procedure for the day. The patient will&#xD;
      receive local lidocaine at their groin site to minimize discomfort during standard arterial&#xD;
      access for the purposes of the angiogram. Catheterization will commence into the external&#xD;
      carotid artery. At this time, the patient's headache history will guide the decision for&#xD;
      first vessel cannulation. If the patient has frontal migraines, the internal maxillary artery&#xD;
      will be cannulated, for parietal headaches the focus will be on the superficial temporal&#xD;
      artery, and the occipital artery for posterior, occipitally located symptoms, all on the side&#xD;
      of the patient's migraines. A microcatheter will be placed at the origin of each respective&#xD;
      artery and a control contrast injection will be performed to determine baseline vessel&#xD;
      caliber and blood flow. Patients will be asked at this time if they are experiencing any pain&#xD;
      or discomfort. If none, nitroglycerin will be drawn up and injected at a volume of 200Âµg&#xD;
      diluted in 10ml saline into these vessels only. This is a standard injection dose for&#xD;
      vasodilation for this medication and it is routinely available and used to treat vasospasm,&#xD;
      or vasoconstriction that occurs after subarachnoid hemorrhage in the angiography suite. This&#xD;
      dose has also been used in several cranial and cardiac studies and has not been association&#xD;
      with adverse reactions related to systemic spread. The expectation is that this small dose&#xD;
      will not reach systemic circulation. After 5 minutes, another contrast run will be performed&#xD;
      to determine any change in vessel size and the patient will be questioned about any headache&#xD;
      symptoms. After another 5 minutes, another contrast run will be performed to see if the&#xD;
      nitroglycerin is still effective. If the patient describes no symptoms, the focus will be&#xD;
      shifted to one of the other 2 external carotid artery branches to test them for the induction&#xD;
      of headaches using the same nitroglycerin protocol. Each vessel will be evaluated for a full&#xD;
      10 minutes and if no vessel causes headache pain, the study will be terminated after a final&#xD;
      control injection and femoral sheath removal. Pressure on the groin will be held for 20&#xD;
      minutes and the patient will be taken to the recovery room and monitored lying flat, as in&#xD;
      standard fashion for 5 hours before being discharged home in order to prevent groin hematoma.&#xD;
      They will again be evaluated for headaches or pain hourly until discharge, and be given&#xD;
      another headache log to complete prior to their 2 week follow-up visit. The headache log will&#xD;
      be collected at that time and this will complete the study for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any vessel immediately, or with time produces headache pain, the patient will be queried&#xD;
      regarding the type and quality of the headache, and asked if it is similar to their&#xD;
      migraines. A 10 minute angiogram will be repeated at the vessel evaluated. With persistent&#xD;
      headaches, a microballoon will be brought to the vessel origin, and it will be inflated to&#xD;
      block flow in this vessel for 5 minutes before being deflated. As stated previously, there is&#xD;
      no risk to occlusion of these vessels permanently, and certainly not temporarily as will be&#xD;
      performed as part of this protocol. These non-critical vessels have dense anastomotic&#xD;
      networks and are safe to occlude. Symptoms will be evaluated to see if any subside as a&#xD;
      result of their occlusion. Five minutes after the balloon is deflated, another contrast run&#xD;
      will be performed to evaluate the caliber of the studied vessel. After this run, the groin&#xD;
      sheath will be removed and the above protocol will be followed until outpatient follow-up. If&#xD;
      headache symptoms do not subside, the patient will be administered standard pain medication,&#xD;
      fentanyl, which is given routinely during angiography at a dose of 25mcg to abate their pain.&#xD;
      This is a low, tolerable, and safe dose that will be given with the assistance of our&#xD;
      anesthesia colleagues, if necessary. Their headache pain will be closely monitored during the&#xD;
      5 hour recovery period, and given 1 more 25mcg dose during this period in order to fully&#xD;
      subside any pain the patient still may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This angiogram will take approximately 30 minutes to complete, and it is a low risk&#xD;
      procedure.. The vessels studied diagnostically will be solely extracranial and completely&#xD;
      separate from intracranial vessels. Any anomalous communication identified between&#xD;
      extracranial and intracranial vessels will automatically disqualify a patient from&#xD;
      participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite some minor discomfort from the groin puncture for the patient, with the assistance of&#xD;
      an anesthesiologist the pain intra- and post-procedurally experienced by patients will be&#xD;
      well controlled. The patient may also opt to receive the rescue pain medication at any time&#xD;
      during the angiogram and discontinue the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated previously, the extracranial vascular circulation has a large anastomotic network&#xD;
      such that a single vessel sacrifice can be performed without great risk. These vessels are&#xD;
      sacrificed without sequelae intraoperatively routinely when performing craniotomies. In cases&#xD;
      where a provocative artery can be found, occlusion of that vessel can lead to improved&#xD;
      symptoms, as tested by temporary balloon occlusion without great risk. It is the hope that&#xD;
      this pilot work to guide future interventions to control blood flow in these offending&#xD;
      vessels, to see if migraines abate permanently with vessel removal from circulation. If these&#xD;
      hypotheses are correct, interventions may be created to minimize patient's need for&#xD;
      medication, improve their quality of life, and free them from the debilitation of their&#xD;
      migraines.&#xD;
