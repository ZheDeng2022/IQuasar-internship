    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS was calculated as the sum of the following:&#xD;
0.121 × Back pain (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Question 2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Question 6 result) 0.110 × Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGADA) 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm (C-Reactive Protein (CRP) [mg/L] + 1)) Back pain, PtGADA, duration of morning stiffness, and peripheral pain/swelling are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units).&#xD;
The change from Baseline is calculated, a negative value indicating improvement and a positive value worsening.&#xD;
There is a minimum score of 0.636 for the total ASDAS score, but no defined upper score. Based on the formula even in the situation that the CRP is normal, any value below 4 is recorded as 'below the limit of quantification' (BLQ) and a value of BLQ/2=2 was prespecified. This assumption is triggering the lowest possible value of 0.636.</description>

    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of 6 horizontal Numeric Rating Scales (NRSs), each with 10 units to measure the severity of the 5 major symptoms: fatigue, spinal pain, peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. To give each symptom equal weighting, the average of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 50 sum score is divided by 5 to give a final BASDAI score between 0 and 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.&#xD;

    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of six 10-unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration for each disease activity, respectively) over the last week. The mean of the 2 BASDAI questions related to morning stiffness (questions 5 and 6) ranged from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.&#xD;
The change from Baseline is calculated, a negative value indicating improvement and a positive value worsening.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The ASDAS was calculated as the sum of the following:&#xD;
0.121 × Back pain (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Question 2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Question 6 result) 0.110 × Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGADA) 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm (C-Reactive Protein (CRP) [mg/L] + 1)) Back pain, PtGADA, duration of morning stiffness, and peripheral pain/swelling are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units).&#xD;
The change from Baseline is calculated, a negative value indicating improvement and a positive value worsening.&#xD;
There is a minimum score of 0.636 for the total ASDAS score, but no defined upper score. Based on the formula even in the situation that the CRP is normal, any value below 4 is recorded as 'below the limit of quantification' (BLQ) and a value of BLQ/2=2 was prespecified. This assumption is triggering the lowest possible value of 0.636.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of 6 horizontal Numeric Rating Scales (NRSs), each with 10 units to measure the severity of the 5 major symptoms: fatigue, spinal pain, peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. To give each symptom equal weighting, the average of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 50 sum score is divided by 5 to give a final BASDAI score between 0 and 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.&#xD;

        <description>The following 44 joints were to be examined for swelling and tenderness by the Investigator, another delegated physician, or an appropriately qualified medical professional:&#xD;
Upper body (4) - bilateral sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints&#xD;

Lower extremity (14) - bilateral knees, ankles, and metatarsophalangeals (I, II, III, IV, and V) The change from Baseline is calculated, a negative value indicating improvement and a positive value worsening.</description>

        <description>For the PtGADA questionnaire, participants scored their global assessment of their disease activity in response to the question &quot;How active was your spondylitis on average during the last week?&quot; using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) where 0 was &quot;not active&quot; and 10 was &quot;very active&quot;.&#xD;
Total score ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.&#xD;
The change from Baseline is calculated, a negative value indicating improvement and a positive value worsening.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 96 in Inflammation Assessed by the Mean of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Questions 5 and 6 Concerning Morning Stiffness and Duration</title>
          <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of six 10-unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration for each disease activity, respectively) over the last week. The mean of the 2 BASDAI questions related to morning stiffness (questions 5 and 6) ranged from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.&#xD;
The change from Baseline is calculated, a negative value indicating improvement and a positive value worsening.</description>
          <population>The Safety Set consisted of all study participants in the Enrolled Set who had received at least 1 dose of IMP.&#xD;
Number of participants analyzed reflect those with a non-missing BASDAI at Week 96.</population>
