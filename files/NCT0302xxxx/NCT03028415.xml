    <description>Functional improvement was assessed using the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activities of Daily Living (FAAM-ADL) subscale, a subject self-assessment questionnaire that consists of 21 items pertaining to basic functional activities. Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale anchored by 4 (no difficulty at all) and 0 (unable to do). The total item subscale score ranges from 0 to 84, which are transformed to a scale of 0 to 100 as the final score. Higher scores represent a higher level of function, with 100 representing no dysfunction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, and at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey includes 12 questions from the SF-36 Health Survey. These include: 2 questions concerning physical functioning; 2 questions on role limitations because of physical health problems; 1 question on bodily pain; 1 question on general health perceptions; 1 question on vitality (energy/fatigue); 1 question on social functioning; 2 questions on role limitations because of emotional problems; and 2 questions on general mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). These eight domain scales were used to derive Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. All scores were calculated through scoring software. Domain scales and component summary scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score considered better.</description>

        <description>The Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey includes 12 questions from the SF-36 Health Survey. These include: 2 questions concerning physical functioning; 2 questions on role limitations because of physical health problems; 1 question on bodily pain; 1 question on general health perceptions; 1 question on vitality (energy/fatigue); 1 question on social functioning; 2 questions on role limitations because of emotional problems; and 2 questions on general mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). These eight domain scales were used to derive Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. All scores were calculated through scoring software. Domain scales and component summary scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score considered better.</description>

        <population>The mITT analysis set comprised all randomized subjects who had an attempted fusion of the index joint(s). Subjects were analyzed according to randomized (planned) treatment.</population>
