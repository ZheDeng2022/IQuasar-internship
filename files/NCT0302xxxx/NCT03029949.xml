      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of group acceptance and commitment&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether group acceptance and commitment therapy&#xD;
      combined with vestibular rehabilitation in addition to clinical management for patients with&#xD;
      persistent postural-perceptual dizziness is more effective than treatment-as-usual(TAU),&#xD;
      which is self-treatment vestibular rehabilitation in addition to clinical management.&#xD;
