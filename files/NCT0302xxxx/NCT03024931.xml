  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe burn patients are some of the most challenging critically ill patients with an extreme&#xD;
      and continuous state of physiological stress. Patients tends to stay for a long period of&#xD;
      time in intensive care unit to treat burns as well as dealing with complications that arises&#xD;
      from the initial burns injury. Severe burns patients are notoriously known to loose weight.&#xD;
      The word 'catabolism' is used medically. This theory of catabolism after a trauma was&#xD;
      hypothesised in 1942 by Professor Curthberston and based on animal models. Since this date,&#xD;
      despite medical technological advancement, there has been no research that confirms Professor&#xD;
      Curthberston's theory. Investigators still do not know the exact mechanism by which the body&#xD;
      changes from conserving energy to becoming catabolic. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether&#xD;
      this change in catabolism is necessary to heal from burns injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This theoretical catabolism in burns patients is currently treated with nutritional&#xD;
      supplement, use of medications including beta-blockers (suppresses heart rate and decreases&#xD;
      blood pressure) and oxandrolone (formula which is similar to testosterone to build up&#xD;
      muscles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are evidences to suggest that increase in weight loss worsens the outcome in burns&#xD;
      injury. Both overfeeding or underfeeding patients can be detrimental. In this research, the&#xD;
      exact changes in metabolic rate will be measured in the first 72 hours of the study using a&#xD;
      calorimetry machine. In addition to the metabolic rate, the response to the heart, liver,&#xD;
      kidneys and hormonal levels will be measured. By looking into these dynamic changes the&#xD;
      investigator will be able to elucidate whether there is a real increase in metabolic rate. If&#xD;
      there is, the investigator would also be able to tell the response of different organs and&#xD;
      whether there are any hormones that could be responsible to inflicting the metabolic changes.&#xD;

      1. Purpose of the study The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
           acute physiological and metabolic changes in severe burns injury. Unless clinicians&#xD;
           understand the physiological effect in burns patients, clinicians are unable to develop&#xD;
           new therapeutic interventions to halt the hyper metabolic changes in burns patient. This&#xD;
           research will be looking into the acute resting basal metabolic changes in severe adult&#xD;
           burns patients by using Quark RMR (indirect calorimetry). This equipment will allow the&#xD;
           investigator to detect the metabolic switch in severe burns patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to the metabolic changes, 'Estimated cardiac output monitor' will be placed&#xD;
           in conjunction with calculating the Fick principle. Heart rate and pulse oximeter will&#xD;
           be monitored continuously. These adjuncts will allow the investigator to conclude&#xD;
           whether hyper-metabolism is associated with hyper dynamic cardiovascular response to&#xD;
           burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Splanchnic circulation will be monitored using the LiMON indocyanine green test and&#xD;
           intermittent intra-abdominal pressure will be monitored to assess whether there is a&#xD;
           link between the metabolic rate and splanchnic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Identifying the 'Ebb' phase and 'Flow' phase in acute burns injury&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To establish cardiovascular response to burns in the acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. To establish cardiovascular response to hyper-catabolism, using ESCO (estimated cardiac&#xD;
      output) 2. To asses the relationship between the splanchnic circulation and hyper-catabolism&#xD;
      3. To assess the feasibility of performing LiMON test and (Bispectral Index) BIS monitoring&#xD;
      for future (Burns Intensive Care Unit) BICU patients 4. To optimize dietary recommendations&#xD;
      for patients who are suffering from hyper-catabolic state&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Study Design Summary: This is a prospective, observational study with intensive monitoring&#xD;
      but no experimental intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Study Site and Duration: This study will be conducted on the adult Burns Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (BICU), Chelsea and Westminster Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom (UK). This is a&#xD;
      tertiary referral hospital serving an area of North West London. The average annual admission&#xD;
      for severe burns to BICU varies form 10 -15 patients. The study will be conducted from&#xD;
      December 2015 to December 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BICU has facilities for ventilatory support, sedation and surgery of critically ill&#xD;
      patients, with two-bed intensive care unit. Each bed is isolated with three senior trained&#xD;
      intensive care nurses covering 24 hours. Critically ill burns participants will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously by nurses and doctors with the use of non-invasive and invasive monitoring&#xD;
      depending on their clinical needs as per standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f) Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      General History and Examination Upon enrolment, full history and examination will be&#xD;
      performed, including detailed assessment of the respiratory system, extent and depth of&#xD;
      burns, neurological examination, cardiovascular examination and excluding other potential&#xD;
      trauma that the participants could have suffered from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be recorded on a designated record form. Participants will be re-assessed by&#xD;
      a physician or nurse for the duration of continuous monitoring to independently assess blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, cardiac output, Glasgow coma&#xD;
      scale, sedation score, ventilator requirement, urine output, intra-abdominal pressure,&#xD;
      splanchnic circulation, BIS, EEG, nitrogen balance, resting metabolic rate and temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily follow up will include assessment for any complications of burns including sepsis,&#xD;
      infection, inhalational injury, suspected Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, and suspected&#xD;
      respiratory distress of uncertain aetiology. The decision to obtain imaging or other&#xD;
      investigations to assess such complications will be made by the clinical team and the results&#xD;
      will be archived as source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to above, venous blood sample will be taken to establish on the daily basis to&#xD;
      monitor inflammatory markers, renal, liver, bone marrow function, electrolyte levels. Urinary&#xD;
      nitrogen levels, plasma hormones including Thyroid stimulating hormone, T3, T4, cortisol&#xD;
      levels, insulin, glucagon levels are taken daily. These tests will be completed by the&#xD;
      clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular arterial line gas sample will be taken as guided by the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous monitoring Participants will undergo standard electrophysiological monitoring,&#xD;
      cardiovascular monitoring including arterial line blood pressure monitoring, placement of&#xD;
      estimated cardiac output monitoring and intra-abdominal pressure. These devices will be&#xD;
      connected to a portable diagnostic recording system to aid the diagnosis of any physiological&#xD;
      changes that occurs. The system comprises a central device, with a display screen, battery&#xD;
      pack and memory card. The electrophysiological monitoring device will consists or three&#xD;
      electrodes and wires which feeds into the central device ports. The electrodes will be&#xD;
      attached to the participants' forehead; left central and right. The intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      device consists of a transducer which is located in the urinary catheter. The wires which are&#xD;
      connected to the transducers are then fed into the central device ports. The continuous&#xD;
      estimated cardiac output monitoring devices consist of three cardiac electrodes, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry device and wires, which are connected to the central device ports. The cardiac&#xD;
      electrodes are placed to the participants' thorax and the pulse oximetry device is attached&#xD;
      to the participants' digit either in the foot or hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following sensors will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram: recording cardiac electrical activity to give three recorded and&#xD;
           three derived traces&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilator: recording airflow inhale and exhalation, flow rate, pressure, tidal volume,&#xD;
           peep, type of ventilator mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse oximeter: recording arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate The monitoring&#xD;
           system will be applied to the participant once assent is obtained and after the initial&#xD;
           management; drug administration, examination and other investigation are performed by&#xD;
           the clinical team. The sensors will be applied with the goal of recording continuously&#xD;
           for seventy two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent monitoring Participant will undergo indirect calorimetry monitoring and LIMON&#xD;
      test. Resting metabolic rate will be measured every 12 hourly for 72 hours using indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry with Quark Resting Metabolic Rate (QUARK RMR) (COSMED, Rome, Italy). This device&#xD;
      consist of canopy, ventilator tubing, heat and moisture exchange filter, air sample analyzing&#xD;
      tubes, computer, gas analyzing chamber, calibration gas cylinder, air pump to calibrate the&#xD;
      flow sensor, fuel cell, spirometry and Windows 8.0 computer which has COSMED Quark RMR&#xD;
      software installed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are either ventilated or awake. Ventilated participants will have a gas&#xD;
      analyzing tubing attached to the heat and moisture exchange filter which is fed unto the gas&#xD;
      analyzing chamber. The flow meter is attached at the exhaust port at the back of the&#xD;
      ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement is taken until a steady resting state is achieved. This will normally vary&#xD;
      from two minutes to 20 minutes. The results are automatically recorded onto the Quark RMR&#xD;
      software. In order to achieve steady ventilation with little minimum bias flow the&#xD;
      participants' Bispectral index is maintained between forty and sixty using medications such&#xD;
      as propofol, fentanyl, midazolam or clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver and splanchnic circulation will be measured every 6 hourly using LIMON Liver Function&#xD;
      Monitor (Liver Monitor, PULSION Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) The device consist of&#xD;
      sensor, wires and monitor to display the instructions and results. The sensor is attached to&#xD;
      the participants' earlobe, finger tips in the hand or foot. The indocyanine green dye (ICG)&#xD;
      is injected into a vein. The results will be displayed onto the monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the recording is suboptimal due to loss of sensors or insufficient recording, it will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the above equipments and monitoring system will be cleaned and disinfected according&#xD;
      to the manufacturing advice and microbiology team. The standard operating procedures for the&#xD;
      above equipments are described in the appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cessation of monitoring The recording system, or individual sensors will be removed&#xD;
      immediately if it is required for clinical investigations or interventions. However, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that most investigations and interventions will be able to proceed with the&#xD;
      sensors in place. The device is expected to remain in place during patient re-positioning,&#xD;
      airway management, delivery of oxygen, delivery of oral and IV medication and fluids and most&#xD;
      imaging with the exception of magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIS monitoring will be removed in the event of cardio-respiratory arrest. If study clinician&#xD;
      is not present at the time of cardio-respiratory arrest, the monitor will detach without&#xD;
      difficulty and will not impede or delay resuscitation efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to above data, the investigator be collecting the patients' demographics&#xD;
      including apache II scoring, end organ function including liver function, renal function,&#xD;
      haematological status, ventilator settings, arterial gas, urine output and temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Data Analysis Analysis of recording Data will be exported from the monitoring devices&#xD;
      after each recording and assessed for adequacy and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All frontal lobe electroencephalogram will be analysed. If there is any EEG finding that are&#xD;
      consist with seizures it will be reviewed by neurophysiologist. All resting metabolic rate&#xD;
      will be plotted against the physiological parameters including splanchnic circulation,&#xD;
      temperature and intra-abdominal pressure. The ECG will be reviewed to assess heart rate,&#xD;
      rhythm and conduction. Invasive blood pressure monitoring device will assess the blood&#xD;
      pressure. Estimated cardiac output monitoring will assess the cardiac output and the trend&#xD;
      over the seventy two hours. Fick principle will be used to calculate the cardiac output using&#xD;
      the data (CaO2 and CVO2) obtained from the Quark RMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any stimulus, airway management, changes in the levels of sedation, return from theatres will&#xD;
      be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical Consideration In the view of the complexity of data provided by continuous&#xD;
           monitoring, statistical guidance will be sought at all stages of analysis from the&#xD;
           &quot;Statistician. For the primary end points, the investigator will draw a graph of time&#xD;
           again resting metabolic rate. The precise choice of test will be determined once the&#xD;
           distribution pattern of the data is known. Repeated measure analysis of variance will be&#xD;
           used followed by regression analysis accounted for repeat measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In comparing patient specific outcome measures (mortality, requirement for ventilation,&#xD;
           development of complications such as sepsis), participants will be placed into ranked&#xD;
           groups from most to least difference in trend change in resting metabolic rate and&#xD;
           nonparametric analysis will be used to assess the relationship between mortality or&#xD;
           morbidity and resting metabolic rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample Size Justification Primary determinant is expected number of eligible patients&#xD;
           presenting in the duration of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation was completed for the primary outcome measures. In order to conclude to&#xD;
      show that there is an increase in metabolic rate by 200 kcal per day with a power of 0.8, I&#xD;
      will need 8 patients to be able to conclude that there increase in metabolic rate.&#xD;
