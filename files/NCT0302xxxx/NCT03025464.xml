  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea. The marketplace&#xD;
      currently does not have an affordable, easy-to-use, over-the-counter, home-based OSA&#xD;
      screening device. An affordable, available, FDA-approved and easy-to-use over-the-counter OSA&#xD;
      screening tool would allow greater screening of at-risk individuals, especially in&#xD;
      underserved communities with low socioeconomic status, hopefully encouraging a greater&#xD;
      proportion of such individuals to seek treatment for their condition. Over the past year,&#xD;
      this investigative team has engineered a small screening device (Zerify®) for OSA and&#xD;
      obtained preliminary evidence of its efficacy in a clinical population under a&#xD;
      NIMHD-sponsored Phase I STTR award. Phase I Specific Aims 1 and 2 focused on developing a&#xD;
      small (1.5 x 2.5 x 0.2 inches) semiconductor sensor that could store sound/motion data,&#xD;
      transfer these data to a computer, and detect non-clinical simulated apnea events with a&#xD;
      specificity and specificity exceeding 90%. Phase I Specific Aim 3 established the preliminary&#xD;
      psychometric performance data of the screening device in a clinical sample of 52 patients&#xD;
      (13% African American, 6% Asian, 4% Mixed or Other Race) against gold-standard&#xD;
      polysomnography. Phase II proposal aims to optimize the engineered hardware and associated&#xD;
      OSA algorithms, create a patient companion app and wireless healthcare provider dashboard,&#xD;
      and compare the efficacy of this screening device to the most commonly utilized sleep apnea&#xD;
      screener, the home sleep apnea test (HSAT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An alternative to polysomnography (PSG), which is done overnight in a lab, is home sleep&#xD;
      apnea testing (HSAT). Also known as out-of-center testing, HSAT has emerged as a more&#xD;
      convenient and increasingly widely used method to screen for sleep apnea. HSAT records fewer&#xD;
      signals for assessment, is less cumbersome than traditional PSG, and allows patients to spend&#xD;
      the night at home, eliminating the need for technical staff to be present during testing.&#xD;
      HSAT is considerably less expensive than PSG to perform. Despite its advantages, there are&#xD;
      concerns about false-negatives and underestimation of disease severity with HSAT. There is&#xD;
      clearly a need to improve the accuracy of less costly screening tools for OSA. Zansors®&#xD;
      wireless microsensor is a novel device to screen for sleep apnea, which measures breathing&#xD;
      patterns and movement, and which will collect data and communicate with a smartphone via&#xD;
      Bluetooth. In this study, investigators are comparing the Zansors microsensor to HSAT and PSG&#xD;
      to assess its accuracy. Patients will be asked to wear the device during the clinical HSAT&#xD;
      ordered by their doctor, and again at an in-laboratory sleep study. When patients are being&#xD;
      trained to use the HSAT equipment, research staff will also show them how to put the Zansors®&#xD;
      device on. They will then wear it at home on the night of their HSAT. At a later date, when&#xD;
      they come for the in-laboratory sleep study, the device will again be worn overnight while&#xD;
      they are being assessed by the full PSG equipment. Together in this study, all these device&#xD;
      recordings will help to detect any sleep apnea and researchers will compare the results of&#xD;
      the Zansors ® microsensor with HSAT and PSG equipment. If the Zansors ® device is confirmed&#xD;
      to detect sleep hypopneas and apneas accurately, it can be used easily and inexpensively by&#xD;
      people at home to screen for obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
