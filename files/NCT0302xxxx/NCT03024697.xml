  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study, the investigators are looking to conduct a prospective, randomised,&#xD;
      double-blind, non-inferiority trial, to study single-shot pectoral plane (PECs) blocks versus&#xD;
      continuous local anaesthetic infusion analgesia versus a combination of PECs blocks and local&#xD;
      anaesthetic infusion analgesia, when it comes to providing analgesia for most forms of breast&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast surgery is common, and the optimal form of analgesia is currently unknown. Techniques&#xD;
      involving local anaesthetic, such as pectoral plane (PECs) blocks and infusion pumps, are&#xD;
      growing in popularity, as they reduce the amount of opioid medications used. Opioids are&#xD;
      associated with nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, drowsiness and constipation, and as&#xD;
      such, opioid-sparing analgesic regimens postoperatively are becoming more common. These&#xD;
      regimens will typically involve paracetamol, a NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug),&#xD;
      and a local anaesthetic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pectoral plane blocks involve a once-off injection of local anaesthetic at two locations&#xD;
      within the chest wall, typically done after the patient undergoes general anaesthesia, but&#xD;
      before the commencement of surgery. Local anaesthetic infusion pumps involve the insertion of&#xD;
      a catheter into the wound at the end of surgery, before the patient emerges from general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, that constantly emit local anaesthetic over a defined period of time. Each&#xD;
      technique is considered extremely safe, and is considered acceptable as a form of pain relief&#xD;
      in patients undergoing breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no published works comparing pectoral plane blocks with local anaesthetic infusion&#xD;
      pump analgesia, and the investigators see a gap in the knowledge base that can be addressed.&#xD;
      This study will allow efficacy, safety and cost of the three techniques to be compared. The&#xD;
      investigators feel the study design is robust, and statistical analysis based on previously&#xD;
      published works in the area of postoperative analgesia has allowed the study to be powered&#xD;
      appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing breast surgery are a vulnerable group, and this is recognised via the&#xD;
      provision of a comprehensive Patient Information Leaflet and a commitment to respecting the&#xD;
      process of Informed Consent. The investigators also recognise this is a stressful period in a&#xD;
      woman's life, and the study will be conducted in a sensitive and compassionate manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed to be prospective, randomised, and double-blinded. The&#xD;
      anaesthetic will be standardised in relation to analgesic and anti-emetic agents&#xD;
      administered, in order to minimise variables. Chronic post-surgical pain is a growing area of&#xD;
      research, and the follow-up telephone interview at 3-months will allow investigation of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Record Form will be utilised for data collection, which will subsequently be analysed&#xD;
      statistically. Data will be handled sensitively, securely, and by the minimum number of&#xD;
      researchers. A plan is in place for destruction of data at an appropriate time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there will be no direct benefit to participants, including monetary considerations,&#xD;
      this research study will add to the knowledge-base surrounding analgesia for breast surgery.&#xD;

      Methods The Mater Misericordiae University Hospital's Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
      approved this study; reference number 1/378/1840, dated December 21st, 2016. It was&#xD;
      registered with clinicaltrials.gov; reference number NCT03024697, dated February 15th, 2017.&#xD;
      Forty-five ASA I-III female patients aged 18 years or older, undergoing non-ambulatory breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery under general anaesthesia between January and May 2017 were included. All&#xD;
      participants provided informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-ambulatory breast cancer surgery encompassed wide-local excision with lymph node&#xD;
      resection, simple mastectomy, and mastectomy with lymph node resection. Those undergoing&#xD;
      latissimus dorsi or DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap reconstruction were&#xD;
      excluded. Patients with chronic pain syndromes, local anaesthetic allergy, contraindication&#xD;
      to simple analgesics, local infection over the proposed block site, coagulopathy, or&#xD;
      co-morbid conditions precluding the provision of informed consent, were excluded. All&#xD;
      patients were day of surgery admission and attended a preoperative anaesthetic assessment&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were allocated into three groups using computer-generated randomisation, with the&#xD;
      study number and group allocation concealed in sealed envelopes. Blocked randomisation in&#xD;
      groups of 9 was applied, giving similar numbers in each group as the study progressed. Groups&#xD;
      were named 'PECs', 'Local anaesthetic infusion (LA infusion)' , and 'Both (PECS &amp; LA&#xD;
      infusion)', which were evenly distributed to opaque envelopes numbered one to forty-five in&#xD;
      accordance with randomisation. The randomisation key was held by an independent party, and&#xD;
      was not used to reveal participant group allocations until data analysis commenced. 'PECs'&#xD;
      patients received PECS I &amp; II blocks and a sham wound infiltration catheter. 'LA infusion'&#xD;
      patients received a continuous local anaesthetic wound infusion catheter. 'PECs &amp; LA&#xD;
      infusion' patients received a combination of techniques, without the initial local&#xD;
      anaesthetic bolus via the wound infusion catheter. PECs blocks were performed while patients&#xD;
      were under general anaesthesia, prior to the commencement of surgery. The operative surgeon&#xD;
      sited wound infusion catheters during skin closure at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were induced with fentanyl 1-2 μg.kg-1, followed by propofol titrated to the absence&#xD;
      of verbal response. Anaesthesia was maintained using an oxygen, air and sevoflurane&#xD;
      combination. Airway management and lung ventilation strategies were at the discretion of the&#xD;
      supervising anaesthetist. Patients received a standard intraoperative analgesic regimen of&#xD;
      paracetamol 1g and dexketoprofen 50mg intravenously (IV), with rescue morphine as deemed&#xD;
      necessary. Combination antiemetics, including ondansetron 0.1-0.15 mg.kg-1 IV, dexamethasone&#xD;
      0.1-0.2 mg.kg-1 IV or droperidol 0.01-0.015 mg.kg-1 IV, were administered according to&#xD;
      patient risk factors. Intraoperative management was otherwise left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      supervising anaesthetist. Routine monitoring was used in accordance with AAGBI guidelines15.&#xD;
      An electronic anaesthetic record was used to document physiological parameters. Perioperative&#xD;
      events, such as induction of anaesthesia, initial skin incision, and end of surgery, were&#xD;
      annotated on the record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PECs I &amp; II blocks were performed on the side of surgery, using the ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      technique described by Blanco et al9, 10. The patient was placed in the supine, head-up,&#xD;
      position with the arm abducted. The skin was prepared with chlorhexidine gluconate&#xD;
      2%/isopropyl alcohol 70% (BD, ChloraPrep, NJ, USA). PECs blocks were performed with a&#xD;
      22-gauge echogenic needle (B. Braun, Ultraplex 360 cannula, Hessen, Germany; 50-80mm), using&#xD;
      the same ultrasound machine (Sonosite Edge, Sonosite, Inc., Bothwell, WA, USA) and transducer&#xD;
      (Sonosite HFL 50x, Sonosite, Inc., Bothwell, WA, USA). The ultrasound probe was placed&#xD;
      inferolaterally at the mid-clavicular level. The axillary artery and vein were identified,&#xD;
      and the probe moved laterally until pectoralis major, pectoralis minor and serratus anterior&#xD;
      muscles were located at the level of the 3rd rib. A needle in-plane approach was taken until&#xD;
      the needle tip was positioned in the plane between pectoralis major and minor muscles, and&#xD;
      levobupivacaine 0.25% 10ml was injected. The needle was advanced until it occupied the space&#xD;
      between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles, and a further 20ml of levobupivacaine&#xD;
      0.25% was injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding was not considered necessary for 'LA infusion' group patients, as PECs blocks were&#xD;
      performed under general anaesthesia. All patients had a wound infusion catheter sited and&#xD;
      attached to an elastometric pump (B. Braun, ON-Q PainBuster, Hessen, Germany), which was&#xD;
      placed by the operating surgeon during skin closure at the end of surgery. For blinding&#xD;
      purposes, patients in the 'PECs' group received a sham wound infiltration catheter system.&#xD;
      'LA infusion' and 'PECS &amp; LA infusion' patients received levobupivacaine 0.1% at 10ml.hr-1&#xD;
      for 24 hours postoperatively, while 'PECs' patients received sodium chloride 0.9% at the same&#xD;
      rate. 'LA infusion' patients were administered an initial bolus of levobupivacaine 0.25% 20ml&#xD;
      at the end of surgery. Those who performed the procedures, or were involved in the&#xD;
      perioperative management, were not involved in postoperative pain assessment or data&#xD;
      collection. Study interventions as described occurred while patients were under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were monitored for 24 hours after surgery, initially in the post-anaesthesia care&#xD;
      unit (PACU), and then at ward level once PACU discharge criteria were met. Oxycodone 1-2mg IV&#xD;
      as required was prescribed for rescue analgesia in the PACU. A standard analgesic protocol of&#xD;
      paracetamol 1g PO/IV 6-hourly regular, ibuprofen 400mg PO 8-hourly regular, and oxycodone&#xD;
      immediate release (oxynorm) 5-10mg 1-hourly as required for rescue analgesia, was prescribed&#xD;
      for all patients. Ondansetron 4-8mg IV 8-hourly as required was prescribed, to be&#xD;
      administered in the event of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the study was area under curve of verbal rating score (VRS) of&#xD;
      pain moving versus time, (AUC) where VRS pain was measured at 1 hour, 4-6 hours, 10-14 hours,&#xD;
      and 20-24 hours postoperatively. At each assessment, patients were invited to report their&#xD;
      pain VRS pain at rest. Pain while moving was defined as pain experienced while sitting&#xD;
      forward from a recumbent position. Secondary outcome measures were total opioid consumption&#xD;
      over a 24-hour period and presence of adverse events. An investigator masked to group&#xD;
      allocations recorded vital signs, pain scores, antiemetic administration and opioid use&#xD;
      postoperatively. Adverse events such as sedation, respiratory depression, hypotension,&#xD;
      pruritus and PONV were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was analysed by Graph Pad Prism v6 (Salt Lake City, UH). The primary end-point was area&#xD;
      under the VRS moving versus time curve (AUC). We powered the study to detect a 25% difference&#xD;
      in AUC from an internal pilot study which indicated mean AUC of 60 cm.hr-1 (SD 5-10) among&#xD;
      patients receiving PECs or LA infusion in our clinical service, to 45 cm.hr-1. We had&#xD;
      observed the standard deviation of the AUC to be in the order of 15 cm.hr-1. Assuming a Type&#xD;
      I error of 0.05 and a Type II error of 0.1, then n=11 patients would be required each group&#xD;
      to detect this difference with 90% power. We obtained IRB permission for n=15 each group to&#xD;
      allow for protocol violations or patient drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected at 1, 4-6, 12-14 and 20-24 hr, post-operatively. It was tested for&#xD;
      distribution initially using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For each patient, their AUC both&#xD;
      moving and at rest was calculated by plotting their pain VRS versus time using Graph Pad&#xD;
      Prism v.6. The mean AUC according to the three study groups was then calculated and inspected&#xD;
      for distribution as described above, and all AUC data was found to be normally distributed.&#xD;
      Therefore, AUC data is expressed as mean ± SD and was compared using ANOVA with post hoc&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction. Non-normally distributed data was compared using the Kruskal-Wallis&#xD;
      test for repeated measurements. Categorical data (e.g. the incidence of potential adverse&#xD;
      effects) were compared using Fischer's exact test where appropriate. P&lt;0.05 was deemed&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
