    <textblock>
      Infant feeding practices and nutritional status among children is interrelated and link is&#xD;
      well established. Incidence of malnutrition sharply rises during 6-9 months of age in most of&#xD;
      the developing countries which coincide with the period of complimentary feeding (CF). This&#xD;
      prospective randomized trial will be implemented in ongoing health and demographic&#xD;
      surveillance system of Matlab, ICDDR,B and will be nested into an ongoing maternal and child&#xD;
      health services area. Area of community health workers (four blocks) will be divided into two&#xD;
      pairs and each pair will be randomly assigned into intervention or control groups. The&#xD;
      eligible and consented mother-infant newborn will be recruited either into an intervention or&#xD;
      control groups based on the areas of the paired block. The mothers and family members of the&#xD;
      intervention area will receive intensive counseling on complementary feeding practices&#xD;
      through community health workers. In total about 360 mother-infant pair will be recruited in&#xD;
      the study for each site. Data on children's anthropometry (weight and lengths), information&#xD;
      on complementary feeding practices and related covariates will be collected through trained&#xD;
      research staffs. Data will be evaluated on reduction of burden of malnutrition (stunting,&#xD;
      underweight, wasting) and complimentary feeding index between intervention and control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

      Back ground:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Link between infant feeding practices and nutritional status among children has been well&#xD;
      established. Incidence of malnutrition sharply rises during 6-9 months of age which coincide&#xD;
      with the period of complimentary feeding (CF). It is reported that poor nutrition increases&#xD;
      the risk of illness, and is responsible, directly or indirectly, for one third of the&#xD;
      estimated 9.5 million deaths in children less than 5 years of age. Early nutritional deficits&#xD;
      are also linked to long-term impairment in growth and health. There is evidence that adults&#xD;
      who were malnourished in early childhood have impaired intellectual performance. They may&#xD;
      also have reduced capacity for physical work. High proportion of childhood malnutrition has&#xD;
      negative impact for national development. Based on evidence of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      interventions, achievement of universal coverage of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) could&#xD;
      prevent 13% of deaths occurring in children less than 5 years of age globally, while&#xD;
      appropriate complementary feeding practices would result in an additional 6% reduction in&#xD;
      under five mortality. Although there is huge potential for EBF till 6 months of age, the CF&#xD;
      practices is also important to maintain the increase demand and growth after the period of&#xD;
      EBF to maintain the optimal growth and development during infancy and early child hood&#xD;
      period. However, there are lacks of efforts observed to increase the knowledge of good&#xD;
      complementary feeding practices at population level. Under five child mortality is still high&#xD;
      for Bangladesh. Among these deaths prematurity of the newborn/LBW and malnutrition together&#xD;
      contribute to about 45% of all deaths. Despite the progress achieved, child malnutrition in&#xD;
      Bangladesh remains among the highest in the world, and more severe than that of most other&#xD;
      developing countries. This suggests that children in Bangladesh suffer from short-term acute&#xD;
      shortfall in food intake as well as longer-term under-nutrition. Exclusive breast feeding is&#xD;
      quiet static (43%-46%) for last few years in Bangladesh and around one fourth infant from 6-9&#xD;
      months ages start complementary feeding either too early or too late. Inappropriate practices&#xD;
      of CF reflect the knowledge gap at the population level. Mother and family members are&#xD;
      usually unaware about the nutrition need immediately after the completion of exclusive breast&#xD;
      feeding practices. It was reported that Bangladesh scored 91.5/150 for Young Infant and Child&#xD;
      Feeding (YICF) practices which was done by International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN),&#xD;
      Asia Pacific where community outreach and information support warranted much improvement. To&#xD;
      reduce malnutrition: Comprehensive programme of integrated actions on many fronts has been&#xD;
      addressed which includes &quot;Promoting improved infant feeding practices, including breast&#xD;
      feeding practices&quot;. Mothers and families need support to initiate and sustain appropriate&#xD;
      infant and young child feeding practices through support person or peer group is recommended&#xD;
      at the community level. Educational intervention on CF practices shows improvement in several&#xD;
      studies in India, china and Brazil. Indian study observed feasibility of CF practices&#xD;
      promotion through existing system and found limited improvement of infant length (difference&#xD;
      in means 0.32 cm, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.61) between groups. Brazilian study assessed impact on&#xD;
      child growth of the nutrition counseling component of the Integrated Management of Childhood&#xD;
      Illnesses strategy and found children 12 month of age or older had improved weight gain&#xD;
      (changes of +.25 and -.06 Z-score, respectively) and a positive but non-significant&#xD;
      improvement in length (0.40 vs. 0.12). In this study medical doctors were used for counseling&#xD;
      which is not applicable in poor resource settings. The China study was to improve infant&#xD;
      growth by improving infant feeding practices. The education group infants were significantly&#xD;
      heavier and longer, but only at 12 month (weight-for-age -1.17 vs. -1.93; P=5 0.004;&#xD;
      height-for-age -1.32 vs. 1.96; P =0.022). But this study differ from exclusive breast feeding&#xD;
      (EBF) duration and starting of complimentary feeding practices as recommended by WHO (EBF is&#xD;
      practice 4-6 month and weaning starts at 4 months). None of the above studies evaluated&#xD;
      feeding practices through CF index. In early 90's Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee&#xD;
      evaluated educational messages on CF practices other than WHO recommendation, Population&#xD;
      level study on CF practice promotion is poor in Bangladesh. Given the above background, with&#xD;
      lack of knowledge on CF practices in the community level and high burden of childhood&#xD;
      malnutrition, we plan to improve complementary feeding practices in Matlab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study hypothesized that an appropriate delivery of CF messages at the community&#xD;
      level will improve the CF practices and subsequently decrease the burden of malnutrition&#xD;
      during infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the project are to evaluate the effect of CF practice messages through&#xD;
      community health workers to mothers and family members in comparison to mothers and family&#xD;
      member who do not receive CF practice messages on the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the burden of stunting, underweight and wasting Evaluate complementary feeding index&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be implemented in a rural community of Matlab under a sub-district of&#xD;
      Bangladesh. Matlab is located 56 kilometer southeast of the capital Dhaka, where ICDDR,B has&#xD;
      been running a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in a population of about&#xD;
      220,000 since 1966. In HDSS, the community health research workers (CHRWs) collect all the&#xD;
      demographic events and selected morbidities in the area by monthly household visits. The&#xD;
      study area is divided into two parts. One is the ICDDR,B service area, where an extensive&#xD;
      Maternal, Child Health and Family Planning Programme has been operating to strengthen the&#xD;
      government's services since 1978. The other is the Government service area, where the&#xD;
      population receives services from government facilities as in areas all over Bangladesh. The&#xD;
      ICDDR,B service area is again divided by four blocks and each one is comprised of an&#xD;
      approximate 27,000 population. Each block has a sub-centre that provides 24-hour services by&#xD;
      midwifery staff. All the sub-centre and field activities are supported by the hospital at&#xD;
      Matlab Township. Sub-centres are comparable with the union level health structure of&#xD;
      government facilities. The study will be implemented in the ICDDR,B service area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently at Matlab a comprehensive maternal, neonatal &amp; child health (MNCH) programme has&#xD;
      been ongoing since March 2007. Under this programme pregnancies are identified by CHRWs&#xD;
      during their routine bimonthly household visits. Once pregnancy is identified by urine test,&#xD;
      CHRWs visit each woman at their home twice during pregnancy (12-14 weeks &amp; 33-34 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy) and counsel them about facility-based delivery, antenatal care, and birth&#xD;
      preparedness. After delivery, the CHRWs visit women on Days 0, 3, 7, and 28, 45, 75,105 and&#xD;
      180 to provide additional counseling, immediate newborn care, anthropometry measurements, &amp;&#xD;
      collect morbidity information (Diarrhoea, Respiratory Tract infections &amp; other illness as&#xD;
      well as also breast feeding &amp; other feeding status). The women also visit CHRWs houses for&#xD;
      immunization, family planning and also for Home based Life Saving Skill (HBLSS) training&#xD;
      along with their child and family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized community intervention will be conducted on mother-infant pairs of two&#xD;
      randomly selected areas from four blocks: intervention and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants (the infant who has completed his/her 6 month of age from the date of&#xD;
      birth along with their mother) will be enrolled from MNCH database according to criteria for&#xD;
      the intervention group and same number of control will be selected as above mentioned&#xD;
      procedure for each selected CHRW. At the beginning, baseline information will be collected&#xD;
      for each participant after informed consent. All the mothers of the selected infants along&#xD;
      with family member/s will receive training on standard complementary feeding practices at&#xD;
      respective CHRWs houses. A Training manual will be developed according to WHO and Bangladesh&#xD;
      Breast Feeding Foundation guideline. Refresher training will be arranged 3 months after the&#xD;
      first training at the CHRWs houses with the same participants. The CHRW will visit each&#xD;
      infant house till he/she reaches at 12 month of age at every two month interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each visit CHRWs will record anthropometrical measurement, details feeding information&#xD;
      both intervention and comparison group. CHRWs and Field Research Assistant (FRA) will also&#xD;
      receive training on study questionnaire. Field Research Supervisors (FRS) will be included&#xD;
      also in the training programme to include them in supervision process. The socio-demographic&#xD;
      information will be collected from HDSS database. The recruited FRA will work with FRS and&#xD;
      will be responsible for all trainings, supervision and monitoring the data collection.&#xD;
      Monitoring will be done by a standard check list. CHRWs will bring the questionnaires in each&#xD;
      subcenter meeting and FRA will receive and will send it to the computer room at Matlab after&#xD;
      reviewing each questionnaire. Any inconsistency or quarries will be checked by FRA with the&#xD;
      help of respective subcenter supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of woman-infant pairs required was calculated based on the studies conducted&#xD;
      earlier with peer counselors. We determined the sample size based on 20% difference (based on&#xD;
      previously conducted same study) in the prevalence of height-for-age, and weight-for-age&#xD;
      (40%) between intervention and control groups, with 5% significance level and 80% power. With&#xD;
      a maximum of 30% lost to follow up a total of 120 pairs will be needed for each study arm&#xD;
      (intervention and control). With design effect of 1.5, we need 180 woman-infant pairs from&#xD;
      each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total observations will be categorized into two groups by using baseline status and&#xD;
      after. Data will be presented as mean ± SD for continuous variables and proportion for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Unadjusted odds ratio between exposure variables and complementary&#xD;
      feeding will be determined by using univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis will be done to evaluate the simultaneous effects of various exposure variables&#xD;
      after adjusting for any confounding variables. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered for&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
