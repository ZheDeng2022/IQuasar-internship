      The aim of the study is to check standard screening blood pressure in the arm and central&#xD;
      blood pressure, the blood pressure at the heart in pregnant women. The standard brachial&#xD;
      pressure is routinely monitored throughout pregnancy, however it is not sensitive enough to&#xD;
      distinguish preeclampsia from other types of hypertension or to predict preeclampsia in those&#xD;
      at risk. Central aortic pressure monitoring has become a valuable clinical tool and&#xD;
      preliminary studies suggest that measuring of central blood pressure may be better predictor&#xD;
      of preeclampsia. It is non invasive and doesn't require undressing. It involves using a&#xD;
      standard blood pressure cuff placed around the thigh, checking carotid pulse and pressure&#xD;
      with an ultrasound and taking measurements of the person neck to torso. With this knowledge&#xD;
      it will be a useful screening tool to identify these patients at higher risk and hopefully&#xD;
      lead to closer monitoring, earlier treatment and reduced morbidity and mortality&#xD;

      When blood pressure is measured conventionally over the brachial artery it is assumed that&#xD;
      these measurements accurately reflect pressures in the central circulation. However, central&#xD;
      aortic pressure is the blood pressure at the root of aorta and are determined not only by&#xD;
      cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance, but by the stiffness of conduit arteries&#xD;
      and the timing and magnitude of pressure wave reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown the importance of central aortic pressure and its implications in&#xD;
      assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment with respect to cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. In the CAFE Study the traditional method of measuring blood pressure in the arms has&#xD;
      been shown to underestimate the efficacy of drugs such as amlodipine and overestimate the&#xD;
      efficacy of those like atenolol (4). This clinical trial demonstrated that different&#xD;
      medications for lowering blood pressure have different effects on the central aortic pressure&#xD;
      and blood flow characteristics, despite producing similar brachial blood pressure readings.&#xD;
      They also were able to show that central aortic pressures are a better independent predictor&#xD;
      of cardiovascular and renal outcome. The Strong Heart Study went further to depict how&#xD;
      central pressure are more predictive of the load imposed on the coronary and cerebral&#xD;
      arteries and thereby bear a stronger relationship to vascular damage and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in particular, preeclampsia, are a leading cause of&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In the United States and the United Kingdom,&#xD;
      approximately 5% of pregnancies are complicated by preeclampsia, and of these patients, 1-2%&#xD;
      progress to eclampsia. It is estimated that these rates are higher in developing countries.&#xD;
      An estimated 50,000 women die annually from preeclampsia worldwide. The presence of&#xD;
      hypertension during pregnancy is also associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus. In addition, a history of preeclampsia increases a women's&#xD;
      subsequent risk of vascular disease, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and stroke. The increased risk of complications is not limited to the&#xD;
      mother; babies of women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are more likely to&#xD;
      suffer adverse outcomes than those of women without hypertension. A large cross-sectional&#xD;
      study observing more than 250,000 women and their infants showed that women with gestational&#xD;
      hypertension were at a 30% greater risk of death or major morbidity, and women with&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia had a 400% increased risk, compared to women without hypertension. Although&#xD;
      preeclampsia is not preventable, early diagnosis, careful monitoring and aggressive treatment&#xD;
      is crucial in preventing mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brachial pressure is routinely monitored throughout pregnancy, however it is not&#xD;
      sensitive enough to distinguish preeclampsia from other types of hypertension or to predict&#xD;
      preeclampsia in those at risk. Central aortic pressure monitoring has become a valuable&#xD;
      clinical tool outside of pregnancy, particular in assessment of patient's hypertension, renal&#xD;
      disease and diabetes. Preliminary studies suggest that measuring of central blood pressure&#xD;
      may be predictive preeclampsia. In normal pregnancy aortic stiffness has been shown to vary&#xD;
      throughout the pregnancy, reaching its lowest point in second trimester and rising again in&#xD;
      the third trimester. A number of studies have investigated the change in pulse wave indices&#xD;
      in the third trimester across the spectrum of hypertensive disorders. Central pressures,&#xD;
      along with Augmentation pressure were found to be significantly higher in gestational&#xD;
      hypertension and preeclampsia compared to normal pregnancy. In addition, Aortic augmentation&#xD;
      pressure and pulse wave velocity has been shown to vary between preeclampsia, gestational&#xD;
      hypertension, and normal pregnancy. The ability to accurately identify women at risk for&#xD;
      preeclampsia would have significant clinical benefits. The ability to distinguish between&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders and identify those women who have increased risk of preeclampsia can&#xD;
      lead to better management of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and therefore better&#xD;
      outcomes for both mother and child. The aim of our study is to examine if early evaluation of&#xD;
      central blood pressure and arterial stiffness (pulse wave analysis) can be a predictor of&#xD;
      gestational hypertension/preeclampsia.&#xD;
