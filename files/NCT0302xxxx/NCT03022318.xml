  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From 3 large patient databases, patients diagnosed with AMD who have never taken&#xD;
      levodopa(L-DOPA) containing medications have a mean age of diagnosis at 71 years. Patients&#xD;
      who have been treated with L-DOPA containing medications have a mean age of diagnosis of AMD&#xD;
      at 79 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA binds to GPR143 in the retinal pigment epithelium, and releases PEDF, which protects&#xD;
      the retina and downregulates VEGF, which is the cause of neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of carbidopa-levodopa in patients&#xD;
      with Neovascular AMD, and measure the effects on visual acuity and retinal abnormalities due&#xD;
      to &quot;wet&quot; (neovascular) AMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness, in individuals&#xD;
      over the age of 50, in the developed world. AMD becomes more common as people age, and is&#xD;
      more common in lightly pigmented individuals. AMD appears more common in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease, than in those without. The AREDS nutritional supplements are effective&#xD;
      in slowing the progress of intermediate AMD(5). Most AMD is &quot;dry AMD&quot;, which progresses&#xD;
      relatively slowly and may impair vision, but usually does not lead to legal blindness. There&#xD;
      are two forms of AMD, &quot;wet AMD&quot; and geographic atrophy (GA), that can cause more profound&#xD;
      vision loss. In aggregate they occur in about 25% patients with AMD. Wet AMD is due to new&#xD;
      growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina. The new blood vessels are believed to be&#xD;
      due to an excessive release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelium(RPE) cells. Wet AMD is now effectively treated with intraocular injections&#xD;
      of VEGF inhibitors. Geographic Atrophy, the other form of advanced AMD, represents focal&#xD;
      death of the RPE cells and overlying neurosensory retina. There is no current treatment for&#xD;
      GA. It is suspected that GA is due in part to a localized inflammatory response, damage to&#xD;
      RPE cells and loss of RPE cell function. It may also be speculated that stimulation of RPE&#xD;
      cells to release a potent neurotrophic factor, pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) may&#xD;
      slow progression of GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, Dr. Brian McKay identified a receptor, G protein coupled receptor #143(GPR143), on&#xD;
      the surface of RPE cells and discovered that L-DOPA was the natural ligand or stimulator of&#xD;
      GPR143. Dr McKay showed that treatment of RPE cells with exogenous L-DOPA resulted in the&#xD;
      release of additional PEDF. In subsequent work Dr McKay's group also showed that L-DOPA&#xD;
      stimulation of PEDF in RPE cells was also associated with a decrease in VEGF. Thus, Dr McKay&#xD;
      hypothesized that exogenous L-DOPA may prevent the onset of AMD or progression to wet AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, Dr McKay and his associates published a paper that showed that patients, who had&#xD;
      been treated with L-DOPA, had a delay in the onset of AMD by 8 years, compared to patients&#xD;
      who had not been treated with L-DOPA. In addition, those who had AMD and went on to develop&#xD;
      wet AMD, did so 5 years later than those with no history of L-DOPA treatment. L-DOPA is an&#xD;
      intermediate in the pigmentation pathway. Dr McKay and his associates suggested that the&#xD;
      reason darkly pigmented races do not get AMD nearly as frequently as lighter pigmented races,&#xD;
      is that they produce more pigment, and thus more L-DOPA to stimulate GPR143 on RPE cells.&#xD;
      According to this hypothesis, the stimulated RPE cells release PEDF and decrease VEGF, which&#xD;
      together are responsible for the protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there are no established animal models for AMD, and L-DOPA has a good safety profile in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease, the Investigators propose a&#xD;
      prospective experiment to determine the safety and tolerability of L-DOPA, in a population of&#xD;
      patients with AMD. The participants will be made aware of potential side effects of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      which are listed in the Informed Consent, during the consent process. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      elicited by questioning the participants at each visit. The participants will also be advised&#xD;
      to call the site, if they have any medical problem between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will also use this study to examine whether L-DOPA has a positive effect on&#xD;
      visual acuity and pathologic retinal changes of &quot;wet&quot; AMD. The parameters to be evaluated are&#xD;
      best corrected ETDRS visual acuity, macular thickness by spectral domain optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (SD OCT), new blood (hemorrhage) by direct retinal examination, or subjective&#xD;
      decrease in vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacology of L-DOPA and carbidopa:&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA is formed by 3-hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine-3-monooxygenase (tyrosinase).(18)&#xD;
      The primary metabolic pathway of L-DOPA is decarboxylation by amino acid decarboxylase to&#xD;
      dopamine, which is responsible for most, but not all, of its pharmacologic effects and&#xD;
      toxicity. When carbidopa is administered with L-DOPA, systemic levels of L-DOPA double and&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) L-DOPA increases from about 1% of the administered dose to about&#xD;
      4%. Levodopa freely passes from the systemic circulation into the retina and brain, but&#xD;
      dopamine and carbidopa do not. Adverse events are markedly decreased when carbidopa is&#xD;
      administered with L-DOPA, because systemic levels of the toxic metabolite of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      dopamine, are markedly reduced. In most patients, 25 mg of carbidopa is sufficient to control&#xD;
      side effects of 100 mg of L-DOPA, primarily nausea, by 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA is the natural ligand for GPR143 in the RPE cells. The Investigators' intent is to&#xD;
      increase the L-DOPA available to RPE surface receptors (GPR 143) while minimizing peripheral&#xD;
      toxicity. This concept is unique, because all other uses of L-DOPA rely on CNS conversion of&#xD;
      L-DOPA to dopamine, in order to produce the desired effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excess VEGF is the mediator of the retinal neovascularization and other retinal pathological&#xD;
      changes in &quot;wet&quot; AMD. Intraocular injections of anti-VEGF antibodies is the standard of care&#xD;
      in &quot;Wet&quot; AMD. Several publications, including Lim et al, show that with careful monitoring of&#xD;
      the visual acuity and retinas of patients with wet AMD, if there is no progression, there are&#xD;
      no long-term adverse consequences of delaying initiation of anti-VEGF therapy for up to 4&#xD;
      weeks. The patients will be monitored at weekly intervals, for up to 4 weeks, for indications&#xD;
      for initiation of anti-VEGF injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for anti-VEGF injections&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be based on: weekly evaluation of ETDRS visual acuity (decrease of 5 letters from&#xD;
      previous visit); increased macular thickness (compared to normal and previous visit as&#xD;
      measured by OCT; new blood (hemorrhage) on direct retinal examination; or subjective decrease&#xD;
      in vision. If any of these criteria are met, or if, in the opinion of the Ophthalmologist,&#xD;
      the patient requires anti-VEGF therapy, the patient will have an anti-VEGF intraocular&#xD;
      injection. If none of these criteria are met at visits 2, 3 or 4, with patient agreement,&#xD;
      anti-VEGF injection will not be done, and the patient will be reevaluated in 1 week. The&#xD;
      patients will receive an anti-VEGF injection at the end of the 4th week, if they have not&#xD;
      received one earlier. Whenever a patient receives the first anti-VEGF injection,&#xD;
      participation in this protocol will end. At that point, the patient will be able to enroll in&#xD;
      Study 0002, Proof of Concept and Dose Ranging Study of carbidopa-levodopa in Neovascular AMD.&#xD;
