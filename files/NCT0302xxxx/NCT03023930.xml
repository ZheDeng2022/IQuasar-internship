  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of (1) Implementation Facilitation (IF)&#xD;
      on rates of provision of Emergency Department (ED)-initiated buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP)&#xD;
      treatment with referral for ongoing medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and the (2)&#xD;
      effectiveness of IF on patient engagement in formal addiction treatment at 30 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a Hybrid Type 3 Effectiveness-Implementation framework and a modified stepped&#xD;
      wedge design. The study will be conducted at four EDs with a high prevalence of patients with&#xD;
      untreated opioid use disorder (OUD). The four sites will receive the same sequence of&#xD;
      evaluations and interventions: the baseline evaluation period after the standard&#xD;
      dissemination practice, the IF phase, and continuation of facilitation into the IF evaluation&#xD;
      period. The timing of initiation of the study activities at each site will be randomly offset&#xD;
      by ~ 3 month increments to accommodate logistical constraints of simultaneous implementation&#xD;
      at all sites. The study populations will include (1) ED providers and staff involved in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with OUD; (2) Community opioid treatment provider and program staff&#xD;
      involved in providing care for patients with OUD referred from the ED; and (3) ED patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses have been added to assess the impact of COVID-19 and social distancing&#xD;
      guidance on drug use and drug supply; access to medications for opioid use disorder; and&#xD;
      COVID19 disease from the perspectives of patient participants and ED leadership.&#xD;
