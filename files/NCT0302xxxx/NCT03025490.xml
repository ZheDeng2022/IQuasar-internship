  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study sets out to assess whether in the context of nurse administered procedural sedation&#xD;
      in the electrophysiology suite, the routine use of capnography and Integrated Pulmonary Index&#xD;
      results in lower incidence of severe adverse respiratory events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the electrophysiology lab, the use of procedural sedation, often by nurses is considered&#xD;
      routine and safe.Standard monitoring during these procedures includes continuous Oxygen&#xD;
      Saturation (SpO2), Heart Rate and rhythm and interval Respiratory rate and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capnography allows for continuous monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide, it is an important&#xD;
      tool during anesthesia, providing valuable information on the patient's respiratory status&#xD;
      and is standard equipment in most operating rooms. Its use in procedural sedation has&#xD;
      increased over the past years as the body of evidence supporting this practice has been&#xD;
      growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been previously shown, use of capnography may allow for earlier detection of&#xD;
      respiratory adverse events in various types of procedural sedation. The fall of oxygen&#xD;
      saturation can occur very late during an adverse respiratory event, especially if&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen is given. Today's procedural sedation in the electrophysiology&#xD;
      catheterization lab are more complex, patients are of increasingly older age, have more&#xD;
      comorbidities, procedures are lengthier and often require deeper sedation (i.e. during&#xD;
      complex ablation procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of capnography in the electrophysiology lab has not been addressed thoroughly in the&#xD;
      literature. A recent multidisciplinary review of anesthesia in the electrophysiology lab&#xD;
      states: &quot;In the obstructive sleep apnea or non-obstructive sleep apnea patient, capnography&#xD;
      should ideally be employed throughout the sedation period.&quot;â€¦&quot;Capnography appears to be&#xD;
      underutilized in the electrophysiology lab, given its omission from electrophysiology&#xD;
      literature documenting safety of sedation by non-anesthesiologists&quot; We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      routine use of capnography during nurse administered procedural sedations in the&#xD;
      electrophysiology lab could aid in detection of early signs of adverse respiratory events,&#xD;
      thus allowing early intervention and reduction of these events.&#xD;
