    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, multicentre study conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of two TB breath-based technologies independently of the manufacturers. Assay error and&#xD;
      failure rates and device operational characteristics will also be assessed during this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in this study in line with FIND sample banking activities.&#xD;
      Results from index tests will not be used to make clinical decisions. Participation in this&#xD;
      study will not alter the standard of care.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will be tested with both the reference and index TB diagnostic tests. Index test results will not be used to inform case management.&#xD;
All samples must be collected before the patient starts any form of TB treatment. Patients will be randomized to receive either the TB Breathalyser or AeonoseTM on Day 1, and will be tested with the remaining breath-test on Day 2. A follow-up evaluation will be required after 8 weeks for all patients who do not have microbiologic confirmation of TB (smear or culture). Two additional breath samples may also be collected upon follow-up.</description>

    <intervention_name>Rapid Biosensor Systems (RBS) TB Breathalyser</intervention_name>
    <description>Rapid Biosensor Systems (RBS) recently developed a portable, non-invasive, rapid TB diagnostic 'Breathalyser' capable of diagnosing TB in patient breath samples collected while patients cough (Figure 1). The TB Breathalyser comprises a disposable, single-use sample collection tube and a multi-use reader. At the bottom of the collection tube is a glass bio-sensor coated with a biochemical sensor that is formulated to react with TB bacilli. Patients cough into the collection tube after nebulization with 0.9% saline solution. Following sample collection, the tube is placed into the reader, where a diode laser interrogates the biochemical coating in the sample collection tube and reports the presence of TB bacilli. The entire process takes about two minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>eNose AeonoseTM</intervention_name>
    <description>The eNose Company has also developed a hand-held, non-invasive rapid TB diagnostic 'electronic nose' (AeonoseTM) for TB detection based upon analysis of exhaled breath. After the device has been calibrated, the patient is instructed to breathe into the device through a mouthpiece for 5 minutes. Within the device is a micro-hotplate, metal-oxide sensor which behaves as a semiconductor at high temperature. Redox-reactions occurring at the sensor surface result in changes in resistance, with results read and interpreted by a phone application to confirm the presence of MTB.</description>

      All consenting patients are expected to provide the following samples: 2x breath/cough&#xD;
      samples, which will be collected directly into enclosed diagnostic devices and destroyed&#xD;
      immediately following diagnosis; blood samples for HIV testing, which will be de-identified&#xD;
      and stored until study completion; urine samples; and 3x sputum samples, collected at&#xD;
      enrollment and during an 8-week follow-up, de-identified and used for liquid culture, solid&#xD;
      culture, AFB smear, and DNA extraction for Xpert testing. Except for the breath samples, all&#xD;
      samples will be de-identified and stored until study completion.&#xD;

        All adult patients who have symptoms consistent with pulmonary TB presenting to health&#xD;
        facilities during study period. Patients will be asked by study or non-study clinicians or&#xD;
        staff if they would be interested in participating in the study. Interested individuals&#xD;
        will be referred to study personnel for additional information and screening, if&#xD;
        appropriate, samples will be obtained following the informed consent process.&#xD;
