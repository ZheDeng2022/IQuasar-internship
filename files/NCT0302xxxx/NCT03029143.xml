      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) dose optimization on mucosal healing compared with the standard vedolizumab&#xD;
      IV dosing regimen over a 30 week treatment period in subjects with moderately to severely&#xD;
      active ulcerative colitis (UC) and high vedolizumab clearance, based on a Week 5 predefined&#xD;
      serum vedolizumab concentration threshold less than (&lt;) 50 microgram per milliliter&#xD;
      (microg/mL) and who are Week 6 non-responders based on partial Mayo score.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Vedolizumab. Vedolizumab will be administered&#xD;
      as an IV infusion. It is being tested in this study with new doses. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of dose optimization of vedolizumab IV, compared with&#xD;
      standard dosing of vedolizumab IV, over a 30-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 250 moderately to severely active subjects with UC in&#xD;
      order to randomize approximately 100 non-responder subjects with high vedolizumab drug&#xD;
      clearance. Subjects will receive induction therapy of vedolizumab IV 300 mg on Day 1 and Week&#xD;
      2 (Lead-in Period). At Week 5, serum vedolizumab concentration will be measured. At Week 6,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for clinical response based on partial Mayo score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of both Week 5 vedolizumab concentration and Week 6 clinical response will determine&#xD;
      the treatment pathway. Those who are non-responders based on partial Mayo score at Week 6 and&#xD;
      who are assessed as having high vedolizumab clearance, based on a predefined Week 5 serum&#xD;
      vedolizumab concentration threshold (&lt;50 microg/mL) will be randomly assigned (by chance,&#xD;
      like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vedolizumab IV Standard Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vedolizumab IV Dose Optimized&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomized subjects will receive vedolizumab IV either 300 mg or 600 mg every 4 or 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States of America and Canada. The overall&#xD;
      time to participate in this study is 56 weeks. Subjects will make multiple visits to the&#xD;
      clinic, and will be contacted by telephone, 6 months after last dose of study drug for a long&#xD;
      term follow-up safety survey.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal healing is defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore &lt;=1 point. Mayo score was used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consisted of 4 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

Mayo score was used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consisted of 4 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition.

Mayo score was used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. A composite index of 3 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with total partial Mayo score ranging from 0 to 9 (higher scores indicate greater disease activity).

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants with ulcerative colitis (UC) took part in the study at 90 investigative sites in the United States and Canada from 29 March 2017 to 16 October 2020.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with UC enrolled in Lead-in Period received vedolizumab 300 mg at Day 1 and Week 2. At Week 5, participants were assessed for clearance and at Week 6 for clinical response per partial Mayo Score. The non-responders were randomized to receive optimized treatment (Regimen A or B, dose decided by vedolizumab clearance) or standard vedolizumab treatment. The responders or participants with low vedolizumab clearance received vedolizumab 300 mg at Week 6 plus 18-week follow-up.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Mucosal Healing at Week 30</title>
        <description>Mucosal healing is defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore &lt;=1 point. Mayo score was used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consisted of 4 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Corticosteroid-Free Remission</title>
          <description>Participants using oral corticosteroids at Baseline who have discontinued corticosteroids and are in clinical remission. Mayo score was used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. Clinical Remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of &lt;=2 points and no individual subscore &gt;1 point at Week 30. It consisted of 4 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

        <description>A clinical response (based on partial Mayo score), which is defined as a reduction in partial Mayo score of ≥2 points and ≥25% from Baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at Weeks 14 and 30. Mayo score was used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. A composite index of 3 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with total partial Mayo score ranging from 0 to 9 (higher scores indicate greater disease activity). Partial Mayo score is calculated analogously to the complete Mayo score but excludes the sigmoidoscopy subscore.
