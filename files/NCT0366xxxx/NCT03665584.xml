      Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a skin condition of the external genitals (vulva) of women. LS&#xD;
      causes vulvar itching, pain, and burning. In addition, LS causes scarring of the vulva which&#xD;
      may cause significant sexual dysfunction or pain. Lastly, 4-6% of women with LS will develop&#xD;
      vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment for lichen sclerosus is potent steroids creams. When&#xD;
      used correctly, steroid creams help to decrease the symptoms of itching and burning and can&#xD;
      prevent further vulvar scarring. In addition, proper treatment reverses the underlying&#xD;
      inflammation of LS, and may lower the risk of getting cancer. While useful, steroid creams&#xD;
      may have serious side effects that include thinning of the skin, fungal infections, and&#xD;
      lowering the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, microablative fractional CO 2 laser treatment (FxCO 2 ) (SmartXide 2 V 2 LR laser&#xD;
      system, for MonaLisa Touch, DEKA, Florence, Italy) has been proposed for the management of&#xD;
      LS. Specifically, two small studies demonstrated that FxCO 2 therapy appears to be a&#xD;
      promising treatment modality to treat lichen sclerosus. These studies demonstrated that FxCO&#xD;
      2 treatment may stimulate tissue healing in LS. Furthermore, by reducing inflammation, the&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of LS, such as intense itching and burning, were improved. While these&#xD;
      studies showed good success, these studies were limited because of their small size and lack&#xD;
      of sham (fake treatment) control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy (how well it works) and the safety of&#xD;
      the FxCO 2 laser treatment (laser energy emitted) for LS as compared to a sham treatment&#xD;
      (very minimal laser energy will be emitted).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic cutaneous disorder affecting approximately one in seventy&#xD;
      women. Presenting symptoms may include intense pruritus, pain, burning, and severe&#xD;
      dyspareunia. This disorder may affect any area of the skin, but has a notable predilection&#xD;
      for the anogenital skin. Extra-genital involvement is infrequent, affecting only 11% of women&#xD;
      with LS. Affected females outnumber affect males by 10:1. There is bimodal peak incidence in&#xD;
      premenarchal girls and menopausal women with an average age of onset of 51 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The typical lesions of LS are white plaques and papules, often with areas of ecchymosis,&#xD;
      excoriation, and ulceration. Often, there is destruction of the vulva architecture with&#xD;
      scarring of the clitoral prepuce, resorption of the labia minora, and narrowing of the&#xD;
      introitus. Four to six percent of women with LS will develop vulvar carcinoma. The&#xD;
      histopathologic changes of LS are distinctive and make biopsy a very useful diagnostic tool.&#xD;
      Characteristic pathologic finding include hyperkeratosis of the epidermis, epidermal atrophy&#xD;
      with loss of rete ridges, homogenization of the collagen in the upper dermis, and a lichenoid&#xD;
      (band-like) inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis. While there is no known cure for LS, the&#xD;
      current gold standard treatment is ultra-potent corticosteroids. When properly administered,&#xD;
      topical ultra-potent corticosteroids help to resolve the symptoms of pruritus and burning and&#xD;
      can prevent further vulvar scarring. In addition, proper treatment reverses the underlying&#xD;
      histopathologic changes of LS, and preliminary data shows that the risk of malignant&#xD;
      transformation also declines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although treatment with topical corticosteroids is effective, topical corticosteroids may&#xD;
      have serious local and systemic side effects, including dermal thinning, skin atrophy,&#xD;
      superimposed infections, rebound dermatitis, and adrenal insufficiency. Due to these side&#xD;
      effects, long- term use of corticosteroids for the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus may&#xD;
      be inadvisable. Therefore, a safe and effective alternative intervention is needed for this&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, microablative fractional CO 2 laser (SmartXide 2 V 2 LR CO 2 laser system, for&#xD;
      MonaLisa Touch, DEKA, Florence, Italy) has been proposed for the management of LS. This type&#xD;
      of laser has a wavelength of 10,600 nm that allows a superficial microablative effect in soft&#xD;
      tissues and a pulsed beam that protects the tissues from possible overheating damage. The&#xD;
      laser beam is delivered to the tissue in a fractional manner, creating small spots (called&#xD;
      DOTs) alternating parts of tissue treated and not treated. The size of each DOT is set by the&#xD;
      manufacturer at 150 - 200 Î¼m. Moreover, it has a DEKA pulse (D-pulse) mode that consists of&#xD;
      two parts: (a) constant, high energy peak power, for rapid superficial evaporation of the&#xD;
      atrophic epithelium with low water content and (b) lower peak power with longer emission&#xD;
      times that allows the energy heat to penetrate deeper in the epithelium. This D-pulse mode&#xD;
      combined with DOTs remodels the connective tissue via the production of heat shock protein 47&#xD;
      and produces new collagen/fibroblasts and ground matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two small studies demonstrated that fractional CO 2 laser (FxCO 2 ) therapy appears&#xD;
      to be a promising treatment modality to treat lichen sclerosus. These studies demonstrated&#xD;
      that FxCO 2 treatment may stimulate protein synthesis, accelerate tissue reconstruction, and&#xD;
      decrease lichenification. Furthermore, after elimination of local inflammation, the stimulus&#xD;
      of nerve endings was reduced, so the clinical manifestations of LS, such as intense vulvar&#xD;
      pruritus and burning were improved.&#xD;
