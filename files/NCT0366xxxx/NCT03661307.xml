    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies how well quizartinib, decitabine, and venetoclax work in&#xD;
      treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome that&#xD;
      is untreated or has come back (relapsed). Quizartinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      decitabine and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Giving quizartinib and decitabine may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia and&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) including CR (complete remission) + CRp&#xD;
      (complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery) + CRi (complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete count recovery) + partial remission (PR) within 3 months of treatment initiation&#xD;
      of quizartinib and decitabine + venetoclax combination in patients with newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (&gt; 10%&#xD;
      blasts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine CR and CR+CRh rates within 3 months of treatment initiation of quizartinib&#xD;
      and decitabine + venetoclax combination in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AML or&#xD;
      high risk MDS (&gt; 10% blast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), MRD status at response and best MRD response attained by flow-cytometry (all patients)&#xD;
      and by FLT3-PCR (if applicable) or variant allele frequency monitoring (if applicable) and&#xD;
      number of patients bridged to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and median duration&#xD;
      to HSCT from the initiation of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate correlations of response to this combination with a pre-therapy,&#xD;
      on-therapy, and progression 81-gene panel of gene mutations in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate possible relationships between response and non-response to the combination&#xD;
      with pretherapy, on-therapy, and progression gene expression signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the characterization of genetic heterogeneity in tumor cell populations,&#xD;
      by performing targeted single-cell sequencing on longitudinally collected AML tumor&#xD;
      populations from patients using a novel microfluidic approach that barcodes amplified genomic&#xD;
      DNA from thousands of individual leukemia cells confined to droplets (single cell&#xD;
      sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify individual treatment-resistant cell populations and how their signaling&#xD;
      state in disease relates to clinical outcomes we will perform CyTOF (mass cytometry) on&#xD;
      patients' bone marrow samples and peripheral blood at diagnosis, remission and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To store and/or analyze surplus blood or tissue including bone marrow, if available, for&#xD;
      potential future exploratory research into factors that may influence development of AML&#xD;
      and/or response to the combination (where response is defined broadly to include efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability or safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10, quizartinib orally&#xD;
      (PO) every day beginning on day 1 of cycle 1, and venetoclax PO on days 1-14 (days 1-21 if&#xD;
      persistent leukemia). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

                  induction chemotherapy, which must be documented and approved by the principal&#xD;
                  investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with newly diagnosed AML with poor risk complex karyotype and/or TP53&#xD;
             deletions/mutations equal or younger than 60 year old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For relapsed cohort: Patients aged &gt;= 18 years old. (Patients who are candidates for&#xD;
             relapse cohort will be enrolled into the study regardless of their fitness for&#xD;
             intensive chemotherapy). (a) Patients with relapsed/refractory AML are eligible if&#xD;
             they are not eligible for potentially curative therapy such as effective salvage&#xD;
             therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or who refuse these options at the&#xD;
             time of enrollment.&#xD;

          -  For frontline cohort: Patients must be chemonaive, i.e. not have received any&#xD;
             chemotherapy (except hydrea or 1-2 doses of ara-C for transient control of&#xD;
             hyperleukocytosis) for AML or MDS. They may have received transfusions, hematopoietic&#xD;
             growth factors or vitamins for an antecedent hematological disorder (AHD) or for AML.&#xD;
             Temporary prior measures such as apheresis, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), steroids&#xD;
             or hydrea while diagnostic work-up is being performed are allowed and not counted as a&#xD;
             prior salvage. Supportive care therapy for MDS (growth factors, transfusions) will not&#xD;
             be considered as prior therapy for MDS/AML and these patients will be enrolled to the&#xD;
             frontline cohort of the study if they are otherwise eligible.&#xD;

          -  For relapsed cohort: Patients who have received at least one prior therapy for AML or&#xD;
             for MDS with &gt; 10% blasts will be eligible. Patients may have received up to 4 prior&#xD;
             salvages for AML and/or MDS (defined by the IPSS classification). Prior therapy for&#xD;
             AML or MDS will be counted as a prior salvage. Patients who receive MDS directed&#xD;
             therapies considered not purely supportive such as HMAs, lenalidomide, investigational&#xD;

             time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents&#xD;
             or at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents. The half-life for the&#xD;
             therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts,&#xD;
             manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be&#xD;
             documented in the protocol eligibility document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of chemotherapeutic or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study&#xD;
             with the following exceptions: (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with&#xD;
             controlled central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at the discretion of the PI a (2) Use&#xD;
             of one dose of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m^2) or hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly&#xD;
             proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first&#xD;
             four weeks on therapy. These medications will be recorded in the case-report form.&#xD;

             method to avoid pregnancy until at least 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational drug. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as men with azoospermia do not require&#xD;

             study drug. Patients who are actively taking a strong CYP3A4 inducing medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require treatment with concomitant drugs that prolong QT/QTc interval or&#xD;
             strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with the exception of antibiotics, antifungals, and&#xD;
             antivirals that are used as standard of care to prevent or treat infections and other&#xD;
             such drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the care of the subject or if&#xD;
             the Investigator believes that beginning therapy with a potentially QTc-prolonging&#xD;
             medication (such as anti-emetic except for prochlorperazine) is vital to an individual&#xD;
             subject's care while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known family history of congenital long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are on strong CYP3A4 inhibitor will be excluded.&#xD;
