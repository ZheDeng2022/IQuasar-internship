      Objective The objectives of the study are to evaluate the relative efficacy of an enhanced&#xD;
      version of HIV testing and counselling (EHTC) versus standard-of-care HIV testing and&#xD;
      counselling (SHTC) in reducing sexual risk behaviours, increasing retesting rate and risk&#xD;
      perception among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Inclusion criteria are: 1) men of age 18 years or above using HTC services at&#xD;
      AIDS Concern, 2) anal intercourse with at least one man in the last six months, 3) able to&#xD;
      read and comprehend Cantonese, 4) willingness to provide contact information and to complete&#xD;
      a simple follow up evaluation at Month 6, and 5) no intention to leave Hong Kong for one&#xD;
      month consecutively within the next six months. Those self-reported or tested to be HIV&#xD;
      positive will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A parallel-group and non-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted.&#xD;
      A total of 430 participants will be randomly allocated into the intervention group receiving&#xD;
      EHTC (n=215) and the control group receiving SHTC (n=215). Evaluation will be performed six&#xD;
      months afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary outcomes are: 1) Prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse with any and&#xD;
      specific types of male partners during the 6-month follow up period; 2) uptake of any type of&#xD;
      HIV antibody testing within the 6-month follow-up period, and 3) HIV risk perception.&#xD;

      Aim To evaluate the relative efficacy of an enhanced version of HIV testing and counselling&#xD;
      (EHTC) that combines a component proven effective and new components involving e-health and&#xD;
      HIV risk self-assessment versus standard-of-care HIV testing and counselling (SHTC) in&#xD;
      reducing sexual risk behaviours, and increasing HIV retesting rate and risk perception among&#xD;
      men who have sex with men (MSM) in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To compare outcomes obtained from the intervention group (EHTC) and the control&#xD;
      group (SHTC) at Month 6, including: 1) prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse with any&#xD;
      type and specific types of male sex partners (regular and non-regular partners) in the last&#xD;
      six months, 2) prevalence of having taken up any type of HIV antibody testing within the&#xD;
      6-month follow-up period, and 3) level of HIV risk perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A parallel-group and non-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be&#xD;
      conducted. A total of 430 participants will be randomly allocated into the intervention group&#xD;
      receiving EHTC (n=215) and the control group receiving standard-of-care HTC (SHTC; n=215).&#xD;
      Evaluation will be performed six month afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedures Users of AIDS Concern's HTC service will be approached by staff of&#xD;
      AIDS Concern. They will brief the participants about the detail of the study and invite them&#xD;
      to participate. Prospective participants who are interested in joining the study will be&#xD;
      screened for their eligibility. Guarantees will be made on anonymity, right to quit at any&#xD;
      time and that refusal will not affect their chance in using any services. Verbal instead of&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained due to maintaining anonymity but the fieldworkers&#xD;
      will sign a form pledging that the participants have been fully informed about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline survey and randomization Participants will complete a self-administered baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire on site. Participants are randomized 1:1 into the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group. Staff of the NGO will draw one of the sealed opaque envelops to randomly&#xD;
      allocate participants into the intervention and the control groups. Random numbers will be&#xD;
      generated by a computer. Block randomization with block size of eight will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-test counselling and rapid testing All consented participants in both groups will receive&#xD;
      the same standard-of-care pre-testing counselling, which has currently been provided by the&#xD;
      NGO staff. It takes about five minutes to complete; it covers knowledge on HIV prevention,&#xD;
      risk assessment, and explanation of the procedure and benefits of HTC. A rapid HIV antibody&#xD;
      test (finger prick) will then be performed. Testing results will be known in about 15&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group Participants that are allocated to the control group will receive the&#xD;
      standard-of-care HTC, which includes the previous pre-testing counselling procedures. In the&#xD;
      post-testing counselling, participants will be explained about the negative HIV testing&#xD;
      result (e.g. window period for screening). They will also be reminded about risk of HIV&#xD;
      transmission, and be facilitated to set up specific goals for consistent condom use. The&#xD;
      standard-of-care post-testing counselling lasts for about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group In addition to the steps received by members of the control group, the&#xD;
      intervention group will be exposed to four additional intervention components.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A video clip While waiting for the HIV testing result, participants in the intervention&#xD;
           group will watch a 10-minute video clip presenting the story of a gay man contracting&#xD;
           sexually transmitted diseases in Hong Kong on a tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A pamphlet and post-test counselling promoting HIV retesting During the standard&#xD;
           post-test counselling, the NGO staff will perform additional brief discussions about the&#xD;
           importance of HIV retesting. A pamphlet promoting HIV retesting in the future six months&#xD;
           will be prepared by this study and be distributed to participants after they have&#xD;
           completed viewing the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The e-health HIV risk calculator Through e-mail, SMS or social media means, participants&#xD;
           will be suggested 3 and 5 months after receiving the EHTC to make a self-assessment of&#xD;
           one's own HIV-related risk through an online personalized HIV risk self-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Brief e-health reminder for retesting Brief SMS or social media messages will be sent to&#xD;
           participants at Month 3 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up evaluation Participants of both the intervention and control groups will be&#xD;
      followed up six months after receiving the HTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted. Between-group&#xD;
      (intervention versus control) baseline differences in the frequency distributions of&#xD;
      potential confounders will be compared by using chi-square test, t-test, Mann-Whitney test or&#xD;
      other statistics. The absolute and relative risks and number needed to treat (and their 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals) for the binary primary outcomes comparing the two groups at Months 6&#xD;
      will be derived. Adjusted comparisons between the intervention and control groups will be&#xD;
      made for all binary outcomes, adjusting for any potential confounders showing p&lt;.2 in the&#xD;
      between-group baseline comparisons (if any), using modified Poisson regression with robust&#xD;
      sandwich variance estimation. SPSS 18.0 will be used for data analysis; p&lt;.05 (2-sided) will&#xD;
      be taken as statistically significant. The research team is very experienced in performing&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size planning Assuming the prevalence of UAI with any male partners in the last six&#xD;
      months is 40% in the control group when measured at Month 6, a sample size of 152 per group&#xD;
      allows us to detect a smallest between-group difference of UAI of 15% (power=0.8,&#xD;
      alpha=0.05), taking into an expected 30% loss of follow up at Month 6. A target sample size&#xD;
      of about 215 per group is required. The actual sample size will be 430 (215 for the&#xD;
      intervention group and 215 for the control group).&#xD;
