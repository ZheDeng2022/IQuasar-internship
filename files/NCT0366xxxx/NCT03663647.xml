  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational multicentral retrospective chart review study in patients with&#xD;
      BRAF V600 positive advanced (unresectable or metastatic) cutaneous melanoma, who have treated&#xD;
      by BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) or MEK inhibitors (MEKi) in routine clinical practice in Russia.&#xD;
      300 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not aim to prove any formal hypothesis and does not imply any intervention in&#xD;
      standard medical care, and all medical events recorded during the study have already&#xD;
      occurred. The data sources of this study will be medical records, patients' charts and other&#xD;
      related medical documentation that allows to fully follow the course of the disease and&#xD;
      collect all the necessary information according to Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For identification of molecular genetic markers that cause resistance and sensitivity to&#xD;
      targeted therapy, an analysis of tumor tissue will be provided in the laboratory of&#xD;
      biological microchips &quot;Institute of Molecular Biology. V.A. Engelhardt&quot; of the Russian&#xD;
      Academy of Sciences. The analyzed materials will be paraffin blocks with samples of tumor&#xD;
      tissue of only patients with primary resistance to targeted therapy (inhibitors BRAF / +/-&#xD;
      MEK inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of the study, the Contract Research Organization (CRO) &quot;Crocus Medical B.V.&quot;&#xD;
      will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the data collected are accurate and&#xD;
      credible. Regular monitoring visits include Source Data Verification (SDV) in accordance with&#xD;
      the monitoring plan, monitoring compliance with the research procedures, as well as the&#xD;
      proper and timely maintenance of the main clinical study documents, including the reporting&#xD;
      provided for by the rules of good clinical practice, the legislation of the Russian&#xD;
      Federation and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the CRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be responsible for the collection and provision of all clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data, as well as safety data, that are entered in electronic Case Report Forms&#xD;
      (e-CRF), and must ensure data authenticity and compliance with the primary documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before hard database lock, the database will be inspected in order to reveal missing and&#xD;
      suspicious data. The queries will be generated to correct or fill-in such data. In case the&#xD;
      data failed to refine, their will be considered as missing, no data-imputation methods are&#xD;
      planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the efficacy endpoints of the study is defined as overall survival which represents&#xD;
      the time-to-event data, these data will be analyzed with Kaplan-Meyer method and Cox&#xD;
      regression. Time to event will be defined as a number of days passed from start of treatment&#xD;
      until any-cause death. Patients alive until the end of study will be right-censored by the&#xD;
      end-of-study day or by the day of preliminary withdrawal. Based on Kaplan-Meyer curves the&#xD;
      following parameters would be accessed: median survival, one- and two-year survival. The Cox&#xD;
      regression will include the following covariates: age, sex, baseline therapy, presence of&#xD;
      metastasis in brain, baseline level of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), number of tissues with&#xD;
      metastasis, time from the beginning of the target therapy, etc. Additional covariates could&#xD;
      be also accessed when necessary. The hazard ratio (HR) along with 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      will be evaluated for each covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of categorical efficacy endpoints (number of patients taken different therapies,&#xD;
      objective response rate, number of patients with molecular genetics alterations) will be&#xD;
      performed with chi-square criterion or Fisher's exact test in case of any expected&#xD;
      frequencies below 5. In addition, the logistic regression could be build based on the above&#xD;
      mentioned covariates. The odds ratio (OR) along with 95% confidence interval will be&#xD;
      evaluated for each covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression-free survival (PFS) will be analyzed analogously as described above for the&#xD;
      overall survival data. Time to event will be defined as a number of days passed from&#xD;
      treatment start until either any-cause death or documented disease progression whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. Patients without event will be right-censored by the end-of-study day or by the&#xD;
      day of preliminary withdrawal. Based on Kaplan-Meyer curves the following parameters would be&#xD;
      accessed for all the patients as well as for the subgroups of baseline therapy (target&#xD;
      therapy, immunochemistry, chemotherapy): 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months progression-free&#xD;
      survival. In addition, the PFS will be analyzed for the patients treated with BRAFi as a&#xD;
      monotherapy with successive inclusion of the MEKi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to response and duration of response data will be analyzed similarly. Time to response&#xD;
      will be defined as a number of days passed from treatment start until first documented&#xD;
      response to the therapy. Non-responders will be right-censored by the end-of-study day or by&#xD;
      the day of preliminary withdrawal. This analyses will be conducted for all the patients as&#xD;
      well as for the subgroups of baseline therapy (target therapy, immunochemistry,&#xD;
      chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of the duration of response will be performed only among the responders. Duration of&#xD;
      the response will be defined as a number of days passed from the first documented response&#xD;
      until either any-cause death or documented disease progression whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Patients responding until the study end will be right censored by the end-of-study day or by&#xD;
      the day of preliminary withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on duration of the therapy will be presented with descriptive statistics for each&#xD;
      therapy line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be coded according to MedDRA. Each&#xD;
      AE/SAE will be summarized with counts and frequencies. The data on AE will be tabulated by&#xD;
      System Organ Classes (SOC) and presented with indication their preferred terms (PT) by&#xD;
      baseline therapy and severity. When necessary, the comparison of frequencies of AEs/SAEs&#xD;
      between subgroups will performed with chi-square criterion or Fisher's exact test in case of&#xD;
      any expected frequencies below 5.&#xD;
