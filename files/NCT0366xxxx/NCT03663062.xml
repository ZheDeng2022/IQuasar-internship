  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, around 1 in 16 men and 1 in 20 women will develop bowel cancer at some point in&#xD;
      their lives. Most bowel cancers happen when a type of growth in the bowel called an adenoma&#xD;
      eventually becomes cancerous. Cutting out adenomas reduces the risk of developing bowel&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain people are more likely to have adenomas than others, for example people who are&#xD;
      overweight. People who are overweight are also more likely to develop liver disease by laying&#xD;
      too much fat down in the liver. Studies in Asia have shown that people with fatty liver&#xD;
      disease are more likely to have adenomas and these are more commonly found in the part of the&#xD;
      bowel (right colon) furthest from the bottom end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on the link between obesity, fatty liver disease and adenomas is very limited,&#xD;
      particularly in the Western population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the link between body weight, fatty liver and adenomas in the&#xD;
      UK population. 1430 patients will be invited; some through the bowel cancer screening&#xD;
      programme and some with symptoms such as low blood count, bleeding or changed bowel habit.&#xD;
      These patients will already have been referred for a camera test looking into the bowel,&#xD;
      called a colonoscopy. Information including height, weight and some health questions will be&#xD;
      taken. Blood samples will be taken. The investigators will compare the number of patients&#xD;
      with adenomas who have liver disease or who are overweight with those who don't. This&#xD;
      information will be used to develop a scoring system to predict risk of adenomas. This will&#xD;
      help the investigators to decide if undertaking colonoscopies in these patients will identify&#xD;
      those at increased risk of bowel cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer, or colorectal cancer (CRC), is the second most common cancer affecting both men&#xD;
      and women in England. The majority of CRCs develop from a pre-cancerous type of growth in the&#xD;
      bowel called an adenoma. Detecting and removing these adenomas is important in reducing CRC&#xD;
      risk. A study which undertook a once-off camera examination of the left hand side of the&#xD;
      bowel (flexible sigmoidoscopy), removing any adenomas, demonstrated a reduction in CRC by 23%&#xD;
      and reduced mortality by 31%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a single cause for adenomas is not known, several factors can predispose patients to&#xD;
      adenomas, including; age, gender, family history, cigarette smoking and excess body weight&#xD;
      (EBW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is becoming an increasing problem in the UK, with approximately a quarter of adults&#xD;
      classed as obese in England. Patients who are obese are at higher risk of having adenomas.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that patients with EBW are more likely to have fatty disease of the liver&#xD;
      (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) by laying down fat in the liver. Studies in Asia&#xD;
      have shown that patients with NAFLD are more likely to have adenomas, and that these are more&#xD;
      likely to be in the right side of the bowel which is furthest from the anus (right colon).&#xD;
      Although these studies have shown a link between NAFLD and adenomas, they have all used&#xD;
      invasive or expensive markers of fatty liver disease. No study has correlated the link&#xD;
      between liver enzymes (blood tests) and adenomas or by using scoring systems to determine the&#xD;
      presence or absence of significant fatty liver disease. Furthermore, no Western studies have&#xD;
      confirmed the link between NAFLD and adenomas, meaning it is unclear whether this link is&#xD;
      only present in the Asian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 400,000 colonoscopies (camera examinations of the large bowel) are performed&#xD;
      each year within the NHS for the investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms, including:&#xD;
      altered bowel habit, rectal bleeding and low blood count. When polyps are found, patients&#xD;
      often have a follow-up surveillance colonoscopy to check that no new adenomas have formed.&#xD;
      The timing and need for surveillance is based only on the number and size of adenomas found&#xD;
      and does not take into account any risk factors which the patient may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) invites all individuals aged 60-74 to&#xD;
      undertake a stool sample test which looks for blood, called faecal occult blood testing&#xD;
      (FOBt), every two years. Those who have a positive FOBt are then invited for a colonoscopy.&#xD;
      This programme is purely based on age and is not targeted. Another arm of the BCSP was&#xD;
      introduced in 2013, where all individuals aged 55 are invited for a flexible sigmoidoscopy&#xD;
      and removal of adenomas. Anyone who is felt to be high risk according to the number or size&#xD;
      of adenomas then undergoes a colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BCSP has led to cancers being detected at an earlier stage, but is not protecting the&#xD;
      population against cancers in the right side of the bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, although studies in Asian populations have suggested an association between NAFLD&#xD;
      and colorectal adenomas, this has not been repeated in a Western population. It is important&#xD;
      that the association is explored further in a Western population, in a simple, non-invasive&#xD;
      manner. Assessing markers of NAFLD and a wider range of risk factors for adenomas will allow&#xD;
      us to develop a tool to predict which patients are at increased risk of adenomas, called a&#xD;
      risk model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OSCAR study is a multicentre observational study has been designed which will recruit&#xD;
      1430 participants from nine sites, eight in the North of England who are all members of the&#xD;
      Northern Region Endoscopy Group (NREG) and one from Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust.&#xD;
      NREG is an endoscopy research collaborative group with an excellent track record of&#xD;
      delivering similar endoscopy based research studies to time and target. Participation will&#xD;
      involve collecting information relating to obesity and fatty liver disease in patients&#xD;
      already attending for colonoscopy in addition to collecting information about the number and&#xD;
      size of any adenomas found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients scheduled for colonoscopy will be provided with an invitation letter and patient&#xD;
      information sheet in addition with the standard information about the colonoscopy procedure&#xD;
      that the endoscopy unit provides. As colonoscopy requires a period of preparation prior to&#xD;
      the test, patients will receive this information at least 24 hours before the procedure,&#xD;
      allowing ample time to consider the study before attending the endoscopy department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking part in this study will change very little about the patients' experience of the&#xD;
      colonoscopy test itself. If the patient agrees to take part in this study, the information&#xD;
      sheet will be reviewed with them by a research team member, an opportunity to ask questions&#xD;
      given, and the consent form signed. Eligibility to take part in the study will be checked,&#xD;
      and the patient will be weighed, have their height checked, waist circumference measured,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) calculated and blood pressure checked. A research team member will&#xD;
      undertake a health questionnaire which will include the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Current and previous smoking history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current and previous alcohol history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Current medications: including Aspirin, Statin, Insulin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           drugs (NSAIDs), Diabetic medication, antibiotics and others&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Family history of colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Family history of ischaemic heart disease in a first degree relative under the age of 60&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. History of liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. History of hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. History of diabetes- Type I, Type II&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. History of chronic kidney disease (Stage 4/5)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. History of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. History of rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Personal history of anti-obesity surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be entered onto the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula (a thin, plastic tube which is inserted into a vein in the arm) is&#xD;
      then inserted as part of routine care before the colonoscopy procedure. Blood tests will be&#xD;
      taken from this at the time of insertion to prevent the need for a separate blood test. These&#xD;
      tests will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Full blood count (FBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Fasting blood glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Lipids: Cholesterol, HDL and Triglycerides&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Immunoglobulin A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also need to sign a separate consent form for the colonoscopy procedure itself&#xD;
      as part of routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then enter the procedure room as per usual practice for their colonoscopy.&#xD;
      During the procedure, the research team member will record data onto the CRF (procedural&#xD;
      data, findings at colonoscopy etc). The colonoscopy report will be generated as per the usual&#xD;
      practice in each unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of patients will undergo Fibroscan, which is a non-invasive test to evaluate for&#xD;
      liver fibrosis, to explore the association between the presence of colorectal adenoma/CRC and&#xD;
      the presence of liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, the patient will enter the recovery ward and follow usual practice in&#xD;
      the unit. Although participants will remain in the study for 14 days to allow data collection&#xD;
      and to follow-up any abnormal results, participants will not require any further visits and&#xD;
      the majority will not be contacted by the research team. If a new abnormality is found on&#xD;
      checking blood samples, the patient will be contacted by a member of the research team and&#xD;
      advised to make an appointment with their General Practitioner (GP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be undertaken by Professor Steven Rushton, Professor of Biological&#xD;
      Modelling at Newcastle University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to develop a risk model which can be used to inform&#xD;
      colorectal neoplasia screening and surveillance guidelines and to inform a future study&#xD;
      targeting screening of higher risk individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will support this model by identifying which demographics contribute&#xD;
      to increased predisposition to colorectal neoplasia, namely smoking history, alcohol intake,&#xD;
      and obesity (measured by BMI and waist circumference). The investigators also aim to assess&#xD;
      whether the presence or degree of liver fibrosis, as measured by FIB4 score and Fibroscan&#xD;
      affects the risk of colorectal neoplasia and by exploring the link between NAFLD, obesity and&#xD;
      colorectal neoplasia in terms of adenoma burden, site and histological features. Lastly, the&#xD;
      association between abnormal liver enzymes and colorectal neoplasia will be explored.&#xD;
