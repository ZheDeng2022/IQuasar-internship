  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, childhood overweight and obesity is a public health problem. Although the rising&#xD;
      trend in children's body mass index (BMI) has plateaued in some high-income countries, it has&#xD;
      accelerated in low- and middle-income countries. It is especially true amongst Chinese&#xD;
      children with the annual increase rate of obesity during 2010-2014 greater than any other&#xD;
      periods from 1985 to 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the dramatic economic development in China, children are now growing up in an&#xD;
      increasingly 'obesogenic' environment. For example, the availability and ubiquity of&#xD;
      computers and smart phones promote sedentary time, and access to energy dense food and sugar&#xD;
      sweetened beverages is now widespread. Effective childhood obesity intervention is urgently&#xD;
      needed in China. Although over 20 intervention studies for overweight/obesity among children&#xD;
      and adolescents have been conducted in China since the 1990s, most of them had moderate or&#xD;
      serious methodological weaknesses. For example, they did not report the number of students,&#xD;
      schools or districts initially approached to participate, raising the possibility of&#xD;
      selection and recruitment bias. Additionally, although they stated the allocation of&#xD;
      intervention and control were randomized, no description of the method of randomization was&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the relative lack of high-quality interventions for childhood overweight/obesity, the&#xD;
      investigators designed a cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      multicomponent one-academic-year intervention among 24 primary schools (approximately 1200&#xD;
      students) in the eastern (Beijing), middle (Shanxi) and western (Xinjiang) part of China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to identify: 1) whether the school-based intervention will be effective for&#xD;
      preventing excessive weight gain among children; 2) whether the intervention will be&#xD;
      beneficial for improving healthy eating, physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors&#xD;
      among children.&#xD;

                  estimated number of students enrolled in the programme is no less than 40 within&#xD;
                  the selected class; two classes per school will be selected if the estimated&#xD;
                  number of students enrolled in the programme is less than 40 within the selected&#xD;
                  class.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Eligibility criteria for students Eligible children will be those whose&#xD;
                  primary caregivers will provide written consent to participate the study. After&#xD;

                  individuals suffering from or having a history of any cardiovascular and&#xD;
                  metabolic diseases, asthma and disabilities that limit their ability to perform&#xD;
                  physical activity.&#xD;
