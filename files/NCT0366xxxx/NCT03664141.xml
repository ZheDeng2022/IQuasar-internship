    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in two parts: 1) The pharmacokinetic (PK) part and 2) The&#xD;
      appetite and nutritional evaluation part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK part of study will be conducted in open label manner on 10 end stage kidney disease&#xD;
      (ESKD) patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) treatment. For the PK part, a&#xD;
      starting dose of cannabis oil -1 drop of 3% cannabis oil once a day [each drop contain 1.2 mg&#xD;
      CBD (cannabidiol) and 1.2 mg of ∆9-THC (∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol)], was judged to be safe for&#xD;
      a first-in-MHD patient's administration. Escalation to the next higher dose and any dose&#xD;
      adjustments of the next dose levels will be based on safety and tolerability results of the&#xD;
      previously administered dose and available PK data of previous dose groups. Once the first&#xD;
      dosage proved to be safe, there will be a 2 fold increase from the first dose level (2 drops&#xD;
      once a day) to the second dose level. The dose levels will be increased by 2-fold from the&#xD;
      previous dose level, until basal hunger and prospective consumption ratings assessed by the&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) will increase at least by 10 mm between screening and the study&#xD;
      visits (change-from-baseline) . PK parameters will be evaluated after first dosage&#xD;
      administration and after dosage increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appetite and nutritional evaluation part of study will be conducted as a 3-month,&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single center study. The study population&#xD;
      will include 30 ESKD patients receiving MHD treatment with different degrees of&#xD;
      protein-energy wasting (PEW) defined as malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS) above 6. A&#xD;
      total of 30 subjects will be randomized to treatment with either cannabis oil or matching&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in appetite assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>For 5 months from the day of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>VAS, 100 mm in length with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive (=100) and the most negative rating (=0), will be used to assess specific domains of appetite separately: hunger, satiety, fullness, prospective food consumption. Each domain will be measured by the 0-100mm scale as mentioned above.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nutritional status assessed by the Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS).</measure>
    <time_frame>For 5 months from the day of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>MIS consists of four sections (nutritional history, physical examination, body mass index [BMI], and laboratory values) and 10 components. Each MIS component has four levels of severity from 0 (normal) to 3 (very severe). The sum of all 10 components results in an overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 30 (severely malnourished).</description>

    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life assessed by short form 36 (SF-36) quality of life (QoL) scoring system</measure>
    <time_frame>For 5 months from the day of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 consists of 36 questions, 35 of which are compressed into eight multi-item scales:&#xD;
(1) physical functioning; (2) role-physical (3) bodily pain ; (4) general health; (5) vitality ; (6) social functioning (7) role-emotional and (8) mental health. In the SF36 scoring system, the scales are assessed quantitatively, each on the basis of answers to two to ten multiple choice questions, and a score between 0 and 100 is then calculated on the basis of well-defined guidelines, with a higher score indicating a better state of health.</description>
