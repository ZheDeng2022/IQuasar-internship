  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weakness in the arm is common after stroke and can affect stroke survivors' ability to&#xD;
      perform some tasks. Studies show that extra sessions of arm exercise can help them to improve&#xD;
      their arm function and that the first 3 months is the best time to gain these benefits. A&#xD;
      website (www.webbasedphysio.com) has been developed and evaluated for delivering and&#xD;
      monitoring physiotherapy exercise programmes. This website has been modified for people after&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess if doing extra physiotherapy for the arm through our&#xD;
      web-based physio website gives any extra benefits to the usual physiotherapy received on the&#xD;
      ward. A total of 30 stroke survivors will be recruited from the acute stroke unit of&#xD;
      Hairmyres Hospital, NHS Lanarkshire, and will be randomised into two groups: intervention&#xD;
      (15) and control (15). The control group will receive usual care and the intervention group&#xD;
      will receive usual care plus an augmented and individualised 4 weeks upper limb exercise&#xD;
      programme delivered by the web-based physio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The augmented programme will comprise upper limb and trunk exercises. The duration and&#xD;
      intensity of the programme will be based on participants' level of functional ability. For&#xD;
      participants with low exercise capacity, the overall time of the exercise will be less to&#xD;
      begin with and will build up over time to 30 minutes, five sessions per week (including&#xD;
      weekends), in addition to their usual physiotherapy care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments will be at baseline, and four weeks post-intervention or just before stroke&#xD;
      survivors are discharged, if earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the feedback from physiotherapy staff, stroke survivors in the&#xD;
      intervention group and their carer on the augmented web-based physiotherapy will be evaluated&#xD;
      qualitatively and quantitatively by three questionnaires.&#xD;

      Study Design The study design is a randomised controlled feasibility study comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of usual care plus an augmented upper limb exercise programme delivered by a&#xD;
      web-based physio website versus usual care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The study will recruit from the acute stroke unit of Hairmyres Hospital, NHS&#xD;
      Lanarkshire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke survivors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy staff in the stroke rehabilitation unit will identify 30 participants from the&#xD;
      stroke ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be given a participant information leaflet by a member of the&#xD;
      physiotherapy staff and, in addition, a participant information leaflet for their carers, if&#xD;
      appropriate. Potential participants will contact the Principal Investigator or the&#xD;
      physiotherapy staff themselves if they would like to take part in the study. If they would&#xD;
      like to take part in the study, the Principal Investigator will see them in the stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation unit, where participants will be assessed for their eligibility to participate&#xD;
      in the study and they and/or their carers will have the opportunity to ask further questions.&#xD;
      If participants then agree to take part in the study, they will be asked to sign a consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who provide their informed consent will undergo baseline measures (week 0). The&#xD;
      following outcome measures will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
      (mRS) Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS). Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomised to either the Intervention or Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the control group will receive usual physiotherapy care only. Normally,&#xD;
      usual physiotherapy care is provided by physiotherapists and assistant physiotherapists, if&#xD;
      needed, for an average of 4 to 5 sessions per week, each lasting approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
      Physiotherapists provide one to one rehabilitation session based on the Bobath technique and&#xD;
      the sessions are focused more on the lower limb. A leaflet about recommended upper limb&#xD;
      exercises is provided to stroke survivors who demonstrate an ability to perform exercises&#xD;
      without supervision and do not suffer from shoulder subluxation, as assessed by physiotherapy&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will undertake a progressive, individualised 4 weeks&#xD;
      upper limb physiotherapy intervention delivered via web-based physiotherapy in addition to&#xD;
      usual care. The individualised exercise programme will be provided by a physiotherapist and&#xD;
      will be based on clinical assessment, their goals and level of upper limb function. The&#xD;
      augmented programme will comprise upper limb and trunk exercises. The duration and intensity&#xD;
      of the programme will be based on participants' level of functional ability. For participants&#xD;
      with low exercise capacity, the overall time of the exercise will be less to begin with and&#xD;
      will build up over time to 30 minutes, five sessions per week (including weekends) in&#xD;
      addition to their usual physiotherapy care. All participants in this group will receive an&#xD;
      explanation of how to use the website, and each participant will be given individual log in&#xD;
      details to access his/her exercises and educational section. Physiotherapists will review and&#xD;
      revise the progress of each participant once a week and make any necessary changes to their&#xD;
      programme. Participants may contact the research team at any time during the study to ask any&#xD;
      questions related to the website or contact physiotherapists to request a change in their&#xD;
      programme. If participants have communication difficulties, where appropriate, an explanation&#xD;
      of how to access and use the web-based physio site will be provided to their carers who will&#xD;
      then support the stroke survivors to undertake their exercise programme. In addition, an&#xD;
      aphasia-friendly version of the website will be available to them. Participants in this group&#xD;
      will use their own tablets/laptop to access their programme. However, if they do not have an&#xD;
      internet enabled device, they will be provided with tablets and internet access for the&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be assessed post-intervention (week 5) with the ARAT, TIS,&#xD;
      MAS and MTS assessment tools. If stroke survivors in either group are discharged before the&#xD;
      end of the 4 week intervention period, the post-intervention assessment will take place&#xD;
      before their discharge. In addition, stroke survivors in the intervention group will complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire, providing feedback on the augmented web-based physiotherapy intervention.&#xD;
      The number, duration and content of all standard physiotherapy sessions will be recorded for&#xD;
      both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy staff:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit up to 5 participants from the acute stroke unit. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator will identify participants from the stroke rehabilitation unit. The&#xD;
      physiotherapy staff will be informed of the study by the Principal Investigator. If they&#xD;
      would like to take part in the study, there are few things that they will be asked to do,&#xD;
      before, during and at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of the study, the Principal Investigator will attend to the stroke unit to&#xD;
      explain the study and demonstrate the web-based physiotherapy website&#xD;
      (www.webbasedphysio.com), and they will be given an opportunity to ask questions about the&#xD;
      study. They then will be asked to sign a consent form. After that, they will receive training&#xD;
      in the use of the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study starts, the physiotherapists will be asked to do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approach potential participants (stroke survivors and carers) from the stroke ward by&#xD;
           contacting the researcher and distributing the participant information sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the stroke survivors who have been allocated to the intervention group and set up&#xD;
           an individualised arm exercise programme for each participant. The rehabilitation&#xD;
           programme needs to build up in a gradual manner to reach a point where the stroke&#xD;
           survivors are able to perform these exercises for 30 minutes each session, 5 times a&#xD;
           week, in addition to the physiotherapy care that they receive while on the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the stroke survivor participants' rehabilitation programmes once a week and&#xD;
           revise as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respond, as appropriate, to any requests from participants to change to their programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the Principal Investigator will ask them to complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire related to their experience of monitoring the stroke survivor in the use of the&#xD;
      web-based physiotherapy website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit up to 15 participants from the acute stroke unit. The physiotherapy&#xD;
      staff in the stroke rehabilitation unit will identify participants from the stroke ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be given a participant information leaflet by a member of the&#xD;
      physiotherapy staff. Potential participants will contact the Principal Investigator or the&#xD;
      physiotherapy staff themselves if they would like to take part in the study. If they would&#xD;
      like to take part in the study, the Principal Investigator will see them in the stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation unit, where participants will be assessed for their eligibility to participate&#xD;
      in the study and they will have the opportunity to ask further questions. If participants&#xD;
      then agree to take part in the study, they will be asked to sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapists will give them an explanation of how to access and use the website to&#xD;
      support the stroke survivor participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the Principal Investigator will ask them to complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire related to their experience of supporting the stroke survivor participants in&#xD;
      doing their exercises through the web-based physiotherapy website.&#xD;
