  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a randomized, double-blind, two-part, dose-ascending, multicenter study of&#xD;
      AR-501 (gallium citrate) solution, administered via inhalation, in healthy adult and P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa infected cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects. Phase 1 of the study in HV subjects will&#xD;
      consist of a single-ascending-dose (SAD) cohort, followed by the HV multiple-ascending-dose&#xD;
      (MAD) cohort. Phase 2a of the study in CF subjects will consist of a MAD study design. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single and repeat&#xD;
      administrations of inhaled AR-501 solution in healthy adults, and the safety, PK and efficacy&#xD;
      of repeat administrations of inhaled AR-501 solution in P. aeruginosa infected CF subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three dose levels (low, medium and high) will be assessed in succession, first in healthy&#xD;
      volunteer (HV) subjects, then in cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects. The study will be performed&#xD;
      in 2 parts: Phase 1 part of the study in HV subjects will consist of a single-ascending-dose&#xD;
      (SAD) cohort, followed by the HV multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) cohort. Phase 2a part of the&#xD;
      study in CF subjects will consist of a MAD study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HV cohort will include up to 48 subjects. The CF cohort will have 42 subjects. Thus, the&#xD;
      total number of subjects is 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1 HV study will be performed at a Phase 1 Clinical Study Unit and the Phase 2a will&#xD;
      be performed at approximately 24 clinical trial sites located in the United States and&#xD;
      possibly in Europe, some of which may be part of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation&#xD;
      (CFF)-accredited Therapeutic Development Network (TDN) or the European Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Society Clinical Trial Network (ECFS-CTN). Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      including giving informed consent, will be enrolled and undergo a screening period of 28&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HV cohort will include up to 24 adult subjects in 3 dose groups (8 per dose group [Low,&#xD;
      Medium and High]) for the SAD phase of the study. In each dose group, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to the active drug or placebo, resulting in 6 subjects&#xD;
      receiving inhaled AR-501 and 2 receiving inhaled placebo in a double-blind manner. The HV MAD&#xD;
      phase of the study will include 24 adult subjects in 3 dose groups (8 per dose group [Low,&#xD;
      Medium and High]). In each dose group, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to&#xD;
      active study drug or placebo, resulting in 6 subjects receiving inhaled AR-501 and 2&#xD;
      receiving inhaled placebo in a double-blind manner. All subjects in HV MAD cohorts will&#xD;
      receive once weekly inhaled study drug (either AR-501 or matching placebo) for 4 weeks for a&#xD;
      total of 5 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CF MAD cohort will evaluate 3 different dose levels for a total of 42 adult CF. Of the 42&#xD;
      subjects, 30 will be randomized to receive one of the three ascending doses of AR-501, while&#xD;
      12 will be randomized to receive placebo. All subjects in CF cohorts will receive once weekly&#xD;
      inhaled study drug (either AR-501 or matching placebo) for 2 weeks for a total of 3 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess preliminary clinical safety of inhaled AR-501.&#xD;
      The true frequency of AEs is unknown, and the sample size cannot be estimated accurately. For&#xD;
      unknown AEs, the probabilities of observing at least 1 AE among 36 total healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects and 30 adult CF subjects receiving any AR-501 dose are ≥ 80% if the true rate of&#xD;
      such events are at least 4.4% and 4.8% respectively.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a dose-escalation, placebo-controlled study where subjects are randomized to receive either study drug or placebo.&#xD;
SAD Phase:&#xD;
The HV cohort will include up to 24 adult subjects in 3 groups (8 per dose group). In each dose group, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single administration of active drug (6 HVs) or placebo (2 HVs).&#xD;
MAD Phase:&#xD;
The HV cohort will include 24 adult HVs in 3 dose groups (8 per dose group). In each dose group, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to active drug (6 HVs) or placebo (2 HVs).&#xD;
The CF MAD will evaluate 3 different dose levels in a total of 42 adult CF subjects (10 per dose level). The first 6 subjects (sentinel subjects) in each dose level will be randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive either AR-501 or placebo for three weeks. The remaining 24 adult CF subjects will be randomized at a 1:1:1:1 ratio to sequentially three doses of inhaled AR-501 or placebo for a total of 3 weekly doses.</intervention_model_description>
