  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, cancer incidence increases over the course of life and therefore it is considered&#xD;
      as an important pathology of the elderly. Cancers are the second leading cause of death for&#xD;
      patients over 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, 233,343 new cases of cancer were estimated for patients of 65 years and over (60.9%&#xD;
      of estimated cancers of all ages), 42,547 new cases for older people over 85 years old (about&#xD;
      11% of all diagnosed cancer cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the expected aging of the population in the coming years, the number of patients over&#xD;
      the age of 70 will continue to increase. Life expectancy will also increase (12 years for the&#xD;
      people above 75 years old and more than 8 years for the people above 80 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elderly are a heterogeneous population. Some people age well with few chronic diseases&#xD;
      and a preserved autonomy. Others have several pathologies, geriatric syndromes (malnutrition,&#xD;
      functional disorders, sensory deficits or psycho-cognitive diseases). Poly-medication is&#xD;
      therefore common with an increased risk of iatrogenic disease. All these factors, in addition&#xD;
      to social and economic conditions, determine the health status of the elderly. The presence&#xD;
      of comorbidities decreases life expectancy and may itself be a contraindication to treatment.&#xD;
      Patients in this age group are therefore particularly exposed to the risks of over- or&#xD;
      under-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multidisciplinary team meeting (RCP) is widely used for decision making in oncology.&#xD;
      Various official texts govern it (Plan Cancer, HAS). However, the onco-geriatric decision is&#xD;
      usually only a complementary opinion after a RCP of a specific organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2006, the E. Herriot Hospital's Multidisciplinary team meeting has been organized to&#xD;
      discuss cases of patients over 70 years old. The specificity is the association of a real&#xD;
      multidisciplinary geriatric oncology discussion. The latter between medical specialist :&#xD;
      geriatrician, oncologist, surgeon, radiotherapist, pharmacist, onco-geriatric nurse allows&#xD;
      the development of an appropriate individualized therapeutic project for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onco-geriatric multidisciplinary team is implementing a descriptive study of the RCP for&#xD;
      the management of patients above 70 with cancer. The Regional Network of Oncology&#xD;
      Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is a partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to describe the feasibility of the assessment of the follow-up of&#xD;
      onco-geriatric recommendations 4 months after the onco-geriatric RCP of E. Herriot Hospital&#xD;
      concerning patients with or with suspicion of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are : 1/ To describe the process of RCP: participants, patient's&#xD;
      characteristics and conclusions with recommendations, 2/ To assess the implementation of&#xD;
      oncological and geriatric recommendations 4 months after RCP 3/ To assess the survival,&#xD;
      autonomy and quality of life of patients 4 months after RCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that onco-geriatric RCP's recommendations improve the outcome for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to ensure that the assessment of the recommendations'&#xD;
      follow-up at 4 months is feasible.&#xD;

A phone call is made to the patient to evaluate the follow-up of the oncological and geriatric recommendations defined during the RCP along with their survival, autonomy and quality of life.</description>
