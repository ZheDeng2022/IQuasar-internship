  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to connect patients with community resources to&#xD;
      improve social determinants of health. Secondary objectives are improving patient&#xD;
      satisfaction within the trauma and general surgery service, enhancement of physician-patient&#xD;
      communication, betterment of surgery department Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare&#xD;
      Providers and Systems scores, and increased understanding of correlations between patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and social determinants of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (1) directed screening and intervention can have a&#xD;
      positive effect for patients and hospitals, (2) directed patient advocacy will have an effect&#xD;
      on patients' perception of care, (2) social determinants of health will have an effect on&#xD;
      patients' perception of care, and (4) traumatic injury and acute surgery will have an effect&#xD;
      on patients' perception of care.&#xD;

      The investigators will be conducting this study as a prospective, non-randomized quality&#xD;
      improvement study that will look at patients 18 years of age and older who are admitted under&#xD;
      the trauma and general surgery specialties. Patients will be identified through admission to&#xD;
      the trauma or general surgery service or referred to surgery services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be identified and approached by the study team. Once the informed&#xD;
      consent is completed, patients will be given a Social Determinants of Health Screening Tool,&#xD;
      an Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Feedback Tool, and an&#xD;
      short form health survey (SF-12) Quality of Life Questionnaire. Feedback from the Hospital&#xD;
      Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems results will be given immediately to&#xD;
      the relevant teams (nurses, doctors, etc.) to address the patient's concerns. Prior to&#xD;
      discharge, the patients will also be given referrals to designated community resources. On&#xD;
      day 15 (+/- 7 days) after discharge, the patients will receive a follow up phone call where&#xD;
      they will be asked if they have utilized the Social Determinants of Health Referrals.&#xD;
      Participants will also be given a second Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers&#xD;
      and Systems Feedback Survey at this time. On day 30 (+/- 7 days) after discharge, the&#xD;
      patients will receive a follow up phone call where the participants will be asked if they&#xD;
      utilized the Social Determinants of Health Referrals. Participants will also be given a&#xD;
      second short form health survey (SF-12) Quality of Life Survey at this time.&#xD;
