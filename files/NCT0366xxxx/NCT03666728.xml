  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody. This is a Phase II, multicenter,&#xD;
      open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 with BP102 in&#xD;
      subjects who are chemotherapy naive and have Stage IIIB~IV non-squamous NSCLC. The primary&#xD;
      end points are ORR and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, subjects will receive SHR-1210 combined with BP102 until progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity (SHR-1210 or BP102 for a maximum of 2 years).&#xD;
