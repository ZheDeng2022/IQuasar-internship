  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Discrimination between cardiac and non-cardiac causes of dyspnea can be challenging, causing&#xD;
      excessive delay before adequate therapy. In clinical practice lung ultrasound (LUS) is&#xD;
      becoming an easy and reliable noninvasive tool for the evaluation of dyspnea and can shorten&#xD;
      the time to diagnosis .However the reproductibility of this test was not extensively studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is one of the most distressing situations for the patient . Emergency cases do not&#xD;
      always present in conditions that are ideal for immediate diagnosis, which sometimes&#xD;
      compromises outcome. Physical examination, laboratory findings and radiography are imperfect,&#xD;
      resulting in a need for sophisticated test results that delay management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasonography is becoming a standard tool in critical cases in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators aim to perform ultrasonography on consecutive patients admitted to the ICU&#xD;
      with dyspnea, comparing lung ultrasonography results on initial presentation with the final&#xD;
      diagnosis by the ICU team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal A lines or vertical B lines indicating&#xD;
      interstitial syndrome), lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion,&#xD;
      these items were grouped to assess ultrasound profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assesses the potential of lung ultrasonography to diagnose heart failure.The&#xD;
      second aim of this study was to evaluate the inter-observer reproducibility of LUS performed&#xD;
      by ED residents in the evaluation of cardiac causes of acute dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea will be prospectively enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. In each patient, LUS was performed by two ED residents blinded to clinical diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AHF was determined on the base of clinical exam, chest x-ray , brain natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (BNP) and echocardiographic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient lung comet score (LCS) was obtained by summing the number of comets in each of the&#xD;
      scanned spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the probability of AHF was defined as :&#xD;
&#xD;
      low probability (LCS&lt;15) intermediate probability (15 &lt;LCS&lt;30), and high probability (LCS&gt;30&#xD;
      ).&#xD;
