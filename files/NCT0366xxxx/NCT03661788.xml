    <textblock>
      Attention deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder which manifests in childhood&#xD;
      but often persists through adulthood. The most prominent symptoms in adults are inattention,&#xD;
      emotional instability, disorganized behavior, impulsivity and restlessness, which cause&#xD;
      several restrictions in different areas of life. It is suggested that those symptoms can be&#xD;
      attributed to a general deficit in inhibitory control. This hypothesis is supported by&#xD;
      several studies revealing that patients with ADHD show poor performance completing inhibitory&#xD;
      control tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, studies showed that a unique administration of atomoxetin (ATX) significantly&#xD;
      improves inhibitory control in patients with ADHD as well as in healthy participtants. In&#xD;
      contrast to other medication authorized for the treatment of patients with ADHD, does ATX has&#xD;
      no risk for potential addiction. Due its indirect mode of action, ATX has a delayed effect&#xD;
      occurence taking up to 2 weeks. However, this apects was unconsidered in those studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although we directly often associate failures in cognitive control with disruptions at&#xD;
      prefrontal areas of the brain, there exists a specific brain network which is called the&#xD;
      default mode network (DMN), which is suggested to be at least partly responsibe for the ADHD&#xD;
      symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study is interested in which way a 2- week intake of ATX affects the DMN and&#xD;
      surrounding networks in their connectivity during a inhibitory control task and during rest&#xD;
      in patients with ADHD vs controls.&#xD;
