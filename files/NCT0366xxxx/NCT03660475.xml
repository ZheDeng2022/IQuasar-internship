  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this exploratory study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 0.002%&#xD;
      Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, compared to placebo for the treatment of the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of dry eye in diabetic subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      compare the safety and efficacy of Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002% to placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye in diabetic subjects. Subjects eligible to be&#xD;
      randomized will receive one of the following treatments to be administered bilaterally BID&#xD;
      for 29 days (from Visit 2 to Visit 5): Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002% or Placebo&#xD;
      Ophthalmic Solution (Vehicle). During a 10-day study run-in period (for the purpose of&#xD;
      subject selection) prior to randomization, all subjects will receive Placebo Ophthalmic&#xD;
      Solution (Vehicle) bilaterally BID. Participants who terminate early during the application&#xD;
      period will be asked to complete safety assessments (if the participants agree) prior to&#xD;
      study exit. Participants who are terminated early from the study will not be replaced.&#xD;
