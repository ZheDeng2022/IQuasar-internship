      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Surgery is still&#xD;
      the main treatment for rectal cancer. With the popularization of stapler technology and the&#xD;
      application of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, more and more patients with rectal cancer&#xD;
      have treated sphincter preservation surgery for rectal cancer. postoperative observation&#xD;
      found that some patients with rectal cancer anus-preserving surgery had different degrees of&#xD;
      defecation dysfunction after surgery, such as incontinence, tightness, increased frequency of&#xD;
      bowel movements, and constipation. These clinical symptoms have been classified as &quot;Low&#xD;
      anterior resection syndrome (LARS)&quot; in recent years.Now there is no treatment for&#xD;
      LARS.Meanwhile,J-pouch and side-to-end anastomosis can help the patients,but there is few&#xD;
      trials can prove this.This trial means to prove weather side-to-end anastomosis can improve&#xD;
      bowel of rectal patients afer surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. There are more&#xD;
      than 1.7 million new cases worldwide each year, accounting for 9.7% of all cancers. Among&#xD;
      them, 840,000 deaths, accounting for 8.5% of all cancer deaths, mortality Second only to lung&#xD;
      cancer, liver cancer and gastric cancer. China is a country with high incidence of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, and its morbidity and mortality are the fifth highest in malignant tumors. Rectal&#xD;
      cancer is the most common type of colorectal cancer. The incidence of rectal cancer in China&#xD;
      is 14.0/100,000, which is the 7th cancer incidence rate in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is still the main treatment for rectal cancer. With the popularization of stapler&#xD;
      technology and the application of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, more and more patients&#xD;
      with rectal cancer have treated sphincter preservation surgery for rectal cancer. The&#xD;
      proportion of permanent ostomy has dropped to 16.9% to 29% . With the popularity of TME&#xD;
      principles worldwide, the standardized treatment of rectal cancer is becoming more and more&#xD;
      stable, and the postoperative survival rate of patients is steadily increasing. However,&#xD;
      postoperative observation found that some patients with rectal cancer anus-preserving surgery&#xD;
      had different degrees of defecation dysfunction after surgery, such as incontinence,&#xD;
      tightness, increased frequency of bowel movements, and constipation. These clinical symptoms&#xD;
      have been classified as &quot;Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS)&quot; in recent years. The&#xD;
      research on LARS is still in its infancy, and its pathogenesis, influencing factors,&#xD;
      pathophysiology and other explorations are not deep enough. Behind the various symptoms of&#xD;
      low anterior resection syndrome is a complex pathophysiological basis. The symptoms and&#xD;
      severity are affected by many changes in intestinal anatomy, nerve injury, postoperative&#xD;
      healing process, diet structure and psychological status. The risk factors associated with&#xD;
      the onset of defecation dysfunction after rectal cancer anal sphincter preservation include&#xD;
      radiotherapy, total mesorectal excision, and tumor location. The role of various risk factors&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of defecation dysfunction after rectal cancer anal sphincter preservation&#xD;
      is still controversial. At present, the diagnosis, grading and treatment of LARS are still in&#xD;
      the exploration stage, and there is still no effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1980s, a variety of colon-rectal anastomosis methods have been used in clinical&#xD;
      practice to improve the dysfunction of rectal cancer after anal sphincter preservation,&#xD;
      including J-pouch anastomosis, Colon transverse anastomosis, and end-to-side anastomosis.&#xD;
      Each of the above three methods has its advantages and disadvantages: J-type storage bag&#xD;
      improves the postoperative bowel movement anastomosis effect, but the technique is&#xD;
      complicated and has more anastomotic symptoms; the colon transverse of the colon has a wide&#xD;
      application range but the effect of improving the defecation function is poor; It has the&#xD;
      longest history, but the time to apply to functional protection is the shortest, and there&#xD;
      are few studies. Huttner et al published a meta-analysis published in 2015 (including 1636&#xD;
      cases from 21 clinical trials reports. Compared with end-to-end anastomosis, J-pouch can&#xD;
      reduce the frequency of defecation and antidiarrheal drugs after 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
      Similar results have been achieved with end-to-side anastomosis and colonic angioplasty; a&#xD;
      review published by Brown et al also suggests that J-pouch can reduce the frequency of&#xD;
      defecation and urgency of bowel movements during early (0-8 months) and mid-term (8-18&#xD;
      Months) .The end-to-side anastomosis achieved similar effects in each stage of the J-pouch,&#xD;
      so it can be inferred that the end-to-side anastomosis (relative to end-to-end anastomosis)&#xD;
      can improve postoperative defecation function. A retrospective study of end-to-end&#xD;
      anastomosis and end-to-end anastomosis published in China also found that end-to-side&#xD;
      anastomosis can reduce bowel movements and improve postoperative defecation function at 6&#xD;
      months after surgery. However, there is still no prospective clinical trial comparing the&#xD;
      end-to-side anastomosis and end-to-end anastomosis for postoperative intestinal function. The&#xD;
      ideal anastomosis should meet the characteristics of exact effect, simple operation and low&#xD;
      complications. The end-to-side anastomosis is one of the potential choices, but its validity&#xD;
      and safety lack relevant research evidence and need further study.&#xD;
