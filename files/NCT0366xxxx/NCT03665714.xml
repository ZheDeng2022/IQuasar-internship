  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Impact Oral in Patients undergoing&#xD;
      Surgery for Gastrointestinal Cancer, half of the participants will receive Impact Oral&#xD;
      nutrition therapy, the other half will receive Enteral Nutrition Emulsion(TPF-T) therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol describes a randomized, active-controlled, open labelled study in which&#xD;
      either IMPACT Oral or Enteral Nutrition Emulsion(TPF-T) will be given to surgical patients&#xD;
      for 5 days before surgery and 7 days after surgery. Both of the study products include&#xD;
      immunonutrition, but the nutrient proportion is different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prealbumin, C-reaction protein (CRP), Albumin，immunology parameters, the results of physical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, relevant nutrition- and safety-related laboratory parameters and&#xD;
      the number, severity, seriousness, relatedness and outcome of Adverse Events (AEs) will be&#xD;
      evaluated in this study.&#xD;
