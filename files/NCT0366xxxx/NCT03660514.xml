  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to conduct a small matched cluster control trial of&#xD;
      an intervention designed to address reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancy (ARCHES -&#xD;
      Addressing Reproductive Coercion within Healthcare Settings) adapted to the Mexican cultural&#xD;
      and family planning healthcare context ( renamed Jovenes Sanos) in order to provide initial&#xD;
      data regarding acceptability, feasibility and efficacy in this high need&#xD;
      low-and-middle-income country.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project consortium will implement the ARCHES model across two community health centers in&#xD;
      Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. A 2-armed pilot study of ARCHES (adapted) will be conducted&#xD;
      with 80 female FP clients (40 intervention, 40 control) ages 16-20 drawn from 2 comparable&#xD;
      community health centers randomly assigned to either intervention or control (i.e. standard&#xD;
      of care). Baseline data will be collected prior to routine FP service delivery, with a short&#xD;
      exit survey conducted immediately following the clients' FP appointment (ARCHES or standard&#xD;
      FP counseling will be provided during this visit). Follow-up data will be collected at&#xD;
      3-months post-intervention. Data at each time point will be collected via a 30-minute audio&#xD;
      computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) in Spanish. Data will also be collected to assess&#xD;
      qualities of program implementation (i.e., process evaluation) to ensure implementation of&#xD;
      the program as intended as well as unforeseen barriers to implementation. Creation of&#xD;
      procedures for data collection, review of quality control data, and interpretation of&#xD;
      findings will occur in collaboration with the entire mentoring/training committee. In-depth&#xD;
      interviews (IDIs) with female adolescent FP clients ages 16-20 with a recent IPV/RC (n= 20),&#xD;
      and focus groups (FGs) (n=2; 6-8 participants per group) with FP counselors in 2 comparable&#xD;
      urban community health centers to identify perceptions of prevalence and impact of IPV and RC&#xD;
      among adolescent clients and barriers to identifying IPV and RC. FGs with FP counselors from&#xD;
      the participating community health centers will be conducted (n=2; 6-8 participants per&#xD;
      group). FP counselors from these community health centers will be purposely selected to&#xD;
      participate based on having provided FP services for at least 10 female adolescent clients in&#xD;
      the past 6 months. At intervention sites, FP counselors will deliver the intervention&#xD;
      integrated into standard-of-care practice; at control sites FP counselors will deliver solely&#xD;
      standard-of-care services. Analyses specific to participants ages 16-20 will provide findings&#xD;
      to guide consideration of ARCHES as an effective strategy to improve the reproductive health&#xD;
      and reduce GBV among adolescents in this region.&#xD;

    <description>RC consisted of two elements, pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage. Pregnancy coercion was assessed using via 5 dichotomous items. Birth control sabotage was assessed via 5 dichotomous items measuring experiences of partner interference with contraception to promote pregnancy.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior 3 months and prior 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recent IPV is defined as violence in the past 3 months and Past IPV as violence in the past 12 months with participant's primary partner. a) Physical IPV: &quot;pushed, pulled, slapped, held you down; punched you with fist or something that could hurt you; kicked or dragged you; tried to strangle or burn you; threatened you with a knife, gun, other weapon; attacked you with knife, gun, other weapon?&quot; b) Sexual IPV: &quot;used verbal threats to force you to have sex; physically forced you to have sex; or coerced you to perform other sexual acts when you did not want to?&quot;.</description>
