  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test a food supplement to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Show that the food supplement is well tolerated and safe to feed to infants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find out how often parents/caregivers feed their infants the food supplement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find out how parents/caregivers usually add the food supplement to infants' regular&#xD;
           solid or liquid food; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn what aspects of the food supplement are more or less attractive to infants and to&#xD;
           parents/caregivers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves parents/caregivers of infants, ≥ 5 months but &lt; 11 months of age. Parents&#xD;
      who enrolled their infants complete a 1-month blinded placebo run-in period, followed by&#xD;
      randomization to placebo or the food supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period, infants randomized to the food supplement are fed a once&#xD;
      daily, individual packet of the food supplement mixed into liquid (e.g., breast milk, infant&#xD;
      formula) or solid (e.g., applesauce, pureed carrots) foods being fed to the infant. The food&#xD;
      supplement is a blend of 16 common allergenic proteins ([oat, milk, egg, sesame, wheat]&#xD;
      [almond cashew, hazelnut, peanut, pecan, pistachios, soy, walnut] [cod, shrimp, salmon])&#xD;
      combined with 400 IU of Vitamin D3. Parents complete a daily diary about any reactions or&#xD;
      symptoms within 2 hours of ingesting the food supplement. Infants randomized to the placebo&#xD;
      are also fed a once daily individual packet of the placebo mixed into liquid or solid foods&#xD;
      being fed to the infant. Parents also complete a daily diary about any reactions or symptoms&#xD;
      within 2 hours of ingesting the placebo.&#xD;
