      This research aims to evaluate a new mode of care for precarious public through a&#xD;
      medico-social mediation device after emergencies, with the aim of improving their care and to&#xD;
      prevent possible complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of management by a medico-social&#xD;
      mediation device set up within 48 hours after leaving emergency on the 90-day emergency&#xD;
      readmission rate. people living in precarious situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      prospective randomized interventional trial with two arms. Patients will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing precariousness, quality of life, health literacy, and time&#xD;
      perspective. Eligible patients (726 subjects) are randomized : control group (usual&#xD;
      management) or experimental group (patient is contacted within 48 hours by a medico-social&#xD;
      mediator familiar with the territory), and followed for 90 days by the latter, in order to&#xD;
      optimize and secure the care path.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readmissions are identified from emergency database and Regional Emergency Terminal and&#xD;

      Patients in the experimental group benefit from the support of a local health mediator who&#xD;
      carries out a diagnosis of the person's needs in order to follow his or her care path in an&#xD;

      the care through his network of professionals of the social sector and the health.&#xD;

      This research aims to evaluate a new mode of care for precarious public through a&#xD;
      medico-social mediation device after emergencies, with the aim of improving their care, to&#xD;
      prevent possible complications of diseases related to poor / no return home care, to improve&#xD;
      the quality of life of the people concerned, and to participate in the decongestion of&#xD;
      emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of management by a medico-social&#xD;
      mediation device set up within 48 hours after leaving emergency on the 90-day emergency&#xD;
      readmission rate. people living in precarious situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of the studied CEP on the 180-day emergency readmission rate,&#xD;
           the hospitalization rate at 30, 90 days and 180 days, the number of readmissions to&#xD;
           emergencies within 30, 90 and 180 days of follow-up, duration of hospitalizations&#xD;
           occurring within 180 days, subgroups of patients, reasons for readmissions to the&#xD;
           emergency department,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of health literacy and temporal awareness levels on the 90 day&#xD;
           emergency readmission rate,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of the initial quality of life on the 90-day readmission rate,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify predictive factors for readmission to emergencies at 30, 90 and 180 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological approach: prospective randomized interventional trial with two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to one of the four participating UAs meeting the inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the trial will complete questionnaires assessing precariousness, quality of life,&#xD;
      health literacy, and time perspective. Two emergency centers will be located in dense urban&#xD;
      areas that are highly vulnerable (Marseille's northern neighborhoods); two others in less&#xD;
      urbanized areas in which there are pockets of neo-rural precariousness. Eligible patients are&#xD;
      randomized to emergency in one of the two arms (control: usual management) or (experimental:&#xD;
      intervention). In this last arm, the patient is contacted within 48 hours by a medico-social&#xD;
      mediator familiar with the territory, and followed for 90 days by the latter, in order to&#xD;
      optimize and secure the care path. Patients are recalled at 90 days (number obtained at the&#xD;
      signing of the consent). Patients are documented for emergency use, severity (CCMU score),&#xD;
      primary and associated conditions, quality of life (WHOQOL-Brief), patterns and patterns of&#xD;
      discharge. A health literacy score and a time-domain assessment (short-term PTZ) will be&#xD;
      administered only in the experimental arm, using these scales to cover a secondary objective&#xD;
      to examine the impact of health literacy and literacy. temporal perspective on the&#xD;
      readmission rate. Readmissions are identified from the emergency database and Regional&#xD;
      Emergency Terminal and documented (reason for appeal, severity score, mode and reason for&#xD;
      leaving the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the experimental group benefit from the support of a local health mediator who&#xD;
      carries out a diagnosis of the person's needs in order to follow his or her care path in an&#xD;
      optimal way. It implements and ensures with the patient and his entourage the follow-up of&#xD;
      the care through his network of professionals of the social sector and the health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group do not have the support of the health mediator. They are only&#xD;
      initially evaluated. Their eventual readmission is identified from the local emergency&#xD;
      database at 30, 90 and 180 days as patients in the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects needed to carry out the research is 726 subjects, ie 363 subjects per&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyzes are carried out according to an analysis plan validated by the&#xD;
      scientific committee of the study, with robust tools , blind (with lifting of the blind at&#xD;
      the end of the analyzes). Use of descriptive and then analytical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be under the responsibility of a multidisciplinary scientific committee&#xD;
      experienced in public health, epidemiology and social psychology of health, in the field of&#xD;
      emergencies, precariousness and medico-social mediation, and excellent knowledge. territories&#xD;
