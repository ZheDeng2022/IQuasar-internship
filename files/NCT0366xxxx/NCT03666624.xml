  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of efficacious research-based interventions for sexual and gender minority (SGM)&#xD;
      older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, combined with the&#xD;
      heightened risk of cognitive impairment in this population, presents a significant public&#xD;
      health problem. SGM older adults are at elevated risk of social isolation and experience&#xD;
      significant barriers to healthcare access. Existing interventions for older adults with&#xD;
      dementia have been found to be effective for caregiving dyads. Yet SGM older adults, compared&#xD;
      to heterosexuals, are significantly less likely to be married or to have biological family&#xD;
      members to support them. A significant proportion of SGM older adults living with dementia&#xD;
      have no caregiver or care network. The goal of the proposed research is to design and pilot&#xD;
      test the cultural appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of an innovative&#xD;
      translation of a personalized care network-RDAD (Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease)&#xD;
      to support those living with dementia without a family caregiver, directly addressing unique&#xD;
      SGM-specific risk factors.&#xD;

      We will address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Develop a personalized care network-RDAD intervention suitable for SGM older adults&#xD;
      living with dementia without caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Implement a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 30 participants with 2&#xD;
      arms (routine medical care vs. the personalized care network-RDAD approach) to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and initial efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;
