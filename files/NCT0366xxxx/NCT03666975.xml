  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will assess whether vibration therapy can increase bone-growth in length of the&#xD;
      shorter leg in children aged 6-12 years with pre-existing leg length difference (LLD) which&#xD;
      is being treated with a heel-raise or orthotics. Children will be referred by orthopaedic and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal clinics, physiotherapists and orthotists. Children will have monthly&#xD;
      measurement of leg length (LL) over a 13 month period (4 months pre-treatment, 3 months&#xD;
      treatment, 6 months post-treatment) using a portable Ultrasound-laser system which is safe,&#xD;
      accurate, reproducible and validated against standing x-ray measurement. During the treatment&#xD;
      phase they will be randomised to receive vibration therapy 3 times per week using a vibration&#xD;
      platform at 30 Hz and very low amplitude of 0.4g (less than experienced when walking) or 30&#xD;
      Hz at 1.0 g (the same force as standing with the effect of gravity). The child will stand&#xD;
      with the shorter leg on the platform and the longer leg on a stationary block for 15 minutes&#xD;
      per treatment session. The aim is to assess the potential of this safe, non-invasive and&#xD;
      potentially cost-effective method for levelling LL. If effective, the research could be&#xD;
      extended in future to children with much larger LLD in whom it could potentially avoid the&#xD;
      need for surgery and minimise long-term musculoskeletal disability.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with a documented treatment history for LLD will be recruited via orthopaedic,&#xD;
      orthotic, physiotherapy and musculoskeletal clinical practitioners in London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All specialist practitioners and clinics across London will be informed about the study (via&#xD;
      Practitioner/LLD Letter), asking them to forward information direct to eligible subjects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      20-25 subjects with pre-existing LLD who are undergoing treatment with shoe raises,&#xD;
      heel-lifts or built-up shoes will be recruited. Parents receiving the Parental information&#xD;
      sheet outlining the study are therein invited to contact the researchers who will arrange a&#xD;
      baseline visit to the clinic. At this visit, the study will be discussed and all questions&#xD;
      answered. If the child and family are willing to take part, written informed consent will be&#xD;
      taken from the parent and assent from the child. Baseline measurements will be taken as&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have accurate LL measurement at baseline and then LL measurement monthly&#xD;
      over 13 months (4 months pre-treatment, 3 months intervention and 6 months follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects at the 4th month will start intervention with LIV and will attend the clinic 3 times&#xD;
      per week. Some subjects living further away will use a loaned LIV platform at home for&#xD;
      treatment and will be trained in its correct use. They will be asked to send in weekly&#xD;
      reports of the number of sessions and minutes per session on the platform. The research team&#xD;
      will keep an accurate note of total time. Subjects who have a machine at home will be asked&#xD;
      to use the treatment at least 3 times per week, but that they can use it once per day if they&#xD;
      wish; they will be asked to record the exact time spent on the platform. All monthly&#xD;
      leg-length measurements will take place at the study clinic at a time to suit the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will use the following low intensity vibration intervention: 0.4 g and 30 Hz&#xD;
      based on the fact that this is the 'low intensity vibration medical device' (LIVMD) machine,&#xD;
      developed by Professor Clinton Rubin for use by NASA astronauts that conforms to all IS0&#xD;
      safety measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the difference in LL growth of the treated vs. untreated&#xD;
      leg over the intervention period. Height and weight of all subjects will be taken monthly and&#xD;
      their level of physical activity (0-5) and any high-performance sports activity such as&#xD;
      trampoline or plyometrics training (on a scale of 0-5) will be assessed by questionnaire.&#xD;
      Previous lower limb dysfunction, injury, fracture or surgery, ongoing illness, drug&#xD;
      treatment, growth hormone treatment or use of shoe heel-raise will also be assessed by&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
