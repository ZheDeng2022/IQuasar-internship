    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, 2-group randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of&#xD;
      topiramate versus placebo in patients with comorbid PTSD and moderate-to-severe AUD. This&#xD;
      trial will provide one of the first rigorous tests of whether the effects of topiramate in&#xD;
      AUD generalize to patients with co-occurring PTSD, and one of the first rigorous tests of&#xD;
      whether topiramate has beneficial effects on PTSD symptoms in this population. It will be the&#xD;
      first study to test whether the rs2832407 genotype predicts clinical response to topiramate&#xD;
      for AUD and PTSD in patients with both disorders. Further, it will contribute to the&#xD;
      understanding of topiramate's mechanisms of action in the co-morbid AUD/PTSD population, and&#xD;
      to the discovery of predictors of treatment response.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly comorbid, and&#xD;
      present a clinical challenge for which existing treatments have limited efficacy. Existing&#xD;
      clinical evidence suggests treatments that simultaneously address symptoms of both PTSD and&#xD;
      AUD should be more efficacious than treating either disorder in isolation. The overlap in the&#xD;
      neurobiological basis of PTSD and AUD (involving alterations in incentive salience,&#xD;
      stress/negative affect, and executive control network functioning) suggests that there could&#xD;
      be treatments that would effectively treat both disorders. However, there is no&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy treatment that is clearly effective for both disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topiramate, an FDA-approved anticonvulsant with effects on GABAergic and glutamatergic&#xD;
      signaling, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AUD in several randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials (RCTs), and has also been tested in several open-label and small RCTs for treatment of&#xD;
      PTSD with some evidence of effectiveness. Positive results in one open-label trial and one&#xD;
      small RCT in patients with co-occurring PTSD and AUD suggest that topiramate may have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on symptoms of both PTSD and AUD in this population. Preclinical work also&#xD;
      supports the efficacy of topiramate in ameliorating anxiety-like behavior and altered stress&#xD;
      response in animal models of stress and chronic alcohol exposure. A recent clinical study&#xD;
      demonstrated that the effects of topiramate on alcohol use were moderated by a polymorphism&#xD;
      of the GRIK1 gene (coding for the kainate receptor GluK1 subunit), such that significant&#xD;
      benefit was found only among rs2832407 C-allele homozygotes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to contrast acute and persisting effects of topiramate to those of&#xD;
      placebo treatment in a sample of 150 participants with comorbid PTSD and moderate to severe&#xD;
      AUD, and to evaluate the moderating effect of rs2832407 genotype on medication effects. Drug&#xD;
      will be titrated over 8 weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg and continued for 4 more weeks for&#xD;
      a total of 12 weeks of treatment, followed by a 2-week taper. Alcohol and PTSD-related&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed at multiple time points throughout the study. Plasma biomarkers and&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments will be obtained at baseline and at week 12. In support of the&#xD;
      overall aims of the center focusing on personalized medicine, the trial will serve as a&#xD;
      platform for studies of topiramate's effects on brain chemistry and function as measured by&#xD;
      fMRI, and EEG . Data from this clinical trial will also contribute to Overall Center Aims&#xD;
      investigating the relationship of plasma biomarkers to neuroimaging markers.&#xD;
