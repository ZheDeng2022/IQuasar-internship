  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with higher levels of spinal cord injury (above the 2nd thoracic vertebrae;&#xD;
      tetraplegia) are unable to maintain normal core body temperature (Tcore) when exposed to cool&#xD;
      environments. In persons with tetraplegia, even limited exposure to cool temperatures may&#xD;
      cause Tcore to approach hypothermic values and impair cognitive performance. Conversely, an&#xD;
      increase in Tcore from subnormal to normal range may improve cognitive performance. Prior&#xD;
      work has shown that cool seasonal temperatures have an adverse effect on personal comfort and&#xD;
      the ability to perform vital daily activities of self-care in persons with tetraplegia.&#xD;
      Interventions that address the vulnerability to hypothermia are limited. A self-regulating&#xD;
      heated vest designed specifically for persons with tetraplegia is a novel and promising&#xD;
      strategy to address this problem. By more effectively maintaining Tcore, the vest can&#xD;
      decrease the adverse impact of cool temperatures on comfort, quality of life, and performance&#xD;
      of vital daily tasks for Veterans with tetraplegia during the cooler seasons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recruitment has been put on hold due to COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly cervical injuries (tetraplegia), are&#xD;
      unable to effectively regulate core body temperature (Tcore) due to interruption of motor,&#xD;
      sensory, and sympathetic pathways. Thus, control of distal extremity vasoconstriction (heat&#xD;
      conservation) and shivering thermogenesis (heat production) are impaired, and the ability to&#xD;
      maintain a constant Tcore is compromised. Persons with tetraplegia often report &quot;feeling&#xD;
      cold,&quot; frequently present with subnormal Tcore (35-36.5 degrees C), and are particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable to hypothermia (Tcore&lt;35 degrees C) and associated impairment in cognitive&#xD;
      performance, even when exposed to temperatures that are comfortable for able-bodied (AB)&#xD;
      individuals. Cool seasonal temperatures have been shown to have a greater adverse effect on&#xD;
      personal comfort, activities of daily living (ADLs), and vital daily activities in persons&#xD;
      with tetraplegia than that of AB controls. Conversely, a minimal increase in Tcore from&#xD;
      subnormal to normothermia, secondary to ambient heat may improve cognitive performance.&#xD;
      Interventions addressing the tendency to poikilothermia and enhanced vulnerability to&#xD;
      hypothermia in persons with tetraplegia are limited. Therefore, exploration of safe and&#xD;
      efficacious bioengineering solutions to address the physiological, cognitive, and quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL) issues associated with the routine exposure to cool temperatures that persons with&#xD;
      tetraplegia often encounter is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this pilot study are to: 1) fully bench-test the heated vest for safety before&#xD;
      performing any human subject testing; 2) study the safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      feedback-controlled heated vest in AB controls; and 3) study the efficacy of this heated vest&#xD;
      to minimize the expected decline in Tcore and associated deterioration of cognitive&#xD;
      performance during 2 hours of cool exposure in persons with tetraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In persons with tetraplegia, a two-condition (heated vest, non-heated vest) prospective study&#xD;
      is being proposed to compare the physiological and cognitive responses to 2 hours of&#xD;
      controlled cool exposure (18 degrees C) with a prototype heated vest vs. a similar, but&#xD;
      non-heated vest (control condition). Eight subjects with tetraplegia (C3-T1, AIS A and B) and&#xD;
      eight AB controls will be recruited for study participation. Before the prototype is tested&#xD;
      on human subjects, it will have been fully bench tested and have satisfied all safety&#xD;
      requirements and specifications. AB subjects will be observed to ensure the safety of the&#xD;
      vest, which will be accomplished by determining the temperatures of the vest ( 39 degrees C)&#xD;
      and subjective thermal sensation of no greater than &quot;warm&quot; during a cool condition that will&#xD;
      be identical to the condition which subjects with SCI will be exposed. Subjects with&#xD;
      tetraplegia will test the efficacy of the heated vest, i.e. preventing the expected decline&#xD;
      in Tcore and cognitive performance and increase in thermal comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the feedback-controlled heated vest has been fully bench-tested and has satisfied all&#xD;
      safety requirements (interior vest temperature does not exceed 39 degrees C at maximal power)&#xD;
      and design specifications (lightweight, slim, easy to don doff), the following specific aims&#xD;
      will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Specific Aim: In a cool thermal chamber (18 degrees C), AB controls will wear the&#xD;
      heated vest at maximal setting for 120 minutes in the seated position to determine (1)&#xD;
      maximum temperatures of all areas of the interior (user's side) of the heated vest and (2)&#xD;
      subjective comfort of the heated vest (safety testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses: The study of AB controls will demonstrate (1) All areas under the vest&#xD;
      will have temperatures 39 degrees C. (2) All subjects will report a thermal sensation no&#xD;
      greater than &quot;warm&quot; this would include identification of &quot;hot spots&quot; (Zhang 9-point Thermal&#xD;
      Sensation Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Specific Aim: During exposure to a cool environment (18 degrees C) for up to 120&#xD;
      minutes in the seated position, persons with tetraplegia will wear the heated vest to&#xD;
      determine (1) change in Tcore, (2) change in cognitive performance, and (3) change in thermal&#xD;
      comfort (efficacy testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses: In persons with tetraplegia wearing the heated vest compared to the&#xD;
      same persons wearing the non-heated vest, it's expected that (1) 30% of the subjects will&#xD;
      have a decline of 0.5 degrees C in Tcore compared with 80% in the control condition, (2) 30%&#xD;
      of the subjects will demonstrate a decline of at least 1 T-score in at least one of the&#xD;
      following measures: Interference of Stroop Color and Word test, Digit Span of Wechsler Adult&#xD;
      Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition, compared with 80% in the control condition, and (3) a&#xD;
      greater percentage of subjects reporting increased thermal comfort (Zhang 6-point Comfort&#xD;
      Scale).&#xD;
