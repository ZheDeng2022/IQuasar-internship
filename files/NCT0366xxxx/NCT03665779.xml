  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate and assess the effectiveness and safety of vaginal administration&#xD;
      of isosorbide mono nitrate (IMN) to induce cervical ripening and shorten the interval time&#xD;
      between induction and delivery in women undergoing induction of labor at term or post term&#xD;
      with prelabor rupture of membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women undergoing induction of labor at term or post term with pre-labor rupture of&#xD;
      membrane, vaginal administration of isosorbide mono nitrate (IMN) is effective to induce&#xD;
      cervical ripening and shorten the interval time between induction and delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does vaginal administration of isosorbide mono nitrate (IMN) induce cervical ripening and&#xD;
      shorten the interval time between induction and delivery in women undergoing induction of&#xD;
      labor at term or post term with prelabor rupture of membrane?&#xD;

      -  Study Design: Prospective double blinded randomized placebo-controlled Clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time plan: Approximately 6 months according to calculated sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study setting: this study will be conducted obstetrics and gynecology department at&#xD;
           Cairo university.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study population: patient will be recruited in this study those attending labor ward for&#xD;
           induction of labor in term or post term pregnancies in females with pre-labor rupture of&#xD;
           membranes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methodology in details&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will be subjected to&#xD;
&#xD;
      -History taking:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verbal consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal history: Name, Age, Parity, Occupation, Residency and Special habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Present history: History of onset, course and duration of vaginal bleeding or bloody&#xD;
           vaginal discharge, presence of uterine contraction, PROM, IUGR or any indication of&#xD;
           induction of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obstetric history: History of previous preterm labor, previous abortion, previous full&#xD;
           term deliveries, RH incompatibility, mode of delivery and fetal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menstrual history: For estimation of gestational age using Naegele's rule, provided that&#xD;
           she had regular cycles for the last three months before she got pregnant and was not&#xD;
           taking contraceptive pills during this period and she was sure of her dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Term pregnancy defined as delivery between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation. Gestational age was&#xD;
      assessed from the menstrual history and confirmed by measurement of fetal crown-rump length&#xD;
      at a first-trimester scan. Post-term pregnancy defined as delivery after 42 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past history: History of medical disorders, drug therapy or allergy or history of intake&#xD;
           of other tocolytic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history : For any similar condition&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full clinical examination (pulse, temperature and the blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General examination including chest, heart and abdominal examination for fundal level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local clinical examination; with special attention to pelvic examination to assess the&#xD;
           state of the cervix (dilatation, effacement, PROM, station and presenting part) and to&#xD;
           assess vaginal bleeding or amniotic fluid in vagina if present and to exclude&#xD;
           cephalic-pelvic disproportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine ante-natal investigations (Rh, Hb, fasting and postprandial blood sugar and&#xD;
           complete urine analysis).(CBC with differential and CRP to exclude chorioamnionitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonography examination : to assess the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal viability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal presentation and EFW.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion of any fetal congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure that the all inclusion criteria are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check amniotic fluid index.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After admission for labor induction, cervical assessment is done to see dilatation (cm),&#xD;
      length (cm), position, consistency, and station of presenting part to get the modified Bishop&#xD;
      score and to confirm pre-labor rupture of membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vaginal IMN group (group 1) 40 mg tablet of intra-vaginal IMN (Effox; MINAPHARMA, Cairo,&#xD;
      Egypt) will be placed into the posterior fornix of the vagina, through a digital vaginal&#xD;
      examination, every 4 h for a maximum of four doses. The medication will be stopped with the&#xD;
      onset of labor. Oxytocin will be started 6 h after the last dose of IMN in women not in&#xD;
      active phase of labor but have Bishop score is &gt;6. Intravenous oxytocin is initiated at an&#xD;
      infusion flow rate of 4 mIU/min and will be doubled as necessary, with 30-min intervals&#xD;
      between increasing the doses, up to a maximum of 16 mIU/min. To obtain this concentration, 5&#xD;
      IU of synthetic oxytocin are added to 500 ml of a 5% dextrose solution. Further management of&#xD;
      labor will be done according to the hospitals protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In placebo group (group 2) 40 mg intra-vaginal pyridoxine placebos every 4 h for a maximum of&#xD;
      four doses will be given, followed by intravenous oxytocin infusion and management of labor&#xD;
      as in group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, the pregnant females who don't progress to labor (regular contractions with&#xD;
      continued cervical changes) with no cervical changes ( bishop score equal to or less than 6)&#xD;
      after a maximum of four doses and oxytocin infusion, this will be considered failure of&#xD;
      induction and those patients will delivered by cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed-up regularly after taking the medications by obstetricians who are&#xD;
      unaware of the group to which the patient belongs. Uterine contraction and fetal heart rate&#xD;
      (FHR) will be checked every 30 min. Prophylactic or &quot;latency&quot; antibiotics, typically&#xD;
      ampicillin and erythromycin for prevention of chorioamnionitis. Symptoms and vital signs will&#xD;
      be monitored at regular intervals. Subjects will be asked to report when they have uterine&#xD;
      contraction or abnormal symptoms such as headache, nausea, shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      signs of chorioamnionitis (e.g : fever, uterine fundal tenderness, maternal and fetal&#xD;
      tachycardia, purulent or foul smelling discharge) will be checked at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic examination will be done with each dose and with the onset of uterine contractions.&#xD;
      Doses will be stopped with the onset of uterine contractions or when the maximum doses&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After documentation of all the collected data, the following will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction to onset of labor time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction to delivery time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure of induction due to maternal or fetal cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for augmentation of labor by oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording any maternal or fetal morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of induction of labor as failure of induction or maternal or fetal morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of the used drugs. Complications of PROM either maternal or fetal.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A double-blind study is one in which neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving a particular treatment. This procedure is utilized to prevent bias in research results. Double-blind studies are particularly useful for preventing bias due to demand characteristics or the placebo effect. In a double-blind study, the investigators who interact with the participants would not know who was receiving the actual drug and who was receiving a placebo.</masking_description>
