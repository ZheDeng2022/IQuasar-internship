  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with compromised walking ability have higher rates of morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      more hospitalizations, poorer quality of life, and are less likely to remain independent in&#xD;
      the community. It is known that age-related changes in brain and peripheral nerves contribute&#xD;
      to loss of walking ability. However, there is a lack of research into how the aging spinal&#xD;
      cord affects walking. In older adults, the spinal cord is less excitable, conducts signals&#xD;
      more slowly, and is subject to neural noise. Intervening on age-related impairment of the&#xD;
      spinal cord to improve walking ability is a very promising but untapped area of research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that age-related impairments of the brain and peripheral nerves contribute&#xD;
      to a decline in walking function. Age-related impairment of the spinal cord is also a likely&#xD;
      contributing factor, as the literature describes a variety of changes in spinal cord&#xD;
      structure and function with aging. Specifically, the elderly spinal cord is less excitable,&#xD;
      conducts signals more slowly, and is subject to neural noise. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      are initiating a new line of research with the goal of enhancing walking function in older&#xD;
      adults by intervening on age-related neural impairment of the spinal cord. The objective of&#xD;
      the proposed study is to establish the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and variance of&#xD;
      response for using transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and textured shoe&#xD;
      insoles to excite spinal locomotor circuits and enhance practice-related performance and&#xD;
      retention on an obstacle walking task. Enhanced practice and retention effects will support&#xD;
      future efforts to translate this approach into a longer term rehabilitation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excitatory tsDCS is a non-invasive neuromodulation approach in which a relatively weak&#xD;
      electrical current is delivered to the desired region of the spinal cord via electrodes&#xD;
      placed on the skin. The electrical current does not cause discharge of action potentials, but&#xD;
      rather is designed to bring neurons closer to their discharge threshold by inducing a&#xD;
      sub-threshold depolarization of membrane potentials. When combined with a behavioral task,&#xD;
      tsDCS has the potential to upregulate neural circuits in a task-specific manner and promote&#xD;
      Hebbian neuroplasticity ('fire together, wire together'). The investigators will use a&#xD;
      previously established electrode montage to deliver excitatory tsDCS to the lumbosacral&#xD;
      spinal cord during practice of a complex obstacle walking task. The investigators also&#xD;
      propose to combine the use of textured shoe insoles with tsDCS. This combinatorial approach&#xD;
      may be a potent strategy for simultaneously optimizing spinal responsiveness to input from&#xD;
      both descending and ascending excitatory signals to spinal centers of locomotor control. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a parallel groups study design in which 40 older adults who have&#xD;
      walking deficits and who demonstrate a compensatory executive locomotor control strategy will&#xD;
      be randomized into one of four groups: 1) dosage &quot;A&quot; tsDCS with smooth insoles&#xD;
      (active/smooth); 2) dosage &quot;B&quot; tsDCS with smooth insoles (sham/smooth); 3) dosage &quot;A&quot; tsDCS&#xD;
      with textured insoles (active/textured); and 4) dosage &quot;B&quot; tsDCS with textured insole&#xD;
      (sham/textured). Participants will be blinded to group assignment. While receiving&#xD;
      stimulation, participants will engage in walking practice over a standardized obstacle&#xD;
      course. Immediately prior to and following the practice, each participant will be assessed&#xD;
      while walking over the course. Practice-related gains in performance will be quantified&#xD;
      primarily by fastest safe walking speed. Retention of performance gains will also be assessed&#xD;
      at a separate later visit. Intervening on age-related impairment of the spinal cord to&#xD;
      improve walking function is a promising but untapped area of research. The proposed&#xD;
      intervention techniques are low cost and translatable to real-world settings, which enhances&#xD;
      the potential long term impact of this work on the well-being of older adults.&#xD;
