&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation&#xD;
&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the Study Interventions work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab: Pembrolizumab has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of&#xD;
      cancer, and information from these studies suggests that it may be beneficial in this type of&#xD;
      cancer. Pembrolizumab is a drug (an antibody) that may treat cancer by working with the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation (Re-irradiation): Radiotherapy destroys cancer cells using radiation aimed at a&#xD;
      cancer from a machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved re-irradiation as a treatment&#xD;
      option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab: Bevacizumab (also known as &quot;Avastin&quot;) is designed to prevent or slow down the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking the growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved bevacizumab as a treatment&#xD;
      option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine if this combination&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab + re-irradiation) proves helpful in treating this cancer. If the participant&#xD;
      has already been receiving bevacizumab, the participant will continue to receive this along&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab and re-irradiation. By doing this, the investigators will look to&#xD;
      determine if this combination (pembrolizumab and bevacizumab + re-irradiation) proves helpful&#xD;
      in treating this cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also test the safety and tolerability of this combination (pembrolizumab +&#xD;
      re-irradiation) when given alone or with bevacizumab&#xD;
