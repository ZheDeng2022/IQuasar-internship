    <textblock>
      This is a qualitative study that will seek to gain further understanding of the support needs&#xD;
      of family carers to people living with symptoms of dementia up to the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family carers are friends, family members or neighbours who provide informal unpaid care to&#xD;
      someone with symptoms of dementia. The experience of providing this care may result in family&#xD;
      carers developing unmet needs that impact adversely on their total wellbeing. This research&#xD;
      is potentially beneficial because little is known about the specific physical, psychological,&#xD;
      spiritual and social needs family carers to people dying with dementia may develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a priority of the UK government and the NHS to better support family carers. The&#xD;
      government published guidelines calling on healthcare professionals to assess and address&#xD;
      carer needs, but the evidence base for family carers to people with symptoms of dementia is&#xD;
      limited. Findings from this study could guide healthcare professionals when they conduct&#xD;
      clinical assessments of carer needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant to this study will be invited to attend a semi-structured interview at a&#xD;
      venue of their choice where they will talk about their experiences of providing care.&#xD;
      Participants must have provided informal, unpaid care to a friend, neighbour or family member&#xD;
      with symptoms of dementia at home, including within the last twelve months of that person's&#xD;
      life. This is a retrospective study so only former family carers will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate. Participants must also be over the age of eighteen, be able to communicate in&#xD;
      English and have capacity to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)&#xD;
      Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) as part of their&#xD;
      Research Capacity in Dementia Care Pilot Programme, which is exploring issues relating to&#xD;
      dementia care provision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to explore the experiences of former family carers who supported someone&#xD;
      living with symptoms of dementia at home up to their death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal research objective will be to identify the support needs common to this group&#xD;
      of family carers. The study will explore the main factors that bring about these needs and it&#xD;
      will aim to determine whether a carer's needs change as the health of the person receiving&#xD;
      care deteriorates towards the end of life. The study will also seek to learn more about the&#xD;
      types of assistance family carers receive from health and social care professionals, family&#xD;
      members, friends, neighbours and the voluntary sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal research objective can be of value because it offers family carers an&#xD;
      opportunity to share their personal stories, insights and experiences. Providing this&#xD;
      information can increase awareness of the carers' role and indicate why a family carer's&#xD;
      total health and wellbeing can decline whilst providing informal support to someone living&#xD;
      with symptoms of dementia, especially as the care recipient nears death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study should enable healthcare professionals to conduct more informed&#xD;
      assessments of carer capacity and wellbeing. The information collected in this study may also&#xD;
      identity interventions that carers felt successfully enhanced their wellbeing and reduced&#xD;
      their needs, particularly at the time when the person they cared for approached the end of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also consider the effectiveness of the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool&#xD;
      (CSNAT) intervention when used by home-based family carers supporting someone living with&#xD;
      symptoms of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assessment tool has been designed to identify the needs of family carers to people with&#xD;
      a life-limiting health condition. The CSNAT helps these carers to prioritise their needs and&#xD;
      seek appropriate solutions. It also enables healthcare professionals to provide more tailored&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a qualitative study. Approximately thirty participants will be recruited and each be&#xD;
      asked to take part in a semi-structured interview. The researcher will also record&#xD;
      observational data in the form of reflective, contemporary field notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have provided informal, unpaid care to a friend, neighbour or family member with&#xD;
      symptoms of dementia will be asked to participate. The support they have given may have been&#xD;
      provided on either a permanent or intermittent basis, however all participants must have had&#xD;
      some involvement in the provision of home-based care during the last twelve months of the&#xD;
      care recipient's life. This is a retrospective study. The care recipient must have died not&#xD;
      less than six months and not more than five years before the interview takes place. All&#xD;
      participants must also be over eighteen years of age, be able to communicate in English and&#xD;
      have capacity to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited with the assistance of health and social care professionals&#xD;
      including an Admiral Nurse Manager. Healthcare agencies, charities, community organisations&#xD;
      and groups that represent older adults have also been approached. Representatives from these&#xD;
      organisations will be asked to send participant recruitment packs to all former family carers&#xD;
      listed on their caseloads/databases who meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the study will be uploaded onto forums of dementia, carer and research-related&#xD;
      websites including www.joindementiaresearch.co.uk. The researcher will also request&#xD;
      permission to put up informational posters in local community centres including GP practices.&#xD;
      The posters will include the researcher's contact details so anyone who wishes to receive&#xD;
      more information about the study can do so. The researcher will attend meetings of local&#xD;
      support groups to raise awareness about the study, answer questions and distribute&#xD;
      participant recruitment packs to possible volunteers. In addition, potential participants who&#xD;
      express an interest in the research study via word of mouth will also be sent participant&#xD;
      recruitment packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant recruitment packs will include an introductory letter and participant&#xD;
      information sheet. Anyone who is interested in participating or who would like to discuss the&#xD;
      study in more detail with the researcher can complete an expression of interest form and&#xD;
      return it in a stamped addressed envelope. The form and envelope will be included in the&#xD;
      participant recruitment packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will telephone those who return a reply form in order to discuss their&#xD;
      voluntary participation in the study, provide them with details of what they will be asked to&#xD;
      do, ensure they meet the inclusion criteria and answer any questions before scheduling an&#xD;
      interview date and location. All interviews will be conducted at least forty-eight hours&#xD;
      following this telephone conversation to give participants opportunity to reflect on their&#xD;
      decision to take part. No further contact will be attempted with those who do not respond&#xD;
      after receiving a participant recruitment pack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be interviewed on one occasion by the researcher in a location of their&#xD;
      choice. They will be informed that the researcher will be happy to interview them in their&#xD;
      own homes if this is convenient. Participants will not be paid, however any reasonable&#xD;
      transport, refreshment or sundry costs will be met by the researcher. Before signing the&#xD;
      consent form, each participant will be informed that they can decline to answer any question&#xD;
      or withdraw from the research study at any time. They will be assured that their healthcare&#xD;
      treatment will not be affected in any way if they do withdraw from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the interview, participants will be asked to share their experiences of caring for a&#xD;
      person with symptoms of dementia. A broad interview protocol will be used to guide the&#xD;
      semi-structured interview. The interview will focus on topics including the participants'&#xD;
      needs, the factors that generated the needs and also how the needs changed as the person the&#xD;
      participant cared for neared the end of life. Participants will be prompted to reflect on the&#xD;
      support they received from others. There will, however, be some flexibility to the&#xD;
      interview's underlying structure. The interview should feel conversational in tone and&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to talk openly and raise issues that they consider important&#xD;
      and relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the interview, participants will also be shown a copy of the Carer Support Needs&#xD;
      Assessment Tool (CSNAT). A large print copy of the tool will be provided for any participant&#xD;
      with poor eyesight. Participants will be asked for their thoughts on the tool and its ease of&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will telephone all participants who gives prior. signed consent in the week&#xD;
      following their interviews to ask them to share any further thoughts on the issues discussed.&#xD;
      It has been found that participants often reflect on their responses to interview questions&#xD;
      after the event and many recall insightful additional information once the interview has&#xD;
      concluded. Capturing this thoughtful, valuable data can add to the quality and depth of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be informed prior to giving consent that the telephone call will be&#xD;
      recorded and anonymised quotes may be used by the researcher in academic articles or in her&#xD;
      final thesis. Participants will be reminded of this at the start of the telephone call.&#xD;
      Participants will also be reassured that they do not have to take part. The audio-tapes and&#xD;
      any printed material relating to the telephone calls will be stored in a secure, locked&#xD;
      location before being destroyed in line with the University of Manchester Data Protection&#xD;
      Policy. Participants will be asked to propose a convenient date and time for the telephone&#xD;
      contact. The researcher will make the call and incur all financial telecommunication charges&#xD;
      The telephone contact is expected to last around fifteen minutes, but this estimate may vary&#xD;
      depending on how much the participants wish to say.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews and follow-up telephone calls will be audio-taped and transcribed by the&#xD;
      researcher, who will ensure any comments that may reveal the identity of a participant are&#xD;
      obscured. Anonymising the transcripts in this way preserves participant confidentiality. The&#xD;
      researcher will analyse all the data collected during the interviews and telephone calls and&#xD;
      code it line by line, allocating the information provided by the participants to relevant&#xD;
      themes and categories. This process of analysis will be discussed in the research paper. The&#xD;
      researcher will begin to analyse the data soon after conducting the initial interviews.&#xD;
