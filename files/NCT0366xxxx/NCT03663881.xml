  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caesalpinia spinosa extract is rich in gallotannins and other well characterized polyphenols&#xD;
      and has a major antioxidant activity. The extract shows immunomodulatory activity in healthy&#xD;
      animals and anti-tumor activity in animals with breast cancer and melanoma as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of P2Et in animals with tumors shows a synergistic effect with doxorubicin in&#xD;
      drug-resistant cell lines. In addition, an increase in survival of transplanted animals with&#xD;
      a TS/A breast cancer tumor model and treated with P2Et, in conjunction with calreticulin&#xD;
      increase is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, single arm, Phase 1 study intends to assess the safety of P2Et extract&#xD;
      obtained from Caesalpinia spinosa, with dose escalation, in healthy voluntary participants in&#xD;
      Colombia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The P2Et extract will be self-administered by the participants on a daily basis (600 mg 1&#xD;
      daily capsule, 2 daily capsules for 1,200 mg, 4 daily capsules for 2,400 and 8 daily capsules&#xD;
      for 4,800 mg) 1 hour after meals and at the same time every day, from day 1 to day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the participants presents vomit within 15 minutes after taking P2Et, the&#xD;
      participants should take another dose. Should the participant forget any scheduled dose and&#xD;
      less than 6 hours have elapsed, the participant must take the dose immediately; if more than&#xD;
      6 hours have elapsed, the subject must wait and take the next scheduled dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be performed to determine the P2Et maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      maximum dose toxicity (MDT). In the escalation phase, the P2Et daily dose will be escalated&#xD;
      in the cohort of subjects with minimum dose of 600 mg daily to a maximum of 4,800 mg. Each&#xD;
      cohort will be made up of around 3 and 6 subjects, at least 3 subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      each dosage level. Should MTD is not observed in the first 3 subjects treated in the first&#xD;
      month, escalation to the next dosage level will be undertaken. Should 1 or more MTD occur in&#xD;
      any dosage level in a subject, 3 subjects will be added to that cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any dosage level in which 2 out of 6 subjects experience a MTD will be considered intolerable&#xD;
      and the previous dose will be considered the P2Et maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose&#xD;
      escalation will be terminated. The 3+3 design will be used monthly for the P2Et dose&#xD;
      escalation (up to a maximum of 4.8 g/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed-up until withdrawal of the protocol therapy. The&#xD;
      participants removed from the protocol due to unacceptable adverse events will be followed-up&#xD;
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
