  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients are at an increased risk of recurrence in bone and bone density loss&#xD;
      (osteopenia/osteoporosis) and consequently fragility fractures due to: age, systemic therapy&#xD;
      with aromatase inhibitors, and premature induction of menopause by chemotherapy or ovarian&#xD;
      ablation. Bone is the most common site of breast cancer recurrence. The use of bone modifying&#xD;
      agents, such as Zoledronate may reduce the risk of bone metastases and fragility fractures.&#xD;
      Despite the widespread use of adjuvant Zoledronate, it is not known what the optimal number&#xD;
      of infusions is to reduce the risk of bone metastases and the risk of fragility fractures.&#xD;
      Indeed, the recent CCO and ASCO Practice Guideline, 'Bottom line recommendations'&#xD;
      specifically states, &quot;More research is recommended comparing different bone-modifying agents,&#xD;
      doses, dosing intervals, and durations.&quot; In the metastatic setting, for nearly 2 decades&#xD;
      biphosphonates (i.e. Zoledronate) have been given to patients every 3-4 weeks. This dosing&#xD;
      interval was selected based on convenience of co-administration with standard anti-cancer&#xD;
      agents and not on the long biological effect of these agents on osteoclasts, the cells&#xD;
      responsible for excess bone breakdown. Furthermore, in the bone density preservation setting,&#xD;
      despite the usual administration of Zoledronate once a year a single dose of Zoledronate was&#xD;
      associated with a sustained increase in bone mineral density 5 years later. A recent&#xD;
      systematic review in the adjuvant setting, showed that BTA at any particular dose or route of&#xD;
      administration showed superiority over the other. In other words, the lowest dose appears to&#xD;
      be just as good as the highest dose. This study will compare the single dose of Zoledronate&#xD;
      to Zoledronate given every 6 months for 3 years. The primary outcome for this study will be&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting this trial. The secondary outcome will assess bone-metastasis risk,&#xD;
      fragility rates, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study it is hypothesized that a single dose of Zoledronate will be non-inferior to&#xD;
      every 6 months in terms of bone-metastasis free survival, time to first bone metastasis and&#xD;
      fragility fractures. It is also hypothesized that a single dose of Zoledronate will have less&#xD;
      toxicities associated with Zoledronate compared to every 6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Direct Estimation of Health Utility Values</measure>

    <description>To evaluate patient quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, undertaken at the first Zoledronate treatment and either every year (Arm A) or every 6 months (Arm B) for 3 years. The EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire consists of two sections; the descriptive system and the visual analogue scale. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and has 5 levels associated with it (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). The scale range of 1-5 is used for the 5 dimensions where 1 is the best outcome and 5 is the worst outcome. The Visual Analogue scale records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' at the top and 'the worst health you can imagine' at the bottom. This ranges 0-100 with 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome.</description>

             study. A women is considered to be of 'childbearing potential' if she has had menses&#xD;
