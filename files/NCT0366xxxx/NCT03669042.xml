  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-market clinical follow-up study is to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of patients receiving PhotoFix as a patch within a vascular repair or reconstruction&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PhotoFix is prepared from bovine pericardium, which is stabilized using a dye-mediated&#xD;
      photo-oxidation process and sterilized using aseptic processing techniques. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint for patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) undergoing carotid endarterectomies&#xD;
      (CEA) will be rate of ipsilateral central neurologic events; the primary endpoint for all&#xD;
      other vascular procedures will be primary patency. The secondary endpoints include all-cause&#xD;
      reoperation rate, device-related reoperation rate, explant rate, restenosis rate, secondary&#xD;
      patency (hemodialysis access repair (HAR) only) and survival. A goal of 100 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at approximately 10 sites. The enrollment period will span a minimum of 8 months&#xD;
      from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and site activation. Candidates for this study&#xD;
      are adults who require vascular repair or reconstruction surgery that necessitates the use of&#xD;
      a patch. Patients will be consented pre-operatively and enrolled patients will be followed&#xD;
      for approximately 6 months after PhotoFix surgery. Data will be collected at 5 time points:&#xD;
      baseline (pre-operatively), intra-operatively, 1 month post-operatively, 3 months&#xD;
      post-operatively, and 6 months post-operatively.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will undergo a vascular repair or reconstruction surgery, which requires the use of PhotoFix. The surgical procedures will vary by patient and by underlying etiology. Therefore, PhotoFix implant sites will also vary. In all cases, PhotoFix will be implanted per the Instructions for Use (IFU).</description>
