  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to assess attitudes, perceived proficiency, and knowledge related to&#xD;
      telemedicine by implementing telesimulation behavioral health scenarios in a cohort of&#xD;
      healthcare students using the Contextual Interview Observation Form.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to Mental Health America, 1 in 5 adults have a mental health condition. Mental&#xD;
      health is associated with higher incidence of chronic diseases, lower use of medical care,&#xD;
      and one of five most costly conditions in the US in 2006 according to the American&#xD;
      Psychological Association. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)&#xD;
      has called for residents to develop an understanding of social-behavioral sciences as a basis&#xD;
      for patient care. ACGME advises that the curriculum is extended to physical aspects of&#xD;
      patient care as well as the emotional, social and behavioral aspects. The Society of Teachers&#xD;
      of Family Medicine (STFM) has also suggested the importance of the psychosocial realm.&#xD;
      According to both the ACGME and STFM, being able to glean the necessary information is an&#xD;
      integral part of being a family doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for healthcare providers, medical students, and residents to possess basic&#xD;
      interviewing, counseling and agenda setting skills to ascertain the pertinent contextual&#xD;
      (e.g., familial, social, cultural, spiritual, etc.), health behavior, and health risk factors&#xD;
      of patients' lives, is vital to close the gap on behavioral health and chronic diseases. In&#xD;
      order to evaluate learners' interviewing skills, the Contextual Interview Observation Form&#xD;
      (CIOF) an observation tool was developed using Robinson, Gould, and Strosahl's (2010)&#xD;
      interview format. The CIOF can be used to teach a contextual interview &quot;procedure&quot; that is&#xD;
      organized in a logical manner with a practical format. This &quot;contextual interview&quot; provides a&#xD;
      no-cost format for the learner to capture the context of patients' behaviorally influenced&#xD;
      health concerns and is applicable during the 4-year curriculum as well as during the&#xD;
      clerkship years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many Americans lack access to health care, with an even greater shortage of access to mental&#xD;
      health providers, especially in rural and underserved areas. Improving access to behavioral&#xD;
      health providers and recognition of mental illness via telemedicine, could lead to improved&#xD;
      patient outcomes and cost. However, in the pedagogical course of medical education, the&#xD;
      investigators do not provide a robust platform for teaching telemedicine. Implementing the&#xD;
      CIOF in a telesimulation format will allow for healthcare providers, behavior health&#xD;
      providers, medical students, and residents to practice and experience providing basic&#xD;
      interviewing and counseling via telemedicine. According to McCoy et al, telesimulation is &quot;a&#xD;
      process by which telecommunication and simulation resources are utilized to provide&#xD;
      education, training, and/or assessment to learners at an off-site location. Off-site location&#xD;
      refers to a distant site that would preclude the education, training, and/or assessment&#xD;
      without the use of telecommunication resources.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences educates and trains healthcare professionals&#xD;
      emphasizing service among rural and medically underserved communities throughout the&#xD;
      Northwest. Specifically, the investigators cover rural and underserved areas in Alaska,&#xD;
      Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho. PNWU's envisioned Institute for Interprofessional&#xD;
      Practice &amp; Education (IIPE) focuses on cultivating healthcare teams from a variety of&#xD;
      professional backgrounds to enhance person-centered health care. One goal of PNWU's strategic&#xD;
      plan is to expand graduate level educational opportunities. In response to that goal, the&#xD;
      Yakima Valley Interprofessional Practice and Education Collaborative (YVIPEC) was established&#xD;
      in the fall of 2014 to promote the highest quality health care in the region through a&#xD;
      culture of inclusive and collaborative interprofessional education, practice, and&#xD;
      scholarship. Interprofessional education (IPE) fosters a team-based approach to health care&#xD;
      which is the approach used in rural health clinics and is reported to be critical to success&#xD;
      in working in medically underserved areas. These collaborations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences (PNWU), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heritage University (HU), Physician Assistant Program and Nursing Program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Washington State University (WSU), Nursing Program and Pharmacy Program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central Washington University (CWU), Paramedicine Program and Dietetics Program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Washington State Allied Health Center of Excellence, located at Yakima Valley College&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current PNWU College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) curriculum includes CLIN 618, which is&#xD;
      a second year requirement and presents a multidimensional approach to the understanding of&#xD;
      the most common clinical entities in psychiatry and behavioral medicine. Third and fourth&#xD;
      year courses includes BEHCS 701 Behavioral Medicine rotation which is designed for students&#xD;
      to learn and practice skills necessary for working with patients in a mental health setting.&#xD;
      Incorporating the COIF via telesimulation would give students, residents, and faculty the&#xD;
      experience for use beyond course requirements and prepare them for the future of healthcare.&#xD;
