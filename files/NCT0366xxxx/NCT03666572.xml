  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is an ever-present problem worldwide. It is estimated that over 18 million&#xD;
      children under the age of 5 are affected by the most extreme form of undernutrition, severe&#xD;
      acute malnutrition (SAM). In spite of having standardized management protocols, in many&#xD;
      hospitals, inpatient mortality reaches up to 30%. Infectious morbidity is common among&#xD;
      survivors. Diarrhea, severe intestinal inflammation, low concentrations of fecal short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acids (SCFAs), and severe systemic inflammation are significantly associated with&#xD;
      mortality in SAM. Investigators of this study have earlier shown that the gut microbiota in&#xD;
      children with SAM is immature and is causally related to SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human milk contains between 10 and 20 g/liter of oligosaccharides (human milk&#xD;
      oligosaccharides-HMOs) which is the third most abundant solid component after lactose and&#xD;
      lipids. HMOs are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion in host infants, and thus the&#xD;
      greater part of HMOs reached the colon and may act as prebiotics to shape a healthy gut&#xD;
      ecosystem by stimulating the growth of useful microorganisms by acting as receptor analogs to&#xD;
      inhibit the binding of various pathogens and toxins to epithelial cells. Probiotics are live&#xD;
      organisms beneficial for a healthy life. The human digestive tract possesses a diverse&#xD;
      microbial community throughout its extent, which supports their hosts generally for healthy&#xD;
      living. Bifidobacterium spp. is dominant microbiota in infants who are exclusively breastfed&#xD;
      and these infants are less likely to suffer from diarrhea. According to recent studies among&#xD;
      the most common probiotics genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, the latter is more&#xD;
      abundant in the gut. To carry out their functional activities, Bifidobacteria must be able to&#xD;
      survive the gastrointestinal tract transit and persist, at least transiently, in the host.&#xD;
      The population of Bifidobacteria in the gut community drastically decreases after weaning.&#xD;
      Certain Bifidobacteria possess the metabolic capabilities to break down the HMOs.&#xD;
      Consequently, it is observed that HMOs support the growth of select Bifidobacteria in the gut&#xD;
      of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research done at icddr,b and Washington University indicates that gut microbes are related to&#xD;
      undernutrition and that children with SAM have gut dysbiosis that mediates some of the&#xD;
      pathologies of their condition. The standard of care in these children should be reinforced&#xD;
      by an intervention that corrects the gut dysbiosis, improves weight gain during nutritional&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and reduces infectious morbidity. Investigators do not have any published&#xD;
      data on the microbiome response to probiotic supplementation (with and without prebiotics) in&#xD;
      malnourished infants or preserving the microbiome with probiotics in non-malnourished&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short-term pilot study should be conducted to evaluate the microbiome response to probiotic&#xD;
      supplementation (with and without prebiotics) in malnourished populations to justify a larger&#xD;
      study of clinical outcomes. Additionally, non-malnourished infants who are hospitalized for&#xD;
      infectious conditions face challenges related to gut dysbiosis caused by antibiotic usage.&#xD;
      Here the investigators will evaluate the ability of a probiotic intervention to rescue the&#xD;
      microbiome of primarily breastfed non-malnourished infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis (EVC001) with and without prebiotic&#xD;
      supplementation for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate the microbiome response to probiotic supplementation (with and&#xD;
      without prebiotics) in infants under 6 months with severe acute malnutrition and to compare&#xD;
      the microbiome response with healthy infants with a probiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Single-blind RCT, stratified randomization will be based on infant age at the time&#xD;
      of transfer to the Nutritional Rehabilitation Unit (NRU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 treatment arms for infants with SAM&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Placebo (Lactose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bifidobacterium infantis alone (Bif)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bifidobacterium infantis + prebiotic Lacto-N-neotetraose [LNnT] (Bif+prebiotic) Age at&#xD;
           enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 2-3.9 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 4-5.9 months of age 1 open-label treatment arm for 18 non-malnourished primarily&#xD;
                breastfed infants: Bifidobacterium infantis alone (Bif)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1 (SAM): Infants between 2 and &lt;6 months old with SAM as defined by&#xD;
           weight-for-length Z score &lt; -3 either sex, caregiver willing to provide consent for&#xD;
           enrolment of the infant, caregiver willing to stay in the NRU for about 15 days,&#xD;
           residence within 15 km from icddr,b&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2 (non-malnourished): Non-malnourished infants (WLZ ≥ -1) &lt;6 months old who are&#xD;
           hospitalized for treatment with antibiotics for the infection, infants receiving at&#xD;
           least 50% of nutritional intake from breast milk at the time of hospitalization, either&#xD;
           sex, residence within 15 km from icddr,b&#xD;
&#xD;

      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the microbiome response to probiotic supplementation (with and without&#xD;
      prebiotics) in under 6 months infants with severe acute malnutrition and to compare the&#xD;
      microbiome response with healthy infants supplemented with probiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: The study will be conducted at Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for&#xD;
      Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). The institution possesses well equipped&#xD;
      clinical care as well as laboratory facilities capable of performing all the clinical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (SAM) Group 2 (non-malnourished)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (EVC001) with and without prebiotic supplementation&#xD;
      for 28 days will be provided in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several studies in the developing world where prebiotic and probiotic were used in&#xD;
      severe acute malnutrition and among at risk infants. Safety of Bifidobacterium longum subsp.&#xD;
      infantis (EVC001) is evident from published literature as well as safety reports (Smilowitz&#xD;
      et al., 2017; Sheridan et al., 2017; Grenov et al., 2017; Panigrahi er al., 2017; Kerac et&#xD;
      al., 2009). The IMPRINT Study, a Phase I clinical trial, determined the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of supplementing breastfed infants with B. infantis (EVC001) (Smilowitz et al.,&#xD;
      2017). Safety of prebiotic (LNnT) was evaluated by EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)&#xD;
      Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) related food and panel concluded&#xD;
      that LNnT is safe for infants. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and&#xD;
      Prebiotics (ISAPP) recommended that an attractive target for clinical interventions will lead&#xD;
      to new approaches that combat malnutrition (Sheridan et al., 2017). A study held in Uganda&#xD;
      using probiotic In hospitalized SAM children revealed that probiotic may have a role in&#xD;
      follow up of hospitalized children with SAM in outpatient phase as it showed significant&#xD;
      reduction of diarrheal duration (Grenov et al., 2017). In rural India significant reduction&#xD;
      was observed for culture-positive and culture-negative sepsis and lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections in infants with use of symbiotic (Kerac et al., 2009). The PRONUT study did not&#xD;
      demonstrate any case of probiotic related bacteraemia . The response of microbiota to&#xD;
      probiotics may differ by diet or geography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 treatment arms for infants with SAM:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (Lactose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B. infantis alone (Bif)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B. infantis + prebiotic Lacto-N-neotetraose [LNnT] (Bif+prebiotic) Each arm will be&#xD;
           assigned to receive the standard of care diet (F-75 during the acute phase treatment of&#xD;
           SAM, F-100 during hospital stay for nutritional rehabilitation, and standardized infant&#xD;
           formula upon discharge). Randomization for treatment allocation will be done in 1:1&#xD;
           ratio using stratification by age (2-3.9 months vs. 4-6 months) to ensure equal&#xD;
           participation of infants by age groups. Allocation will be achieved by using random&#xD;
           permuted blocks size of 3. In total 54 participants will be enrolled with 18 infants&#xD;
           (9+9) allocated in each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prebiotic will be used in the form of LNnT (Lacto-N-neotetraose, which is produced by&#xD;
      fermentation and is chemically identical to LNnT present in human breast milk. LNnT contains&#xD;
      a specific linkage that B. infantis can break down while other bacteria cannot. In the in&#xD;
      vitro assay, when the growth media contains 50% or more of LNnT, growth of B. infantis is&#xD;
      supported, but growth of Bacteroides and E.coli is inhibited. The distribution of the&#xD;
      glycosylhydrolases needed to consume this structure are rare among Proteobacteria (including&#xD;
      Campylobacter) as a whole, and absent among Bacteroides and therefore LNnT should not&#xD;
      contribute to cross feeding, even in the absence of B. infantis engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of selecting the non-malnourished children is to see whether the disrupted microbiota&#xD;
      of SAM infants recovers to higher level of B. infantis, similar to those levels seen in&#xD;
      healthy breast fed infants who have an acute illness and are treated with an antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot, we will have 18 infants per treatment arm, a total of 54 SAM infants. We will&#xD;
      also enroll 18 non-malnourished infants for the open-label B. infantis treatment. A total of&#xD;
      72 infants will be the study population for this pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if study participants drop or develop any hospital acquired infection or deteriorate, we&#xD;
      have to complete 18 evaluable cases in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection procedure: All SAM and non-SAM children within the defined age&#xD;
      groups will be screened for study eligibility criteria by the study physician. Parents /&#xD;
      attending care givers of those fulfilling the eligibility, in application of the inclusion&#xD;
      and the exclusion criteria, will be invited to provide their consent for enrollment of their&#xD;
      children in the study. Upon signing a written informed consent, after providing information&#xD;
      about the study and its interventions, explaining possible benefits and risks, and voluntary&#xD;
      nature of participation along with the right to withdraw children at any time after the&#xD;
      initial consent without providing any reason, children will be enrolled by the study&#xD;
      physician. Clinical Record Form will be used to collect relevant information such as medical&#xD;
      history including nature and duration of illness, medication for current illness;&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics such as age, sex, religion, parental age with education,&#xD;
      parents occupation, fuel use and smoking history, monthly family income, number of&#xD;
      siblings,etc. Information would also be collected about child's feeding practice such as&#xD;
      history of breast feeding, formula or other complementary feeding, and immunisation status;&#xD;
      family history of tuberculosis, recent respiratory tract infection of any family members and&#xD;
      past medical history of child would be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For long term follow up separate CRF will be used to collect information on weight, height,&#xD;
      MUAC, feeding and co-morbidity history. Field Research Assistants will visit the houses of&#xD;
      enrollees and will collect required information after taking written consent from parents or&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (children with SAM): Eligible SAM infants will be treated for the stabilization phase&#xD;
      in the Longer Stay Unit of the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b. The standardized treatment protocol&#xD;
      for children with SAM and diarrhea (developed at icddr,b and aligned to the WHO guidelines;&#xD;
      Ahmed et al Lancet 1999) will be followed. Key elements include initially 2 hourly feeding&#xD;
      with F-75 (the recommended starter formula, 130 ml/kg per day), folic acid, vitamin A,&#xD;
      Ampicillin plus Gentamicin, temperature and blood glucose monitoring and control. Prior to&#xD;
      initiation of antibiotics, baseline stool samples will be obtained (by fecal catheter if&#xD;
      needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stabilization phase lasts on an average 4 days in our experience. Completion of&#xD;
      stabilization phase is characterized by a satisfactory appetite, no need for nasogastric tube&#xD;
      feeding, good general clinical condition, absence of diarrhea, dehydration, fever,&#xD;
      hypothermia or tachypnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants who are stabilized are transferred to the NRU upon receiving written consent from the&#xD;
      caregiver. Stabilized infants will be randomized to the 3 treatment arms once they have&#xD;
      completed the 5-7 day course of antibiotics. The Senior Dietician of the Hospital prepares&#xD;
      the diet (F-100) and supplies to the NRU. F-100 is dispensed at 130 ml/kg per day every 2&#xD;
      hours for the first 2 days, and thereafter given every 3 hours and gradually increased by 10&#xD;
      ml at each serving until some feed is left. Breast feeding is encouraged in between the&#xD;
      feeds. Amount of breast milk consumed will be estimated by test weighing of infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will be trained to provide psychosocial stimulation to the infants, an activity&#xD;
      that is done routinely in the NRU. This is done through talking or singing to the infants,&#xD;
      age specific physical activity and play with local toys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of breast milk intake by test weighing folloing standard published method (Islam&#xD;
      et al., 2006):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of breast milk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this study will investigate the engraftment of Bifidobacteria which is linked with&#xD;
      availability of HMOs in breast milk, we will collect 10 ml of breast milk under aseptic&#xD;
      condition and will be analyzed for HMO content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis will be performed in laboratories that have a track record of performing these&#xD;
      assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, we will also perform microbiota analysis of collected breast milk samples. This&#xD;
      is because breast milk microbiota is likely to influence the colonization by other organisms&#xD;
      and the intestinal mileage of infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast milk will be collected from the breast between 0700 and 1100 hr, and women will be&#xD;
      asked to have not to fed or expressed from the study breast for at least 2 hours prior to&#xD;
      sample collection. Before sample collection, the breast will be cleaned with an iodine swab.&#xD;
      A complete breast expression will be collected using a single-use, sterile, collection kit&#xD;
      (Hygienikit®; Ameda, Cary, IL, USA) and an electric breast pump (Model SMR-B-R; Ameda-Egnell,&#xD;
      Inc.). Milk will be immediately placed on ice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bif (8 billion CFU/daily single dose-), Bif (8 billion CFU/daily single dose-) + Prebiotic&#xD;
      (1gm/6hourly-4gm/day), and placebo (lactose 625mg) will be available in powder format in&#xD;
      sachets contained within feeding kits marked with unique code numbers that match the&#xD;
      randomization code of each infant. The sachet contents will be administered to an infant once&#xD;
      every day for Bif and placebo sachets mixed with 5ml infant formula or breast milk and each&#xD;
      preparation of 200ml F-100 one prebiotic (LNnT) sachet will be dissolved. Caregivers, but not&#xD;
      study staff, will be blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose and dispensing of LNnT will ultimately be derived upon the review of recent&#xD;
      literature as well as experience of experts working in this field. The goal is to stimulate&#xD;
      as much as possible the natural conditions of availability of HMOs in breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feeding kits (sachets) that have been assigned to randomized infants will be refrigerated&#xD;
      or stored frozen until used while the participant is hospitalized. Feeding kits that have not&#xD;
      yet been assigned to an infant will be stored in a hospital freezer with continuous&#xD;
      temperature monitoring. The probiotic stored in the freezer (-20°C ± 5°C) can be used up&#xD;
      until the expiration date printed on the sachet (1 year from date of packaging). It can be&#xD;
      stored up to 31 days in the refrigerator (4°C ± 5°C). The prebiotic (LNnT) is stable at room&#xD;
      temperature, but can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer with the probiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (non-malnourished children): Eligible non-malnourished infants will be treated as per&#xD;
      hospital protocol. In brief, they are admitted to the Longer Stay Unit or if necessary to the&#xD;
      ICU. The hospital has defined treatment protocols for acute watery diarrhea, pneumonia and&#xD;
      severe pneumonia, persistent diarrhea, severe sepsis, electrolyte disorders, and&#xD;
      hospital-acquired infections. Children will be treated at the hospital per these protocols.&#xD;
      Exclusively breastfed infants will continue on breast milk. Others are supplemented with&#xD;
      modified infant formula every 2-3 hours. Amount of breast milk consumed will be estimated by&#xD;
      test weighing of infants. Treatment with Bif will start on the day of completion of the&#xD;
      antibiotic course and will be provided to infants in the same manner as Group 1. The sachet&#xD;
      contents will be mixed with a teaspoon of infant formula or breast milk and fed to the&#xD;
      infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if study participants drop or develop any hospital acquired infection or deteriorate, we&#xD;
      have to complete 18 evaluable cases in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge from Hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discharge will be done if the infant with SAM has achieved a weight-for-length &gt;-3, if&#xD;
      possible ≥ -2 Z-score, and in case of edematous malnutrition when edema resolves and when the&#xD;
      infant thriving and clinically well. Non-malnourished infants will be discharged when they&#xD;
      fulfill the hospital discharge criteria.By then the caregivers will have been trained for&#xD;
      food and supplement preparation and administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants with SAM will be followed up through home visits by Research Assistants twice every&#xD;
      week until 8 weeks post randomization. Non-malnourished infants will be followed through home&#xD;
      visits twice every week until the supplementation is complete and then once every week until&#xD;
      6 weeks post randomization. During such visits, the rations of infant formula (for SAM&#xD;
      infants) and supplements (both groups) will be replenished, actual intake of the diet will be&#xD;
      observed or the amount given and the method of reconstitution verified, and morbidity&#xD;
      recorded on a customized case record form. Because the B. infantis supplement should be kept&#xD;
      cool to maintain optimum viability, Research Assistants will bring the supplement to home&#xD;
      visits in insulated boxes or coolers with ice or frozen gel packs. Although the supplement&#xD;
      will likely warm to room temperature between visits, it is not expected that the viability&#xD;
      loss will significantly impact the colonization of B. infantis in the gut. A miniature fridge&#xD;
      will be provided to each participant for the study period and each parent will be instructed&#xD;
      to keep the supplement in these containers until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants who have not yet achieved a weight-for-length ≥ -1 Z-score by 8 weeks post&#xD;
      randomization (end of home visits) may continue to bring the infant to icddr,b for weighing&#xD;
      and measuring and to pick up the formula rations on a routine basis until a weight-for-length&#xD;
      ≥ -1 Z is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A long term follow up will be carried out to assess the anthropometry of enrolled&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal samples will be collected as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool swabs (for microbiome analysis) (13times in SAM, 11 times in non-SAM)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At admission, prior to antibiotic treatment&#xD;

             -  2 weeks post supplementation (collected by research assistant at home visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sample collection in the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be screened from Dhaka Hospital, icddr,b according to the above mentioned&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research staff will screen these children before&#xD;
      administration of an antibiotic. Before collection of stool samples written consent will be&#xD;
      taken from legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool should be freshly collected from each child. The samples must be immediately aliquoted&#xD;
      into pre-labelled 2 ml cryovials and into the shipper (~-70⁰C) as quickly as possible after&#xD;
      collection, ideally less than 15 minutes after collection. After collection and prior to&#xD;
      aliquoting, the stool collection vessel should be maintained on (wet) ice. Ideally the&#xD;
      cryovials would be filled to approximately 2/3 full. Two times in a week these cryopreserved&#xD;
      samples will be transported to Biosafety Level Laboratory in icddr,b Dhaka Hospital for&#xD;
      storage in -80⁰C freezer. In order to prevent thawing, vials will be transferred from the&#xD;
      shipper to the -80⁰ freezer as quick as possible while transferring to freezer boxes. These&#xD;
      freezer boxes will not be removed from the -80⁰ freezer until they are handed over to World&#xD;
      Courier for shipment to USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to ensure best possible recovery of bacteria and their viability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The shippers should be fully charged before the collection day and a record will be&#xD;
           maintained for the number of times they will be opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The shippers need around 12 hours after adding liquid nitrogen to become fully charged.&#xD;
           Therefore, we will re-charge (fill) the shippers at the end of each day and then pour&#xD;
           off any remaining unabsorbed liquid nitrogen the next morning before using them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Shippers will be weighed before charging, after charging (ie. the next morning after&#xD;
           pouring off any unabsorbed N2), and then again at the end of each day, to know how much&#xD;
           liquid nitrogen remains in the canister. This will allow us to estimate how much liquid&#xD;
           N2 is needed every time we recharge and how frequently this is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool swab collection in the Hospital and from the Community:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected as mentioned in the time schedule. Once participants are&#xD;
      discharged from the NRU, the stool swab will be collected within a two day window of the&#xD;
      scheduled time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For collection of stool, child's/participant's primary caretaker will be informed one day&#xD;
      before planned stool collection. A trained research staff will collect the first available&#xD;
      fresh stool sample from the child on the day of the scheduled sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During collection in the Hospital and in the community, the research staff will be provided&#xD;
      with the labeled stool swab tubes (containing stabilization buffer), individually wrapped&#xD;
      swabs (with breakpoint), a cryogenic marker, and plastic bags.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Hospital, the mothers/caretakers will be instructed to notify the research staff as&#xD;
      soon as the child defecates. Then the research staff will do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swab the baby's soiled diaper, collecting enough stool sample to entirely coat the head&#xD;
           of the swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place the swab into the appropriately labeled green-topped collection tube and snap the&#xD;
           swab head off at the breakpoint - the swab head will remain in the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seal the tube tightly and shake vigorously to ensure distribution of the stool within&#xD;
           the stabilization buffer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the provided cryogenic marker&#xD;
           (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4000221), write the date the stool&#xD;
           was collected on the label on the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat the swabbing with a second clean swab and the duplicate green-topped tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place green-topped tubes back in the provided plastic bags and store at room temperature&#xD;
           until picked up by the health worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about antibiotic intake will be collected for each participant during the study.&#xD;
      At the time of each sample collection, we will ask mother or other caregiver for any illness&#xD;
      during last 14 days, and whether treated. The nature of medicine will be verified by physical&#xD;
      inspection of the medicine, the prescription and by asking the name or if the medicine was a&#xD;
      powder that had to be reconstituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sample collection from mother:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will do the &quot;Secretor status phenotyping assay&quot; in mothers' saliva to see the secretor&#xD;
      status of mothers to detect HMO status as well as link with the Microbiota of infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sample collection procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mothers' should wash the hands and rinse the mouth with cold water, and spit water out&#xD;
           completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They will remove the sampler being careful to touch only the handle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mother will hold the handle Oracle sampling tube as a toothbrush and will insert in her&#xD;
           mouth and will rub a sponge against her gums for one minute. Ensure that the sponge is&#xD;
           completely saturated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. without touching the sponge, they will insert the sampler into the original Oracol tube,&#xD;
           sponge down, and will close the lid tightly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mother will give the Oracle sampler tube back to the study staff (who will label and&#xD;
           refrigerate the tubes if the samples will not be processed on the same day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and transport of fecal samples from the community Each trained community health&#xD;
      worker will be responsible for certain number of stool collections per month. She will&#xD;
      contact mother over cell phone and arrive at the child's house early in the morning with a&#xD;
      bench top nitrogen shipper and collect the stool swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial collection of fecal samples should be made in a suitable sterile container after&#xD;
      which smaller aliquots of fecal material should be transferred by the field worker (within 20&#xD;
      minutes of defecation) into pre-labeled, sterile 2ml cryo-safe tubes. Tube labels should&#xD;
      minimally include the Participant's Sample ID (SID) and the date of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearing clean, disposable latex gloves, the health workers will fill each 2 ml cryo-vial&#xD;
      approximately one-half to two-thirds full using a sterile spatula and cap tightly. Any&#xD;
      buffers, preservatives or additives will not be added to the sample. Precaution will be taken&#xD;
      during use of screw cap vials and not overfilling them as this will minimize the potential&#xD;
      for cross-contamination of samples during transport and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then they will place the capped vials into liquid nitrogen pre-charged 'dry shippers'&#xD;
      immediately to transport back to the laboratory. Although difficult, the specimens should be&#xD;
      transferred to dry shippers within 20 minutes of defecation. In the laboratory, trained staff&#xD;
      will empty the vials from the dry shipper into a bucket of dry ice to prevent thawing while&#xD;
      sorting and transferring the vials to 9x9 freezer boxes for longer term storage and&#xD;
      transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be recorded on Stool Field Collection Form (SFC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests performed at icddrb:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determining fecal pH in hospital lab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing of Myeloperoxidase and other biomarker levels in fecal samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests performed by Evolve Biosystems:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Next Generation Sequencing, Metagenomics and q PCR analyses of samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune- related tests- Multiplex analysis of inflammatory and immune-related&#xD;
           cytokines/analytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-10, TGF beta, IL-2, TNF alpha, IL-17, IL-22, IL-8, IL-6, IP-10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ELISAs for sCD83, sTLR2 and fecal lipocalin 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool PH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool PH will be measured to assess the change from baseline in stool pH during&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myeloperoxidase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myeloperoxidase is a specific marker of neutrophil activity. It was chosen because it is not&#xD;
      elevated in breast milk or in the stools of breastfed children as are lactoferrin and&#xD;
      calprotectin (Dorosko et al., 2008) and stool MPO levels have been correlated with disease&#xD;
      activity in inflammatory bowel disease as assessed both by endoscopic and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters (SAIKI T, 1998). MAL-ED study has already demonstrated the role of MPO as a marker&#xD;
      of gut function (McCormick et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure this biomarker concentration by a commercial ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next Generation Sequencing: In recent years, several next-generation sequencing technologies&#xD;
      have been established (Shendure &amp; Ji, 2008) which further make it possible to analyze a large&#xD;
      number of microorganisms in different environments (Tringe et al., 2005) and human body sites&#xD;
      (Ding &amp; Schloss, 2014, including the human gut (Methé et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      16S rDNA sequence analysis and metagenomics are two effective DNA sequencing techniques, and&#xD;
      both have been used to study uncultivated gut microbial communities. 16S rDNA sequence&#xD;
      analysis focuses on the sequencing of the conserved 16S rDNA gene present in all microbes&#xD;
      (Woese &amp; Fox, 1977) and has established a series of novel connections between intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota composition and disease (Blaser et al., 2013). The research based on 16S rDNA&#xD;
      sequence is a technique to reveal &quot;who's there?&quot; in a given microbial community, while&#xD;
      shotgun metagenomic sequencing will be able to answer the complementary question of &quot;what can&#xD;
      they do?&quot; (Lepage et al., 2012). Next generation sequencing will be performed to detect the&#xD;
      engraftment of organism especially B. infantis after intervention in severely malnourished&#xD;
      infants and comparing it with well nourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomics was first described in 1998 by Handelsman and Rodon ( Handelsman et al., 1998)&#xD;
      and became another DNA sequencing approach to study the complex gut microbial community. It&#xD;
      aims to catalog all the genes from a community by the random sequencing of all DNA extracted&#xD;
      from the sample (Qin et al., 2010). Firstly, the total DNA of all microorganisms is extracted&#xD;
      from fecal samples. Before being sequenced, total DNA samples are randomly sheared by a&#xD;
      &quot;shotgun&quot; approach. The comprehensive sequences are then analyzed to obtain either species&#xD;
      profiles based on phylogenetic markers (16S rDNA) (Sunagawa et al., 2010) or genomic profiles&#xD;
      based on whole genomes (Tringe et al., 2005). Metagenomics plays a role in understanding the&#xD;
      human gut microbiome, including the diversity of the gut microbiome, identifying novel genes,&#xD;
      and determining the etiology of functional dysbiosis (Wang et al., 2015). Baseline&#xD;
      composition of gut microbiota (metagenomic analysis) and Bifidobacterium colonization&#xD;
      (relative abundance) by metagenomic analysis during/after supplementation will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      qPCR: Real time PCR will be done for quantitative detection of organism in DNA directly&#xD;
      extracted from stool sample. B. infantis colonization by qPCR during and after&#xD;
      supplementation (with and without prebiotics) will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any cytokine that is produced locally as a result of gut inflammation may leak into the bowel&#xD;
      lumen and appear in the stools. Large inflammatory infiltrate in the diseased mucosa of gut&#xD;
      causes raised cytokines in stool. We will do cytokine assays to detect gut inflammation. We&#xD;
      will measure in stool samples Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β),&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-17 (IL-17), Interleukin-22&#xD;
      (IL-22), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interferon Gamma-Induced Protein 10&#xD;
      (IP-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISAs for sCD83, sTLR2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A soluble form of CD83 is released from activated dendritic cells and B lymphocytes, and is&#xD;
      detectable in normal human sera (Hock et al., 2001). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class&#xD;
      of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that play a key role in innate immunity and trigger a&#xD;
      specific immune response. sTLR2 has been detected in human fluids, such as plasma, breast&#xD;
      milk, saliva and amniotic fluid as well as in supernatant of cultured monocytes (LeBouder et&#xD;
      al., 2003; Kuroishi et al., 2007; Dulay et al., 2009) We will isolate sCD83 and sTLR2 from&#xD;
      stool samples of malnourished infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal lipocalin 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This glycoprotein is expressed in several cells and, has been associated with primary and&#xD;
      secondary granules of human neutrophils (Roudkenar et al., 2007). Upregulation of Lcn-2 is&#xD;
      observed in tissue damaging conditions such as infection, kidney injury, cancer, ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and burn injury where production of free radicals occurs (Chassaing et al., 2012).&#xD;
      Lipocalin-2 correlates less tightly with the neutrophil markers, it may provide a&#xD;
      complementary marker of epithelial cell disruption or damage ( Prata et al., 2016). We will&#xD;
      do the test for both the malnourished and well nourished infants to detect enterocyte damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast milk microbiota and HMO analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several study where breast milk analysis (Williams et al., 2017) and bacterial&#xD;
      community in breast milk (Hunt et al., 2011) were assessed. In this study Microbiota analysis&#xD;
      will be done with 16S rDNA sequence analysis. HMO measurement will be done to know LnNT&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires will be visually scanned soon after interview &amp; marked for omissions,&#xD;
           inconsistencies or mistakes that will be addressed immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SPSS will be used &amp; data will be entered after creating a template for each data entry&#xD;
           file with appropriate logical and consistency checks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be continuously entered as the data are being generated in hospital and&#xD;
           laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be validated by a series of logical and range checks, producing summary&#xD;
           statistics and tables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition 50 % CRF (and all variables) will be checked by investigator(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be immediately copied on the hard disks of two computers as soon as data&#xD;
           verification will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Outcome (Primary and Secondary) Variable(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot study, we will enrol 18 SAM infants per treatment arm, and additional 18&#xD;
      non-malnourished children, thus a total of 72 infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data will be entered in to the pre-tested Clinical Record Forms (CRFs) using&#xD;
      SPSS (20.0 version, Armonk, NY) and finally cleaned with repeated check. To know the outcome&#xD;
      of prebiotic and probiotic supplementation in our study children for normally distributed&#xD;
      data we will perform ANOVA and in case of non-normal distribution of measurements, equivalent&#xD;
      non-parametric tests like Kruskal-Wallis H test will be used and appropriate post hoc test&#xD;
      will be done for the sub-group analysis, if required. A probability of less than 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant and strength of association will be determined by&#xD;
      calculating odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). If any death occurs we will&#xD;
      perform verbal autopsy and evaluate the associated factors of death by the same analytic&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) Data safety Monitoring will be rigorously performed&#xD;
      throughout the course of the study. All forms will be reviewed by study physician after&#xD;
      enrolment and data collection followed by supervisor for completeness, legibility, and&#xD;
      internal consistency. Administration of prebiotic and probiotic in hospital will be in&#xD;
      presence of study physician. All aspects of specimen accession, processing and interpretation&#xD;
      will also be performed according to SOPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborative Arrangements icddr,b will perform the study in collaboration with Evolve&#xD;
      BioSystems, Inc. USA , a private enterprise established in California by internationally&#xD;
      reputed academicians researching into infant gut microbiome and its critical association with&#xD;
      human breast milk.&#xD;
