      The purpose of this study is to describe pain relief in TTH with Neosaldina treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, non-interventional and prospective study of healthy participants&#xD;
      with episodic TTH who have already been treated with Neosaldina according to regular clinical&#xD;
      practice. This study will assess the pain intensity and pain relief of TTH after the uptake&#xD;
      of Neosaldina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 317 participants. All participants will be enrolled into&#xD;
      one observational group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Neosaldina&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will assess participants from the time of enrolment through the completion of&#xD;
      observation period up to 6 months. Each participant will be assessed up to 45 days after&#xD;
      first dose. The data will be collected from medical charts and during routine follow up&#xD;
      visits. The data from participants will be collected through a self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire using a mobile phone. All the participants will be instructed to insert the&#xD;
      data in an application, downloaded in their phone whenever they will have an episode of TTH&#xD;
      and use Neosaldina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Brazil. The overall duration of observation&#xD;
      period in this study is approximately 6 months. Participants will be contacted by telephone&#xD;
      on Days 15 and 30 for a follow up and will make a final visit on Day 45.&#xD;

    <measure>Cohort 2: Time-weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference From Baseline (0 Hour) to 2 Hours (SPID 0-2) Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 hour) up to 2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) was calculated as time-weighted sum of the visual analogue scale (VAS) differences over 2 hour period. Pain intensity was measured by VAS which was an 11-point numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very intense pain). Pain intensity difference (PID) was the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the dosing) and current pain intensity at assessment. Total possible score ranges from -720 (worst) to 120 (best) for SPID 0-2. A higher value in SPID indicated greater pain relief. This outcome was recorded at 15-minutes intervals for the first 60 minutes, followed by 30 minutes from 1 to 2 hours after Neosaldina administration.</description>

    <description>Pain intensity was measured by VAS which was an 11-point numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very intense pain). Percentage of participants are reported who had no pain relief and who achieved a reduction of at least 1 point pain in intensity for each time interval.</description>

    <time_frame>Each episodic TTH (Day 1 to Day 45)</time_frame>
    <description>The relief of pain intensity was assessed by the PID% in each time point. Pain intensity was measured by VAS which was an 11-point numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very intense pain). PID was the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the dosing) and current pain intensity at assessment. Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief (confirmed by meaningful relief which was reduction of at least 1 point on pain intensity) according to the pain intensity reported at the time points 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after Neosaldina administration.</description>

        <title>Cohort 2: Time-weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference From Baseline (0 Hour) to 2 Hours (SPID 0-2) Post-dose</title>
        <description>Sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) was calculated as time-weighted sum of the visual analogue scale (VAS) differences over 2 hour period. Pain intensity was measured by VAS which was an 11-point numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very intense pain). Pain intensity difference (PID) was the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the dosing) and current pain intensity at assessment. Total possible score ranges from -720 (worst) to 120 (best) for SPID 0-2. A higher value in SPID indicated greater pain relief. This outcome was recorded at 15-minutes intervals for the first 60 minutes, followed by 30 minutes from 1 to 2 hours after Neosaldina administration.</description>

Participants were instructed to insert the data in an application, downloaded onto mobile phone, whenever they had an episode of TTH and use Neosaldina.

        <title>Cohorts 1 and 2: Time to First Perceptible Pain Relief (PR)</title>
        <description>The relief of pain intensity was assessed by the PID% in each time point. Pain intensity was measured by VAS which was an 11-point numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very intense pain). PID was the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the dosing) and current pain intensity at assessment. Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief (confirmed by meaningful relief which was reduction of at least 1 point on pain intensity) according to the pain intensity reported at the time points 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after Neosaldina administration.</description>
