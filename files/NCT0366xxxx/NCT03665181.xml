    <textblock>
      This study focuses on reduction of X-rays dose applied to eye's lens during cranial CT in&#xD;
      children. Principal objective is to analyse the efficiency of ocular bismuth masks, which are&#xD;
      associated with an eye's lens dose modulation&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eye's lens radiosensitivity represents an important subject of investigation in radiology.&#xD;
      Indeed, eye's lens is recognised as one of the most radiosensitive organs in human body.[1,2]&#xD;
      Radiation induced cataracts represent a determining effect of ionising radiations and has&#xD;
      been widely studied. &quot;International Commission for Radiological Protection&quot; has evaluated&#xD;
      cataract appearance threshold at 15 Gy in 1977 &quot;,[3] then at 8 Gy [4] and 5 Gy in 2007.[5]&#xD;
      Finally, in 2011 new studies gave rise to a new limit of appearance of 0.5 Gy. Eye's lens&#xD;
      radiosensitivity seems to have been underestimated for several years and so there is a&#xD;
      significant improvement to be made in radioprotection in order to protect to the best of the&#xD;
      investigator's ability both patient and manipulator. This was also confirmed by the Directive&#xD;
      EURATOM 2013/59 (which is in the process of being transposed in French legislation)[6] that&#xD;
      reduces legal limit dose delivered to eye's lens from 150mSv to20mSv, for categories A&#xD;
      workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is performed on 4 sequential groups, of ten patients, whereby one control group&#xD;
      without ocular protection added. Other groups benefit either from a bismuth ocular&#xD;
      protection, from a dose modulation applied to the eye's lens, or from both techniques&#xD;
      associated. For each group, experiment is then focused on dose received by the eye's lens&#xD;
      (measured using TLD detectors) as well as on Image quality obtained. Currently, there is no&#xD;
      recommendation regarding lens protection for patient who benefit of a head tomodensitometry.&#xD;
      Some practices are already used routinely but without a critical analysis of a comparison of&#xD;
      their respective benefits.&#xD;
