             erythropoietin) within 7 days before the first administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following&#xD;
             intervals before the first administration of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≤ 14 days for chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation&#xD;
                  therapy. Subjects must also not require chronic use of corticosteroids and must&#xD;
                  not have had radiation pneumonitis because of a treatment. A 1-week washout is&#xD;
                  permitted for palliative radiation to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease&#xD;
                  with medical monitor approval. Note: Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted&#xD;
                  medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ≤ 28 days for prior immunotherapy or persistence of active cellular therapy&#xD;
                  (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy; other cellular therapies must be&#xD;

                  denosumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. ≤ 7 days for immune-suppressive-based treatment for any reason. Note: Use of&#xD;
                  inhaled or topical steroids or corticosteroid use for radiographic procedures is&#xD;
                  permitted. Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be&#xD;
                  approved after consultation with the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. ≤ 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose for all&#xD;
                  other investigational study drugs or devices. For investigational agents with&#xD;
                  long half-lives (e.g., &gt; 5 days), enrollment before the fifth half-life requires&#xD;
                  medical monitor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;

             therapy. Note: Subjects with stable chronic conditions (≤ Grade 2) not expected to&#xD;
             resolve (such as neuropathy and alopecia) are exceptions and may enroll. Note:&#xD;
             Subjects with a history of any grade immune-related ocular AE (e.g., episcleritis,&#xD;
             scleritis, uveitis) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, chicken pox/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin,&#xD;
             and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed&#xD;
             virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,&#xD;
             FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past (i.e., with use&#xD;
             of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Note:&#xD;
             Subjects with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, who have not required systemic&#xD;
             treatment for an autoimmune disease for at least 2 years and are stable on thyroid&#xD;
             hormone replacement are allowed to participate in the study. Note: Replacement and&#xD;
             symptomatic therapies (e.g., levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) are not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic immune suppressive therapy and are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Note: Subjects with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without&#xD;
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least 28 days before the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new&#xD;
             or enlarging brain metastases or CNS edema, and have not required steroids for at&#xD;
             least 7 days before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, or&#xD;
             history of other malignancy within 2 years of study entry after treatment with&#xD;
             curative intent. Note: Cured basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer, prostate intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the cervix, or other noninvasive or indolent malignancy, or cancers from which the&#xD;
             subject has been disease-free for &gt; 1 year are not considered exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis or history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, is clinically meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection despite appropriate&#xD;
             anti-infection treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), unless the hepatitis&#xD;
             is considered to be cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of HIV (HIV 1 or HIV 2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or reaction to any component of study drug or formulation components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 60 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
