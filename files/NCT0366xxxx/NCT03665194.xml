  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double blind placebo controlled Phase I study which will assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and PK of Cortexolone 17α-propionate (and its metabolites), and its&#xD;
      effects on the QTc interval when administered as multiple doses to healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
      Volunteers will receive a morning and evening dose (12 hours apart) of 225 mg (3 mL&#xD;
      Cortexolone 17α-propionate applied topically as a 7.5 % solution (75 mg in 1 mL), giving a&#xD;
      total daily dose of 450 mg (6 mL) per individual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two volunteers will be enrolled and evaluated (i.e. complete the study). Subjects will&#xD;
      be dosed in four groups of eight (purely for logistical reasons relating to the procedure&#xD;
      times expected with dosing and ECG). Volunteers will receive either the active drug or&#xD;
      matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Therefore within each cohort, six volunteers will receive&#xD;
      the active drug and two will receive matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be screened within 20 days prior to entering the study on Day -1. Each&#xD;
      volunteer will receive verbal and written information followed by signing of the ICF prior to&#xD;
      any screening procedures taking place. Volunteers will be admitted to the study unit on Day&#xD;
      -1, dosed twice daily on Days 1-3 and once on Day 4 (morning dose only). They will be&#xD;
      discharged on Day 6 and will have a telephone follow-up on Day 14. If they report any&#xD;
      relevant Adverse Event (AE) they will be invited to attend the unit for an outpatient visit&#xD;
      as close to Day 14 as is possible.&#xD;

             (as defined as amenorrhoea for at least 12 months with no alternative medical cause)&#xD;

             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For male subjects who have had a vasectomy (with documented evidence of azoospermia if&#xD;
             possible) and agree to use a barrier method (male condom) for the stated time period,&#xD;

             abnormalities as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluation (haematology, biochemistry,&#xD;
             coagulation and urinalysis) that is reasonably likely to interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation in or ability to complete the study as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to provide written, personally signed, and dated informed consent to&#xD;
             participate in the study, in accordance with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;

             signs, or physical findings at screening, pre-dose of Day 1 (as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator). In case of uncertain or questionable results, tests performed during&#xD;
