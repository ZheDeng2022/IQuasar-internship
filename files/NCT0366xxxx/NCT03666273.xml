    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn more about a new drug called Bapotulimab given in&#xD;
      combination with Pembrolizumab. The purpose of this study is to learn if this new combination&#xD;
      of drugs is safe for the participants, how it affects the body and to try to find the best&#xD;
      dose of the new drug to give to participants and to obtain a preliminary assessment of the&#xD;
      tumor response efficacy in the recurrent or metastatic Head and Neck Cancer.&#xD;
