      Introduction and background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glomerulonephritis and auto-immune diseases are often associated. Lupus nephritis (LN) is one&#xD;
      of the major clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) which have a&#xD;
      severe impact on prognosis. This complication is a real challenge for clinicians because of&#xD;
      insidious-onset and no predictable relapses. Biomarker use is therefore essential, but&#xD;
      conventional biomarkers such as proteinuria have poor sensivity and low specificity to&#xD;
      predict LN occurrence, and new more reliable biomarkers (genetic, epigenetic or protein&#xD;
      biomarkers) are difficult to use for daily medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-glomerular membrane basement disease (anti-GBM disease) is a rare (0.5 to 1/millions of&#xD;
      inhabitants) and severe illness, characterised by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,&#xD;
      pulmonary haemorrhage and the presence of anti-GBM antibodies, which are highly sensible&#xD;
      (100%) and specific (92-100%) of this condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Our experience and literature review&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our department of internal medicine, we report one case of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis&#xD;
      associated to an active SLE. After literature review, we note the following studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  some similar association cases had been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In 2006, a Chinese cohort study highlighted important rates of anti-GBM antibodies, in&#xD;
           serum samples from patients with SLE (14 positives/157patients (8.9%) using ELISA&#xD;
           method). Moreover, every SLE patient with positive circulating anti-GMB antibodies LN&#xD;
           and a severer SLE (with significantly more anemias, pulmonary hemorrhage). According to&#xD;
           histological data's, they also had more important kidney damages (10/14 had necrotizing&#xD;
           crescentic glomerulonephritis lesions and 5/14 fulfil criteria's for anti-GBM disease&#xD;
           diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We also note that some authors published experimental studies showing that immunological&#xD;
           and genetic links exist between LN and anti-GBM disease, which could explain this&#xD;
           association.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Main Hypothesis: Based on these findings, we suspect that detection of significant&#xD;
           levels of circulating anti-GBM antibodies may be more frequent in SLE followed patients&#xD;
           than in general population, and that it could be an interesting biomarker of LN in&#xD;
           patient with SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Objectives First objective: based on 2 SLE patient groups (one having lupus nephritis&#xD;
           and the other without it) we would like to compare the ratio of positive anti-GBM&#xD;
           antibodies in each group, expecting a higher rate in SLE patients with LN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second objective: will be to study the positive anti-GBM group patients in their clinical&#xD;
      aspects, serological features and renal characteristics, in this SLE population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Materials and methods We suggest a retrospective analytic transversal controlled study,&#xD;
      based on serum samples from the Lupus Biobank of Upper Rhine (LBBR project), and based on&#xD;
      serum samples from healthy voluntary blood donors (control group). We will then perform tests&#xD;
      in each serum sample group in our immunology laboratory and compare the ratio of positive&#xD;
      anti-GBM in each arm.&#xD;

      Introduction and context :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glomerulonephritis and auto-immune diseases are often associated. Lupus nephritis (LN) is one&#xD;
      of the major clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) which have a&#xD;
      severe impact on prognosis. This complication is a real challenge for clinicians because of&#xD;
      insidious-onset and no predictable relapses. Biomarker use is therefore essential, but&#xD;
      conventional biomarkers such as proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, urine sediments,&#xD;
      anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement levels, have poor sensivity and low specificity to&#xD;
      predict LN occurrence, and new more reliable biomarkers (such as genetic, epigenetic or&#xD;
      protein biomarkers) are difficult to use for daily medical practice , .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-glomerular membrane basement disease (anti-GBM disease) is a rare (0.5 to 1/millions of&#xD;
      inhabitants , ) and severe illness , , characterised by rapidly progressive&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis, pulmonary haemorrhage and the presence of anti-GBM antibodies, which are&#xD;
      highly sensible (100%) and specific (92-100%) of this condition .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our department of internal medicine, one case of Goodpasture glomerulonephritis associated&#xD;
      to an active SLE has been reported , and after searching data in literature, we note the&#xD;
      following studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  some similar cases were reported such as a case of pulmonary hemorrhage and positive&#xD;
           anti-GBM in SLE , or a case of anti-GBM disease and LN presenting as pulmonary-renal&#xD;
           syndrome .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In 2006, a Chinese cohort study highlighted an elevated prevalence of anti-GBM&#xD;
           antibodies, in serum samples from patients with SLE (14 positives/157patients (8.9%)&#xD;
           with ELISA method). Moreover, every patient with positive anti-GMB antibodies had LN and&#xD;
           a severer SLE (with more anemias, pulmonary hemorrhage). They also suffered from more&#xD;
           important kidney disease. In fact, in histological criteria's, 10/14 had necrotizing&#xD;
           crescentic glomerulonephritis lesions and 5/14 had a real diagnosis of Goodpasture&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We also note that some authors have already studied pathogenesis of this association&#xD;
           (whether immunological explanations , genetics links , ).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Main Hypothesis: Based on these findings, we suspect that detection of positive&#xD;
           circulating anti-GBM antibodies may be more frequently positive in SLE followed patients&#xD;
           (than in general population) and that it could be an interesting screening biomarker for&#xD;
           LN.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Objectives First objective: based on 2 SLE patient groups (one having lupus nephritis&#xD;
           and another without it) we would like to compare the ratio of positive anti-GBM&#xD;
           antibodies in each group, expecting a higher rate in SLE patients with LN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second objective: to study positive anti-GBM patients in their clinical aspects, serological&#xD;
      features and renal characteristics, in this SLE population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Materials and methods We suggest a retrospective analytic transversal controlled study,&#xD;
      based on serum samples from the Lupus Biobank of Upper Rhine (LBBR project), and on serum&#xD;
      samples from healthy voluntary blood donors (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the use of LBBR Lupus Biobank, our project has already been accepted by scientific&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After group randomization, Cryo-conserved SLE serum samples will be transferred by&#xD;
      specialized transporter service, from Strasbourg biobank, to the immunology laboratory&#xD;
      department in Reims University Hospital center, to perform anti-GBM tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning healthy serum sample recruitment, Regional blood center of Reims will&#xD;
      systematically suggest to voluntary blood donors to participate. If they agree, they will&#xD;
      receive an extended information about the study, and after written consent, a tube sample&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Population The statistic calculation led to the need of 200 SLE sera (100 patients in each&#xD;
      group). Thus, we will use : 100 serum samples coming from lupus biobank LBBR patients without&#xD;
      lupus nephritis, and 100 serum samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and&#xD;
      lupus nephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also use 100 serum samples of voluntary blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Experimental project Anti-GBM antibodies detection in serums will be performed by an&#xD;
      automatized chemiluminescent method, using a commercial test kit. In case of positivity, same&#xD;
      serum will be tested second time to confirm the result, and then controlled by another method&#xD;
      using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) in frozen sections of primate kidney, covering the&#xD;
      reaction areas of a BIOCHIP slide (reference method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our immunology laboratory department, we need 600μl of serum per patient to be&#xD;
      able to perform all the tests. According to the manufacturer's instruction, the optimum&#xD;
      cut-off value for positivity in chemiluminescence method will be set at 20CU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Data analysis Primary endpoint: proportion of positive anti-MBG antibodies, will be&#xD;
      estimated in each group (with and without lupus nephritis) by a Chi-2 test or an exact test&#xD;
      of Fisher (depending on test validity conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: clinical, serological and renal features of anti-GBM positives patients,&#xD;
      will be compared to negatives, using tests adapted to the distribution of each variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Expected results and future prospects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We expect a higher frequency of positive circulating anti-GBM antibodies in patients&#xD;
           with LN compared to the SLE control group and to healthy control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether this research was positive, another larger study could show the interest of&#xD;
           anti-GBM antibodies as a predictive biomarker of LN, and as a prognostic biomarker of&#xD;
           SLE.&#xD;
