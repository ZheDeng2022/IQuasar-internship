  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind placebo-controlled study will assess the tolerability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of intradermal Hair Stimulating Complex (HSC) in up to 18 of 27 women with&#xD;
      Ludwig 1 or 2 classification or the Savin Frontal classification of hair loss. Safety&#xD;
      measures include vital signs, dermatological examination of the scalp, pre- and post-dose&#xD;
      blood and urine collection, as well as Investigator Global Assessments and subject self&#xD;
      assessments throughout the 22-week study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized single site trial. The study is&#xD;
      to be conducted in La Jolla, CA and is primarily designed to evaluate safety in the clinical&#xD;
      application of injected HSC by assessing the tolerability of HSC, as well as the volume that&#xD;
      can be delivered safely in the intradermal region of the scalp using a syringe with 31-gauge&#xD;
      1.75 mm length needle. The main study (18 weeks) involves the two treatment time points,&#xD;
      collection of lab samples (blood/urine) for screening, and before and after the two treatment&#xD;
      time points. Six of the seven total visits (including screening) in the study are conducted&#xD;
      in the first 18 weeks. The final visit is for investigator monitoring, global photographs and&#xD;
      final lab collection 30 days after the 18-week evaluation point. A 2 year follow up&#xD;
      questionnaire will be sent to the patient to collect additional safety information.&#xD;
      Additional dermatological exam of the scalp, as well as Subject and Investigator Assessments&#xD;
      will also be assessed. The secondary goal of the study will be to explore whether an efficacy&#xD;
      signal of the change in hair growth can be detected using an independent panel of physician's&#xD;
      comparing global photographs taken at baseline to week 18 (and baseline to week 22), for&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
