      Outcome after non-traumatic cardiac arrest remains poor despite many efforts in improving&#xD;
      immediate advanced life support (ALS) and post-arrest therapy. Preserving myocardial and&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion in the event of cardiac arrest by the means of effective cardio-pulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR) is of utmost importance. During CPR, coronary perfusion pressure is a&#xD;
      significant predictor of increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and&#xD;
      survival to hospital discharge, while cerebral perfusion pressure is crucial for good&#xD;
      neurologic outcome. The absence of ROSC despite prolonged high quality and efficient initial&#xD;
      basic life support (BLS) followed by traditional ALS ends finally in neuronal damage and&#xD;
      death. Occlusion of the aorta using a REBOA catheter in the management of noncompressible&#xD;
      abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage has shown improvements in hemodynamic profiles and has proved&#xD;
      to be feasible in both, clinical and preclinical settings for trauma patients in hemorrhagic&#xD;
      shock. Animal models of continuous balloon occlusion of the aorta in non-traumatic cardiac&#xD;
      arrest have shown meaningful increases in coronary artery blood flow, coronary artery&#xD;
      perfusion pressure and carotid blood flow, leading to improved rates of ROSC, 48h-survival&#xD;
      and neurological function. These promising data provide an opportunity to improve outcome&#xD;
      after cardiac arrest in humans too. Before testing such an approach in humans, the safe and&#xD;
      reliable placement procedure of the catheter-balloon in humans after cardiac arrest needs to&#xD;
      be established under ongoing CPR.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale Outcome after non-traumatic cardiac arrest remains poor despite many&#xD;
      efforts in improving immediate advanced life support (ALS) and post-arrest therapy.&#xD;
      Preserving myocardial and cerebral perfusion in the event of cardiac arrest by the means of&#xD;
      effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is of utmost importance. During CPR, coronary&#xD;
      perfusion pressure is a significant predictor of increased rates of return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital discharge, while cerebral perfusion pressure is&#xD;
      crucial for good neurologic outcome. The absence of ROSC despite prolonged high quality and&#xD;
      efficient initial basic life support (BLS) followed by traditional ALS ends finally in&#xD;
      neuronal damage and death. Occlusion of the aorta using a REBOA catheter in the management of&#xD;
      non-compressible abdominal or pelvic haemorrhage has shown improvements in hemodynamic&#xD;
      profiles and has proved to be feasible in a preclinical setting for trauma patients in&#xD;
      haemorrhagic shock. Animal models of continuous balloon occlusion of the aorta in&#xD;
      non-traumatic cardiac arrest have shown meaningful increases in coronary artery blood flow,&#xD;
      coronary artery perfusion pressure and carotid blood flow leading to improved rates of ROSC,&#xD;
      48h-survival and neurological function. These promising data provide an opportunity to&#xD;
      improve outcome after cardiac arrest in humans too. Before testing such an approach in&#xD;
      humans, the safe and reliable placement procedure of the catheter-balloon in humans after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest needs to be established under ongoing CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product (treatment, device) and Indication The ER-REBOA™ Catheter, Prytime&#xD;
      Medical, 229 North Main Street, Boerne, TX 78006, USA, has a CE Declaration of Conformity and&#xD;
      is intended, as defined in the instruction manual, for temporary occlusion of large vessels&#xD;
      and blood pressure monitoring. The ER-REBOA™ Catheter is specifically designed for use in the&#xD;
      emergency and critical care environment and was developed to support rapid and immediate&#xD;
      haemorrhage control in trauma patients but can also be used in patients with ruptured&#xD;
      aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Importantly, the ER-REBOA™ Catheter is indicated to be&#xD;
      safely and effectively placed with or without the aid of medical imaging if none is&#xD;
      available. The device will be placed via femoral artery directly in the thoracic part of the&#xD;
      aorta, with the aid of a standard 7-F introducer sheath. For blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
      standard equipment (transducer and 0.9% saline flush unit) are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puncture of the femoral artery to gain access to the arterial system is a standard procedure&#xD;
      in the emergency and critical care area, as well as in cardiology, interventional radiology,&#xD;
      angiology/vessel surgery and anaesthesiology. Puncture itself can be difficult or impossible,&#xD;
      even with the aid of ultrasonography, especially in an emergency. Nevertheless, even&#xD;
      prehospital puncture of the femoral artery during cardiac arrest in order to obtain&#xD;
      hemodynamic monitoring and guide CPR has shown feasible. Handling the balloon catheter&#xD;
      requires a short introduction and some mannequin training before first use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical Evidence Several studies have examined the effect of continuous balloon occlusion&#xD;
      of the aorta during non-traumatic cardiac arrest in animal models. Occlusion of the aorta&#xD;
      with and without selective aortic arch perfusion was shown to increases coronary artery blood&#xD;
      flow and perfusion pressure as well as carotid perfusion pressure and blood flow, thus&#xD;
      leading to improved rates of ROSC, 24h- and 48hsurvival and neurological function in animals.&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, no conflicting data failing to show the described effects&#xD;
      has been published, leading to the suggestion that further research should concentrate on the&#xD;
      question whether these promising findings apply for humans, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Evidence to Date Recent advances in technology have led to the endovascular approach&#xD;
      to the aorta being no longer exclusively the domain of cardiology, angiology and vascular&#xD;
      surgery, but emergency and critical care physicians and surgeons using the technique in the&#xD;
      emergency and critical care setting as well as in a prehospital setting to control major&#xD;
      pelvic and abdominal hemorrhage in trauma victims. Therefore, regarding the use of the&#xD;
      ER-REBOA catheter, available literature reports mainly trauma victims, where endovascular&#xD;
      occlusion of the aorta was used to control exsanguinating hemorrhage but was also shown to&#xD;
      lead to meaningful increases of mean arterial blood pressure immediately following occlusion&#xD;
      of the aorta. A recent study examining the outcome of trauma victims with severe hemorrhage&#xD;
      also included patients in traumatic cardiac arrest and showed a neurological intact survival&#xD;
      rate of 10%, whereas survival of cardiac arrest due to massive hemorrhage treated with&#xD;
      emergency department thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamp is known to be dismal. Similarly,&#xD;
      patients with non-traumatic hemorrhage mainly from intraabdominal aneurysmal rupture received&#xD;
      REBOA until definitive hemorrhage control, with 7 of 11 patients being in cardiac arrest at&#xD;
      the time of insertion and a high survival rate of 57%. Regarding cardiac arrest not&#xD;
      associated with hemorrhage and/or trauma, for humans only case reports exist, describing&#xD;
      neurological intact survival in one case of refractory cardiac arrest with PEA/Asystole&#xD;
      during coronary angiography, where after 20 minutes of futile ALS an intra-aortal balloon&#xD;
      pump (IABP) was inserted, with detection of ROSC 30seconds after occlusion of the descending&#xD;
      aorta. Importantly, the estimated benefit of increased mean arterial pressure and coronary&#xD;
      perfusion pressure even with intermittent occlusion of the aorta has led to the&#xD;
      recommendation to use the IABP (after switching to a pressure-triggered mode) in patients&#xD;
      with cardiac arrest after heart surgery and IABP in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Device: Rationale for the intended purpose in study (pre-market MD) The ER-REBOA™&#xD;
      Catheter was chosen because it is (to the investigators' knowledge) the only REBOA catheter&#xD;
      which can be inserted without a guide wire, and the placement does not necessarily need&#xD;
      radiologic guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks / Benefits As only patients will be included who have failed to respond to recommended&#xD;
      standard resuscitation therapy (refractory cardiac arrest under BLS/ALS) and not qualifying&#xD;
      for e-CPR, these patients can only gain the benefit of improved survival to hospital&#xD;
      discharge and neurological good outcome, given the extremely poor chance of neurologic intact&#xD;
      survival otherwise. This outweighs the risks associated with arterial puncture (damage to the&#xD;
      vessel/ tissue, pseudoaneurysma, fistula, surgical repair after successful resuscitation) and&#xD;
      the theoretical risk of limb paralysis after prolonged (&gt; 2 hours) ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival of cardiac arrest with an unwanted unfavorable neurologic state is an inherent risk&#xD;
      of resuscitation per se. Use of a REABOA device might possibly shift patients from the&#xD;
      out-come groups &quot;death&quot; towards &quot;vegetative state&quot; or &quot;home-bound and dependent on others&quot;.&#xD;
      The investigators cannot estimate this specific &quot;risk of survival&quot;, which, depending on&#xD;
      personal beliefs, are not necessarily seen as bad outcome at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, the ER-REBOA™ Catheter is intended for temporal occlusion of large&#xD;
      vessels and specifically designed for the use in an emergency or intensive care setting, as&#xD;
      it is planned in this study. Possible problems with malpositioning and injury to the access&#xD;
      site, rarely requiring surgical repair, have been addressed. The extreme complication - the&#xD;
      case of exsanguinating hemorrhage due to the puncture - is judged acceptable by the study&#xD;
      group compared to the potential benefit of surviving otherwise refractory cardiac arrest&#xD;
      during standard ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of choice of study population To evaluate the feasibility of the REBOA catheter&#xD;
      placement during resuscitative efforts due to cardiac arrest, the investigators cannot&#xD;
      perform the study in already deceased persons since the investigators need the hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements during CPR as a success parameter that measurable blood pressure can be&#xD;
      generated in the aorta due to the occlusion. Since cardiac arrest and CPR cannot be performed&#xD;
      in healthy subjects or in patients during routine cardiac surgery or coronary angiography,&#xD;
      the investigators can only perform the study in patients suffering from actual cardiac&#xD;
      arrest. Patients in cardiac arrest are per definition clinically dead (no circulation - no&#xD;
      breathing) and in the most extreme life threatening emergency. Therefore patients in CA&#xD;
      cannot consent beforehand. Standard CPR is a highly focused team-orientated and standardized&#xD;
      event to save the life of the patient, and given the nature of cardiac arrest, an extremely&#xD;
      time-sensitive emergency. It will therefore be no time to contact family members or next of&#xD;
      kin to get consent for a study, and timely involvement of an independent physician in the&#xD;
      study consent procedure beforehand will not be achievable in each case (despite the intend to&#xD;
      do so). If the patient survives, a daily assessment of the patient's capacity to give&#xD;
      informed consent will be done until the patient is discharged from the ICU, as in any case of&#xD;
      significant clinical change. When the patient is judged capable of giving consent, a post hoc&#xD;
      informed consent process will be performed as soon as possible. If the patient is permanently&#xD;
      lacking capacity to consent and if no written statement of wishes formulated in a state of&#xD;
      capacity is available, a proxy consent will be obtained from a person authorized to represent&#xD;
      the patient as soon as possible, bearing in mind the emotional stress the proxy experienced&#xD;
      after the event of sudden cardiac death and resuscitation and providing an appropriate time&#xD;
      frame.&#xD;
