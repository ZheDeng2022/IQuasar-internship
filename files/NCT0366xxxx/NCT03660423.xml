  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purpose of this current study is to examine the changes in postural stability in adult&#xD;
      individuals with developmental disabilities following exposure to a college based integrative&#xD;
      dance training course. Integrative dance may be defined as dance that encourages the&#xD;
      participation of all individuals, regardless of ability, supporting and celebrating these&#xD;
      differences as a community. It is hypothesized that a significantly reduced body sway will be&#xD;
      observed in participants following a college based integrative dance training course.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in participants that continue dancing in the program over multiple semesters, it&#xD;
      is hypothesized that there will be an inverse relationship between body sway and dance&#xD;
      participation over time (IE: As participants dance more, body sway will continue to&#xD;
      decrease).&#xD;

      11. Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1 Bridges to Skidmore Course Information DA209, Bridges to Skidmore: The Dance Experience&#xD;
      class will be held twice per week in the dance facilities or Tang teaching museum. This&#xD;
      course will be taught by Dr. Sarah DiPasquale who will also lead the dance class sessions&#xD;
      each week. Dependent on space constraints and learning goals each semester, the class will&#xD;
      convene in the dance studios, dance theater, Tang teaching museum or intramural gym of the&#xD;
      Williamson Sports Center. The Williamson Sports Center and Tang museum are accessible&#xD;
      buildings with multiple handicap accessible parking spots available for the Saratoga Bridges&#xD;
      staff to transport participants. Each week the participants will partake in 100-120 minutes&#xD;
      of contemporary dance training; participants work up to a 30 minute warm up period at the&#xD;
      beginning of class and then take a short break to get a drink or use the bathroom. Chairs are&#xD;
      also set up on all sides of the room so individuals can rest or take a break if they wish.&#xD;
      They will learn the basic positions and combinations used in Contemporary Dance, including:&#xD;
      Plié, Tendu, Degagé, Rond de Jambe, Frappé, Chassé, Sauté, Pas de Bourrée, Glissade, and&#xD;
      Révérance. Additional Contemporary Dance movements and patterns will be employed utilizing a&#xD;
      mixture of fall and recovery techniques consistent with this discipline's movement&#xD;
      vocabulary. A minimum of two staff members from Saratoga Bridges will be in attendance during&#xD;
      the class period in addition to the 8-10 students helping with the class. If a participant&#xD;
      chooses not to dance for the full duration of a given class period, a Bridges staff member&#xD;
      will assist them out of the studio to wait comfortably in the lobby of the dance center,&#xD;
      dance gym or sports center until the class ends and their transportation arrives. A staff&#xD;
      member from Saratoga Bridges will remain with the participant outside of the dance studio.&#xD;
      They may also rejoin the class at any time, should they choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skidmore dance students will register for a 1-credit course through the dance department&#xD;
      entitled Bridges to Skidmore: The Dance Experience (DA271-001). Skidmore students registered&#xD;
      in this class will be matched with a cohort of Bridges participants (ideally a 4:1 ratio or&#xD;
      less). These cohorts will work together in the classroom enabling each member to get to know&#xD;
      one another throughout the duration of the semester. As the Bridges participants will come to&#xD;
      class with a wide range of physical and intellectual abilities, the small group cohort&#xD;
      embedded within the larger class setting will allow the student leaders to assist each person&#xD;
      in a way that meets their individual learning and/or mobility needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any participation in Bridges to Skidmore: The Dance Experience, an intake form will&#xD;
      be completed by a staff member at Saratoga Bridges. This staff member must be a health care&#xD;
      provider who has full access to the participants protected health information (PHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only person who will have full access to the completed intake forms will be Dr. Sarah&#xD;
      DiPasquale PT, DPT. Student data collectors will have limited access to these files in order&#xD;
      to input the information into the database. Prior to any student access to files containing&#xD;
      PHI, the names of the participants will be removed from the documents and replaced with the&#xD;
      participant ID numbers. Additionally, this access will be under direct faculty supervision&#xD;
      and for only the amount of time needed to input the data. These files will be kept in a&#xD;
      locked filing cabinet in office 228 of the Williamson Sports Center at all times and will not&#xD;
      be removed from the office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first day of class for Bridges to Skidmore: The Dance Experience will be a training&#xD;
      session for the Skidmore student cohort leaders. We will invite a member of the Saratoga&#xD;
      Bridges medical or administrative team to talk with the class about working with people with&#xD;
      DD. We will discuss appropriate interactions and confidentiality during the class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Please note: Student cohort leaders are not synonymous with student data collectors. Student&#xD;
      cohort leaders will not have access to any data collected for the purposes of research. They&#xD;
      will be participating only in the 1 credit dance course aspect of the Bridges to Skidmore:&#xD;
      The Dance Experience project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Data Collection Data collection will take place at the Saratoga Bridges facility, the&#xD;
      multipurpose room (Williamson Sports Center) or the intramural gym (Williamson Sports Center)&#xD;
      prior to the program commencement with post-testing to be completed the week of, or&#xD;
      following, the final performance/graduation ceremony. Of great importance during data&#xD;
      collection is the comprehension of the participants during the examination. While tests will&#xD;
      be verbally explained/instructed, a physical demonstration of the measurement will be&#xD;
      presented prior to administration. This will help to create clear expectations for the test&#xD;
      (specifically for those with decreased abilities to comprehend complex verbal explanations),&#xD;
      help to decrease any fear or anxiety surrounding the process, and potentially increase the&#xD;
      reliably of test-retest procedures in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be overseen by Dr. Sarah DiPasquale and assisted by 2-3 student&#xD;
      researchers from Skidmore College each semester. Student data collectors will be trained in&#xD;
      all procedures and techniques directly by the supervising faculty members prior to any data&#xD;
      collection and must be able to demonstrate competency in testing prior to administering any&#xD;
      tests on participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the pre and post data collection will take approximately 15 minutes per participant at&#xD;
      each testing session. Participants will receive instructions prior to each trial of 30&#xD;
      seconds and 2 researchers will always be present on either side of the participant should&#xD;
      they lose their balance. Participants will be asked to stay in a static standing position for&#xD;
      3 trials of 30 seconds while standing on a Wii board in four of the following conditions : 1)&#xD;
      bilateral stance with eyes open, 2) bilateral stance with eyes closed, 3) unilateral stance&#xD;
      on the right limb 4) unilateral stance on the left limb 5) bilateral stance with eyes open on&#xD;
      foam 6) bilateral stance with eyes closed on foam 7) unilateral stance on the right limb on&#xD;
      foam and 8) unilateral stance on the left limb on foam. All three trials will happen back to&#xD;
      back before moving on to the next condition. Different patterns of the four conditions will&#xD;
      be utilized each year as research progresses although no more than four conditions will be&#xD;
      utilized each semester as to minimize the time required of the participant for testing. Each&#xD;
      semester, the participants will be tested under the same four conditions. Participants will&#xD;
      be given a 15 seconds rest period between each trial and will be told they may rest at any&#xD;
      moment.&#xD;
