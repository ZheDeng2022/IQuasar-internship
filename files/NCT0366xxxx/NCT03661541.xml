    <textblock>
      Subjects were recruited who were positive for antibody against herpes simplex virus type 1&#xD;
      (HSV-1) and self-reported having in the previous 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 or more herpes labialis outbreaks (group A),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 or 2 outbreaks (group B), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  zero outbreaks (group C). Twelve subjects in each group were recruited. Blood was&#xD;
           collected from these persons and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated and&#xD;
           tested for proliferation in vitro when stimulated with HSV-1-infected cell extracts,&#xD;
           free HSV-1 virus, or Candida albicans extract. Candida albicans is a ubiquitous&#xD;
           infectious fungus and its extract is used as a test of general immune response. RNA was&#xD;
           also isolated from the PBMCs after incubation in the three stimuli and expression of 41&#xD;
           immune-related genes quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Also serum anti-HSV-1 IgG&#xD;
           levels were quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blood collection on day 1, the persons in group A (frequent cold sore sufferers)&#xD;
      were treated with a single topical application of 2% squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE) in&#xD;
      DMSO, applied to the inner aspect of the upper arm. These subjects returned on days 15 and 57&#xD;
      for blood collection, and their PBMCs were tested again on those dates for proliferation in&#xD;
      vitro against the same stimuli and for gene expression and for serum anti-HSV-1 IgG levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary oral infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically occurs at a young age,&#xD;
      is asymptomatic, and is not associated with significant morbidity. After primary oral&#xD;
      infection, HSV may persist in a latent state in the trigeminal ganglion and later reactivate&#xD;
      as the more common herpes labialis, or &quot;cold sores.&quot; Common triggers for reactivation are&#xD;
      well known and include ultraviolet light, trauma, fatigue, stress, fever, inflammation, and&#xD;
      menstruation. These lesions affect up to 45 percent of the U.S. population. They classically&#xD;
      manifest as a well-localized cluster of small vesicles along the vermilion border of the lip&#xD;
      or adjacent skin. The vesicles subsequently rupture, ulcerate, and crust within 24 to 48&#xD;
      hours. Spontaneous healing occurs over seven to 10 days. In immunocompetent patients, herpes&#xD;
      labialis usually is mild and self-limited. However, pain, swelling, and cosmetic concerns may&#xD;
      prompt physician consultation. Orally administered antiviral agents, such as acyclovir&#xD;
      (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex), have a modest clinical benefit if initiated during the&#xD;
      prodrome. Topical treatment with 1% penciclovir cream (Denavir) may reduce healing time and&#xD;
      pain slightly, even if initiated after the prodrome. However, reduction in healing time with&#xD;
      systemic or topical agents is modest. Squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE) is a topical&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of verruca vulgaris and alopecia areata. During&#xD;
      a recent FDA Compounding Advisory Committee Meeting, it was recommended that squaric acid&#xD;
      dibutylester be included on the list of bulk drug substances allowed for use in compounding&#xD;
      under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. And SADBE has now been so&#xD;
      listed under section 503A. A study completed by Lee et al of 29 patients with recalcitrant&#xD;
      warts demonstrated complete clearance in 69% of patients with application every 2-4 weeks.&#xD;
      Silverberg et al showed a complete clearance in 58% of patients (n=61) when SADBE was applied&#xD;
      3 times weekly. SADBE has also been used with some success in the treatment of alopecia&#xD;
      areata. In a review of the literature, Rokhsar et al noted a 50% to 60% success rate of SADBE&#xD;
      in use for hair re-growth in this population. SADBE has been reported to cause eczema,&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy, blistering, allergic contact dermatitis, skin hypopigmentation, a burning&#xD;
      sensation after application, and systemic reactions including fever and arthralgias. A study&#xD;
      completed by Oglio et al of eight patients treated with SADBE for warts noted only mild and&#xD;
      well tolerated side effects of erythema, desquamation, cutaneous edema, pruritus, burning,&#xD;
      and pain. SADBE induces a delayed-type hypersensitivity response which in warts, is believed&#xD;
      to induce the killing of virally infected cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes. This influx of&#xD;
      lymphocytes into lesional Page 4 of 14 tissue may also enhance the recognition and processing&#xD;
      of viral antigens, leading to clonal expansion of effector cells. It is hoped that SADBE will&#xD;
      offer subjects a safe and effective therapeutic option to decrease the frequency and severity&#xD;
      of future herpes labialis outbreaks through these mechanisms. A placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      study completed at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that squaric acid prevented&#xD;
      recurrence of herpetic lesions. The effect of SADBE of delaying new herpes labialis outbreaks&#xD;
      was highly significant (p&lt;0.01) as compared to placebo.&#xD;
