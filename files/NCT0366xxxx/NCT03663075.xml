  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress-related ill health is today the most common cause of long-term sick leave in women in&#xD;
      the middle of life and a common cause of visits to primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To implement and investigate the effect of education in group and/or individually held in&#xD;
      primary health care clinics embracing aspects of mental health, quality of life, sick leave&#xD;
      and the needs women aged 45-60 with stress-related symptoms have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The study is a randomized controlled trial with a two-factor design. The study&#xD;
      evaluates both group information (GI) and structured person-centered support (PCS) and&#xD;
      possible interaction effects between these two treatment modalities. The group education&#xD;
      consists of four information sessions discussing myths around menopause, physiology, local&#xD;
      estrogen deficiency symptoms, women's cardiovascular health, stress-related ill health,&#xD;
      mental health, relationships, sexuality, lust and possible treatment options. In addition,&#xD;
      conversations about insight into obstacles and resources, coping strategies and behavioral&#xD;
      changes will be included. The individually structured person-centered support comprises of&#xD;
      five meetings consisting of dialogue on symptoms of stress-related ill health, physiology and&#xD;
      coping strategies. Participants will be block randomized into four groups; GI, PCS, GI+PCS or&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result Implementation of group and individual support calls is expected to improve&#xD;
      health for women seeking primary care care. The results are expected to increase the&#xD;
      knowledge of how women's health is affected by short-term care in primary care through&#xD;
      reduced sick leave days, reduced care needs, return to work and increased quality of life.&#xD;
      The result may improve existing primary care routines for women, and if needed, for a more&#xD;
      individualized care contact and support.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress-related ill health is today the most common cause of long-term sick leave in women in&#xD;
      the middle of life and a common cause of visits to primary health care. Women seem to suffer&#xD;
      more than men in the same age group. Few evidence based treatment options exist and none of&#xD;
      them has a proven effect on return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To implement and investigate the effect of education in group and/or individually held in&#xD;
      primary health care clinics embracing aspects of mental health, quality of life, sick leave&#xD;
