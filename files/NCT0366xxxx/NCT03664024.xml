  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with Stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without prior&#xD;
      systemic treatment will be treated with standard of care pembrolizumab combined with&#xD;
      platinum-doublet chemotherapy for 4 cycles, then pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed maintenance&#xD;
      for up to 31 additional cycles. The platinum doublet would be pemetrexed plus the&#xD;
      investigator's choice of either cisplatin or carboplatin. The primary hypothesis is to&#xD;
      evaluate if total baseline tumor mutation burden (TMB) in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) is&#xD;
      predictive of objective response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1) by the investigator by estimating the level of association.&#xD;

    <description>Objective response rate is the proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Objective response rate is assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
