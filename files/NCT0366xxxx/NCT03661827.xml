    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, prospective diagnostic accuracy study to assess the comparative&#xD;
      sensitivity of dobutamine versus adenosine for detection of severe non-infarct epicardial&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis in subjects with reduced LV EF ( EFed referred for clinical coronary&#xD;
      angiography for investigation of symptoms or to establish the cause heart failure. Study&#xD;
      participants will be identified from hospital angiography referral waiting lists, or already&#xD;
      known with CAD and from heart failure outpatient clinics at Glenfield General Hospital.&#xD;
      Clinical and CMR data will be collated on-site (at Glenfield General Hospital) from medical&#xD;
      records stored and stress cardiac MRI scans at Glenfield General Hospital. The analysis will&#xD;
      occur over a 12-month period following study commencement.&#xD;

      Aim The primary aim of this study is to assess the comparative sensitivity of adenosine and&#xD;
      dobutamine for detection of severe CAD in patients with HFrEF. Secondary aims are to evaluate&#xD;
      how the addition of stress perfusion may alter management compared to CMR without stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with HFrEF (EF≤40%), dobutamine perfusion has superior sensitivity to adenosine&#xD;
      for the detection of non-infarct severe CAD (&gt;70% epicardial coronary artery stenosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses The addition of stress perfusion imaging to CMR cine and LGE imaging&#xD;
      does not significantly increase the accuracy for determining whether the aetiology of HFrEF&#xD;
      is due to CAD or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to adenosine (haemodynamics/splenic T1) will be inversely related to markers of&#xD;
      LV dysfunction/injury (high sensitivity troponin I/B-type natriuretic peptide) and directly&#xD;
      to EF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced myocardial perfusion reserve (&lt;2.0) increases the accuracy of adenosine perfusion to&#xD;
      detect CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biphasic wall motion response to dobutamine is not specific for the detection of severe&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental details and design of proposed investigation Design: prospective cross-sectional&#xD;
      study. Subjects: participants will be recruited from the Cardiology Department at Glenfield&#xD;
      General Hospital, Leicester, one of the largest secondary and tertiary care units in the UK.&#xD;
      Patients referred for invasive coronary angiography to determine the cause of HFrEF or&#xD;
      symptomatic angina and EF≤40% will be recruited. Patients will be contacted directly at&#xD;
      hospital appointments or by letter after reviewing of case records to ensure eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: 1. HFrEF (LV EF≤40%, consistent with recent guidelines for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of HFrEF)[38] referred for investigation of CAD; 2. Age ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria: 1.&#xD;
      Absolute contraindication to MRI. 2. Absolute contraindication to dobutamine OR adenosine; 2.&#xD;
      Stage III-V renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30ml/min/1.73m2; 3. Previous&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting; 4. Unstable angina or MI within 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History taking and examination to confirm signs and symptoms of heart failure and obtain&#xD;
           a current medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECG to determine rhythm, ST-segment and conduction abnormalities. Venepuncture (20mL)&#xD;
           for full blood count, biochemistry, high-sensitivity troponin I and B- type natriuretic&#xD;
           peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CMR scanning performed at Glenfield Hospital on a dedicated NIHR 3T research scanner.&#xD;
           The investigators have extensive experience of stress CMR for the assessment of CAD,&#xD;
           including dobutamine stress. Each CMR study will be supervised by the fellow after&#xD;
           appropriate training including safe administration of dobutamine. Patients will be asked&#xD;
           to withhold beta-blocker therapy for 48 hours to minimise antagonism to dobutamine. For&#xD;
           this study, The investigators will use newly installed software with dual-sequence&#xD;
           perfusion that allows fully automated inline quantification of myocardial blood flow&#xD;
           utilising advanced image reconstruction algorithms, Gadgetron, in conjunction with our&#xD;
           collaborator (Dr Peter Kellman, NIH, Bethesda, USA). This sequence allows both visual&#xD;
           analyses for perfusion defects and quantification of myocardial blood flow and perfusion&#xD;
           reserve on a pixel by pixel basis. A modified protocol will be undertaken,&#xD;
           incorporating:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cine functional assessment to determine ventricular volumes and function; Adenosine stress&#xD;
      perfusion, dobutamine stress wall motion and perfusion, and rest perfusion imaging to assess&#xD;
      qualitative perfusion defects, inducible wall motion abnormalities and myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      reserve. Dobutamine will be reversed with intravenous metoprolol before undertaking LGE and&#xD;
      then rest perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed contrast enhancement for assessment of LV fibrosis and evidence of previous&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. The investigators did consider undertaking adenosine stress CMR and&#xD;
      dobutamine stress CMR scans on separate days, to mitigate the effects of contrast remaining&#xD;
      affecting perfusion quantification during dobutamine stress testing. However, this would&#xD;
      double the expense of CMR scanning in the study and reduce the acceptability to potential&#xD;
      participants. The investigators are confident that performing both adenosine and dobutamine&#xD;
      stress in one CMR study will not have any material impact on image assessment, as there will&#xD;
      be 20 minutes between the two stress sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have invasive coronary angiography performed as to clinical standards to&#xD;
      assess for the presence of CAD, which will be performed within 4 weeks of CMR scanning.&#xD;
      Fractional flow reserve will be performed as clinically indicated and given that this may be&#xD;
      equally influenced by adenosine down-regulation is not mandated in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image analysis: All imaging will be analysed blinded to patient details. CMR analysis will be&#xD;
      undertaken by using dedicated software for research (cmr42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging,&#xD;
      Calgary, Canada). CMR studies will be divided into three series: i) cine and LGE images, ii)&#xD;
      cine, adenosine stress and rest perfusion and LGE images, and iii) cine, dobutamine stress&#xD;
      and rest and LGE images, and allocated a computer-generated random number identifier prior to&#xD;
      analysis. Each of the 16 segments of the left ventricle will be scored for function,&#xD;
      infarction, perfusion defects and contractile response as previously described. Qualitative&#xD;
      analysis will be performed by the consensus of two readers (the fellow and Dr Arnold) and in&#xD;
      cases of disagreement or uncertainty with a third observer (Prof McCann). Splenic switch-off&#xD;
      will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively with T1 mapping for evaluation of the&#xD;
      adequacy of vasodilator stress with adenosine. The random number key will not be accessible&#xD;
      to staff involved in the analysis until all analyses have been completed and the database has&#xD;
      been locked. Image analysis of series I, ii and iii will be performed separately, at least&#xD;
      two weeks' apart. Invasive angiography images will be anonymised and reported by a senior&#xD;
      clinician or the fellow (after appropriate training and under supervision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aetiology of heart failure: will be decided by a &quot;gold&quot; group consisting of an interventional&#xD;
      cardiologist, heart failure specialist and cardiac imager (Dr Adlam, Prof Squire and McCann,&#xD;
      respectively) who will be presented with all investigations, as per previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling: To reduce costs, the NIHR Leicester BRC staff have developed electronic&#xD;
      databases using the validated and open source REDCap system and CiviCRM for management of&#xD;
      recruitment of subjects into clinical studies, research, governance and monitoring. This&#xD;
      infrastructure will be available during this programme of study. All imaging data will be&#xD;
      entered into REDCap in a blinded fashion and will only be unblinded for statistical analysis&#xD;
      when the database is locked. This will ensure the integrity of the data and any changes may&#xD;
      be audited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data will be examined for normality and summarised. Non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be transformed to achieve normality prior to analysis. CMR image series&#xD;
      will be compared by paired t-tests, Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared tests as appropriate. The&#xD;
      sensitivities, specificities and accuracy of adenosine stress and dobutamine stress imaging&#xD;
      for identifying non-infarct related ischemia will be compared. The kappa statistic will be&#xD;
      used as a measure of agreement in diagnoses between series. Correlation coefficients will be&#xD;
      assessed for adenosine response v markers of LV dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations The power calculation has been performed with the assistance of Dr C&#xD;
      Nelson, Lecturer in Medical Statistics. From our pilot data, the sensitivity of adenosine for&#xD;
      detecting non-infarct related myocardial perfusion abnormalities as our baseline standard is&#xD;
      62%. The investigators estimate that the sensitivity of dobutamine for detecting perfusion&#xD;
      abnormalities is 82%, as shown by Mordi et al. in patients with left bundle branch block at a&#xD;
      maximum dobutamine dose of only 20μg/kg/min. Assuming the prevalence of CAD is 50% and&#xD;
      dobutamine has sensitivity 20% higher than adenosine (Delta=0.82-0.62), 86 patients are&#xD;
      required for 80% power at the 5% alpha level. To allow for technical issues with failure of&#xD;
      either of adenosine, dobutamine or LGE or for patients who may decide not to proceed with&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography, investigators will recruit 100 patients. If all 100 patients&#xD;
      completed the assessments investigators would have 80% power to detect an 18% increase in&#xD;
      sensitivity with dobutamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias and confounders The investigators will aim to recruit consecutive patients to avoid&#xD;
      selection bias. Ascertainment bias will be minimised by robust blinding of CMR scans as&#xD;
      outlined above. As the dobutamine and adenosine stress images will be acquired in the same&#xD;
      patients, there is no confounding in selection between the two perfusion arms. The&#xD;
      investigators are confident that the accuracy of the dobutamine perfusion will not be&#xD;
      compromised by prior administration of contrast for adenosine perfusion due the relatively&#xD;
      small dose used (0.05mmol/kg at 3T) and with the long time interval (~20mins) between&#xD;
      contrast injections, allowing clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline The investigators perform over 1000 clinical stress examinations and over 1200&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiograms annually, many in patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to recruit a minimum of one patient per week and the study will be&#xD;
      completed in under two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected value of results This study will be the first to compare the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of adenosine versus dobutamine stress CMR for the detection of CAD in patients with HFrEF. If&#xD;
      the results confirm that adenosine has poor sensitivity for the detection of CAD and that&#xD;
      dobutamine is superior then the study will challenge the current paradigm of combined&#xD;
      adenosine perfusion and CMR viability assessment. However before clinical practice is changed&#xD;
      the investigators would plan to conduct a multicentre trial through BSCMR research group,&#xD;
      which has a strong track record in multicentre clinical trials.&#xD;
