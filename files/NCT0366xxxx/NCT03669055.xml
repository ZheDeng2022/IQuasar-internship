  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection (AD) is a serious pathology affecting one person for 300 000 habitants per&#xD;
      year. In case of complicated AD on the descending aorta, it is necessary to perform an&#xD;
      endovascular surgery in association with medical treatment. An endoprosthesis is implanted on&#xD;
      the descending thoracic aorta in order to close the main intimal tear. This closure lead to&#xD;
      an increase in the thoracic true lumen diameter, a decrease in the thoracic false lumen&#xD;
      diameter, a better perfusion of the aortic branches. Furthermore, even in case of open&#xD;
      surgical treatment of the ascending aorta it can be necessary to perform an endovascular&#xD;
      treatment on the descending aorta, either to prevent and treat aneurysmal evolution or to&#xD;
      treat patent malperfusion syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT and Magnetic Resonance angiography, by the realization of an aortic morphologic&#xD;
      evaluation, are the two key imaging exams in the DA. Nevertheless, CT can't provide aortic&#xD;
      dynamic evaluation, contrary to MRI. This exam, thanks to the phase-contrast sequence can&#xD;
      measure velocity and flow data in vessels, including aorta but also true and false lumen in&#xD;
      the AD. Thus, by verifying the perfusion of the aortic true lumen and the aortic branches it&#xD;
      is possible to perform an early evaluation of the endovascular treatment of the DA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, only one study has realized an aortic dynamic evaluation on the AD, unfortunately&#xD;
      this study was limited to non-operated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the place of MRI in the AD, the ingestigation propose to determine if&#xD;
      phase-contrast MRI is able to evaluate the impact of the endovascular treatment on the&#xD;
      hemodynamic state of the aorta and its branches.&#xD;
