    <textblock>
      NiSAR is a Ph.D. study and consists of three substudies. Renal cancer is one of the most&#xD;
      deadly urologic malignancies and accounts for 900 new cases and 300 deaths per year. An&#xD;
      increase in the use of imaging diagnostics has yielded a rise in the incidental detection of&#xD;
      small renal masses (SRM), meaning tumors &lt;4cm (T1a). Kidney biopsies are the gold standard&#xD;
      for diagnosing SRM but has an inherent risk of infections, retroperitoneal bleeding and in&#xD;
      rare cases loss of kidney function. This is problematic since up to 30% of SRM are benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Ph.D. consists of three studies that all aim to develop new minimally invasive&#xD;
      modalities for diagnosing SRM. Patients eligible for these studies are diagnosed with SRM at&#xD;
      one of the departments of Urology in the southern region of Denmark. Studies 1 and 2 aims to&#xD;
      find circulating biomarkers, in the form of DNA and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)&#xD;
      contained in micro vesicles secreted into blood by renal cell cancers and find changes in&#xD;
      biomarkers levels after surgery. Study 3 aim to determine the potential of multiplanar MRI&#xD;
      (mpMRI) to discriminate between benign and malign SRM. Potentially this can lead to a&#xD;
      fundamental change of the way urologists diagnose and monitor SRM and renal cell cancer in&#xD;
      general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also build a research biobank for future research.&#xD;

      Study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of biomarkers in blood and urine and to set the basis for a minimally invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic program for SRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will be collected in ethylendiamin-tetraacetate (EDTA) containing tubes.&#xD;
      two samples are then centrifugated at 2000 G for 10 minutes to isolate plasma, which then are&#xD;
      stored at -80oC. The remaining 2 samples are stored at -80oC as is. Total nucleic acid (TNA)&#xD;
      will be extracted from concentrated urine and plasma samples as previously described using a&#xD;
      NucliSENS easy MAG instrument. Extracted TNA will then be used for targeted immune- and&#xD;
      oncologic profiling (mutations and expression) using next generation sequencing (NGS)-based&#xD;
      RNA and DNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional core sample from kidney tumor will be stored without preservatives for&#xD;
      NGS-based DNA and RNA-seq analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of changes in circulating biomarkers after curative treatment in patients with&#xD;
      biopsy verified renal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in study 2 in the same manner as study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the first four samples four additional blood samples (20 ml) will be taken 1&#xD;
      month and 6 months after curative treatment from each patient. All samples will be coded and&#xD;
      given an ID according to patient´s CPR number using the RedCap informatic coding system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage, preparation and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be handled in the same manner as in study 1. Statistical&#xD;
      Analysis for study 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analysis of the data will be performed on molecular expression levels of specific&#xD;
      sequences identified, an unsupervised hierarchical clustering will be fit and heat maps will&#xD;
      be produced. Properties of clustered elements will be further matched with histopathological&#xD;
      results to search for histological aggregation patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expression levels of the sequences identified, in blood and urine will be compared by means&#xD;
      of Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Changes in levels of expression from pre-operative&#xD;
      to post-operative will be evaluated with Friedman´s ANOVA and subsequent post-hoc pairwise&#xD;
      comparison with Wilcoxon's signed rank test with Bonferroni correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis will be further performed on pre-operative&#xD;
      samples, to test for validity of the assays for each marker to discriminate between benignant&#xD;
      histology and malignancy, with a cut-off for area under curve (AUC) of 0.75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The minimal sample size required for achieving a statistical power of 80% with a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 and an expected dropout rate of 15% will be 155 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations for sample size have been computed with the GPower software (Düsseldorf, DE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the diagnostic value of mpMRI in determining malignancy in SRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing a written consent a mpMRI will be scheduled at the same day but prior to the&#xD;
      primary biopsy. All mpMRIs will be performed locally and the pictures transferred to Odense&#xD;
      University Hospital where a specialist radiologist, will examine the scans in a blinded&#xD;
      fashion, meaning that he will be ignorant to the pathologist´s diagnosis. The result will be&#xD;
      stored in a coded RedCAP database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MpMRIs are performed according to a standard protocol and include the following sequences: T1&#xD;
      (with reduced affinity for fatty tissue) +/- contrast, diffusion weighted sequences and wash&#xD;
      in/wash out.&#xD;
