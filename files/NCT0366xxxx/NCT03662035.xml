  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of apatinib combined with S-1&#xD;
      on advanced pancreatic cancer patients after failure of first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;

      1. To observe the curative efficacy of apatinib and S-1 on patients by analyzing the data&#xD;
           of overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), the rate of&#xD;
           progression free survival (PFS), levels of CA19-9 and VEGFR in serum [Time Frame:&#xD;
           Evaluation at 2 month intervals through study completion from the date of study entry&#xD;
           until the date of progression, up to 1 year].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To observe any adverse events, including abnormal clinical symptoms and vital signs,&#xD;
           abnormal laboratory examinations, and to record the clinical features, severity,&#xD;
           occurrence time, duration, management and prognosis of all subjects during the clinical&#xD;
           study, and to determine the correlation between these adverse events and the&#xD;
           experimental drugs. . The safety of drugs used in advanced pancreatic cancer was&#xD;
           evaluated by CTCAE v4.0&#xD;
