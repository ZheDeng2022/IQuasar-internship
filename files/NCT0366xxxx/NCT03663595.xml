    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is characterized by diffuse pain around the knee joint.&#xD;
      This presence of pain is the most common manifestation in sports medicine among adults and&#xD;
      young people. Women are more likely to develop PFPS. Among the young adult population, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 13% of the women are affected by PFPS. There is a consensus among clinicians&#xD;
      that PFPS etiology is multifactorial, including local factors (structures present or acting&#xD;
      directly on the patellofemoral joint) and nonlocal factors [extrinsic to the patellofemoral&#xD;
      joint, including proximal factors (hip, trunk and pelvis), and distal factors (ankle and&#xD;
      foot)]. PFPS is not a degenerative syndrome, and conservative treatment offers good results.&#xD;
      However, the most appropriate therapeutic approach is still unclear, and the rate of&#xD;
      nonresponders to treatment is high. One of the possible explanations for failure of the&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention is that the triggering mechanisms of PFPS are not the same for all&#xD;
      subjects, and probably some patients cannot be reached by standard treatment. The traditional&#xD;
      intervention model focuses on the strengthening of the knee extensor muscles, but recent&#xD;
      literature has pointed out that multi-articular treatment models (i.e., exercises for the&#xD;
      proximal or distal factors, in addition to exercises for the quadriceps) have shown better&#xD;
      results. It is believed that the elaboration of treatment protocols based on the PFPS&#xD;
      etiological factors, combining local and non-local factors, present greater responsiveness&#xD;
      and results retention, thus reducing treatment failure. Based on this, and due to the lack of&#xD;
      experimental studies that aimed to compare the effects of a multi-articular intervention&#xD;
      protocol on specific subgroups in women affected by PFPS, this study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of two multi-articular intervention protocols based on exercises (1) for the proximal&#xD;
      and local factors versus (2) for the distal and local factors on the clinical, functional and&#xD;
      neuromechanical outcomes of young women with PFPS. Participants of the PFPS group will be&#xD;
      submitted to one of two intervention models for an 12-week rehabilitation program. Model 1&#xD;
      will be composed of exercises focusing on local and proximal PFPS factors, and Model 2 will&#xD;
      be composed of exercises focused on the local and distal factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be divided into 2 groups (control group: n=15 and PFPS group, n=60).&#xD;
      Participants of the PFPS group will be classified according to their PFPS etiological&#xD;
      factors, and as a function of changes at proximal or distal factors. Participants' inclusion&#xD;
      in the study will be done based on their anamnesis, clinical tests, functional tests and&#xD;
      strength measures. Participants will be recruited primarily at the School of Physical&#xD;
      Education, Physical Therapy and Dance of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).&#xD;
      The PFPS group will be submitted to one of two intervention models based on physical&#xD;
      exercises, with an 12-week duration, and 2 sessions per week. Model 1 will be composed of&#xD;
      exercises focusing on local and proximal factors, and Model 2 will be composed of exercises&#xD;
      focused on the PFPS local and distal factors. Only the PFPS group will receive the&#xD;
      intervention program, and every intervention model will have 2 participants' groups (group&#xD;
      with proximal factors and group with local factors). The allocation of each participant's&#xD;
      intervention model will be randomized. All participants will be submitted to the following&#xD;
      evaluations: (1) anthropometric measurements (mass, height and thigh length), (2) clinical&#xD;
      tests (Compression Test and Kujala Questionnaire), (3) single leg squat (kinematic analysis),&#xD;
      (4) muscle mechanical properties of the knee extensors, external hip rotators, hip extensors,&#xD;
      hip abductors, ankle plantar and dorsal flexors, foot pronators and supinators [evaluated&#xD;
      with a manual (Microfet 2) or isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3 Pro)], (5) myoelectric&#xD;
      properties [evaluated by electromyography (Delsys system)], (6) drop landing test (kinematic&#xD;
      analysis), (7) patellofemoral cartilage thickness (evaluated by ultrasonography), and (8)&#xD;
      muscle architecture of the knee extensors, external hip rotators, hip extensors, hip&#xD;
      abductors, ankle plantar and dorsal flexors, and foot pronators and supinators (evaluated by&#xD;
      ultrasonography&#xD;
