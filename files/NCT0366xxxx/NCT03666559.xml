  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioma are the most commun frequent brain tumour. Mutation of Isocitrate DeHydrogenase IDH1&#xD;
      or IDH2 genes affect 40% of gliomas, mostly grade II and III gliomas. Despite IDH mutated&#xD;
      gliomas (IDHm glioma) have a better prognosis compared to the IDH wild type counterparts,&#xD;
      they invariably recur after standard treatment with radiotherapy and alkylating agent. IDH&#xD;
      mutation results in the accumulation of D-2 hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) produced by the IDH&#xD;
      mutant enzyme. D2HG acts as a competitive inhibitor of the alphaketoglutarate cofactor in a&#xD;
      wide range of cellular reactions, including Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes and&#xD;
      histone demethylases, resulting in DNA hypermethylation (CIMP phenotype) and histone&#xD;
      hypermethylation. Preclinical data have shown a dramatic anti-tumor effect of hypomethylating&#xD;
      drugs as 5-azacytidine on IDH1 mutated human gliomas. These hypomethylating drugs are&#xD;
      routinely used in myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS) and are well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AGIR Trial will be a phase II, non-comparative, open label, non randomised monocentric&#xD;
      trial evaluating efficacy of a treatment by azacitidine in recurrent IDHm gliomas. The main&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of azacitidine according to the RANO criteria on&#xD;
      progression-free survival at 6 months, evaluated according to the RANO criteria. Given the&#xD;
      slow mode of action of treatment, it is proposed to include only patients whose life&#xD;
      expectancy at inclusion is greater than 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6-month progression-free survival of less than 15% will be inefficient. The minimum&#xD;
      efficiency must be at least 30%. An interim analysis (according to Fleming's method) will be&#xD;
      performed when 19 patients have been included and followed up to 6 months. If the interim&#xD;
      analysis is inconclusive, 36 additional patients will be included. The maximum number of&#xD;
      analysable patients to include is 55.&#xD;

      Scientific justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gliomas are the most frequent brain tumors. Prognosis is poor. It depends on the histological&#xD;
      grade (I to IV), and on the molecular profile, and particularly on the presence of IDH&#xD;
      (Isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutation which is associated with a better prognosis. Mutations of&#xD;
      IDH1R132, less frequently IDH2R172 affect 40% of gliomas, mostly grade II and grade III. IDH&#xD;
      mutation results in the accumulation of D-2 hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) produced by the IDH1&#xD;
      mutant enzyme. D2HG acts as a competitive inhibitor of the alphaketoglutarate cofactor in a&#xD;
      wide range of cellular reactions, including TET family enzymes and histone demethylases,&#xD;
      resulting in DNA hypermethylation (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype, CIMP) and histone&#xD;
      hypermethylation. IDH mutation is probably the earliest genetic alteration in the&#xD;
      tumorigenesis of gliomas, and is also the most stable, as shown in a whole exome analysis of&#xD;
      initial and recurring low grade gliomas. It is therefore an attractive target. In an attempt&#xD;
      to reverse the CIMP status, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed a dramatic anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect of hypomethylating drugs (5-azacytidine and 5-deoxyazacytidine) on IDH1 mutated human&#xD;
      gliomas . These hypomethylating drugs are routinely used in myelodysplasic syndrome and are&#xD;
      well tolerated. Despite glioma with IDH1/2 mutation have a better outcome compared to the IDH&#xD;
      wild-type counterpart, the prognosis remains grim with no therapeutic perspective after&#xD;
      radiotherapy, temozolomide and/or nitrosourea treatment. Another reason to administer the&#xD;
      hypomethylating drug after failure of alkylating chemotherapy is based on the assumption that&#xD;
      demethylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter could compromise the&#xD;
      efficacy of future alkylating treatment. Based on preclinical data obtained in animal models&#xD;
      and clinical data of patients with MDS, we will treat with demethylating drug (Azacitidine,&#xD;
      Vidaza®) patients with recurrent IDH mutated gliomas (as authentificated by IDHR132H&#xD;
      Immunochemistry or direct sequencing). Preclinical data on experimental gliomas and clinical&#xD;
      data on MDS, has shown that efficacy is delayed by three or more cycles. This has important&#xD;
      consequences in the selection of the population, and the follow-up of the treatment. We will&#xD;
      exclude patients with important mass effect and intracranial hypertension, and more generally&#xD;
      patients whose life expectancy is inferior to 9 months. Despite such treatment has never been&#xD;
      evaluated in IDH mutated glioma patients, the biological and preclinical backgrounds are&#xD;
      extremely strong and the drug is well tolerated and widely used in the field of haematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by multiple mechanisms including&#xD;
      cytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA.&#xD;
      The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including&#xD;
      inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, incorporation into RNA and DNA, and activation&#xD;
      of DNA damage pathways. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine.&#xD;
      Incorporation of azacytidine into DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases,&#xD;
      leading to hypomethylation of DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA hypomethylation of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle regulation,&#xD;
      differentiation and death pathways may result in gene re-expression and restoration of cancer&#xD;
      suppressing functions to cancer cells. The relative importance of DNA hypomethylation versus&#xD;
      cytotoxicity or other activities of azacitidine to clinical outcomes has not been&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine is small molecule. Pharmacokinetic data suggest a good penetration in the Central&#xD;
      Nervous System (CNS). 5-aza-dCyd, active metabolite of azacitidine, can cross the&#xD;
      blood-Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF) barrier effectively, producing cytotoxic concentrations in&#xD;
      the CSF when given by i.v. infusion in animal models .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In IDH mutated tumors, it is believed that the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by&#xD;
      aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands plays an important role in the development of&#xD;
      malignancy. DNA methylation usually occurs at the 5-position of the cytosine ring within&#xD;
      cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide by a transfer of the methyl group from&#xD;
      S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Azacitidine reactivates many tumor suppressor genes that are&#xD;
      aberrantly silenced in hypermethylated tumors, including Rb, p53, CDKN2A, and mismatch repair&#xD;
      genes which are involved in alkylating resistance. It may also reactivate MGMT, which makes&#xD;
      the cell more sensitive to alkylating drugs: this may be a deleterious effect. This is one&#xD;
      more reason to reserve this treatment to patients previously treated with alkylating drugs&#xD;
      which developed secondary resistance: one of the mechanisms of resistance is the inactivation&#xD;
      of mismatch repair genes which occurs after alkylating treatment and is a mechanism of&#xD;
      secondary resistance in MGMT promoter methylated gliomas. Re-expressing these genes may&#xD;
      render the tumor more sensitive to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description and justification of the dosage, route of administration, administration schedule&#xD;
      and treatment duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vidaza® is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients who are&#xD;
      not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with: intermediate-2 and&#xD;
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring&#xD;
      System (IPSS),, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without&#xD;
      myeloproliferative disorder, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and&#xD;
      multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification, AML&#xD;
      with &gt;30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these approved indications, the recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle,&#xD;
      for all patients regardless of baseline haematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m2 of body&#xD;
      surface area, injected subcutaneously, daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days&#xD;
      (28-day treatment cycle) every 4 weeks until progression, intolerance or end of the study. It&#xD;
      is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 6 cycles. In absence of study in&#xD;
      neuro-oncology, it was decided to use same dosage and schedule as in haematological&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of the known and foreseeable benefits and risks for the study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this population, there is currently no available treatment, shown to have any efficacy.&#xD;
      Despite there is no data on efficacy of azacitidine in this population there is a strong&#xD;
      biological and preclinical background. Furthermore the tolerance is well known since the drug&#xD;
      is widely used in hematology. The toxicity is mostly haematologic and renal and easily&#xD;
      manageable. However there are two caveats:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since the response is delayed, we expect no effect before 3 cycles. Moreover&#xD;
           neurological worsening must be expected and anticipated and treated if necessary by&#xD;
           introducing or increasing steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demethylation modifies gene expression and reactivates tumor suppressor genes; however&#xD;
           we cannot not exclude a deleterious effect (ie reactivation of deleterious genes). This&#xD;
           is a theoretical risk though it has not been reported in the MDS and AML treated with&#xD;
           azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy based on RANO criteria,&#xD;
      of azacitidine in patients with recurrent IDH1/2 mutated glioma after conventional&#xD;
      treatments. The primary assessment criterion will be Progression-Free Survival at 6 months&#xD;
      (PFS-6) (24 weeks) estimated by the RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary objectives will be 1/ to evaluate the clinical efficacy: objective response&#xD;
      rate after 6 cycles of treatment evaluated by RANO criteria and overall survival, 2/ to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of azacitidine by description and graduation of adverse&#xD;
      events according to the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE&#xD;
      V4.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AGIR Trial will be a phase II, non-comparative, open label, non randomised monocentric&#xD;
      trial evaluating efficacy of a treatment by azacitidine in recurrent IDH1/2 mutant gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Fleming two-stage design is used to assess the efficacy of Azacitidine on the 6-months&#xD;
      progression free survival. Minimal efficacy (p0) and expected efficacy (p1) are respectively&#xD;
      fixed to 15% and 30%. With a type I error rate of 5%, and an 80% power, 19 patients are&#xD;
      required for the first step, and 36 additional patients for the second step if no conclusion&#xD;
      has been reached at intermediate analysis. In this configuration we plan to enroll 63&#xD;
      patients in order to have 55 patients who will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment.&#xD;
