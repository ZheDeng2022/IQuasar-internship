    <textblock>
      Monocentric randomized phase I/II trial, including 24 patients diagnosed with relapsing&#xD;
      glioblastoma (GBM) irrespective of MGMT and IDH gene status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following diagnosis of relapsing glioblastoma by either brain CT scan or MRI, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized in 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm 1: IMA950 mixed with Poly-ICLC administered subcutaneously&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm 2: Pembrolizumab 200mg q3w IV and IMA950 mixed with Poly-ICLC administered&#xD;
           subcutaneously&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of treatment will last 6 weeks, then surgery will be performed (done if&#xD;
      clinically possible ad indicated). In case of available brain tissue, extensive analysis of&#xD;
      the tumor immune response will be performed. Assessment of systemic immune response by PBMC&#xD;
      immunomonitoring will be systematically done before and after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors are the first cause of cancer mortality in children and the 3rd cause in young&#xD;
      adults. The most frequent brain tumors are gliomas and among them the most common type is&#xD;
      astrocytoma. The most malignant astrocytoma is Glioblastoma (GBM). Standard therapy of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM patients includes surgery, irradiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy with&#xD;
      1-year and 5-year survival rates at 30% and 3%, respectively. For the treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      GBM, TMZ is widely used even if the optimal dosing schedule and the minimal time interval&#xD;
      from first line are unknown. Other appropriate therapeutic options include Lomustine, an&#xD;
      alkylating drug, and Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic agent targeting VEGF-A, approved only in&#xD;
      selected countries (i.e. North America, Switzerland). Controlled trials are rare for&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma, consequently therapeutic decisions are mostly based on low-level&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amongst innovative strategies, immunotherapy is considered as one of the most promising.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy stimulates the natural properties of the immune system to protect against&#xD;
      cancer growth. Therapeutic vaccines (active immunotherapy) are expected to elicit a cytotoxic&#xD;
      immune response to tumor-associated antigens, destroying malignant cells without harming&#xD;
      normal cells. The cells involved in this response are T lymphocytes, which can sense abnormal&#xD;
      peptides at the tumor cells surface. One critical step towards the development of therapeutic&#xD;
      vaccines was the identification and validation of glioma antigens. This is an obstacle the&#xD;
      investigators have circumvented with the characterization of several immunogenic glioma&#xD;
      peptides by screening the peptidome of ex vivo human glioma samples. This led to the&#xD;
      development of a multipeptide vaccine called IMA950.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMA950 is composed of 9 synthetic tumor-associated HLA-A2-restricted peptides (TUMAPs), two&#xD;
      MHC class II-binding peptides and one HLA-A2-restricted HBV-derived peptide, the latter used&#xD;
      as marker of vaccine immunogenicity. The HLA-A2 allele is expressed by approximately 45% of&#xD;
      the Swiss population. As the interactions between peptides and their corresponding HLA&#xD;
      molecule are highly specific, only HLA-A*02 positive patients will be included in this trial.&#xD;
      The reasons why this set of peptides is very promising for vaccination are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tumor peptides have been isolated from ex vivo samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They are over-expressed in glioma (compared to normal tissues)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They are derived from proteins involved in the malignant process&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. They are immunogenic in vitro in healthy donors and in glioma patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. This is a MULTI-peptide vaccine IMA950 was investigated in a monocentric phase I/II&#xD;
           trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and WHO grade III gliomas using poly-ICLC as&#xD;
           adjuvant (PI: P-Y. Dietrich, NCT01920191, study completed, final results in preparation&#xD;
           for publication). A total of 19 patients (16 with GBM and 3 with anaplastic astrocytoma)&#xD;
           were included, with a median number of 9 injections received per patient (range: 4-11).&#xD;
           The multipeptide vaccine did not show any serious safety issues, apart from some mild&#xD;
           inflammatory reactions at the injection site, peritumoral or resection cavity&#xD;
           edema/tumor flare manageable with steroids, as well as peri-vaccinational transient mild&#xD;
           headache, fatigue and flu-like syndrome (grade 3 events: 42.1%, grade 4 events: 21%, no&#xD;
           grade 5 events). Regarding vaccine immunogenicity, CD4 T-cell responses were detected in&#xD;
           the majority of patients (58%) and were usually sustained. The CD8 T-cell responses were&#xD;
           detected in 63% of patients, with 37% of them being multi-TUMAP responders. Median&#xD;
           overall survival from date of surgery was 21 months (range: 10 - 41 months) for the&#xD;
           overall cohort, with a 19 months survival for the GBM-only cohort (range: 10-41 months),&#xD;
           which compares favorably with the reported median survival of 15 months with the&#xD;
           reference treatment of temozolomide-based chemoradiation. PFS was 93% and 56% at 6 and 9&#xD;
           months respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the T cell ability to detect tumor peptides that are naturally presented by tumor&#xD;
      cells, these T cells do not normally become activated and do not protect the body against the&#xD;
      cancer, as tumor cells on their own are only poorly immunogenic. For effective T cell&#xD;
      activation, the help of co-stimulatory molecules, which are expressed on activated&#xD;
      professional APCs, e.g. dendritic cells, is required. During infections, the activation of&#xD;
      APCs is triggered by molecular patterns common to all pathogens of a class (e.g. RNA&#xD;
      viruses). These patterns, also referred to as &quot;danger signals&quot;, are not provided by peptides&#xD;
      themselves. Consequently, artificial danger signals have to be provided with a tumor vaccine&#xD;
      to induce the required co-stimulation on APCs. In combination with a vaccine, such substances&#xD;
      with a non-specific immunostimulatory effect are called adjuvants. Poly-ICLC, (Hiltonol®,&#xD;
      Oncovir) is a synthetic double-stranded ribo-nucleic acid (dsRNA) mimicking viral pathogen&#xD;
      associated molecular patterns (PAMP) that activates multiple elements of innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic cells has&#xD;
      been known for decades. The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by&#xD;
      tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface&#xD;
      of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-regulate unwanted or excessive&#xD;
      immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. Binding of PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2)&#xD;
      to the PD-1 receptor inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab (Keytruda™) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (mAb) designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. Impressive&#xD;
      response rate and prolonged survival were first observed for metastatic melanoma, but the&#xD;
      clinical benefit of this mAb was recently shown to extend to several other cancer types.&#xD;
      There is a strong rationale to investigate the role of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in malignant&#xD;
      glioma, since (i) we and others have previously reported that PD-L1 expression by glioma&#xD;
      cells may contribute to tumor-related immunoresistance; (ii) PD-L1 is also expressed by&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating macrophages and circulating monocytes; (iii) expression of PD-L1 on&#xD;
      circulating monocytes was shown to correlate with worsened survival in patients who received&#xD;
      the HSPPC-96 vaccine for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM. The 200 mg Q3W dose will maintain&#xD;
      individual patient exposures within the exposure range demonstrated to be well tolerated,&#xD;
      safe and established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response. A fixed dose&#xD;
      regimen simplifies the dosing regimen so as to be more convenient for physicians and to&#xD;
      reduce the potential for dosing errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of pembrolizumab with a vaccine therapy is currently being tested in several&#xD;
      trials for different tumors, such as melanoma, bladder, colorectal and prostate cancer&#xD;
      (NCT02574533, NCT02054520, NCT02432963, NCT02499835, NCT02515227). Here the investigators&#xD;
      postulate that Pembrolizumab may improve the immunogenicity of the IMA950 vaccine and the&#xD;
      function of vaccine-induced glioma-specific T cells, and that the multipeptide vaccine may&#xD;
      help to focus the immune response against antigens overexpressed by glioma, leading together&#xD;
      to an optimization of the antitumor immune effect whilst reducing the risk of collateral&#xD;
      damage to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to answer questions regarding safety (for the future clinical development of&#xD;
      this strategy), immunogenicity (synergy between multipeptide vaccine and pembrolizumab) and&#xD;
      clinical outcome. Ancillary translational research should help to identify possible&#xD;
      correlation between neo-epitopes, methylation status, immune response and clinical outcome.&#xD;
