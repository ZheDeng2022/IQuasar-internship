  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a rare disease defined as a congenital absence of enteric&#xD;
      ganglia, resulting usually in neonatal bowel obstruction. The current treatment is the&#xD;
      operative removal of the aganglionic bowel and anastomosis to the ganglionic zone considered&#xD;
      as 'healthy'. However, postoperative course remains unpredictable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional intestinal disorders are present in up to 45% of patients and can occur in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period or few weeks/years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there are neither predictive factors of postoperative digestive complications nor&#xD;
      established treatment for postoperative dysmotility in HD. Abnormalities in enteric nervous&#xD;
      system (ENS) phenotype and functions in the 'healthy' ganglionic segment are increasingly&#xD;
      suspected to be directly responsible for postoperative intestinal dysfunctions in HD.&#xD;
      Therefore, approaches aimed at restoring the nitrergic phenotype could be of major&#xD;
      therapeutical interest. Among targets regulating the nitrergic phenotype of ENS are the&#xD;
      microbiota and/or derived metabolites. Indeed preclinical animal models deficient in&#xD;
      bacterial sensing molecules have a loss of nitrergic neurons and reduced colonic transit.&#xD;
      Conversely, microbiota transfer to newborn germ-free mice restored colonic transit time.&#xD;
      Alternatively the investigators has shown that bacterial metabolites such as short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acids, in particular butyrate, can increase nitrergic phenotype and enhance colonic&#xD;
      motility in a gut immaturity animal model. Therefore the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      preoperative butyrate enema will reduce postoperative intestinal complications at short-term&#xD;
      and medium/long-term.&#xD;

      Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a rare disease (1/5000) defined as a congenital absence of&#xD;
      enteric ganglia, secondary to developmental defects in colonization of the gut by the enteric&#xD;
      nervous system (ENS) and in its maturation, resulting usually in neonatal bowel obstruction.&#xD;
      The current treatment is the operative removal of the aganglionic bowel and anastomosis to&#xD;
      the ganglionic zone considered as 'healthy'. However, postoperative course remains&#xD;
      unpredictable. Functional intestinal disorders, mainly functional obstructive symptoms, are&#xD;
      present in up to 45% of patients and can occur in the immediate postoperative period or few&#xD;
      weeks/years later. Postoperative enterocolitis also occurs in up to 25% of patients following&#xD;
      a similar time course. Until now, there are neither predictive factors of postoperative&#xD;
      digestive complications nor established treatment for postoperative dysmotility in HD, in&#xD;
      part due to a lack of understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms involved.&#xD;
      Abnormalities in ENS phenotype and functions in the 'healthy' ganglionic segment are&#xD;
      increasingly suspected to be directly responsible for postoperative intestinal dysfunctions&#xD;
      in HD. In an ongoing multicentre study (Ente-Hirsch project), he investigators have&#xD;
      identified a reduced density of nitrergic enteric neurons associated with a reduced&#xD;
      neuromuscular transmission that could account for digestive dysfunctions in HD. Therefore,&#xD;
      approaches aimed at restoring the nitrergic phenotype could be of major therapeutical&#xD;
      interest. Among targets regulating the nitrergic phenotype of ENS are the microbiota and/or&#xD;
      derived metabolites. Indeed preclinical animal models deficient in bacterial sensing&#xD;
      molecules have a loss of nitrergic neurons and reduced colonic transit. Conversely,&#xD;
      microbiota transfer to newborn germ-free mice restored colonic transit time. Alternatively he&#xD;
      investigators has shown that bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, in&#xD;
      particular butyrate, can increase nitrergic phenotype and enhance colonic motility in a gut&#xD;
      immaturity animal model. Therefore the investigators hypothesize preoperative butyrate enema&#xD;
      will reduce postoperative intestinal complications at short-term and medium/long-term.&#xD;
