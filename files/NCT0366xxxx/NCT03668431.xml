      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer characterized by BRAF V600E mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dabrafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trametinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDR001&#xD;

      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the&#xD;
           drug combination works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
           drug combination is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PDR001 as a&#xD;
                treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The FDA has not approved dabrafenib and trametinib for your specific disease but it&#xD;
                has been approved for other uses, whether alone as single agents, or given together&#xD;
                as in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer characterized by BRAF V600E mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All humans have a gene called BRAF which is responsible for sending signals to&#xD;
                proteins called B-Raf inside of cells that help them grow. In some metastatic&#xD;
                colorectal patients, this gene mutates and causes cancer cells to grow in&#xD;
                uncontrolled ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
                --- Dabrafenib is a drug that is thought to inhibit the mutant BRAF activity, which&#xD;
                may serve to slow or stop cell growth of metastatic colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a pathway that helps to activate the&#xD;
                BRAF mutated genes. The MAPK pathway is commonly found to be overactivated in BRAF&#xD;
                mutated tumor cells. MEK (which refers to MAPK/ERK Kinase) enzymes are essential to&#xD;
                the activity of the MAPK pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Trametinib inhibits the MEK enzymes in order to shut down the MAPK pathway,&#xD;
                     thus blocking the pathway that helps the cancer cells grow uncontrollably.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  PDR001 is a drug which binds to PD1 on immune cells and is believed to block&#xD;
                     binding of PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-L1/PDL1 and PD-L2/PDL2 are often used by cancer&#xD;
                     cells and to escape the power of the body's immune system so that they cannot&#xD;
                     be fought. By blocking that binding of the molecules, the body's immune system&#xD;
                     may reach and fight the cancer cells. Researchers are hoping that&#xD;
                     administration of all three of these drugs may help anti-cancer activities&#xD;
                     work together to slow or stop the cancer growth and may help your own immune&#xD;
                     system damage or destroy the existing cancer cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of trametinib, dabrafenib and PDR001 on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason and because these agents may be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must avoid consumption of grapefruit, Seville oranges or products containing&#xD;
             the juice of each during the entire study and preferably 7 days before the first dose&#xD;
             of study medications, due to potential CYP3A4 interaction with the study medications.&#xD;
             Orange juice is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to of trametinib, dabrafenib or PDR001.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible but once on treatment must be used with caution.&#xD;
             Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because trametinib, dabrafenib or PDR001&#xD;
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with trametinib, dabrafenib or PDR001 breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with trametinib, dabrafenib or PDR001.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with trametinib, dabrafenib or&#xD;
             PDR001. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;

             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or&#xD;
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted&#xD;
             to enroll).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic chronic steroid therapy (≥ 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or any&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy 7 days prior to planned date for first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. Topical, inhaled, nasal and ophthalmic steroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of organ transplant requiring use of immunosuppressive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current use of a prohibited medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant disease, other than that being treated in this study. Exceptions to this&#xD;
             exclusion include the following: malignancies that were treated curatively and have&#xD;
             not recurred within 2 years prior to study treatment; completely resected basal cell&#xD;
             and squamous cell skin cancers and any completely resected carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy within 2 weeks prior to start&#xD;
             of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Subjects with antecedent of Hepatitis B (anti-HBc positive, HbsAg and HBV-DNA&#xD;
             negative) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with positive test for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) Note: Subjects&#xD;
             in whom HCV infection resolved spontaneously (positive HCV antibodies without&#xD;
             detectable HCV-RNA) or those that achieved a sustained virological response after&#xD;
             antiviral treatment and show absence of detectable HCV RNA ≥ 6 months (with the use of&#xD;
             IFN-free regimes) or ≥ 12 months (with the use of IFN-based regimes) after cessation&#xD;
             of antiviral treatment are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, prevent the&#xD;
             subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns, compliance with&#xD;
             clinical study procedures or interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
