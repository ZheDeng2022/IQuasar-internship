  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor, WT) is the most common renal tumor of childhood representing ±&#xD;
      6% of all childhood malignancies. The diagnosis is established on clinical and radiological&#xD;
      grounds. Metastases are visible on conventional imaging in at least 12% of nephroblastoma&#xD;
      patients; however, an additional ~15% of patients have nodules on CT-scan only. The treatment&#xD;
      consists of neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, nephrectomy and risk-based adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy ± radiation therapy (RT) to the flank and/or metastases. For truly localized&#xD;
      tumors, overall survival is &gt; 85% (high risk histology excluded). Several high risk&#xD;
      biological characteristics have been identified: diffuse anaplasia, gain of 1q chromosome,&#xD;
      loss of heterozygosity 1p + 16q, blastemal residual volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For metastatic nephroblastoma, the standard neo-adjuvant chemotherapy includes 3 drugs:&#xD;
      vincristine, actinomycin-D and doxorubicin (VAD). Long-term survival is 82% (1). However, two&#xD;
      issues arise. First, the use of doxorubicin ± concomitant RT might be associated with cardiac&#xD;
      and pulmonary sequelae (4-17% of congestive heart failure) (2), and actinomycin-D is&#xD;
      associated with hepatic toxicity (3). Second, patients with &quot;CT-only&quot; nodules are treated&#xD;
      according to &quot;localized disease&quot;. However, their outcome is poorer than that of truly&#xD;
      &quot;localized disease&quot; (4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of carboplatin and etoposide is known for a long time; these drugs are used as&#xD;
      second line treatment or for high-risk histology nephroblastoma. Therefore, an alternate&#xD;
      chemotherapy has been designed that combines drugs shown as highly efficacious in&#xD;
      nephroblastoma, i.e., Vincristine, Carboplatin and Etoposide (VCE). VCE has been used for the&#xD;
      treatment of other pediatric malignancies. For metastatic nephroblastoma, the switch from VAD&#xD;
      to VCE and the associated reduction of actinomycin-D and doxorubicin is expected to reduce&#xD;
      the chemotherapy-related long-term toxicity. In addition, VCE could potentially decrease the&#xD;
      rate of patients requiring pulmonary RT. Finally VCE may have a beneficial effect on tumor&#xD;
      high risk biological characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      French patients with nephroblastoma have been treated for &gt; 40 years according to SIOP&#xD;
      protocols collaborating in the SIOP Renal Tumour Study Group (SIOP-RTSG). This group has&#xD;
      designed an international randomized phase III clinical trial for the evaluation of VCE&#xD;
      versus VAD in patients with metastatic renal tumors (&gt;&gt;90% having nephroblastoma), in order&#xD;
      to decrease the long-term toxicity while at least preserving, if not improving, the treatment&#xD;
      efficacy. In addition, the issue of &quot;CT-only&quot; nodules and their adequate treatment needs to&#xD;
      be solved. In previous protocols, the treatment strategy was based on the diagnosis of&#xD;
      pulmonary metastases (~90% of all metastases) by conventional pulmonary X-ray. Central&#xD;
      Radiological Review (CRR) is planned for the initial staging using CT ± MRI, as it is&#xD;
      expected to more accurately detect patients with metastatic disease, including patients with&#xD;
      &quot;CT-only&quot; nodules. In addition, CRR will be set up for real-time response assessment during&#xD;
      treatment, in order to reliably determine who require pulmonary RT and which postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the main trial objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the non-inferiority (efficacy) of neoadjuvant VCE chemotherapy (experimental&#xD;
           arm) as compared to the standard arm with VAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide central radiological review (CRR) at diagnosis and after neoadjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy in order to determine more precisely the appropriate treatment for each&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the RCT is to investigate the metastatic complete response rate&#xD;
      (MetCR, including very good partial response (VGPR)) of neoadjuvant 6 weeks of VAD as&#xD;
      compared to neoadjuvant VCE in stage IV renal tumours using CRR. Several international&#xD;
      studies have shown that MetCR is a good surrogate endpoint for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative treatment, secondary objectives as well as the intended methodology are&#xD;
      detailed in the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of patients is 406 patients for the entire phase III trial running in the 12&#xD;
      major SIOP countries (max 110 patients in France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected trial duration is 5 years for accrual + 2 years follow-up (the overall 10-year&#xD;
      follow-up for long-term toxicity will be an independently funded ancillary study. This&#xD;
      duration is required for a reliable evaluation of the cardiac toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the current trial should be useful for the future protocols for the treatment&#xD;
      of all patients with nephroblastoma (metastatic but also localized and bilateral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this RCT will be worthy for the entire international pediatric oncology&#xD;
      community and future patients throughout the world and will be communicated in scientific&#xD;
      congresses and high-level peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
