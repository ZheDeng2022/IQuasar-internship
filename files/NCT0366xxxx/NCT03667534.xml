  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholestatic jaundice with multitude of causes affects approximately 1 in every 2,500 infants.&#xD;
      Of the many conditions that cause neonatal cholestasis, the most commonly identifiable are&#xD;
      biliary atresia (BA) (25%-35%). The incidence in Taiwan was 1.2 to 2.0 per 10,000 live birth.&#xD;
      Prognosis and survival are improved if bile drainage is restored by a Kasai portoenterostomy.&#xD;
      Stool color card was introduced to Taiwan in 2002 and national screening program was started&#xD;
      in 2004. The rate of age at Kasai operation &lt;60 days improved from 49.4% before year 2002 to&#xD;
      65.7% after introducing nationwide stool color card screening in Taiwan. There was a great&#xD;
      improvement in early diagnosis for biliary atresia after stool color card screening and there&#xD;
      were still many researches tried to improve the timing of diagnosis. A prospective cohort&#xD;
      observational study on neonates under 27 days old at London showed that serum conjugated&#xD;
      bilirubin &gt; 18 micromol/l in plasma measured at 6-10 days is a reliable marker for neonatal&#xD;
      cholestasis liver disease with sensitivity 100%, specificity 99.59% (95% CI 99.5-99.67), PPV&#xD;
      10.3% (95% CI 4.50-16.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to developed a screening test for neonatal cholestasis using dry blood spot to&#xD;
      improve patient survival by early diagnosis of treatable neonatal cholestasis disease, such&#xD;
      as biliary atresia and inborn error of bile acid metabolism. The diseases markers for&#xD;
      neonatal cholestasis we aims including basic clinical blood test examination profiles,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, fibrosis markers, immune profiles. In phase I study we will enroll&#xD;
      cholestasis patients at National Taiwan University Children Hospital. We will collect&#xD;
      patients' blood on dry blood spot and measure the disease markers for cholestasis disease. In&#xD;
      phase II study, we will enroll the cholestasis patients and healthy newborn without&#xD;
      cholestasis. We will review their newborn screening at 3 days old. Newborn screening dry&#xD;
      blood spot will be examined for the disease markers and compared with healthy control without&#xD;
      cholestasis. ROC curve analysis will be performed to find the best cut-off to screen for&#xD;
      neonatal cholestasis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings will aid early diagnosis in the patients and hence improve the survival.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Developed a screening test for neonatal cholestasis using dry blood spot&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve patient survival by early diagnosis of treatable neonatal cholestasis disease&#xD;
           such as biliary atresia and inborn error of bile acid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Validation of method for quantification of disease markers on dry blood spot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric children with cholestasis diagnose at National Taiwan University Hospital during&#xD;
      admission or out-patient clinic will be collected for the Phase I study. 5ml of venous blood&#xD;
      will be collected for measurement of disease markers during routine follow-up at National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital outpatient clinic. Dried blood spot (DBS) specimens are collected&#xD;
      from patients by applying a whole blood, drawn by lancet from the finger, heel or toe, a&#xD;
      provided filter paper. To evaluate the stability of disease markers on DBS, a total 10 blood&#xD;
      spots (each blood spout contain 50 - 75 microL of blood) will be applied on the filter paper&#xD;
      at day 0. The collected blood spots samples of a single patient at day 0 will be evaluated at&#xD;
      the day of DBS collection and followed by day 3, day 7, 6 months and 1 year after sample&#xD;
      collection. The purpose of repeat measurement of single patient sample at different time&#xD;
      point is to evaluate the possible effect of time effect on the accuracy of the data. 5 blood&#xD;
      spots are separated and protected from light with a light blocking envelope to compare the&#xD;
      light effect on disease markers degradation (Table 1). Serum disease markers measured with&#xD;
      conventional method will be served as reference and compared with DBS samples at different&#xD;
      time points. 30 patients will be collected to validate the correlation between serum and DBS&#xD;
      disease markers level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Pilot study In the pilot study, we aim to develop dry blood spot method for the&#xD;
      screening of neonatal cholestasis. Children with neonatal cholestasis disease previously&#xD;
      diagnosed at Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Children's Hospital from&#xD;
      2007 or newly diagnosed children will be recruited retrospectively from chart review.&#xD;
      Patients with indirect type hyperbilirubinemia and healthy neonates will be enrolled as&#xD;
      control. We will analyze neonatal cholestasis and control patients dry blood spot screening&#xD;
      test after birth to quantify disease markers level. ROC curve analysis will be conducted on&#xD;
      bilirubin quantity to find the best cutoff to screen for neonatal cholestasis. The sample&#xD;
      size of case and control study is 20 cases and 20 controls.&#xD;
