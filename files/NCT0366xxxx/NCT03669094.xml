  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An interventional, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the strain Lactobacillus salivarius&#xD;
      V4II-90 in the reduction of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization in pregnant women who&#xD;
      are GBS carriers. Forty GBS-positive participants in their first trimester of pregnancy will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of the two study groups: The experimental group with 3 months&#xD;
      probiotic consumption; and the control group with 3 months placebo consumption. The efficacy&#xD;
      of the probiotic strain to reduce the incidence of Group B Streptococcus will be assessed by&#xD;
      the percentage of participants with a vaginal and/or rectal detection of Group B&#xD;
      Streptococcus at the end of the study, by bilateral comparison of the treatment group with&#xD;
      the control group at the same time period. The estimated duration of the study will be 30&#xD;
      weeks, which includes a 3-month product administration. The intervention will start at week&#xD;
      23 ± 4 days of pregnancy and end at week 35 ± 4 days. Then, a visit will be completed one&#xD;
      month after delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All pregnant women reporting to the clinic in their first trimester of pregnancy (week 11 ± 2&#xD;
      weeks of pregnancy) will be asked to participate in this study. Participation will be&#xD;
      voluntary and written informed consent will be obtained from each participant. The study&#xD;
      visits will take place in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. After signing the informed&#xD;
      consent, a physical examination will be performed in addition to a vaginal-rectal smear to&#xD;
      detect if they are GBS-positive. Information on the demographic profile and medical history&#xD;
      will be collected. The investigator will explain to the participant that she cannot use any&#xD;
      probiotic during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, within 21-23 weeks ± 4 days of gestation, the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be reviewed. When a positive result of the microbiological analysis of the&#xD;
      vaginal-rectal exudate are obtained, the pregnant GBS+ women will be invited to continue in&#xD;
      the study. The randomized participant will intake one capsule of probiotic or placebo every&#xD;
      day for the next 12 weeks. The participant will be given a diary and instructions to record&#xD;
      the product intake. Adverse events occurring from the time of study inclusion will be&#xD;
      recorded. Adverse Events occurring from the time of study inclusion will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the third visit (Visit 3, 35 weeks ± 4 days of gestation), all participants continuing in&#xD;
      the study will undergo a general physical examination. A sample of vaginal and rectal exudate&#xD;
      will be collected from the participants who end the treatment period. Adverse Events&#xD;
      occurring during the period between Visit 2 and Visit 3 will be recorded. The participants&#xD;
      must deliver the remaining product and the completed diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Visit 4 (1 month after delivery), all participants will have a general physical&#xD;
      examination. Adverse Events occurring since Visit 3 will be recorded. Data will be collected&#xD;
      on the delivery and occurrence of early- or late-onset GBS sepsis in the newborn during the&#xD;
      first month of life.&#xD;
