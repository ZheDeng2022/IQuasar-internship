      This is a phase III, single blind (outcome assessor is blinded), randomised controlled&#xD;
      multicentre trial of the effect of EpiCeram emollient for improving and maintaining skin&#xD;
      barrier function and reducing incidence of eczema and food allergy in high risk infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 760 participants with a first degree family history of allergic disease (asthma,&#xD;
      eczema, allergic rhinitis or food allergy) will be recruited (380 each group) from maternity&#xD;
      wards of three hospitals.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that twice daily application of a&#xD;
      ceramide dominant emollient reduces the risk of eczema and food allergy, when compared to&#xD;
      standard skin management. Secondary objectives are to determine if twice daily application of&#xD;
      a ceramide dominant emollient reduces the risk of infants developing allergic sensitisation&#xD;
      (as measured by skin prick test); to determine if twice daily application of a ceramide&#xD;
      dominant emollient improves infant skin barrier function; to determine the level of parental&#xD;
      compliance with a program to build infant skin barrier function; to confirm that a ceramide&#xD;
      dominant emollient does not cause adverse effects in infants; to determine the level of&#xD;
      compliance required to demonstrate an improvement in infant skin barrier function and to&#xD;
      determine if twice daily application of a ceramide dominant emollient influences infant skin&#xD;
      microbial colonisation, or skin lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase III, single blind (outcome assessor is blinded), randomised controlled&#xD;
      multicentre trial of the effect of EpiCeram emollient for improving and maintaining skin&#xD;
      barrier function and reducing incidence of eczema and food allergy in high risk infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 760 participants with a first degree family history of allergic disease (asthma,&#xD;
      eczema, allergic rhinitis or food allergy) will be recruited (380 each group) from maternity&#xD;
      wards of three hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be from birth until six months, with a six week, six month and twelve month&#xD;
      follow-up. An initial assessment will be performed at baseline which incorporates three&#xD;
      surveys, a skin assessment, diary card (which is to be completed weekly and measures&#xD;
      compliance), a breast milk sample, guthrie card and tape stripping. The six week and six&#xD;
      month assessments entail a skin assessment, survey, compliance check, breast milk sample,&#xD;
      tape stripping and guthrie card. Primary outcomes are assessed at the 12 month follow up&#xD;
      where in addition to the aforementioned items, a saliva sample will also be taken and skin&#xD;
      prick testing and food challenges will be performed when children have a positive SPT to one&#xD;
      or more foods..&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>This diagnosis is derived from a combination of allergic sensitisation, reaction history and food challenge. A skin prick test to six common allergens will be performed (egg white, cows' milk, peanut, dust mite, cat dander, and rye grass) along with a negative (saline) and a positive (histamine) control. Participants that are sensitised to certain foods (&gt;=1mm wheal) during the skin prick testing will be given a challenge to determine if they are allergic to those foods. This will be conducted at the MCRI Allergy Clinic under the supervision of a Doctor specifically trained in oral food challenges.</description>

    <description>They will be instructed to apply EpiCeram™ to the full skin surface of their child twice per day for 6 months. The prophylactic use of EpiCeram™ is the intervention that is being tested for its effect on infant skin barrier function. We will instruct parents to apply approximately 6 grams of EpiCeram™ per application at two regular times each day, including after bathing the infant, or at the time they would normally bathe their child.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infants will be eligible for this study if their mother, father, or an older sibling has a&#xD;
        self-reported history of at least one of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  asthma,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  eczema/atopic dermatitis,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hay fever/ allergic rhinitis or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  food allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: infants with any of the following will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A parent who has a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of EpiCeram™ will&#xD;
             be excluded, as it would be difficult for these parents to apply EpiCeram™ to their&#xD;
             infant, and there is likely to be an increased risk of the infant reacting to the&#xD;
             cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple births (twins, triplets etc.) will be excluded, due to the difficulty in&#xD;
             randomising individual twins and because of the clustering effect of multiple children&#xD;
             from the same family which would reduce the effective sample size of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who are born premature (&lt;36 weeks) as the effect of the intervention may be different&#xD;
             in premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who have major birth or early life medical complications that require admission into a&#xD;
             special care nursery, as it will be difficult for parents to comply with the study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Whose parents do not have sufficient English language skills to be able to answer&#xD;
             questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Whose parents are not able to comply with all protocol required visits and procedures&#xD;
