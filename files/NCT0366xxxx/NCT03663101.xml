  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine whether a currently licensed version of botulinum toxin&#xD;
      (Dysport®) is effective for the treatment of pain that has developed and/or persisted for&#xD;
      months or years around the scar of a previous surgical site, and whether this condition could&#xD;
      be suitable for the testing of similar new medicines. The study will compare three different&#xD;
      doses of Dysport® to see if there is benefit and/or a best dose for treating persistent&#xD;
      post-surgery scar pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to Onset of Effect in the Spontaneous Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Part B: From baseline (defined as mean of all predose data from Day -7 and including predose on Day 1) up to end of study (Week 16) or early discontinuation.</time_frame>
    <description>The time to onset of effect was defined as the time to a decrease from baseline of two points or greater in the spontaneous NRS score. Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Participants were provided with an Actiwatch® during an Actiwatch® training visit to record their spontaneous NRS scores at home. The Actiwatch® alerted the participants twice a day to record their average and maximal NRS scores over the preceding 12 hours. The questions were asked of the participants by the Actiwatch®: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain on average during the last 12 hours.&quot; and &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain at its worst during the last 12 hours.&quot; Only descriptive statistical analysis was performed for this outcome measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Part B: From baseline (defined as mean of all predose data from Day -7 and including predose on Day 1) up to end of study (Week 16) or early discontinuation.</time_frame>
    <description>The peak effect was defined as the maximal decrease from baseline in the spontaneous NRS score over a 12-hour period. Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Participants were provided with an Actiwatch® during an Actiwatch® training visit to record their spontaneous NRS scores at home. The Actiwatch® alerted the participants twice a day to record their average and maximal NRS scores over the preceding 12 hours. The questions were asked of the participants by the Actiwatch®: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain on average during the last 12 hours.&quot; and &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain at its worst during the last 12 hours.&quot; Greater reductions in change from baseline correspond to greater pain relief.</description>

    <description>The duration of effect was defined as the duration between time to onset and last timepoint for which decrease from baseline in the spontaneous NRS score was two points or greater. Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Participants were provided with an Actiwatch® during an Actiwatch® training visit to record their spontaneous NRS scores at home. The Actiwatch® alerted the participants twice a day to record their average and maximal NRS scores over the preceding 12 hours.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Stimulus-Evoked NRS Score on the Painful Area at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Part B: Baseline (defined as mean of all predose data from Day -7 and including predose on Day 1) and Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>For stimulus-evoked NRS score during Quantitative Sensory Testing, participants were submitted to stimuli of various nature (light touch, pressure and temperature) applied to the painful area. Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Static mechanical allodynia is the response to light sustained normally innocuous pressure against the skin. Dynamic mechanical allodynia is the response to a normally innocuous light moving mechanical stimulus on the skin. Temporal summation is a condition, which demonstrates an increased perception of pain to repetitive painful stimuli.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This Phase II proof-of-concept study was conducted at single investigational site in the United Kingdom between 30 October 2018 and 08 November 2019. The study consisted of two sequential parts: Part A (Pre-randomisation run-in period) and Part B (Randomised double-blind period). Part A was considered as an extended screening period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Part A was conducted to identify participants who would potentially benefit from Dysport® injection, considered as 'responders'. Part B was a double-blind study of Dysport or placebo injection in responders from Part A. Of the 46 participants who were included in Part A, 17 were responders. Of which, 16 participants were randomised into Part B of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Time to Onset of Effect in the Spontaneous Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score</title>
        <description>The time to onset of effect was defined as the time to a decrease from baseline of two points or greater in the spontaneous NRS score. Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Participants were provided with an Actiwatch® during an Actiwatch® training visit to record their spontaneous NRS scores at home. The Actiwatch® alerted the participants twice a day to record their average and maximal NRS scores over the preceding 12 hours. The questions were asked of the participants by the Actiwatch®: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain on average during the last 12 hours.&quot; and &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain at its worst during the last 12 hours.&quot; Only descriptive statistical analysis was performed for this outcome measure.</description>

          <title>Peak Effect in the Spontaneous NRS Score</title>
          <description>The peak effect was defined as the maximal decrease from baseline in the spontaneous NRS score over a 12-hour period. Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Participants were provided with an Actiwatch® during an Actiwatch® training visit to record their spontaneous NRS scores at home. The Actiwatch® alerted the participants twice a day to record their average and maximal NRS scores over the preceding 12 hours. The questions were asked of the participants by the Actiwatch®: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain on average during the last 12 hours.&quot; and &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain at its worst during the last 12 hours.&quot; Greater reductions in change from baseline correspond to greater pain relief.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Spontaneous NRS Score Throughout the Study</title>
          <description>Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Participants were provided with an Actiwatch® during an Actiwatch® training visit to record their spontaneous NRS scores at home. The Actiwatch® alerted the participants twice a day to record their average and maximal NRS scores over the preceding 12 hours. The questions were asked of the participants by the Actiwatch®: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain on average during the last 12 hours.&quot; and &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain at its worst during the last 12 hours.&quot; Greater reductions in change from baseline correspond to greater pain relief.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Stimulus-Evoked NRS Score on the Painful Area at Weeks 6 and 12</title>
        <description>For stimulus-evoked NRS score during Quantitative Sensory Testing, participants were submitted to stimuli of various nature (light touch, pressure and temperature) applied to the painful area. Pain intensity was scored using an 11-point NRS score ranging from 0 to 10, where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. Static mechanical allodynia is the response to light sustained normally innocuous pressure against the skin. Dynamic mechanical allodynia is the response to a normally innocuous light moving mechanical stimulus on the skin. Temporal summation is a condition, which demonstrates an increased perception of pain to repetitive painful stimuli.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There IS an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Recruitment was closed prematurely by 30 June 2019 due to slow enrolment (16 participants randomized instead of 24 initially planned), which meant Sponsor did not believe it was feasible to continue study in an acceptable timeframe. The decision was not related to any safety/tolerability concern with Dysport.</limitations_and_caveats>
