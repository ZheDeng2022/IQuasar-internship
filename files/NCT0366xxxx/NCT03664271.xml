  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to increase families' understanding of eczema and improve&#xD;
      eczema management in the primary care setting. The investigators plan to create an&#xD;
      educational video for families providing general information about eczema as well as&#xD;
      instructions about good skincare management and common treatments. The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized controlled trial of the plan in the primary care clinic at Boston&#xD;
      Children's Hospital. Specifically, the investigators aim to (1) decrease eczema severity (2)&#xD;
      improve patient and family quality of life (QOL) and (3) increase parental knowledge about&#xD;
      eczema and eczema management.&#xD;

    <description>change in caregiver knowledge pre-post as assessed by a questionnaire. This is not a standardized tool, but rather a series of 22 questions about caregiver comfort and understanding of eczema. Some responses use a likert scale format, while others are multiple choice questions. There are 8 multiple choice questions, each of which has one right answer. Those can be totaled to determine percentage correct.</description>
