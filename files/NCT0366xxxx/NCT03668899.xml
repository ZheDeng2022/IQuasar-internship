      proper disinfection of root canal system before obturation is a must for long term success of&#xD;
      endodontic treatment, therefore a proper irrigant is mandatory, therefore investigators are&#xD;
      studying the antibacterial effects of 4 different irrgating solutions in root canal treatment&#xD;
      of patients diagnosed with necrotic pulps in their mandibular posterior teeth. patients will&#xD;
      be recruited from outpatient clinic of the endodontic department in cairo university.&#xD;
      endodontic treatment will be carried out as usual and samples from the infected root canals&#xD;
      will be collected before and after preparation to be cultivated and analyzed at the&#xD;
      laboratories of microbiology of faculty of medicine, cairo university&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Antimicrobial Efficacy of Nano Chitosan, Chlorhexidine, Chlorhexidine/ Nano&#xD;
      Chitosan Combination versus Sodium Hypochlorite Irrigation in Patients with Necrotic&#xD;
      Mandibular Posterior Teeth: A Randomized Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteria play a major role in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis; therefore, success of&#xD;
      endodontic treatment is dependent on its complete eradication before obturation1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been established that no instrumentation technique can sufficiently eradicate bacteria&#xD;
      from the root canal system without proper irrigation. the success rate of endodontic&#xD;
      treatment was claimed to be approximately 10-15% lower for teeth which yield a positive&#xD;
      culture before obturation than for teeth which yield a negative culture1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A verity of irrigating solutions has been introduced and investigated for proper disinfection&#xD;
      during endodontic treatment of which sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was considered the most&#xD;
      popular of all available solutions for its superior antimicrobial effects and tissue&#xD;
      dissolving abilities2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inability of NaOCl to remove smear layer advocated the use of a chelating agent like EDTA&#xD;
      or Citric acid for removal of smear layer after chemo-mechanical preparation3. Yet this&#xD;
      wasn't the only downside to the use of NaOCl as the main irrigant, toxicity and irritation to&#xD;
      the periapical tissues, burning of the surrounding oral tissues and the weakening effect on&#xD;
      dentin flexural strength are also important disadvantages of NaOCl4,5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine (CHX), is another popular irrigant which has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity plus substantivity, yet it has no tissue dissolving abilities of any kind6. Several&#xD;
      studies compared the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl and CHX, some studies showed CHX to be&#xD;
      superior to NaOCl7 other studies concluded that it had no added effect to those of NaOCl and&#xD;
      that hypochlorite more often achieved negative cultures than CHX8 and several studies proved&#xD;
      them both to be similarly effective9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide variety of natural solutions used for irrigation has emerged in order to overcome the&#xD;
      downsides of NaOCl including Chitosan nanoparticles. Chitosan nanoparticles are known to have&#xD;
      a good antimicrobial activity as well as a chelating effect which will allow for eradication&#xD;
      of bacteria and removal of smear layer in the same time10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Rationale A. The intervention benefits and databases search results Sodium hypochlorite&#xD;
      (NaOCl); the gold standard for irrigation has many disadvantages including irritation of the&#xD;
      periapical tissues and burning of surrounding tissues4,5. Therefore, the present study aims&#xD;
      to explore new irrigating solutions probably more effective and less irritating to the&#xD;
      periapical tissues than NaOCl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shed the light on a wide range of natural substances like Chitosan,&#xD;
      Propolis, and other herbal solutions that are claimed to be as effective against bacteria as&#xD;
      NaOCl and less toxic and less irritant4,and also introduced nanoparticles with their known&#xD;
      antimicrobial capabilities as endodontic irrigants10,15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides its antimicrobial activity, Chitosan nanoparticles showed promising chelating&#xD;
      abilities; Porchena et al suggested that CNPs irrigation was superior to NaOCl in that as&#xD;
      well as inhibiting bacterial growth it also can remove the smear layer effectively10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in vitro study in 2017 claimed that the combination of 2% Chlorhexidine and 2% Chitosan is&#xD;
      as effective as NaOCl against E. Faecalis in biofilms5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The benefits of this study to the population and clinicians It is well established that&#xD;
      the most probable cause failure of endodontic treatment is the presence of a persisting&#xD;
      infection. Therefore, it is important that chemo-mechanical canal preparation be directed&#xD;
      towards complete eradication of all bacteria from the root canal system so that the best&#xD;
      possible prognosis can be achieved in endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural alternatives to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) can provide as efficient disinfection of&#xD;
      the root canal system without the adverse effects of NaOCl on surrounding oral and periapical&#xD;
      tissues. This may allow endodontists to perform an efficient and comfortable root canal&#xD;
      treatments increasing the patients' confidence and creating a more positive attitude towards&#xD;
      the dental profession.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim of the current study is to compare the antimicrobial effects of Nano chitosan,&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine and Chlorhexidine/ Nano Chitosan combination to sodium hypochlorite in patients&#xD;
      with necrotic mandibular posterior teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICO Format&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P: population Patients diagnosed with necrotic mandibular posteriors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I: intervention I1: Irrigation with nano chitosan I2: Irrigation with chlorhexidine I3:&#xD;
           Irrigation with Chlorhexidine/ nano Chitosan combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C: control Irrigation with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  O: outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibacterial efficacy: will be assessed by counting the number of colony forming units (CFU)&#xD;
      after cultivating the collected samples before and after irrigation (S1 and S2) for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Tool Unit Time antibacterial efficacy Number of CFUs Numerical data Samples collected&#xD;
      before and after preparation and transferred to the laboratory for immediate cultivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome Postoperative pain: will be recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS), pain&#xD;
      intensity will be recorded preoperatively and postoperatively after 6, 12, 24,48, 72 hours&#xD;
      and 7 days. The VAS consists of a10-cm line anchored by two extremes &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;pain as&#xD;
      bad as could be&quot;, patient will be asked to choose the mark that represent their level of&#xD;
      pain. Pain level will be assigned to one of 4 categorical scores: 1, None (0); 2, Mild (1-3);&#xD;
      3, Moderate (4-6); 4, Severe (7-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Tool Unit Time Postoperative pain Visual analogue scale VAS Categorial data&#xD;
      Immediately after treatment and Up to 7 days after endodontic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In necrotic mandibular posterior teeth, would irrigating the canals using either nano&#xD;
      chitosan, chlorhexidine or a combination of nano chitosan and chlorhexidine versus sodium&#xD;
      hypochlorite result in better canal disinfection and less postoperative pain?&#xD;
