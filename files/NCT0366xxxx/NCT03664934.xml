      The knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms behind prolonged Whiplash Associated Disorders&#xD;
      (WAD) is insufficient and whether changes can be restored by rehabilitation or not is&#xD;
      unknown. The aim of these studies are to investigate different parameters to further learn&#xD;
      about pathophysiological mechanisms (neck muscle fatty infiltration, cross-sectional area,&#xD;
      volume, inflammation and function, brain structure and activity, biomarkers for stress and&#xD;
      inflammation, cervical kinaesthesia and balance before and after intervention) and the&#xD;
      association for clinical outcomes in individuals with chronic WAD (n=30) compared with age&#xD;
      and gender matched healthy individuals (n=30). Measurements will be made at baseline&#xD;
      (patients and healthy) and at 3 months (patients only, at the end of treatment). However, for&#xD;
      the blood and saliva samples, they will be re-investigated in the healthy group as well. The&#xD;
      study results may contribute to the development of improved understanding and diagnostics in&#xD;
      chronic WAD that may improve future rehabilitation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND There is no consensus regarding the injury mechanism in complex prolonged Whiplash&#xD;
      Associated Disorders (WAD) cases. Often, tissue damage and physiological alterations is not&#xD;
      detectable. In order to improve future rehabilitation, a greater understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying whiplash injury and their importance for treatment success is required.&#xD;
      It is also important to investigate if pathophysiological changes can be restored by&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The projects aims to investigate neck muscle structure and function, biomarkers and the&#xD;
      association with pain, disability and other outcomes before and after neck-specific&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Design These are sub-group trials, each one independent of the others, in a&#xD;
      prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel treatment arms&#xD;
      conducted according to a protocol established before recruitment started (ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      Protocol ID: NCT03022812). Physiotherapist-led neck-specific exercise previously shown to be&#xD;
      effective for the current population constitutes the control treatment for the new&#xD;
      Internet-based neck-specific exercise treatment. In the RCT, a total of 140 patients will be&#xD;
      included (70 from each group), whereof 30 (both randomization arms equally) consecutively&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in the present sub-group study. The sub-group studies aims to&#xD;
      start September 2019. Independent physiotherapists in primary health care will distribute the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sub-group of individuals, additional measurements will be performed before and after&#xD;
      interventions end (3 months follow-up). The physical measurements will be performed by&#xD;
      independent specially trained test-leaders blinded to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, 30 neck healthy individuals without serious diseases matched for age and gender&#xD;
      will consecutively be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;

           (changes in smell and taste).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous fractures or dislocation of the cervical spine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known or suspected serious physical pathology included myelopathy,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  BMI &gt;35&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindications of MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and randomization Information about the study will be provided by healthcare&#xD;
      providers, reports in newspapers, social media, and the university's website. Interested&#xD;
      patients will contact the research team through the project website. After completing a small&#xD;
      survey on the website, a project team member (physiotherapist) will perform a telephone&#xD;
      interview and ask about the patient's medical history. An appointment for a physical&#xD;
      examination and additional interview for the present sub-group study is made as a last step&#xD;
      to ensure that the criteria for study participation are met. If the study criteria are met,&#xD;
      written and oral informed consent are obtained, and the patient will fill out a questionnaire&#xD;
      and undergo physical measurements of neck-related function. Baseline measurements must be&#xD;
      completed for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy individuals will consecutively be recruited among friends, family and staff at the&#xD;
      university or the university hospital to suit the age and gender of a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for the patient group The intervention consists of neck-specific exercises&#xD;
      distributed in two different ways, twice a week at the physiotherapist clinic for 3 months&#xD;
      (NSE group) or with 4 physiotherapy visits only combined with a web-based system (NSEIT&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. In the NSE group, patients will get an explanation and justification for the exercise&#xD;
      consisting of basic information about the musculoskeletal anatomy of the neck relevant to the&#xD;
      exercises given by the physiotherapist in order to motivate the patient and help make them&#xD;
      feel safe and reassured. The patients undergo a 12-week training programme with a&#xD;
      physiotherapist 2 days/week (total 24 times). Exercises are chosen from a clear and written&#xD;
      frame of exercises. The training includes exercises for the deep neck muscles, continuing&#xD;
      with the endurance training of neck and shoulder muscles. The exercises are individually&#xD;
      adjusted according to the individual's physical conditions and progressively increased in&#xD;
      severity and dose. Exercise-related pain provocation is not accepted. The patient may also&#xD;
      perform exercises at home. At the end of the treatment period, the participants are&#xD;
      encouraged to continue practising on their own. The exercises have been used with good&#xD;
      results in previous RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. In the NSEIT group, patients will receive the same information and training programmes as&#xD;
      the NSE group, but with 4 visits to the physiotherapist instead of 24. Exercises are&#xD;
      introduced, progressed, and followed up to ensure correct performance. The exercises are&#xD;
      performed and most of the information is given with the help of Internet support outside the&#xD;
      healthcare system. Photos and videos of the exercises (a clear stepwise progression) and&#xD;
      information are available on the Web-based system. A SMS reminder is automatically available&#xD;
      if the exercise diary is not completed. The time required for training is the same as in&#xD;
      group A, but without the patient having to go to the physiotherapy clinic. The Internet&#xD;
      programme was developed by experienced physiotherapists/ researchers together with&#xD;
      technicians and clinicians. Technicians are available to assist the participants if any&#xD;
      technical difficulties arise. The patients will be introduced to the exercises and get&#xD;
      information and support at the physiotherapy visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables and measurements Background data and data in the RCT include personal details,&#xD;
      questionnaires and test results regarding pain, physical and psychological functioning,&#xD;
      health and cost-effectiveness described elsewhere (ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol ID:&#xD;
      NCT03022812).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be done at baseline for both groups and at 3 months follow-up for the&#xD;
      patient when treatment ends. Except for blood and saliva samples that will be collected twice&#xD;
      (baseline and repeated after 3 months), the measurements will be performed at baseline only&#xD;
      for the healthy individuals.&#xD;
