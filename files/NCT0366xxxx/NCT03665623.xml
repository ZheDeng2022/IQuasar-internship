  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is one of the most serious complications in pregnancy that causes maternal death&#xD;
      and preterm delivery. Series studies has show that the competing risk model developed by the&#xD;
      Fetal Maternal FouNdation in early pregnancy has the potential to predict preeclampsia&#xD;
      effectively but has show crowd difference. We aim to evaluate the performance of various&#xD;
      screening model based on FMF model in Chinese population.&#xD;

      The prospective multi-center observational study aimed to recruit at least 10,000 pregnant&#xD;
      woman during the first trimester conducted among 12 medical centers in China. The medical&#xD;
      history of each candidate was recorded , blood pressure was measured , blood sample was taken&#xD;
      between 11 gestational weeks and 13+6 gestational weeks, to get the PlGF and PAPPA tested.&#xD;
      Routine ultrasound was taken with measurement of the uterine artery pulsatility index. The&#xD;
      results of the recruited patients were not released to the patients or the doctor. Pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome was recorded as to whether the women develop preeclampsia , the SGA babies, or low&#xD;
      birth Apgar score and other preeclampsia related adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The&#xD;
      basic medical information, the mean artery pressure, the PlGF and PAPPA MOM, the UtA PI were&#xD;
      used in combination to do the risk stratification, and to develop prediction model for&#xD;
      Chinese people.&#xD;
