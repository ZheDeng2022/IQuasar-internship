    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carbon dioxide fractional (CO2RE) laser works in&#xD;
      treating participants with stage 0-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer with&#xD;
      vulvovaginal atrophy associated with dryness, inflammation or thinning of the epithelial&#xD;
      lining of the vulva and vagina. CO2RE laser is a device that delivers controlled CO2 energy&#xD;
      to the vaginal tissue and may help treat vaginal symptoms such as itching, burning, painful&#xD;
      sexual intercourse, thickened or thin skin of the vulva, and stinging.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the reduction in Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire (VSQ) score at 3-month&#xD;
      follow up after CO2RE laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the reduction in VSQ score after CO2RE laser treatment 6-month follow-up and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score before and after treatment with&#xD;
      CO2RE laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) 6 score before and after treatment with&#xD;
      CO2RE laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate vaginal health index score and vaginal caliber before and after treatment&#xD;
      with CO2RE laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate discomfort and pain during CO2RE laser treatment using the visual analog&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate treatment satisfaction after CO2RE laser treatment using 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate adherence to aromatase inhibitor at 6 and 12 months after CO2RE laser&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the change in the vaginal cytology using vaginal maturation index at baseline&#xD;
      and during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess serum estradiol level at baseline and after CO2RE laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo carbon dioxide fractional laser therapy over 10-15 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
