      Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Kinesio taping on upper&#xD;
      trapezius muscle on the reduction of pain and emotional state in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with tension type headache by acting on myofacial mechanoreceptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study was conducted in 71 patients aged 30-45 years with tension type headache&#xD;
      diagnosed. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. While KT and stretching exercises&#xD;
      were performed in the study group, only the stretching exercise was performed for the control&#xD;
      group. KT was applied 8 times in total for 4 weeks with 2 sessions per week. Stretching&#xD;
      exercise was done in the morning, afternoon and evening 3 times every day for 4 weeks and 5&#xD;
      days of the week. After recording the demographic data of all the patients participating in&#xD;
      the study, assessed the sensitivity of the right and left upper parts of the trapezius with&#xD;
      algometer, pain intensity with visual analog scale (VAS), Beck depression and anxiety scale&#xD;
      for emotional status before and after treatment. p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;

      Participants This study was performed with 71 patients diagnosed as tension type headache.&#xD;
      The study was conducted with patients at the Florence Nightingale Hospital between the ages&#xD;
      of 30-45 who applied to the Neurology clinic. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. A&#xD;
      randomized list is prepared in a computer environment by a statistician for randomization. In&#xD;
      this list, the odd numbers for the control group and the KT group were given double numbers.&#xD;
      The group identification is printed on sequentially numbered cards placed in sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. After enrollment, the numbered envelope was opened by the patient and the blind&#xD;
      investigator. Patients were included in the study, between 30 and 45 years of age, who had a&#xD;
      tension headache diagnosis, presence of a tender points on the upper part of the trapezoid,&#xD;
      voluntary or written volunteers to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria include&#xD;
      cervical area surgery and / or surgery, cervical trauma history, systemic disease targeting&#xD;
      this area, moderate or excessive nausea and vomiting with headache, headache due to other&#xD;
      causes (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral embolism, cerebral&#xD;
      thrombosis, vascular malformation, arthritis, hypertension, or arteriosclerosis), have used&#xD;
      prophylactic headache medications in the last 3 months, neurological, mental, hemorrhagic&#xD;
      disease, allergy, serious heart, liver, kidney and other organ deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Upper trapezius muscle stretching exercise with KT was applied to the study&#xD;
      group, and upper trapezius muscle stretching exercise was applied to the control group. KT&#xD;
      was applied 8 times in total for 4 weeks with 2 sessions per week. Stretching exercise was&#xD;
      done in the morning, afternoon and evening 3 times (repeated 10 times per set) every day for&#xD;
      4 weeks and 5 days of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KT application: 50-mm wide and 0.5-mm thick KT was applied to the upper trapezius muscle with&#xD;
      one I-shaped tape. The tape was measured from the acromion to the hairline at the back, and&#xD;
      the upper trapezius fibers were extended in the extended position, ie the cervical vertebrae&#xD;
      were flexed to the opposite side and applied to the same side in the flexion and rotation&#xD;
      position. The band was fixed to the insertion site of the acromion in the initial resting&#xD;
      position. The muscle was lengthened and the band was fixed with the initial skin shift, then&#xD;
      the band was fixed to the origin of the hairline from the muscle fixed with 10% stretch. The&#xD;
      tape was rubbed together with the muscle in the extended position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements After recording the demographic data of all the patients participating&#xD;
      in the study, the sensitivity of the right and left upper parts of the trapezius assessed&#xD;
      with algometer, pain intensity with visual analog scale (VAS), Beck depression and anxiety&#xD;
      scale for emotional status before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The algometer is a mechanical pressure device with a minimum diameter of 100 g and a pressure&#xD;
      of 10 kg / cm2, with a spring-loaded cylinder with a rubber tip, a circle and a pressure&#xD;
      surface of 1 cm2 in diameter, obtained in kg / cm2. Before measuring with the algo- rithm, a&#xD;
      pressure of approximately 4 kg was applied to the midpoint of the upper part of the trapezius&#xD;
      muscle, which is the control point, with the pulp of the thumb of the hand. Then the force&#xD;
      was applied to the same point, causing pain to separate the patient's sense of pressure and&#xD;
      pain sensation. This process has been repeated several times. Measurements with an algometer&#xD;
      were made at a rate of 1 kg per second. The measurements were interrupted for at least 15-20&#xD;
      seconds. Three measurements were made at these 2 sensitive points and the average of the&#xD;
      measurements was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to convert some numerical values, such as pain, to numeric&#xD;
      values. The two extremes of a 100 mm line are to be assessed on two extremes and the patient&#xD;
      is asked to indicate on the line where the severity of the pain is appropriate by drawing a&#xD;
      line or placing a point or pointing. The length of the distance from where the pain has never&#xD;
      occurred to the point the patient has marked indicates the pain of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) developed by Aron T. Beck in&#xD;
      1961, Turkish validity and reliability were done by Hisli N. Emotional state assessment scale&#xD;
      that measures the characteristic attitude and depression symptoms. The application takes&#xD;
      about 10-15 minutes to complete. It is designed for people aged 13 and over. Scoring and&#xD;
      evaluation of scales is easy. The total number of points counted from each four-sentence&#xD;
      sentence group is found. For depression scale; 0-9: Normal level, 10-16: Mild depression,&#xD;
      17-29: Moderate depression, 30-63: Indicates severe depression. For anxiety scale; Normal&#xD;
      range between 0-7 points, mild anxiety between 8-15 points, middle anxiety between 16-25&#xD;
      points, and severe anxiety between 26-63 points.&#xD;
