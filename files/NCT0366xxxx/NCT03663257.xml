      AneurysmFlow R1.0 is an approved (i.e. CE labeled, 510k, Health Canada), software tool&#xD;
      intended to provide relevant information on the blood flow in a cerebral aneurysm and its&#xD;
      parent artery based on angiography. It calculates the Mean Aneurysm Flow Amplitude (MAFA)&#xD;
      ratio to measure the volumetric flow rate quotient before and after Flow Diverter Stent (FDS)&#xD;
      implantation in the region of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a prospective, single arm, observational, multicenter cohort study to&#xD;
      assess the prognostic value of the MAFA ratio for predicting full aneurysm occlusion 12&#xD;
      months after flow diverter placement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      AneurysmFlow R1.0 is an approved (CE labeled, cleared in US, Canada and Argentina), software&#xD;
      tool intended to provide relevant information on the blood flow in a cerebral aneurysm and&#xD;
      its parent artery based on angiography. It provides color coded and vector field&#xD;
      representation of a digital subtraction angiography (DSA). It can quantify blood flow rates&#xD;
      in the artery based on DSA and 3-D Rotational Angiogram (3DRA) data. It can visualize blood&#xD;
      flow patterns in an aneurysm based on DSA data. Specifically, it calculates the Mean Aneurysm&#xD;
      Flow Amplitude (MAFA) ratio to measure the volumetric flow rate quotient before and after&#xD;
      Flow Diverter Stent (FDS) implantation in the region of interest. It is manufactured by&#xD;
      Philips Medical Systems bv., a Philips Healthcare company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 subjects with unruptured, &gt;5mm saccular aneurysm(s) located in the anterior intracranial&#xD;
      circulation and suitable for an endovascular treatment with a Flow Diverter Stent will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. The enrollment period is expected to last for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician investigators participating in this study are expected to follow their normal&#xD;
      clinical practice in enrolling, treating and following patients with intracranial aneurysms&#xD;
      that are amenable to treatment with flow diverter stents. No additional procedures are&#xD;
      required of patients in order to participate in this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with intracranial saccular aneurysm(s) will be evaluated by the neuro&#xD;
      interventional team, in accordance with institutional practice, to establish an appropriate&#xD;
      treatment plan based on the patient's medical condition and available diagnostic screening&#xD;
      procedures prior to recruitment in the study. More than one aneurysm in a single patient may&#xD;
      be treated, but only one target aneurysm treated with an FDS device will be considered as&#xD;
      part of this study. If treatment of the aneurysm with the FDS is deemed appropriate, the&#xD;
      institution's guidelines regarding their ethics committee and informed consent process will&#xD;
      be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the consent form(s) approved by the local research ethics board (REB), the&#xD;
      principal investigator will screen the potential investigation subjects for the CARO study.&#xD;
      The principal investigator or his delegates on the study team will enter data in a&#xD;
      pre-designed digital Case Report Form (e-CRF). This will include patient demographics,&#xD;
      relevant past medical and surgical history, and specific target aneurysm data along with&#xD;
      pre-procedural/screening imaging details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will qualify for this&#xD;
      study. The measurement and size of each aneurysm will be verified by the principal&#xD;
      investigator. If the size of the aneurysm is acceptable, then it will be included in the&#xD;
      study. It is recommended that this measurement should be done within 180 days before the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index Procedure and Discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will proceed with standard of care procedures on the day of Index Procedure&#xD;
      (i.e. FDS insertion) for the target aneurysm(s). Then, endovascular treatment procedure&#xD;
      details should be provided for each eligible patient. Blood flow velocity will be calculated&#xD;
      using the dedicated software AneurysmFlow (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), which&#xD;
      will be installed on standard of care imaging equipment. For this purpose, digital&#xD;
      subtraction angiograms will be acquired during the procedure; just before and right after&#xD;
      placement of the FDS. Calculation of blood flow velocity will be performed automatically on&#xD;
      the AneurysmFlow software. There are no additional devices or medications required for the&#xD;
      study. The AneurysmFlow software uses standard-of-care 2D DSA and 3D-RA image sequences to&#xD;
      determine this flow information. All raw image sequences will be stored for future reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not make any recommendation on patient management or on treatment strategy.&#xD;
      Also, this software will not disrupt standard-of-care workflow for the interventionalist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Ups (6 and 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All registry patients treated with FDS are expected to follow their routine post treatment&#xD;
      clinical visits, which will include a standard-of-care head imaging (e.g. Computed Tomography&#xD;
      Angiography (CTA), Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and/or DSA) test to classify aneurysm&#xD;
      occlusion (i.e. Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification I) at 6 months (±49 days) and 12 months&#xD;
      (±49 days). During the 6 and 12 month follow up visits, patient medical charts will be&#xD;
      accessed to collect adverse events (if applicable) and document any post-treatment&#xD;
      neurological deterioration (neurological assessment, modified Rankin Scale). De-identified&#xD;
      data (i.e. clinical notes, imaging reports etc.) will be entered in the relevant e-CRF&#xD;
      sections. All (serious) adverse events (i.e. re-operations, ruptures and deaths) whether or&#xD;
      not related to the investigational device will be collected and reported conform local rules&#xD;
      and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is expected to take approximately 2.5 years. Patient&#xD;
      enrollment will take place between September 2018 and September 2019. Each subject will be in&#xD;
      the study for 1 year (follow-up).&#xD;
