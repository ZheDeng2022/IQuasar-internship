      HIIT-BEER will determine the effect of habitual and moderate beer intake (330-660 ml / day, 5&#xD;
      days / week) on physical fitness, body composition, psychokinetic abilities and psychological&#xD;
      status in sedentary healthy adults undergoing a HIIT training program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of habitual and moderate consumption of beer on physical fitness,&#xD;
      body composition, psychokinetic and cognitive abilities and psychological status in sedentary&#xD;
      healthy adults undergoing a HIIT training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis will that a HIIT program will induce an improvement on physical&#xD;
      fitness, body composition, psychokinetic abilities and psychological responses compared to a&#xD;
      control group but this positive effect could be blunted by alcohol intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIIT-BEER will recruit 80 sedentary, healthy, adults (50% women) aged 18-40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be performed a 10-week controlled trial in which the effects of HIIT will be compared to&#xD;
      a control group without training. The effects of habitual intake of different alcoholic&#xD;
      beverage will be also compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the baseline measurements, the selected participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the control or the exercise training groups. The participants included in&#xD;
      the training groups will be asked to choose individual choice about their drinking preference&#xD;
      for alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages. The participants who chose alcohol intake will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into the training group with alcohol beer intake (5.4% Alcohol-Special&#xD;
      Alhambra®, Cervezas Alhambra, Spain) or to the sparkling water group with exactly the same&#xD;
      amount of distilled alcohol added. The distilled alcoholic beverage used for the&#xD;
      investigator's study will be vodka because of the purity of its composition (37.5% ethanol&#xD;
      and 62.5% water). The participants who chose non-alcoholic beverages will be randomized into&#xD;
      the training groups of non-alcohol beer (0.0% alcohol-Cruzcampo®, Heineken España) or&#xD;
      sparkling water (Eliges (IFA) Eliqua 2®, Font Salem, Spain) intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, eligible participants will be assigned to five groups: (i) a group that will performed&#xD;
      HIIT and will consumed 330 ml (women) or 2x300 ml (men) of beer with 5.4% alcohol (HIIT-AB,&#xD;
      n=16); (ii) a group that will performed HIIT and will consumed the same amount of beer&#xD;
      without alcohol (0.0%) (HIIT-NAB; n=16); (iii) a group that will performed HIIT and will&#xD;
      consumed the same amount of sparkling water (0.0%) (HIIT-W; n=16); (iv) a group that will&#xD;
      performed HIIT and will consumed sparkling water with the same amount of alcohol than the&#xD;
      pre-established beer (5.4%) (HIIT-ASW; n=16); and (v) a control group that will not perform&#xD;
      any physical training program (CON; n=16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beverage intakes will be programmed from Monday to Friday. There will not specific&#xD;
      recommendation for Saturday and Sunday, but the participants will be instructed to keep a&#xD;
      moderate alcohol during the weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory measures completed at baseline and 10 weeks later, include physical fitness&#xD;
      (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength), body composition, hearth rate variability&#xD;
      (HRV), reaction time, cognitive variables and health-related questionnaires. The&#xD;
      investigators will also obtain dietary habits data and cardiovascular disease risk factors.&#xD;
