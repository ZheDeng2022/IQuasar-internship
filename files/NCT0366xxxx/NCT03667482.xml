    <description>from 3 testing dose levels: 20, 40, and 60. Three patients will be enrolled at the dose level 0 of 40 mg. The dose escalation scheme is as follows:&#xD;
If none of the initial three patients at a given dose level experience DLT within 4 weeks, the next dose level will be studied.&#xD;
If one of the initial three patients at a given dose level experiences DLT, three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation will continue only if there is no additional DLT observed.If two or more patients experience DLT at a given dose, the previous dose level will be studied. Should two or more patients experience the DLT at the lowest dose level (20 mg), the study will be halted, and alternative dosing will be considered.&#xD;
4. The highest dose level with no more than one DLT among six patients will be declared as the MTD. If only three patients were treated at a dose under consideration as the MTD, an additional three patients will be treated at that level.</description>
