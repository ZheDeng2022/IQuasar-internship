  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Living with diabetes and other chronic (ongoing) conditions is common in older adults. These&#xD;
      individuals have poorer health and higher use of health services compared to older adults&#xD;
      with diabetes alone. Programs that help older adults self-manage their diabetes and other&#xD;
      health conditions benefit both individuals and the healthcare system. The McMaster University&#xD;
      Aging, Community and Health Research Unit developed and tested a new patient-centered,&#xD;
      community-based program (CPP) to improve the delivery and outcomes of care for older adults&#xD;
      with diabetes and other chronic conditions. This 6-month program was developed in partnership&#xD;
      with patients, caregivers, primary and community care providers and researchers. The program&#xD;
      is delivered by nurses, dietitians and community providers. It involves in-home or virtual&#xD;
      visits by nurses and dietitians, monthly group wellness sessions at community centers or&#xD;
      virtually, and monthly virtual team meetings. Wellness sessions include exercise, education,&#xD;
      and social support. Caregivers are invited to be active participants along with patients. The&#xD;
      program was successfully implemented in Ontario and Alberta. Participants who received the&#xD;
      program had better quality of life, self-management, and mental health at no additional cost&#xD;
      from a societal perspective compared to those receiving usual care. To determine how the&#xD;
      program can best help people, more testing is needed with different communities and groups of&#xD;
      people. We will partner with primary healthcare teams (e.g., family doctors' offices) in&#xD;
      three provinces to adapt and test the program in a variety of real-world settings. We will&#xD;
      assess how to best put this program into practice and measure outcomes important to patients&#xD;
      and caregivers so study results are relevant to them. Study findings will guide the&#xD;
      development of a plan for expanding the program to reach and benefit more older adults with&#xD;
      diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Patients and caregivers will be involved as key&#xD;
      partners in all aspects of the research.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the implementation and effectiveness of the CPP&#xD;
      intervention in new settings and populations to demonstrate widespread effectiveness and ways&#xD;
      to adapt CPP for diverse population subgroups and primary care setting and community care&#xD;
      contexts. Based on the investigator's previous work, we expect that the CPP intervention will&#xD;
      result in a greater improvement in mental health and will be cost neutral relative to usual&#xD;
      care because program costs will be offset by lower use of other health services. A&#xD;
      cross-jurisdictional, multi-site implementation-effectiveness type II hybrid randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be conducted. The trial will be conducted in two sites in each of&#xD;
      Ontario, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island. Each of the six sites will involve a primary care&#xD;
      setting and a community care organization. Study participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the intervention or usual care group. Participants randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group will be offered the 6-month CPP intervention in addition to their usual primary care&#xD;
      services offered by their local diabetes education centre or primary care setting. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of intervention effectiveness is patient mental health. Other health outcomes&#xD;
      for patients and their caregivers will be assessed (e.g., depression, anxiety, use of health&#xD;
      and social services etc.). Implementation will be examined in-detail through qualitative&#xD;
      evaluations with providers, patients and caregivers. Engagement of patients and caregivers&#xD;
      will occur in all stages of the research study. Qualitative evaluation of patients and&#xD;
      caregivers as research partners will be conducted through annual evaluations. Patient, Public&#xD;
      (e.g., caregivers, knowledge users) and Community (e.g., local providers/representatives)&#xD;
      Research Partners will be engaged in the research study by way of the study's established&#xD;
      governance structures: Community Advisory Boards, Patient Advisory Council, and Steering&#xD;
      Committee. Qualitative evaluation of Patient, Public and Community Research Partners will be&#xD;
      conducted to inform implementation of the CPP intervention at the local context and the&#xD;
      potential for widespread implementation and scale-up. Both quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      evaluations will be used to interpret study findings, and in the development of scale-up&#xD;
      plans.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mental Health Using the Short-Form 12 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2) - Mental health component</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short-Form 12 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2) tool will be used to assess change in mental health. The tool consists of 12 questions that measure functional health and well-being from the participant's perspective. It provides scores for eight health domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health), by which a psychometrically-based physical component summary and mental component summary can be calculated. Response options include the frequency of feeling a certain way or behaviour across 3 or 5 categories (e.g., 'all of the time'). Patients (and caregivers) will be evaluated for change in SF-12 - Mental health component. Total scale range: 0 - 100. Two items compose the mental health score with a range of 2 - 10. Higher scores represent a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptoms Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies on Depression 10-Item Scale (CES-D-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies on Depression 10-Item Scale (CES-D-10) will be used to assess change in depressive symptoms. This tool has been used in prior studies of older adults with mood disorders, has a high degree of reliability and validity, distinguishes between depressed and non-depressed people, and is a sensitive tool for measuring changes in depressive symptoms over time in psychiatric populations. Participants will be asked about the way they have felt or behaved in response to 10 statements such as 'I was happy'. Response options ask participants to select the frequency they have felt or behaved during the last week, ranging from 'rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)', 'some or a little of the time (1-2 days)', 'occasionally or moderate (3-4 days)', to 'most or all of the time (5-7 days)'. Patients and caregivers will be evaluated for change in depressive symptoms using CES-D-10. Scale range: 0 - 30. Higher scores represent more depressive symptoms.</description>
