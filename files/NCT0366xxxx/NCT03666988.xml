  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arginine methylation mediated by protein arginine methyl-transferases (PRMTs) is an important&#xD;
      post-translational modification of proteins involved in a diverse range of cellular&#xD;
      processes. Misregulation and overexpression of PRMT1 (a type I PRMT) has been associated with&#xD;
      a number of solid and hematopoietic cancers. GSK3368715 leads to inhibition of tumor cell&#xD;
      growth across tumor types with cytotoxic response observed in lymphoma, acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) and a subset of solid tumor cell lines. This study will assess the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), food effect and preliminary clinical activity&#xD;
      of GSK33368715 in participants with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and selected solid tumors with&#xD;
      frequent methyl-thioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficiency. The study will consist of two&#xD;
      parts. In Part 1 (Dose Escalation) escalating doses of GSK3368715 will be evaluated and&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be established in participants with selected solid&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory tumors. Once a RP2D is identified, a food effect sub-study will be&#xD;
      initiated to determine the effect of a high-fat, high calorie meal on the bioavailability of&#xD;
      GSK3368715. In Part 2 (Dose Expansion), this RP2D will be further investigated in two&#xD;
      expansion cohorts; participants with DLBCL (Expansion Cohort 2A) and relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors including pancreatic, bladder, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)(Expansion&#xD;
      Cohort 2B). The study includes a screening period, an intervention period and follow up.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is considered to be a DLT if the event is considered by the investigator to be clinically relevant and attributed (definitely, probably or possibly) to the study intervention during the DLT window (first 21 days of intervention, except for Venous thromboembolism (VTE)) and meets DLT criteria for non-hematologic and hematologic Toxicities.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment will be categorized as serious adverse event (SAE).</description>

             2B: The availability of archival tumor tissue, or willingness to undergo a fresh&#xD;
             biopsy to determine MTAP status (any archival tumor specimen must have been obtained&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to starting study drug unless approved by the study Medical&#xD;
             Monitor). Local MTAP or Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) results are&#xD;

             intervention(s) (example given [e.g.], 5 terminal half-lives) after the last dose of&#xD;
             study intervention. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
             contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. A WOCBP&#xD;
             must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine as required by local&#xD;
