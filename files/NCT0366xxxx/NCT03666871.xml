      A Comparative Study of Autologous CD4+ T Cells Genetically Modified at the CCR5 Gene by Zinc&#xD;
      Finger Nucleases SB-728 versus ex vivo Expanded Unmodified Autologous CD4+ T Cells in Treated&#xD;
      HIV-1 Infected Subjects&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing the effect of infusing expanded autologous CD4+&#xD;
      T cells with or without ex vivo modification of the CCR5 gene by zinc finger nucleases among&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with plasma HIV RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks and CD4+&#xD;
      T cell counts greater than 350 cells/µL. The main hypothesis is that the infusion of modified&#xD;
      CD4+ T cells will lead to a reduction in the size of the replication-competent HIV reservoir,&#xD;
      as measured by the quantitative virus outgrowth assay (QVOA) that is greater than that&#xD;
      resulting from infusion of unmodified CD4+ T cells. A total of 30 participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive one infusion of 0.5 - 4 x 1010 ex vivo expanded autologous CD4+ T cells&#xD;
      that have been either modified by transduction with a zinc finger nuclease designed to cleave&#xD;
      CCR5 (arm 1, n=20) or unmodified (arm 2, n=10). All participants will be pre-treated with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide at a dose of 1 g/m2 before infusion. The primary outcome measure will be the&#xD;
      change in the number of infectious units per million (IUPM) CD4+ T cells from study&#xD;
      enrollment to 24 months after infusion of expanded CD4+ T cells.&#xD;

             HIV RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks. Subjects who had intermittent&#xD;
             isolated episodes of detectable low-level viremia &lt;500 copies RNA/mL flanked by values&#xD;
             &lt;50 copies/mL will remain eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. On stable antiretroviral medication (no changes to treatment and no missed dose for &gt;7&#xD;
             continuous days within 4 weeks of screening) and willing to continue on current&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy, unless a change is medically indicated, for the duration of&#xD;
             the study. Note: Changes in formulation or a single within-class, single-agent change&#xD;
             are permitted in the last 48 weeks but not within 12 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women and persons born female regardless of gender identity with childbearing&#xD;
             potential. These participants are considered to be of childbearing potential if they&#xD;
             are postmenarchial, have an intact uterus and at least one ovary, and have had at&#xD;
             least one menstrual period in the past two years. Participants who have had a&#xD;
             documented bilateral tubal ligation or a hysterectomy are not considered to be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous gene therapy using an integrating vector. NOTE: For the purposes of the&#xD;
             TRAILBLAZER protocol, only therapies that a) are expected to modify the host genome&#xD;
             durably or broadly, and b) are delivered using a vector defined by FDA as having a&#xD;
             propensity for integration or the potential for latency/reactivation meet this&#xD;
             exclusion criterion. The following are examples of products and vectors that DO NOT&#xD;
             meet this exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plasmid DNA products&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  RNA products&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poxvirus-vectored products&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adenovirus-vectored products&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Replication-negative adeno-associated virus-vectored products&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccines that use one of these delivery&#xD;
                  mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin, DMSO and&#xD;
             Dextran 40).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. An antiretroviral regimen including maraviroc or any CCR5 inhibitor within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Presence or absence of the following exclusion criteria will be assessed at screening,&#xD;
             but participants who develop any of these criteria at any time between screening and&#xD;
             the planned infusion time will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Acute or chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as a positive plasma HCV RNA using any&#xD;
             FDA-approved qualitative or quantitative test in a participant with a positive HCV&#xD;
             antibody (HCV RNA testing is not required in participants with a negative HCV&#xD;
             antibody) at screening. Participants who have completed a course of antiviral&#xD;
             treatment for hepatitis C and have a confirmed plasma HCV RNA level below the limit of&#xD;
             detection of the assay 12 weeks or longer after completion of therapy will be&#xD;
             eligible. Note: Individuals that have undetectable HCV RNA in the absence of treatment&#xD;
             that cleared infection spontaneously are also considered eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acute or chronic hepatitis B infection, defined as a positive HBV surface antigen or a&#xD;
             positive HBV DNA at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any prior AIDS-defining condition within the past 5 years, except a history of CD4+ T&#xD;
             cell count below 200 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: The terms &quot;AIDS encephalopathy&quot; and &quot;wasting syndrome&quot; are often recorded on&#xD;
             medical records to indicate constellations of signs and symptoms that may not formally&#xD;
             meet the current diagnostic criteria for AIDS-related dementia or AIDS-associated&#xD;
             wasting syndrome, respectively. Therefore, the principal investigators will determine&#xD;
             whether in their opinion, a reported history of these conditions truly corresponds to&#xD;
             an AIDS-defining syndrome meeting this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any active cancer or malignancy within the past 5 years, with the exception of&#xD;
             successfully treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or low-grade (0&#xD;
             or 1) anal or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Diagnosis of New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade 3 or 4 congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             uncontrolled angina or uncontrolled arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec (by any formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History or any features on physical examination indicative of a bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of chronic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immune-modulating agents (e.g.,&#xD;
             interleukin-2, interferon-alpha or gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating factors,&#xD;
             etc.) within 30 days prior to screening or for any period extending to within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to the planned infusion date.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Use of inhaled or topical steroids is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Breastfeeding or pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Continued need for use of aspirin, warfarin or any other medication likely to affect&#xD;
             platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation significantly that cannot be&#xD;
             held during the 7-day period prior to each of the leukapheresis procedures (or&#xD;
             tissue/CSF sampling procedures for participating subjects) or that maintains&#xD;
             biological activity beyond 7 days after discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Presence at screening of a serious and persistent illness requiring a new systemic&#xD;
             treatment expected to last beyond the planned date of infusion and/or hospitalization&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to the planned date of infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: A participant who has required a hospital admission within the 30 days prior to&#xD;
             infusion may be allowed to proceed if, in the judgement of the principal&#xD;
             investigators, the condition requiring admission has resolved completely and is not&#xD;
             expected to recur or worsen during study participation. Examples include scenarios&#xD;
             such as: a removed kidney stone; inpatient hydration for food poisoning; observation&#xD;
             for atypical chest pain; a minor traumatic injury; etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Planned or actual vaccine administration within 4 weeks prior to infusion. Note:&#xD;
             Receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine authorized under an FDA EUA, in general, should not&#xD;
             disqualify potential participants. Vaccination should be avoided in the 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to and after the administration of cyclophosphamide. In addition, vaccination should&#xD;
             be avoided 2 weeks prior to study leukapheresis or large volume blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the investigator may compromise the safety&#xD;
             of the participant or interfere with study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Current use of zidovudine within 30 days of planned infusion of cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Current active chronic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis or non-alcoholic&#xD;
             steatohepatitis) within 30 days of study enrollment. Note: In addition, for the&#xD;
             purpose of the TRAILBLAZER clinical trial, chronic active liver disease means a&#xD;
             confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis of the liver or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with&#xD;
             elevated liver transaminases (confirmed) above the upper limit of normal. The presence&#xD;
             of fat (steatosis or NAFLD) in the liver by imaging (in the absence of indication of&#xD;
             disease, e.g., elevated transaminases) is not a contraindication to enrollment in the&#xD;
             trial. Individuals diagnosed with fatty liver disease that have normal transaminases&#xD;
             may be permitted to enroll in the study. The use of FDA approved medications to treat&#xD;
             chronic fatty liver disease is a contraindication to enrollment. The use of non-FDA&#xD;
             approved interventions, vitamins or supplements is not a contraindication to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. A history of urinary outflow obstruction as documented by a history of enlarged&#xD;
             prostate on physical exam, use of medications to treat outflow obstruction (e.g.,&#xD;
             tamsulosin), or elevated urinary residual volume. Note: urinary outflow obstruction is&#xD;
             defined as requiring placement of a drainage catheter to relieve a urinary&#xD;
             obstruction. Documented enlargement of the prostate in the absence of urinary&#xD;
             obstruction is not a contraindication to enrollment in the trial. The use of FDA&#xD;
             approved medications to treat urinary frequency (e.g., tamsulosin) in the absence of&#xD;
             proven urinary obstruction is not a contraindication to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. A history of active or latent tuberculosis, regardless of treatment history.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Individuals with limited antiretroviral treatment options (less than 2 new classes) by&#xD;
             history because of prior known resistance mutations to antiretrovirals. Note:&#xD;
             Investigators should consider prior treatment history for HIV and known resistance&#xD;
             mutations to ensure that a potential participant has an acceptable alternative&#xD;
             treatment regimen should they develop treatment failure while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Inability, in the opinion of the investigator, to avoid potential exposure to Covid-19&#xD;
             in the two weeks after the receipt of cyclophosphamide. Note: Participants may go out&#xD;
             into public to conduct essential activities but will be strongly encouraged to wear a&#xD;
             mask, use appropriate social distancing and hand hygiene when going outside their home&#xD;
             during that 14 day interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the clinical investigator or sponsor,&#xD;

             Minor procedures involving only the anal canal such as condyloma ablations,&#xD;
             hemorrhoidectomy, and anoscopy are permitted if cleared by the responsible surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Abnormalities of the colorectal mucosa, or significant colorectal symptoms, which in&#xD;
             the opinion of the clinician represent a contraindication to biopsy (including but not&#xD;
             limited to presence of any unresolved injury, infectious or inflammatory condition of&#xD;
             the local mucosa).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For participants in the lymph node biopsy program at sites doing open biopsies only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. BMI greater than 35 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Anatomical condition that would prevent surgical access to either inguinal area, such&#xD;
             as scar tissue, active skin condition affecting the area, or foreign material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known hypersensitivity to local anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Contraindication for the use of epinephrine-containing local anesthetic formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of pacemaker, implantable defibrillator, or other medical device thought to&#xD;
             be susceptible to electromagnetic interference from electrocautery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For participants in the lymph node biopsy program at sites doing lymph node aspirates only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anatomical condition that would prevent surgical access to either inguinal area, such&#xD;
             as scar tissue, active skin condition affecting the area, or foreign material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known hypersensitivity to local anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Contraindication for the use of epinephrine-containing local anesthetic formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For participants in the CSF sampling program only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any condition that could prevent access to the subarachnoid space or obscure the&#xD;
             anatomical landmarks for lumbar puncture, such as scar tissue, active skin condition&#xD;
             affecting the area, or foreign material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known hypersensitivity to local anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known space-occupying central nervous system lesion, unless cleared by the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
