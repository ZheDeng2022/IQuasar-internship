    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 way crossover, open-label study of the effect of&#xD;
      multiple-dose PF 04965842 on single-dose OC PK in healthy female subjects. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. A total of 16 healthy female subjects (8 in each&#xD;
      treatment sequence) will be enrolled in the study. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Treatment Sequence 1, Period 1 Day 1, subjects will be dosed with a single administration&#xD;
      of OC in the form of 1 PORTIA (ethyinyl estradiol [EE] and levonorgestrel [LN]) or equivalent&#xD;
      tablet, orally. OC (EE and LN) PK will then be assessed at pre dose and over 48 hours after&#xD;
      OC dosing. Period 1 will be immediately followed by Period 2 with no washout. The 48 hours&#xD;
      post-OC dose PK sample for Period 1 must be collected prior to receiving the first dose of PF&#xD;
      04965842 in Period 2. In Period 2, subjects will be dosed with 200 mg PF 04965842 PO QD for 9&#xD;
      days followed by administration of a single dose of OC oral tablet immediately after&#xD;
      administration of a 200 mg dose of PF-04965842 on the morning of Day 10. OC PK in Period 2&#xD;
      will be assessed at pre dose and over 48 hours after OC dosing. Dosing with 200 mg PF&#xD;
      04965842 PO QD will continue until Day 11.&#xD;

      days followed by administration of a single dose of OC oral tablet immediately after&#xD;
      administration of a 200 mg dose of PF-04965842 on the morning of Day 10. OC PK will be&#xD;

      QD will continue until Day 11. Subjects will then undergo a washout period of at least 10&#xD;
      days (Day -1 of Period 2 starts 10 days after Day 12 of Period 1). In Period 2 subjects will&#xD;
      be dosed with a single OC administration on Day 1. OC PK will then be assessed at pre dose&#xD;
      and over 48 hours after OC dose.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Natural log transformed AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax of EE and LN will be analyzed separately using a mixed effect model with sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects and subject within sequence as a random effect. Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test Reference) and corresponding 90% CIs will be obtained from the model. The adjusted mean differences and 90% CIs for the differences will be exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios. OC (EE and LN) alone will be the Reference treatment, while the OC (EE and LN) coadministered with PF 04965842 will be the Test treatment.&#xD;
The absent of an effect of PF 04965842 on OC (EE and LN) will be concluded if the lower bound of 90% confidence interval for the ratio of adjusted geometric mean for AUCinf is â‰¥80%.</intervention_model_description>
