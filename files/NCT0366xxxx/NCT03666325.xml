  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Squamous Cell Cancer (Cscc, 25%) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC; 75%) are the major&#xD;
      subtypes of non-melanoma skin cancer. Most cSCC arise in the head and neck region because it&#xD;
      is frequently exposed to sunlight and its ensuing UV radiation-induced DNA damage, which is&#xD;
      the major etiologic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets for patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic squamous Cell Cancer of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial progress has recently been made in the development of immunotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of cancer. In particular, the treatment with pembrolizumab alone or in conjunction&#xD;
      with an anti epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agent may reverse this condition, so&#xD;
      performing radical surgery. Finally, the adjunct of an anti EGFR agent as cetuximab could&#xD;
      reverse the primary and secondary resistance to pembrolizumab, with a synergistic effect able&#xD;
      to counteract pathway redundancy (i.e. the presence of several concurrent pathways which need&#xD;
      to be addressed together) and boosting T cell priming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, there is rationale to combine cetuximab with pembrolizumab in order to increase its&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous squamous cell cancers (cSCC) increase in incidence in recent years. Prognosis of&#xD;
      these tumors is generally favorable, with most of the patients cured with local therapies,&#xD;
      except from a small percentage (less than 10% of the cases) with recurrence not amenable to&#xD;
      surgery or radiation or with distant metastasis. There are only limited clinical risk factors&#xD;
      able to discriminate an aggressive lesion at its presentation (size &gt; 2cm, perineural&#xD;
      invasion (PNI) or beyond subcutaneous tissues). The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)&#xD;
      added aggressive features of cSCC that lead to upstaging the disease and are associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of recurrence or metastasis, including invasion of bone, or presence of at&#xD;
      least two high-risk factors such as poor differentiation, PNI, invasion greater than 2 mm,&#xD;
      occurrence at a high-risk site (i.e., ear or lip), or Clark level greater than or equal to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreatable recurrences are most frequently localized in the head and neck area (80% of&#xD;
      cases) and they are often disfiguring, while metastasis may involve lymph nodes, lungs, liver&#xD;
      or bone. The probability of metastasis in SCC of the skin varies between 2% and 10% depending&#xD;
      on the series and on the risk factors considered. Chemotherapy is reserved to cases of&#xD;
      recurrence or distant metastasis, with palliative intent. The most commonly used drug&#xD;
      combinations are cisplatin-based, in combination with bleomycin, methotrexate,&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, anthracycline or with cis-retinoic acid and interferon alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, clinical responses are limited, so underlining the medical need existing with&#xD;
      recurrent SCCs of the skin not amenable to local therapy or with metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of immunosuppression is well-known in the pathogenesis of skin SCCs; however, only&#xD;
      limited evidence exists about the possibility to treat this disease through the restoration&#xD;
      of an immune activity against cancer cells. In this regard, there is the need to acquire more&#xD;
      information about the expression and the role of the PD-L1:PD1 pathway in skin SCCs, being&#xD;
      one of the most attractive in cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, immuno-oncologic agents targeting checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed death&#xD;
      receptor-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1 are very promising new anti-cancer drugs, while&#xD;
      efficacy correlates with PD-L1 expression in various tumor types. In order to provide a&#xD;
      translational basis for the possible use of PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors in cSCC, Sharper et al&#xD;
      examined the expression pattern of PD-L1 in tumor cells and tumor infiltrating leukocytes&#xD;
      (TILs) as well as the proportion of CD8+ T- cells and correlated these findings with&#xD;
      clinic-pathological characteristics of patients. Utilizing a cut-off â‰¥ 5%, 10.3% tumors and&#xD;
      42.7% of TILs were PD-L1 positive. The severity of inflammation was positively correlated&#xD;
      with PD-L1 expression in both tumor and TILs and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was&#xD;
      associated with the presence of intratumoral CD8+ cells. Additionally, the location of the&#xD;
      tumor had an impact on PD- L1 expression: cSCC located in sun-exposed areas (66.2%) showed a&#xD;
      higher expression of PD-L1 in TILs compared to cSCC excised in no sun-exposed areas of the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herbst et al. recently showed in multiple cancer types that a response to treatment with a&#xD;
      PD- L1 inhibitor was observed especially when PD-L1 was expressed by TILs, therefore the&#xD;
      expression of PD-L1 in the majority of TILs in cSCC provides a preclinical rationale for the&#xD;
      use of PD-1 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of EGFR in skin SCCs is shown to be&#xD;
      more than 80%. However, given the paucity of recurrent/metastatic lesions analyzed, only a&#xD;
      small amount of data in this setting exists. Primary lesions associated with subsequent&#xD;
      metastasis have been shown to more likely overexpress EGFR in comparison with not recurring&#xD;
      lesions. Therefore, this pathway represents a potentially valuable target for the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced disease. Moreover, HER2 expression is common in skin SCC, being reported with&#xD;
      high rates, even if in small studies. Coexpression of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 is present in skin&#xD;
      SCCs but not in normal skin and it could be associated with the malignant phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-EGFR therapy in cSCC has been explored in phase II trials, with cetuximab and&#xD;
      panitumumab in unresectable or metastatic setting, with gefitinib in potentially curable&#xD;
      disease and in other case reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR-TKI gefitinib was shown to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in both EGFR-TKIs sensitive&#xD;
      and acquired resistant non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, so providing a novel&#xD;
      anti-tumor mechanism for the combination of EGFR-TKIs and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being the responses to cetuximab alone are limited and not durable, there is the need to&#xD;
      enhance response rate and secondarily duration of responses. There are suggestions for a&#xD;
      possible role of anti-EGFR agent in tackling resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. In fact,&#xD;
      suppression of EGFR signalling decreases PD-L1 overexpression on tumoral cells (possible&#xD;
      mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy), so reducing the immune escape process. Moreover,&#xD;
      activation of EGFR pathway is involved in suppressing the immune response through activation&#xD;
      of Tregs or reducing the level of T cell chemoattractants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody employed in patients with unresectable locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic cSCC showed activity and a tolerable profile of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patient will be treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First evaluation: After 9 weeks since treatment start the patient will be evaluated&#xD;
      clinically and radiologically, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of disease control (SD/PR/CR), the patient will continue to receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      alone and after 6 weeks will be evaluated clinically and radiologically, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of disease progression at the first evaluation, in order to avoid disease&#xD;
      pseudo-progression, the patient will repeat an evaluation (confirmatory) after at least 4&#xD;
      weeks; if PD confirmed, then the patient will receive cetuximab (400 mg/sm loading dose, then&#xD;
      250 mg/sm day 1,8 and 15 of a 3-week schedule) in addition to pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second and following evaluations: After the first evaluation, every restaging will be&#xD;
      performed every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of disease response (PR/CR), the patient will continue to receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of stable disease or progression, the patient will repeat an evaluation after at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks (confirmatory); in case of confirmed stability or PD, the patient will receive&#xD;
      cetuximab (400 mg/sm loading dose, then 250 mg/sm day 1,8 of a 3-week schedule) in addition&#xD;
      to pembrolizumab, in order to reverse the primary lack of response to the immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of progression after an initial disease response, the patient will receive cetuximab&#xD;
      (400 mg/sm loading dose, then 250 mg/sm day 1,8, 15 of a 3-week schedule) in addition to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, in order to reverse the acquired resistance to the immunotherapeutic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 weeks of combination treatment (pembrolizumab + cetuximab) a first&#xD;
      clinical/radiological assessment will be performed. In case of lack of response (PR or CR),&#xD;
      another assessment will be performed within 4 weeks. In case of confirmed lack of response&#xD;
      during the combination treatment the patient will be permanently discontinued from study, as&#xD;
      the balance of possible treatment toxicities against its lack of efficacy is no more&#xD;
      favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will be conducted according to the ir-RECIST Partial response will be considered&#xD;
      at any time according to ir-RECIST with a reduction â‰¥50% in tumor burden compared with the&#xD;
      first assessment at study entry for each treatment schedule. The first 6 patients treated&#xD;
      with the combination of pembrolizumab and cetuximab will be treated within a safety run-in&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety run-in cohort will include 6 subjects treated with 250 mg/sm (after loading dose&#xD;
      400 mg/sm) IV infusion of weekly cetuximab plus standard-dose pembrolizumab. These first 6&#xD;
      patients will be followed for 4 weeks for dose limiting toxicities (DLT) before enrolling&#xD;
      additional patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a DLT will be observed in no more than 1 of 6 patients, the trial will continue with&#xD;
      enrolling subjects to the remainder of the phase II portion of the study. Otherwise, 6&#xD;
      additional patients will be enrolled at dose level -1 (200 mg/sm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no more than one DLT will be observed, then phase II will enroll patients at dose level -1&#xD;
      (200 mg) for the total expected number of accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a DLT will be observed in more than 1 of 6 patients, 6 additional patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at dose level -2 (150 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no more than one DLT will be observed with this dose level, then phase II will enroll&#xD;
      patients at dose level -2 (150 mg) for the total expected number of accrual. Otherwise the&#xD;
      combination of the 2 drugs will be considered unfeasible in such a disease population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To consolidate these safety data, after 6 patients will have completed treatment at the&#xD;
      specific dose without more than one DLT, other 6 patients will be analyzed for safety&#xD;
      purpose, without the need to stop enrollment. In case 3 or more DLTs will globally happen in&#xD;
      the 12 treated patients, then the trial will continue to enroll 6 additional patients at the&#xD;
      inferior dose level with the above reported rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective(s) &amp; Hypothesis(es):&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Objective: Increase in cumulative response rate (PR + CR) obtained by single agent or by&#xD;
      combination strategy (pembrolizumab alone or with pembrolizumab + EGFR inhibiting agent) in&#xD;
      respect to monotherapy with anti-EGFR agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: this approach will be considered effective if the cumulative response rate is at&#xD;
      least 45%, with an increase of 17% with respect to previous study with cetuximab in the same&#xD;
      setting of disease, in which a response rate of 28% was shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s) &amp; Hypothesis(es)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance to the treatment and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease control (SD + PR + CR) as best response obtained by single agent or by&#xD;
           combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients initially not considered for surgery due to difficulty to obtain&#xD;
           a curative treatment that undergo surgery after the treatment (pembrolizumab alone or&#xD;
           pembrolizumab + anti EGFR agent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reversal of acquired resistance to pembrolizumab obtained through the addition of&#xD;
           cetuximab (percentage of responding patients after cetuximab adjunct) 4.3 Exploratory&#xD;
           Objective Translational research (TR): In skin cancers performing paired biopsies is&#xD;
           relatively easy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to consent to analysis of tissue and to receive additional biopsies at&#xD;
      time of anti EGFR agent introduction; if possible, another biopsy at time of combined therapy&#xD;
      resistance will be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TR includes: - evaluation of PD-L1 expression in skin SCC and of PD1 on CD8 T cells at&#xD;
      baseline , - evaluation of PD-L1 and PD1 modulation during treatment, -evaluation of PDL-1&#xD;
      and PD-1 in TILs at the baseline and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of the presence of HPV genotype on tumor sample through viral DNA and RNA&#xD;
           detection by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of pharmacodynamic changes of potential markers in course of therapy, and&#xD;
           their association with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the study will involve a multi-omic approach with analysis of gene-expression,&#xD;
      miRNA, methylation and CGH profiling, completed by next generation &quot;amplicon sequencing&quot;, by&#xD;
      means of Ion Torrent, detecting with high sensitivity mutations and polymorphisms of&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with prognosis and with response to the whole treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a bio-banking of FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ) tissues and of blood&#xD;
      will be performed, as this part of the analysis has not been funded yet. A separate consent&#xD;
      will be requested for additional biopsies and for bio-banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-pembrolizumab and pre-cetuximab biopsies will be compared in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      changes in microenvironment and tumoral pharmacodynamic markers.&#xD;
