    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is the elimination of two neglected tropical diseases&#xD;
      (NTD):&#xD;
&#xD;
      soil-transmitted helminthiasis and rabies. The specific objective of this pilot study was:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the integrated delivery platform improved the cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      coverage of MDA targeting STH and rabies;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators integrated two public health initiatives: 1) a mass drug administration&#xD;
      (MDA) effort to eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTD) caused by soil-transmitted&#xD;
      helminths (STH), with 2) a community-valued mass dog rabies vaccination (MDRV) intervention&#xD;
      to eliminate human and animal rabies, also a priority NTD of the World Health Organisation.&#xD;
      The goal of MDA efforts targeting STH is to reduce worm burdens to very low levels below&#xD;
      which self-sustaining transmission, and the public health consequences of STH, cease.&#xD;
      Existing school-based delivery programs fail to reach all affected age groups, however, which&#xD;
      results in ineffective coverage levels and persistence of STH. The goal of MDRV is to&#xD;
      immunize 70% of dog populations, after which canine-mediated rabies is eliminated. MDRV&#xD;
      programs are typically very popular, with all human age groups participating. The objectives&#xD;
      of this project were to determine whether supplementing a strictly school-based MDA NTD&#xD;
      control program with a community-wide strategy that is coupled to an MDRV program will result&#xD;
      in a synergism that (a) improves coverage, reach and cost-effective delivery of MDA targeting&#xD;
      STH and (b) improves coverage and cost-effective delivery of dog vaccination. To achieve&#xD;
      this, research activities, comprised of post-intervention household questionnaire surveys,&#xD;
      were carried out. In addition detailed cost data was collected.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out in the Ngorongoro District, Tanzania inhabited by semi-nomadic&#xD;
      Maasai people. The remote area was chosen because MDRV and MDA are carried out annually in&#xD;
      the region as separate programs. The MDA program delivers twice yearly deworming treatment to&#xD;
      every primary school and is coordinated by the District Medical Office (DMO). The MDRV&#xD;
      program vaccinates dogs annually and is coordinated by the District Veterinary Office. The&#xD;
      MDA and MDRV carried out in this study constituted one cycle of the established MDA and MDRV&#xD;
      in the target villages. The study took place between February and October 2016, however&#xD;
      activities were suspended during the rainy season to avoid inclement weather from affecting&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study focused on 24 villages. The target villages were located within the eight wards&#xD;
      immediately surrounding the district's administrative centre and were selected through&#xD;
      convenience. Each of the 24 villages were randomly assigned to one of three arms: i) Arm A (n&#xD;
      = 8) received both MDA and MDRV; ii) Arm B (n = 8) received MDA only; iii) Arm C (n = 8)&#xD;
      received MDRV only. All villages were equally likely to be assigned to each arm. As per the&#xD;
      established MDA and MDRV programs, a nurse from the DMO and two village-based community&#xD;
      health workers carried out the MDA whilst a rabies field team (a veterinarian, two field&#xD;
      staff and a ward-based person) delivered the MRDV. STH and / or rabies awareness information&#xD;
      was provided to respondents in the form of verbal disease avoidance advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Villages in this region cover a large area, and all are divided into sub-village units. Each&#xD;
      intervention ('event') was delivered at the level of the sub-village using a 'central-point'&#xD;
      strategy, which required villagers to travel from their homes to the central-point event to&#xD;
      receive treatment. Village leaders estimated that hosting each sub-village event for one day&#xD;
      would provide sufficient time for villagers to attend. Consequently each event was scheduled&#xD;
      to last for one day, and the number of days the team(s) spent in each village equalled the&#xD;
      number of sub-villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A events comprised an MDA and a MDRV clinic hosted concurrently, while Arm B and Arm C&#xD;
      events comprised only one clinic (MDA or MDRV, respectively). For Arm A villages, the MDA and&#xD;
      MDRV delivery teams travelled together in one vehicle and set up the clinics close to each&#xD;
      other. For Arm B and C villages, the MDA and MDRV teams travelled separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to allow comparison of the MDA with school-based delivery (second objective) the&#xD;
      events were all hosted during the school term. In sub-villages with a primary school, the&#xD;
      clinics were positioned outside the school grounds, whilst in sub-villages that did not have&#xD;
      a primary school the clinics were located in a central location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inform each community of the event, a village-wide meeting was convened one week before.&#xD;
      Key information provided at the meeting included STH and / or rabies awareness information&#xD;
      and the importance of controlling these conditions through MDA and MDRV, the date of each&#xD;
      clinic, that treatment would be given free of charge, and that people and dogs of all ages&#xD;
      were invited to attend. On the Sunday prior to a village event, a motorbike rider with a&#xD;
      loudspeaker drove around each village announcing the event details. Additionally the DMO&#xD;
      informed the head teacher of each primary school of the date that the event would be convened&#xD;
      outside of the school grounds. At 0830 hours the clinic(s) would be set up in the&#xD;
      predetermined location and the treatment teams would wait for villagers to arrive. People&#xD;
      coming to the MDA clinic were registered and research data collected. Following this,&#xD;
      children between 12 and 59 months were given an oral dose of mebendazole (500mg) and vitamin&#xD;
      A (100,000 IU), whilst people over 59 months were given an oral dose of albendazole (400mg).&#xD;
      Following arrival and registration at the MDRV clinics, dogs were vaccinated (Nobivac&#xD;
      RabiesÂ®, MSD Animal Health, Boxmeer, Netherlands), a collar placed around the neck and&#xD;
      water-soluble purple coloured paint was applied to both flanks. People attending the combined&#xD;
      clinic (Arm A) who had also brought dogs were instructed to visit the MDRV clinic after&#xD;
      receiving deworming treatment. The events ended at 1630 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household participation and coverage - community perceptions and knowledge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-intervention household questionnaire survey (HQS) targeting 30 randomly selected&#xD;
      households per village (stratified across sub-villages) was carried out within one week of&#xD;
      each intervention to determine the proportion of households, people and dogs that attended&#xD;
      the clinics. No households declined to participate, however if the family were not at home&#xD;
      the team moved onto the next household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coverage of school-aged children and others:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the percentage of treated primary school age children (7 - 13 years) that were&#xD;
      enrolled or not in school, or were attending or not attending school on the day of the&#xD;
      clinic, every person treated was asked whether they were enrolled and attending primary&#xD;
      school that day and, if they attended primary school, which primary school they attended.&#xD;
      Every participant was also asked their age, which allowed analysis of other age groups&#xD;
      treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi squared tests were used to determine whether household participation and coverage were&#xD;
      impacted by delivery strategy. A logistic regression model (logit family) was used to&#xD;
      determine whether the proportion of children enrolled in primary school in each village was&#xD;
      dependent on the presence of a school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison with the national school-based deworming program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether delivery strategy and clinic location (outside of school grounds with&#xD;
      the whole community invited (this study) or within the schools with treatment given only to&#xD;
      enrolled school children (NSDP)) impacted the number of school children that received&#xD;
      deworming treatment, a paired comparison at ten village primary schools was made. To allow&#xD;
      comparison, the number of primary school children treated in the previous NSDP round of&#xD;
      deworming treatment was obtained for each of the ten schools from the Ngorongoro District NTD&#xD;
      Coordinator and compared with the number of registered children treated in this study in the&#xD;
      same schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A generalized linear mixed model, with 'school name' as a random effect, was used to compare&#xD;
      the proportion of primary school children treated by the NSDP and this study in each&#xD;
      comparison school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration and delivery costs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic administration and delivery (A&amp;D) costs were collected for all 24 villages, including&#xD;
      variable costs (per dose delivered, by dose type) and fixed costs (per clinic, by clinic&#xD;
      type). Expense categories included: Advertising, Equipment, Incentive payments to village&#xD;
      leaders, Labour Costs (team salaries and wage labour for local help), Living (lodging)&#xD;
      Allowance, Per Diem for the team, Meeting Costs, Vehicle Fuel, Repairs and Service,&#xD;
      Communication (telephone credits), and Other. Other included a variety of miscellaneous costs&#xD;
      that do not fit under any other category, such as incidental taxi and transportation costs&#xD;
      and team health treatment. Costs attributable to research-related activities were not&#xD;
      included in A&amp;D costs. Indirect costs (time, foregone opportunities) borne by households to&#xD;
      attend the event (described above) were not included in A&amp;D costs. For accounting purposes,&#xD;
      fixed costs not attributable to a specific clinic type were allocated equally across all&#xD;
      events. Fixed costs attributable to either MDRV or MDA were attributed equally across all&#xD;
      rabies or deworming events, respectively. Because there were two clinics for each Arm A&#xD;
      event, the unattributable fixed cost per clinic was half that of Arm B and C. Variable costs&#xD;
      per clinic were calculated as per-dose purchase costs multiplied by the number of doses&#xD;
      delivered. Per-dose purchase costs were $0.021 (44 Tanzanian Shillings [Tsh]) per deworming&#xD;
      dose and $0.26 (520 Tsh) per rabies vaccination. The exchange rate for cost calculations was&#xD;
      2,100 Tsh per U.S. Dollar, approximately the exchange rate that prevailed from mid-2015&#xD;
      through 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average cost per dose (A&amp;D) was calculated in two ways. Method 1 calculates the total&#xD;
      cost over all clinics (by clinic type and Arm) divided by the total number of doses delivered&#xD;
      (by clinic type and Arm), and represents the aggregate cost per dose for a given clinic&#xD;
      category. Method 2 calculates cost per dose on a per clinic basis, and then averages over all&#xD;
      clinics. Both methods provide valid measures of cost per dose (A&amp;D), but provide different&#xD;
      estimates, because the average of a ratio (Method 2) is not equivalent to the ratio of&#xD;
      averages or totals (Method 1). Method 1 is useful as an aggregate measure over all clinics,&#xD;
      but cannot be used to test for statistical differences across clinic categories because it is&#xD;
      not calculated on a per clinic basis. Method 2 allows testing for statistical differences&#xD;
      across clinic types, but represents a summary statistic for clinic-level cost per dose&#xD;
      measure rather than an aggregate measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-sample parametric and non-parametric tests were used to test for differences in cost per&#xD;
      dose between Arms A and B, and Arms A and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Travel time to attend clinics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand which mode of transport was most commonly used, respondents were asked how they&#xD;
      travelled to the clinic (foot, carried (e.g. infants), bike, car, etc.). To estimate the mean&#xD;
      time (t Ì_1) a respondent took attending a combined or single event, respondents were asked&#xD;
      how long it took in minutes to reach the events. In addition, the mean amount of time a&#xD;
      respondent spent at a clinic (t Ì_2) and, for the integrated delivery (Arm A) the mean time&#xD;
      spent travelling between the two clinics (t Ì_3), was measured. These estimates were then&#xD;
      used to compare the overall time spent attending single and integrated events. To estimate&#xD;
      the overall time a respondent spent attending a single clinic (Arm B or C, or Arm A if no dog&#xD;
      was brought for vaccination) (T_s) we multiplied the mean travel time by two (for the out and&#xD;
      return journey) and added the mean time spent at a clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T_s=(t Ì_1 Ã 2)+ t Ì_2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the mean time a respondent spent attending a combined clinic (Arm A) (T_c ) we&#xD;
      multiplied the mean travel time by two and added the mean time spent at a clinic (multiplied&#xD;
      by two for deworming and dog vaccination) and the time spent travelling between the two&#xD;
      clinics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T_c=(t Ì_1Ã 2)+(t Ì_2Ã 2)+ t Ì_3.&#xD;
