  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is proven to increase the survival of patients with&#xD;
      respiratory failure, most commonly from diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD). At least 15 hours' usage per day is needed to improve mortality. Most&#xD;
      patients on LTOT utilise bulky oxygen concentrators (OC) which run on continuous Alternating&#xD;
      Current (AC) power. This intervention, however, limits patient mobility and social engagement&#xD;
      as patients are tethered to their device and confined to their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced physical activity levels have been shown in COPD patients to be associated with&#xD;
      reduced quality of life (QoL), increased admission rates to hospital and survival even after&#xD;
      adjustment for severity of COPD. Significant benefits stand to be made by improving physical&#xD;
      activity levels in LTOT patients. Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR), which is traditionally&#xD;
      conducted in a healthcare setting, is an established intervention that addresses this by&#xD;
      improving exercise tolerance but uptake and completion rates have been low due to reasons&#xD;
      such as cost and difficulty with transport. LTOT usage is also cited as an independent&#xD;
      barrier to PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the establishment of a 10-week home-based physiotherapy programme&#xD;
      as a novel community-centric and resource-lean intervention that seeks to improve the&#xD;
      physical activity level of LTOT patients. Patients will be prescribed an ambulatory oxygen&#xD;
      device and receive education on its usage in conjunction with a home exercise regimen which&#xD;
      includes a home visit and subsequent telephone support by a physiotherapist in partnership&#xD;
      with a community-based healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective pilot study of 30 patients is proposed. The outcome measures include mobility&#xD;
      function, activity levels, generic and disease-specific QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, our programme may revolutionize the approach to LTOT patients in Singapore and&#xD;
      improve their ability to function independently in the community greatly; in addition, the&#xD;
      reduction in hospital-based healthcare utilisation is greatly advantageous.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an investigator-initiated, prospective pilot study which aims to recruit 30&#xD;
      patients in total and conducted over 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims and Hypotheses: Utilisation of healthcare resources and burden of care on society&#xD;
      for LTOT patients is disproportionately high. The study investigators aim to describe this&#xD;
      group of patients and introduce an intervention that aims to promote quality living with a&#xD;
      home-based physiotherapy programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that the intervention of a home-based physiotherapy programme&#xD;
           together with a lightweight POC will improve physical activity level, reduce daily time&#xD;
           spent in sedentary activity, improve Quality of Life (QoL) and reduce symptoms of&#xD;
           anxiety and depression of patients on LTOT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the functional status of patients on LTOT and their caregivers - physical&#xD;
           activity levels, body mass index, psychological, socio-economic background, activities&#xD;
           of daily living (ADL) status&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the barriers to uptake of ambulatory oxygen in patients who fulfil criteria&#xD;
           for LTOT&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. As there is a lack of local data on the effectiveness and safety of a home-based&#xD;
           physiotherapy program, the study being conducted is a pilot study intended to establish&#xD;
           the feasibility of a home-based physiotherapy programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is an established medical intervention that has been&#xD;
           shown to prolong the survival of a select group of patients with respiratory failure (1,&#xD;
           2). Although local data on the incidence and prevalence of LTOT use in Singapore is&#xD;
           lacking, it has been reported in the Danish Oxygen Register that the annual incidence&#xD;
           and prevalence of LTOT use in 2010 was 32.2 and 48.1 per 100,000 inhabitants&#xD;
           respectively (3). Older studies have reported a LTOT prevalence of 28 per 100,000 in&#xD;
           1992 in the French Oxygen Register (4), LTOT incidence and prevalence of 7.1 and 24 per&#xD;
           100,000 respectively in 2000 in the Swedish Oxygen Register (5) and prevalence of LTOT&#xD;
           of 241 per 100,000 in the USA in 1994 (6). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)&#xD;
           is by far the main respiratory diagnosis in LTOT patients followed by other diseases&#xD;
           such as interstitial lung disease and bronchiectasis (7). In addition, the medical&#xD;
           literature has documented rising LTOT usage over the years due to reasons such as&#xD;
           increasing survival of COPD patients and increased physician and patient awareness of&#xD;
           the benefits of LTOT (8). The costs of LTOT have been recognised to be high, with an&#xD;
           estimated 800,000 patients in USA utilising LTOT at cost of approximately $1.4 billion&#xD;
           American dollars annually according to a 1995 publication by O'Donohue et al (9). Total&#xD;
           Medicare payments for LTOT in 1998 were reported to be USD 1.3 billion (10). A more&#xD;
           recent analysis of 329,482 Medicare beneficiaries with COPD who received oxygen from&#xD;
           2001 to 2010 found that 73,659 (22.4%) received oxygen therapy (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The majority of patients utilise oxygen concentrators (OC) (3,11) which typically run on&#xD;
           continuous AC power and weigh between 13-22kg. This intervention, although&#xD;
           life-prolonging, nonetheless limits patient mobility as patients are required to utilise&#xD;
           oxygen therapy for at least 15 hours a day to benefit. As a result, many patients become&#xD;
           confined in their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Indeed, patients with chronic respiratory disease requiring LTOT have been reported to&#xD;
           be severely limited in their physical activity. Studies of patients on LTOT have shown&#xD;
           that 46% of patients walk less than 600m per day (12) and up to 45% are house-bound&#xD;
           (13). While this may be due to low exercise tolerance, oxygen therapy may be a&#xD;
           contributory factor in itself as patients receiving oxygen from a stationary source&#xD;
           often become tethered their device over time. Although there are theoretical benefits to&#xD;
           improving exercise tolerance with oxygen therapy (14), it has been reported that&#xD;
           patients with severe COPD on LTOT have significantly reduced levels of domestic activity&#xD;
           compared with patients with COPD of similar severity but who were not on LTOT (15).&#xD;
           Patients with severe COPD and broadly similar health status on LTOT have also been&#xD;
           reported to be less independent on activities of daily living than those not requiring&#xD;
           LTOT (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Apart from reduced quality of life, reductions in daily activity levels have been shown&#xD;
           to be related to clinically relevant outcomes in COPD patients, such as reduced health&#xD;
           status (17), hospital admissions (18, 19) and survival (19) even after adjustment for&#xD;
           severity of COPD. Over the years, interest has shifted from improving exercise capacity&#xD;
           to increasing daily physical activity (20) which is defined as any bodily movement&#xD;
           produced by the contraction of skeletal muscles that increased energy expenditure (21).&#xD;
           In fact, it was found in a prospective cohort study of 170 outpatients with stable COPD&#xD;
           that objectively measured physical activity was the strongest predictor for all-cause&#xD;
           mortality in patients with COPD and that there was a linear association between physical&#xD;
           activity and mortality (22). Significant gains in quality of life and reduced&#xD;
           utilisation of healthcare stand to be made if the physical activity and mobility profile&#xD;
           of patients on LTOT can be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. An established intervention to improve the mobility and physical activity levels of LTOT&#xD;
           patients is Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR). PR is a structured, multidimensional and&#xD;
           multidisciplinary programme over time (at least 6 weeks) that comprises physical&#xD;
           training and breathing exercises supervised by a respiratory physiotherapist in&#xD;
           conjunction with education guided by objective tests of the respiratory system and&#xD;
           exercise capacity such as pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk test and&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary exercise testing. PR been shown to be cost-effective and beneficial in&#xD;
           improving shortness of breath, health status and exercise tolerance in patients of all&#xD;
           grades of COPD severity, including patients with chronic respiratory failure on LTOT&#xD;
           (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Although the benefits of PR are established, uptake and completion of PR is frequently&#xD;
           limited. The percentage of referred participants who did not attend PR at all ranged&#xD;
           from 8.3 to 49.6% in a systematic review (24). Many barriers have been cited, such as&#xD;
           low referral rates from healthcare providers (25) and low patient and healthcare&#xD;
           provider awareness of its availability and benefits. Usage of LTOT has also been found&#xD;
           to an independent predictor for non-attendance to PR (26). This is not surprising as&#xD;
           patients on LTOT face even greater difficulty than the average patient in participating&#xD;
           in PR due to challenges in being able to independently navigate the transportation&#xD;
           system to attend outpatient PR whilst on oxygen therapy. Another major barrier worth&#xD;
           mentioning is the lack of access from a combination of factors of geography, culture,&#xD;
           finances, transportation and other logistics (27, 28). This may be due to the fact that&#xD;
           PR is a healthcare-provider centric intervention that is traditionally conducted in a&#xD;
           healthcare institution in an outpatient or inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Locally in Singapore, patients face a financial disincentive towards participating in PR&#xD;
           in the outpatient setting as Medisave, the national medical savings scheme, imposes&#xD;
           limits on withdrawals for outpatient healthcare expenditure. Outpatient PR also imposes&#xD;
           hidden costs to the patient in the form of transportation and missed days at work for&#xD;
           family caregivers who accompany the patient for outpatient PR. Patients are often&#xD;
           accompanied by family caregivers or sponsors to healthcare visits in Singapore and the&#xD;
           lack of a caregiver to accompany patients for outpatient PR is an important cultural&#xD;
           barrier to PR. Inpatient PR in Singapore, on the other hand, is also limited in its&#xD;
           capacity to serve many patients due to the national strain on hospital beds. PR clearly&#xD;
           has its limitations as a modality in improving the poor physical activity levels of&#xD;
           patients on LTOT and a novel solution is needed that addresses the many barriers with PR&#xD;
           uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The investigators are therefore proposing the establishment of a home-based&#xD;
           physiotherapy programme as a novel community and patient-centric and resource-lean&#xD;
           intervention that seeks to improve the physical activity of LTOT patients. Patients will&#xD;
           be prescribed an ambulatory oxygen device and receive education on its usage in&#xD;
           conjunction with a home exercise regimen which would include a home visit by a&#xD;
           physiotherapist. It is hypothesised that home-based physiotherapy would be more&#xD;
           patient-centric compared to healthcare centre-based physiotherapy as realistic&#xD;
           rehabilitation goal settings and exercise regimens can be personalised to each patient's&#xD;
           unique home and community environment, lifestyle and care needs. The proposed&#xD;
           intervention would be similar to an 8-week home-based PR study recently conducted in the&#xD;
           UK which comprised 1 home visit and 7 once-weekly telephone calls from a physiotherapist&#xD;
           in the home-based intervention arm which found equivalent short-term outcomes (such as&#xD;
           exercise tolerance and dyspnoea-related quality of life) that were equivalent to&#xD;
           outpatient centre-based PR (29).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Ambulatory Oxygen (AO) is an important enabler in improving the mobility of patients on&#xD;
           LTOT in the community and therefore their participation in PR. However there remain many&#xD;
           barriers to the uptake of AO such as (i) lack of instruction on the usage of AO, and&#xD;
           particularly with regards to AO delivered via oxygen cylinders, (ii) fear of running out&#xD;
           of their AO supply while they were using it, (iii) embarrassment and (iv) difficulties&#xD;
           with carrying the AO supply (30).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. These barriers have led to low usage rates of AO via oxygen cylinder with only 39% of&#xD;
           patients using AO for more than 2 hours a week in a Danish study published in 1999 (31).&#xD;
           In the same study, it was reported that when patients had outdoor activity, the usage of&#xD;
           stationary oxygen fell by a couple of hours, resulting in lower overall oxygen usage.&#xD;
           This suggested that patients were spending a considerable time outside their home&#xD;
           without using their AO (31). In Italy where LTOT is almost exclusively provided by&#xD;
           liquid oxygen, it was reported that although most patients (84%) possessed an AO device,&#xD;
           only 40% declared that they used it daily with &quot;being ashamed of being seen by passersby&#xD;
           with a stroller&quot; being the principal barrier (7). Similar data was presented in a French&#xD;
           study which reported that most patients (630/930) used their oxygen only while resting&#xD;
           (32).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Compared to oxygen cylinders, AO delivered by lightweight Portable Oxygen Concentrator&#xD;
           (POC) has the advantages of being (i) user-friendly, (ii) aesthetically more pleasing&#xD;
           and is (iii) easily rechargeable with standard household electrical supply (33).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Such advantages will overcome some of the aforementioned barriers to AO usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. A prospective pilot study of 30 patients is proposed. Assessment of activity levels, QoL&#xD;
           and breathlessness will be measured before and after 10 weeks. The 2 components of the&#xD;
           proposed intervention, namely the home-based physiotherapy programme and the&#xD;
           prescription of a lightweight POC are synergistic in its effects. Supplemental oxygen&#xD;
           has been shown to improve exercise duration (34) and therefore rehabilitation while it&#xD;
           has been shown that effective use of oxygen was improved by follow-up education, whether&#xD;
           given by nurse or physiotherapist, after initiation of oxygen therapy (32). It has been&#xD;
           shown that the prescription of AO alone does not automatically assure good adherence to&#xD;
           the prescribed treatment or use of AO outdoors (30). The guidance from the home-based&#xD;
           physiotherapy programme will comprise of a home visit by a physiotherapist with the aim&#xD;
           of reinforcing compliance and usage of AO outside the house, thereby improving the&#xD;
           patients' mobility over simply prescribing an AO device. It is hypothesised therefore&#xD;
           that patients will be encouraged to use their AO device when they are guided by a&#xD;
           home-based physiotherapy programme where rehabilitation goals and exercises are tailored&#xD;
           to each patient's unique &quot;life-space&quot; in the home and community.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. In summary, the proposed intervention of a home-based activity education programme in&#xD;
           partnership with a community healthcare provider and in conjunction with a lightweight&#xD;
           POC may revolutionize the approach to patients with chronic respiratory failure in&#xD;
           Singapore and improve their ability to function independently in the community greatly;&#xD;
           in addition, the ability to stay active and community ambulant as well as the reduction&#xD;
           the demand on national healthcare resources (e.g. inpatient rehabilitation beds for PR)&#xD;
           is greatly advantageous.&#xD;

             pulmonary hypertension) or respiratory diseases (e.g. COPD, ILD), as demonstrated by&#xD;
             no recent acute exacerbation of respiratory/cardiac illness, acute healthcare&#xD;
             utilisation (presentation to GP, polyclinic or hospital) or change in medication (or&#xD;
             adjustments of non-invasive ventilation) for ≥6 weeks before enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who are sufficiently mobile to perform a 6-minute walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with any life-threatening condition with a low probability (in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator) of survival for at least 3 months or who has been hospitalised more&#xD;
             than 3 times in the preceding 1 year for respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are not able to ambulate with the lightweight POC (they must be able to&#xD;
             perform a 6-minute walk test - this can be unaided or with walking aid) or who have&#xD;
             significant limitation of ambulation due to non-respiratory causes such as&#xD;
             musculoskeletal (e.g. osteoarthritis) or neuromuscular disease (e.g. Parkinson's&#xD;
             disease or stroke), or who are assessed to have no rehabilitation potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are actively smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are currently participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are unable or unwilling to complete questionnaires (e.g. patients on LTOT&#xD;
             and home mechanical ventilation).&#xD;
