    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design&#xD;
      in which 40 patients with GD will receive active or sham cTBS to the pre-SMA for 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators will combine TMS, multimodal structural and functional MRI and behavioral&#xD;
      measures in order to identify circuit-level mechanisms of action and therapeutic targets&#xD;
      (connectivity changes that explain clinical improvement) and assess the efficacy of TMS in&#xD;
      modulating inhibitory control and symptom severity in this population.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS The appropriate interplay of cognitive and reward systems is essential for&#xD;
      adaptive human behavior, allowing a homeostatic balance between immediate basic pleasures and&#xD;
      long-term planned rewards. Deficits in inhibitory control from cortical cognitive systems&#xD;
      over subcortical reward circuits is a key pathophysiological feature of addictive behavior&#xD;
      that has not been studied satisfactorily in gambling disorder (GD). The clinical phenotype of&#xD;
      this population is characterized by unsuccessful efforts to reduce or stop gambling despite&#xD;
      negative outcomes, suggestive of faulty inhibitory control of gambling impulses that sustain&#xD;
      the chronicity and comorbidities of this clinical syndrome. Deficits in behavioral and&#xD;
      cognitive control constitute a symptom dimension associated with diminished response&#xD;
      inhibition in experimental tasks such as the Stop Signal Task (SST). The pre-supplementary&#xD;
      motor area (pre-SMA) is a key node of the cognitive control network responsible for response&#xD;
      inhibition. Pre-SMA activation has been associated to response inhibition performance in fMRI&#xD;
      studies using the SST and recent evidence also suggests that its activity represents a&#xD;
      motivational signal for movement. In fact, pre-SMA seems to have a dominant role in bridging&#xD;
      the delay between expected reward and specific actions rather than determining whether an&#xD;
      action is made. Although the pathophysiology of GD is not well understood, studies have shown&#xD;
      altered brain activity in prefrontal regions (including pre-SMA) of GD patients during&#xD;
      response inhibition tasks in addition to functional connectivity abnormalities of SMA during&#xD;
      rest. These circuit-level abnormalities represent a potential therapeutic target that could&#xD;
      be modulated by brain stimulation therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
      Theta burst stimulation (TBS), is a particularly brief and effective form of TMS that can be&#xD;
      inhibitory (continuous or cTBS) or excitatory (intermittent or iTBS). Although pre-SMA has&#xD;
      been successfully targeted with traditional TMS and TBS for impulse-control disorders like&#xD;
      OCD, this approach has never been tested for GD in therapeutic or mechanistic studies.&#xD;
      Despite the significant morbidity and mortality of GD, there is a dramatic shortage of&#xD;
      effective treatment options for these patients, partly due to the lack of valid&#xD;
      pathophysiological models for target discovery and experimental therapeutics. In this project&#xD;
      the investigators propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design in which 40&#xD;
      patients with GD will receive active or sham cTBS to the pre-SMA for 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators will combine TMS, multimodal structural and functional MRI and behavioral&#xD;
      measures in order to identify circuit-level mechanisms of action and therapeutic targets&#xD;
      (connectivity changes that explain clinical improvement) and assess the efficacy of TMS in&#xD;
      modulating inhibitory control and symptom severity in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (ACUTE MECHANISM OF ACTION): To assess circuit-level effects of a single session of&#xD;
      cTBS to the pre-SMA in GD patients. Hypothesis 1.1: cTBS will lead to increase in functional&#xD;
      connectivity between cortical inhibitory nodes (pre-SMA) and reward subcortical structures&#xD;
      (Nucleus Accumbens, NAc), and these changes will correlate with improvement in reaction time&#xD;
      in SST. Hypothesis 1.2: cTBS will not lead to acute changes in FA, RD or AD in the&#xD;
      mesocorticolimbic pathway. Hypothesis 1.3: cTBS will lead to increased cognitive control&#xD;
      network and decreased NAc activation during SST. Exploratory analyses will test the&#xD;
      predictive value of acute circuit changes for clinical improvement after 2 weeks and 1 month&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (CHRONIC MECHANISM OF ACTION): To assess circuit-level effects of 10 session of cTBS to&#xD;
      the pre-SMA in GD patients Hypothesis 2.1: cTBS will lead to increases in functional&#xD;
      connectivity between preSMA and NAc, and these will correlate with behavioral and clinical&#xD;
      improvement. Hypothesis 2.2: cTBS will lead to increased FA and decreased RD and AD in the&#xD;
      mesocorticolimbic pathway, and these will correlate with clinical improvement. Hypothesis&#xD;
      2.3: cTBS will lead to further increased cognitive control network and decreased NAc&#xD;
      activation during SST, and these will correlate with clinical improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (BEHAVIORAL/CLINICAL): To determine the behavioral and clinical changes of cTBS to the&#xD;
      preSMA in GD. Hypothesis 3.1: A single session of cTBS will lead to improvement in reaction&#xD;
      time in the SST, but not in symptom severity measured with clinical scales. Hypothesis 3.2:&#xD;
      10 sessions of cTBS will lead to improvement in reaction time in the behavioral inhibition&#xD;
      task, in addition to a reduction in clinical severity (including craving/urges) as measured&#xD;
      by clinical scales.&#xD;
