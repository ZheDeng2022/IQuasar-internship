      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood stem cells in the bone marrow make all the cells to normally defend a body against&#xD;
      disease. Allogeneic blood or marrow transplant is when these stem cells are transferred from&#xD;
      one person to another. Researchers think this treatment can provide a new, healthy immune&#xD;
      system to correct T-cell problems in some people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplant is safe and effective in treating people&#xD;
      with T-cell problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors: Healthy people ages 4 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients: People the same age with abnormal T-cell function causing health problems&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, heart, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will also have an electrocardiogram and chest x-ray. They may have veins tested or a&#xD;
      pre-anesthesia test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will also have lung tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have scans and/or bone marrow collected by needle in the hip bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will learn about medicines and activities to avoid and repeat some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some donors will stay in the hospital overnight and have bone marrow collected with&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other donors will get shots for several days to stimulate cells. They will have blood removed&#xD;
      by plastic tube (IV) in an arm vein. A machine will remove stem cells and return the rest of&#xD;
      the blood to the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More bone marrow and a small fragment of bone removed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dental, diet, and social worker consultations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy and antibody therapy for 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter inserted in a chest or neck vein to receive donor stem cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A hospital stay for several weeks with more medicines and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple follow-up visits&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disorders of T-cell proliferation and/or dysregulation (TCP/D) can lead to T-cell&#xD;
           lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmunity, infection, and aberrant immune activation&#xD;
           with resulting organ dysfunction, morbidity, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure disorders&#xD;
           of TCP/D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with TCP/D may be at higher risk for graft rejection and/or disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Separately by arm: To estimate the percentage of recipients with &gt;50% donor T cell&#xD;
      chimerism and graft-failure free survival at day +180 post-HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 4 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCP/D deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant HCT that meets at least one of&#xD;
           the criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identified germline T-cell activating mutation in the PI3k pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identified ADA2 deficiency (biallelic mutations in CECR1 (ADA2) and/or&#xD;
                phenotypically with low ADA2 level) leading to neutropenia requiring chronic GCSF&#xD;
                therapy or to transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T-cell infiltration of liver, spleen, lymph nodes, marrow, lungs, gut, or other&#xD;
                organs by T cells, as evidenced by laboratory, radiographic, and/or anatomic&#xD;
                pathology evaluation, resulting in organ dysfunction and/or organomegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Latent herpesvirus infection in T lymphocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of or active evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recurrent or prolonged fevers attributed to immune dysregulation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T-cell population in blood and/or marrow with immunophenotype of large granular&#xD;
                lymphocytes (LGL), with or without clonality or lymphocytosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in the setting of an underlying immune defect&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immune-mediated cytopenias of one lineage requiring transfusion or GCSF support or&#xD;
                of 2 or 3 lineages with or without transfusion or support&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one potentially suitable 7-8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or an&#xD;
           HLA-haploidentical related donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate end-organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease status: Subjects with malignancy should be referred in remission for evaluation&#xD;
           if possible, although the aggressive nature of many of these diseases necessitates the&#xD;
           potential need to enroll subjects onto study and treat with standard therapies before&#xD;
           proceeding to protocol therapy (HCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be two arms that vary in conditioning intensity - an immunosuppression-only&#xD;
           conditioning (IOC) arm for high-risk subjects and a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)&#xD;
           arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IOC arm: equine anti-thymocyte globulin (e-ATG) 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13,&#xD;
           pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days -9 and -5, low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily on&#xD;
           days -9 through -2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days&#xD;
           -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV,&#xD;
           pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -- Subjects will be assigned to the IOC arm if there is significant end-organ&#xD;
           dysfunction present and it is felt that a conditioning regimen that includes busulfan&#xD;
           would likely be associated with intolerable or life-threatening toxicities for the&#xD;
           subject. Subjects will also be assigned to the IOC arm if they possess a DNA repair&#xD;
           defect, telomere maintenance defect, or familial cancer predisposition syndrome that&#xD;
           necessitates limiting chemotherapy as much as possible to prevent future cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood stem cells are the preferred graft source, although bone marrow is&#xD;
           permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GVHD prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PTCy on days +3 and +4 (50 mg/kg/day on RIC arm and 25 mg/kg/day on the IOC arm,&#xD;
                with the option of 25 mg/kg/day on the RIC arm), tacrolimus on days +5 through +90,&#xD;
                and MMF on days +5 through +25.&#xD;

                  arm if evaluated by a hepatologist who deems the liver function test&#xD;
                  abnormalities to be potentially reversible with HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2,&#xD;
                  calculated using eGRF in the clinical lab for adults and the Schwartz formula for&#xD;

             a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful&#xD;
             to a fetus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for at least one year post-allo HCT. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in the study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status: Subjects with lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD), LGL, HLH, or other&#xD;
             TCP/D disorders requiring standard therapies to prepare for HCT should be referred in&#xD;
             remission if possible. However, these diseases are often aggressive and require swift&#xD;
             evaluation for HCT while concurrently attempting to establish disease control through&#xD;
             the administration of standard therapies. If ongoing therapy for the underlying&#xD;
             disease outside of the NIH is not in the best interest of the subject according to the&#xD;
             clinical judgment of the PI, then the subject may receive standard treatment for&#xD;
             his/her underlying TCP/D disorder as a bridge to HCT on this protocol, prior to&#xD;
             starting the research phase of the study. If it becomes apparent that the subject will&#xD;
             not be able to proceed to HCT, then he/she must come off study. Subjects receiving&#xD;
             standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, potential benefits,&#xD;
             alternatives to the proposed therapy, and the availability of receiving the same&#xD;
             treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
