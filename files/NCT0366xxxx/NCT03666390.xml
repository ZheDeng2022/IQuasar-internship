  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and suicide are two leading mental health and public health issues in Taiwan.&#xD;
      However, until now, the optimal treatment for refractory depression and suicide is still&#xD;
      lacking. Previous USA studies suggested a low dose NMDA antagonist Ketamine infusion can&#xD;
      significantly reduce depression and suicide. In our study, we firstly investigate the&#xD;
      anti-suicide and anti-depressive effects of ketamine in Taiwan. If we can find the similar&#xD;
      antidepressant and anti-suicide of ketamine in Taiwanese, this result will have a great&#xD;
      influence in the current suicide and depression prevention programs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression and suicide are major issues of public health worldwide. However, there is&#xD;
      time-lag for current available antidepressants to have therapeutic effective. In fact, if&#xD;
      partial responses were also included, up to 50% of depressed patients showed little or no&#xD;
      response to traditional antidepressant medication treatments. In addition, suicide is also a&#xD;
      prevalent mental health problem worldwide and still has no optimal and effective treatment&#xD;
      now. In Taiwan, the annual suicide rate increased gradually despite of the suicide prevention&#xD;
      program. Ketamine, a kind of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is a&#xD;
      FDA-approved anesthetic agent. One single sub-anesthesia dose of ketamine infusion can&#xD;
      rapidly improve refractory depression without side effects of dependence, and its&#xD;
      antidepressant effects have been proved by some double-blind and randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      in other countries. However, it has not been investigated and validated in Han Chinese&#xD;
      population. The mechanism of rapid antidepressant effects is still unknown. Besides, much&#xD;
      less studies assessed the anti-suicide efficacy of a low dose of ketamine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the support of NSC 101-2314-B-010-060 and NSC 101-2314-B-010-061, we finished the study&#xD;
      of a single dose ketamine infusion in the treatment of refractory major depression (TRD)&#xD;
      using a double blind randomized placebo-controlled fashion. Three groups with each 24&#xD;
      patients of TRD received 0.5mg/kg, 0.2mg/kg and placebo (PBO) respectively. The primary&#xD;
      outcome assessed by MADRS and HAMD depression ratings disclosed about 40~45% response. Also,&#xD;
      a single low dose of ketamine could reduce approximately 50% suicide-related symptoms based&#xD;
      on the subanalysis of ketamine treatment efficacy for specific suicide item.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current study, we plan to recruit 48 subjects of TRD within two years in double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized - controlled fashion with each year 24 subjects, who will receive 0.5mg/kg vs.&#xD;
      active placebo (0.045mg/kg Midazolam) equally. Mood symptom changes by MARDRS and HAMD&#xD;
      ratings, suicide scales, and impulsivity and loneliness scales will be conducted at different&#xD;
      time points from baseline to the 14th day. We will elucidate the exact efficacy of a low dose&#xD;
      of ketamine infusion for the rapid anti-depression and anti-suicidal ideations. If it is&#xD;
      successful, it would be able to generalize to benefit for the huge population of Chinese in&#xD;
      the world.&#xD;
