    <textblock>
      opened labelled randomised trial. Participants will be randomly divided into control &amp;&#xD;
      intervention group during admission to hospital using random numbers. Participants were&#xD;
      randomized into two groups: the carbohydrate-protein (CHO-P) group and control (CO) group.&#xD;
      Participants were given a specific drink to their group on the evening prior to surgery and&#xD;
      three hours before operation. The CHO-P group received 474ml (evening drink) or 237ml (3hours&#xD;
      prior to operation drink) of a solution contain 14% whey protein, 86% carbohydrates and 0%&#xD;
      lipids and the CO group nil-by-mouth at 12 midnight day of operation. All participants fasted&#xD;
      for solids for 6 hours from the operation.&#xD;

      Candidates will attend Multidisciplinary Clinic (MDC) as appointment date for examination&#xD;
      then they will get surgery appointment (admit to ward) 7-14 days after MDC date. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be identified from name list available in the electronic medical record.&#xD;
      Selection of patient will be done by assigned research team member then she will approach and&#xD;
      inform with study procedures to all potential candidates (selected based on inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria) while they attend MDC during study period. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups: the carbohydrate-protein (CHO-P) group and conventional (CO)&#xD;
      group during admission to hospital via random numbers which are issued by computer program.&#xD;
      For the concepts of the CONSORT flow diagram are followed [50]. The Patient Information&#xD;
      Consent Form will be given to identify eligible subjects who agreed to be recruited in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects are allowed to bring back consent form if she keen to seek advice from family&#xD;
      member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbohydrate-protein group: Participants will attend dietitian clinic to have anthropometry &amp;&#xD;
      dietary assessment on the same day of admission (before admission). Subjects are given a&#xD;
      specific drink to their group on the evening prior to surgery and three hours before&#xD;
      operation. The CHO-P group received 474ml (evening drink) or 237ml (3 hours prior to&#xD;
      operation drink) of a lactose-free clear tea-colour fruit flavoured fluid contains 14% whey&#xD;
      protein, 86% carbohydrates and 0% lipids. Participants fast for solids for 6 hours from the&#xD;
      operation. Participants will be given clear fluid (2 packs Resource peach) within 24 hours&#xD;
      post-surgery (without present of bowel sound) and reviewed by dietitian. Staff nurse&#xD;
      in-charged will monitor anesthetic risk of drinking whey protein and ensure subject to finish&#xD;
      specific drinks prior surgery. When they tolerated at least 500ml of clear fluids, they were&#xD;
      given a regular solid diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional group: Participants will attend dietitian clinic to have anthropometry &amp; dietary&#xD;
      assessment on the same day of admission (before admission). Participants followed&#xD;
      conventional operation procedure whereby fasting start 12am until operation. On the first day&#xD;
      of post-operation day, participants will be reviewed by gynaecologist and dietitian. They are&#xD;
      allowed for clear fluid once there is bowel sound. After tolerated clear fluid, they will&#xD;
      proceed for nourishing fluid, then soft diet and they were given a regular solid diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of operation and on the first day of post-operative day, blood samples are&#xD;
      collected for hemoglobin, renal profile, albumin and C-reactive protein. Biochemical data&#xD;
      will be record from electronic medical record. Upon discharge, all participants will be sent&#xD;
      to dietitian clinic to assess anthropometry and dietary data.&#xD;
