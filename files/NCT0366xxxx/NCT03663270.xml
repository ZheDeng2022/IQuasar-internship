    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the value of the Hypotension Probability Index in&#xD;
      reducing intraoperative hypotension in patients with primary hip replacement. The measurement&#xD;
      of the blood pressure was and is of great interest for the treating&#xD;
      physician/anesthesiologist to optimize the peri- and postoperative patients outcome. The&#xD;
      non-invasive measurement can scale the blood pressure but not from heartbeat-to-heartbeat,&#xD;
      what results in a loss of information. The invasive measurement by a placed catheter in an&#xD;
      artery shows the blood pressure with information about the pulse wave form, the ascending&#xD;
      angle, and makes it possible to detect hemodynamic changes in a way the non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement is lacking. The additional informations of the monitoring and a&#xD;

      Study design The study is designed as a single center randomized prospective interventional&#xD;
      trial comparing goal directed hemodynamic management using HPI compared to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcenter University hospital of Giessen, Department of Anesthesiology, Operative Intensive&#xD;
      Care and Pain Therapy (Study team: Dres. med. Christian Koch, Emmanuel Schneck, Thomas&#xD;

&#xD;
      Data Processing Data collection is carried out consistently on pre-defined time-points in our&#xD;
      electronic patient data management system (NarkoData, IMESO Company, Giessen, Germany) into a&#xD;
      separated study database(Microsoft Excel). Patient data is transferred to the database as&#xD;
      pseudonyms based on a random key method. The chart with the patient data and decrypting keys&#xD;
      is kept in the study center for at least 15 years after the end of the study (publication).&#xD;
      Data anonymization is intentionally not performed to give patients the option for data&#xD;
      insight or deletion of their data in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and evaluation is performed by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient number and Biometrics The aim of the study is to show the benefit of early and&#xD;
      automated monitoring of intraoperative hypotension index in order to support automatically&#xD;
      registration of the approach of critical situations given as probability of occurrence of&#xD;
      hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit - Risk assessment Potential benefit Based on a continuous monitoring by additional&#xD;
      monitoring system (HPI) an early detection of potential life threatening events is possible.&#xD;
      This can result in an optimization of the patients' therapy and a better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks The presented study is an interventional study. The potential risks are&#xD;
      marginal. The usage of an arterial catheter is based on preexisting diseases, to monitor the&#xD;
      blood pressure continuously. The risk of arterial injuries, infection, fistula etc. is&#xD;
      minimal. The time points of blood samples for the study are in line with routine sampling.&#xD;
      Based on this, there is no additional risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit/ Risk analysis The benefit for the patients is additional monitoring, based on an&#xD;
      additional monitoring device and the supervising study doctor, who can support the treating&#xD;
      anesthesiologist with information in potentially critical situations. Thereby, it is possible&#xD;
      to treat early goal-directed and possibly improve the patients outcome. Considering the&#xD;
      potential benefits of the generated information for the patient in comparison to the expected&#xD;
      risks, the beneficial effect is overbalanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected gain in knowledge from this study could be used for optimizing perioperative&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
