      In this study, patients with previously-treated locally-advanced or metastatic mismatched&#xD;
      repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal carcinoma (CRC)&#xD;
      and other solid tumors will be treated with KN035 monotherapy. There will be two cohorts in&#xD;
      this study: Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. For Cohort 1, colorectal cancer participants, who are&#xD;
      required to have been previously treated with standard therapies, which must include&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan. For Cohort 2, other solid tumor participants,&#xD;
      who are required to have been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard&#xD;
      of care therapy.&#xD;

      Later-line therapies after failure of standard treatments for advanced colorectal and&#xD;
      non-colorectal cancer patients are limited. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or&#xD;
      microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) played a role of positive predictive factor, which&#xD;
      had been documented after the pembrolizumab and nivolumab trial were reported, for PD-1&#xD;
      blockade monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal and non-colorectal cancers.&#xD;
