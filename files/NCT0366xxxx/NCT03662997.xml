      A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) using a cross-over (repeated&#xD;
      measures) design to evaluate safety and efficacy of three foam wound dressings in the local&#xD;
      management of chronic wounds.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in an outpatient setting of an academic clinical center over a&#xD;
      total period of four weeks (28 days, -1/+2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this RCT is to evaluate and compare three different foam dressings in the local&#xD;
      management of chronic wounds (i.e. venous leg ulcers (VLUs) and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs))&#xD;
      in an outpatient setting. A bordered, five-layer, flexible foam dressing with soft silicone&#xD;
      adhesive technology will be evaluated versus a hydropolymer, adhesive foam island dressing&#xD;
      and a multi-layered, hydrocellular foam dressing with silicone adhesive, within three focus&#xD;
      areas; efficacy and safety of the dressings, participant-centric outcomes and health economic&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: The terms used within the body of this report and results, in both the Primary and&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes, are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: Weeks 1 and 2 of study follow-up visits. Period 2: Weeks 3 and 4 of study follow-up&#xD;
      visits. Week 1: Designates data captured only on visit days 7 and 21. Week 2: Designates data&#xD;
      captured only on visit days 14 and 28. During Week 1: Designates data captured on visit days&#xD;
      3, 7, 17 and 21. During Week 2: Designates data captured on visit days 10, 14, 24 and 28. Day&#xD;
      3 of Week 1 from tables: inclusive of data captured on Visit Days 3 and 17. Day 3 of Week 2&#xD;
      from tables: inclusive of data captured on Visit Days 10 and 24.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective RCT using a crossover design to evaluate safety and efficacy. The study will be conducted in an outpatient setting of an academic clinical center. There will be two participant groups: those with VLU and those with DFU. Approximately 50% of the participants will be in the VLU group and 50% of the participants in the DFU group. Treatment sequence will be randomized so that a fair distribution is achieved. Each participant will receive a 2-week treatment with one of the three dressings followed by a 2-week treatment period with a second dressing (i.e. each participant will receive treatment with two different dressings, either the Bordered Five-Layer Foam Dressing and the Hydropolymer Foam Dressing, or the Bordered Five-Layer Foam Dressing and the Hydrocellular Multi-Layer Foam Dressing) using a cross-over (repeated measures) design, with a total of four study arms.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Dressing strike-through determined @ Wk1 Day 3&amp;7, and Wk3 Day 17&amp;21. Dressing strike-through that occurred Day 3 and/or 7, Day 17 and/or 21 were included in final dataset.&#xD;
Contributing factors to strike-through:&#xD;
Saturation of dressing pad:&#xD;
Inappropriate dressing type&#xD;
Inappropriate dressing change freq. (i.e. more frequent changes required)&#xD;

Dislodgement of dressing:&#xD;
Suboptimal dressing application (e.g. selection of inappropriate dressing size, failure to clean periwound skin before applying dressing, insufficient fixation)&#xD;
Exposure of dressing to mechanical forces (e.g. off-loading devices, patient mobility)&#xD;
Patient interference w/ dressing&#xD;
Dressing design deficiency:&#xD;
Insufficient fluid handling capacity (absorption, retention and/or moisture vapor transmission)&#xD;
Insufficient adhesion&#xD;
Insufficient conformability (i.e. ability to conform to body contours &amp; challenging anatomical wound locations)</description>

    <measure>Mean Difference in Score in SF12 Health-Related Quality-of-Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 health survey consists of 12 questions that yield an eight-scale profile of functional health and well-being, and 2 component summary measures of physical and mental health. SF-12 scores range from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicate lower levels of health.&#xD;
SF-12 questionnaire was administered at Screening/Baseline, Day 14, and Day 28 visits, and scored by a 3rd party vendor.&#xD;
Results are mean differences between five-layer vs the comparator dressing and presented for each of the 8 health domains, and 2 component summary measures.&#xD;
Negative scores indicate lower SF-12 scores (indicating lower levels of health) for the five-layer treatment group; positive scores indicate higher SF-12 scores for the five-layer group.</description>

Contributing factors to strike-through:&#xD;
Saturation of dressing pad:&#xD;
Inappropriate dressing type&#xD;
Inappropriate dressing change freq. (i.e. more frequent changes required)&#xD;
Change in wound condition (e.g. increase in exudate amt)&#xD;
Dislodgement of dressing:&#xD;
Suboptimal dressing application (e.g. selection of inappropriate dressing size, failure to clean periwound skin before applying dressing, insufficient fixation)&#xD;
Exposure of dressing to mechanical forces (e.g. off-loading devices, patient mobility)&#xD;
Patient interference w/ dressing&#xD;
Dressing design deficiency:&#xD;
Insufficient fluid handling capacity (absorption, retention and/or moisture vapor transmission)&#xD;
Insufficient adhesion&#xD;
Insufficient conformability (i.e. ability to conform to body contours &amp; challenging anatomical wound locations)</description>

        <description>Intact dressing after 7 days wear time, assessed @ Wk1 Day7 &amp; Wk3 Day21 only. 1st week of dressing wear (Wks 1 &amp; 3) is critical for start of wound healing.&#xD;
Contributing factors to strike-through:&#xD;
Saturation of dressing pad:&#xD;
Inappropriate dressing type&#xD;
Inappropriate dressing change freq. (i.e. more frequent changes required)&#xD;
Change in wound condition (e.g. increase in exudate amt)&#xD;
Dislodgement of dressing:&#xD;
Suboptimal dressing application (e.g. selection of inappropriate dressing size, failure to clean periwound skin before applying dressing, insufficient fixation)&#xD;
Exposure of dressing to mechanical forces (e.g. off-loading devices, patient mobility)&#xD;
Patient interference w/ dressing&#xD;
Dressing design deficiency:&#xD;
Insufficient fluid handling capacity (absorption, retention and/or moisture vapor transmission)&#xD;
Insufficient adhesion&#xD;

        <description>The SF-12 health survey consists of 12 questions that yield an eight-scale profile of functional health and well-being, and 2 component summary measures of physical and mental health. SF-12 scores range from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicate lower levels of health.&#xD;
SF-12 questionnaire was administered at Screening/Baseline, Day 14, and Day 28 visits, and scored by a 3rd party vendor.&#xD;
Results are mean differences between five-layer vs the comparator dressing and presented for each of the 8 health domains, and 2 component summary measures.&#xD;
Negative scores indicate lower SF-12 scores (indicating lower levels of health) for the five-layer treatment group; positive scores indicate higher SF-12 scores for the five-layer group.</description>

        <title>% Participant Compliance in Wear Time Between Five-layer and Comparator Dressing</title>
        <description>Compliance with the 7-day wear time protocol, within the first critical week of treatment.&#xD;
Compliance is defined as participants who wore a dressing continuously from time of application until removal at Day 7 visit. This includes participants whose dressing did not have strikethrough up to Day 7 and those who wore their dressing until strikethrough at Day 7 when dressing was removed.</description>
        <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
        <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set of superiority. Participants were combined into 2 cohorts: participants in the Five-layer vs Hydropolymer into one cohort, &amp; Five-layer vs Hydrocellular were similarly combined into a second cohort to allow for reporting and analysis in order to compare the % of participant in compliance with 7-day wear time protocol in the first week of treatment. Number of participants analyzed differ from baseline due to missing values.</population>
