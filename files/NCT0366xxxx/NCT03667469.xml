      Background and study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical and non-surgical normalization of body weight with obesity leads to a significant&#xD;
      improvement in health and regression of metabolic syndrome. But as the reduction in body&#xD;
      weight with obesity changes the life expectancy remains not clear enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of endoscopic staplers does not exclude the emergence of serious complications of&#xD;
      surgery, for example, including bleeding and leakage in the stapler suture line. Therefore,&#xD;
      the advantages of using a band in the bariatrics are justified from a security standpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the gastric bypass is increasingly performed in the version of the mini gastric&#xD;
      bypass (MGB). Another name for the procedure: one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). The&#xD;
      proposal to use for the staple-free (stepleless or steplerless) creation of a pouch&#xD;
      (band-separated gastric bypass) with use for band a vascular prosthesis is justified, but it&#xD;
      requires comparison of this method with a stapler variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important issue is comparing surgical and non-surgical weight loss with obesity and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and comparing life expectancy with confirmation of changes in telomere&#xD;
      length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares loss of weight, changes in other health conditions that the patient may&#xD;
      have (co-morbidities, such as diabetes), telomere length, quality of life, the number of&#xD;
      complications and side effects, the degree of complexity of the surgical technique and&#xD;
      operating costs of a new laparoscopic band-separated mini- gastric bypass (LBSMGB) procedure&#xD;
      compared with the standard stapler (linear cutter) - separated mini-gastric bypass (LSSMGB).&#xD;
      Additionally, surgical treatment will be compared with non-surgical treatment (hypocaloric&#xD;
      diet therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can participate? Obese adult patients with a BMI of between 30 kg/m2 and 50 kg/m2. What&#xD;
      does the study involve? Participants are randomly allocated to one of three groups. Those in&#xD;
      the first (A) group undergo the laparoscopic band-separated mini-gastric bypass procedure.&#xD;
      Those in the second (B) group undergo the linear cutter stapler-separated mini-gastric bypass&#xD;
      procedure. In three (C) group including standard lifestyle intervention on weight and&#xD;
      hypocaloric diet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are then followed up one month after surgery and again after 6 and, finally, 12&#xD;
      months after surgery where the changing body mass index, changes in co-morbidities, change&#xD;
      telomere length and quality of life are assessed.&#xD;

      Morbid obesity.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Procedure/Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The prevalence of obesity in Kazakhstan in 2017 was more than 20% of the&#xD;
      population. The annual increase in obesity rates over the past five years was 3.9 percent.&#xD;
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is based on abdominal adiposity, is a complex of symptoms&#xD;
      that are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, manifestations of type 2 diabetes or&#xD;
      prediabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemia. Clinical MetS play a&#xD;
      leading role in reducing the life expectancy and mortality of Kazakhstan's population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Surgery is the best option for treat type 2 diabetes and other components of MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of excess body weight positively affects the clinical course and life expectancy of&#xD;
      patients with MetS. Currently, surgeries and physicians accumulated positive results of&#xD;
      treatment of patients with MetS methods of surgical and nonsurgical weight loss. The use of&#xD;
      endoscopic staplers for surgical weight loss does not exclude the emergence of serious&#xD;
      complications of surgery, for example, including bleeding and leakage in the stapler suture&#xD;
      line. Therefore, the advantages of using a band in the gastric bypass surgery are justified&#xD;
      from a security standpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that increased systemic inflammation and oxidative stress associated with obesity&#xD;
      can accelerate aging and therefore telomere length (TL) can serve as an indicator of aging at&#xD;
      the cellular level. Obesity has a known association with shorter TL. And weight loss in obese&#xD;
      men is associated with increased telomere length. But the reduction in body weight with&#xD;
      obesity changes the life expectancy remains not clear enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study is designed as an interventional, prospective, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      single-center clinical trial. Patient enrollment started on May 24, 2018, and the last&#xD;
      patient is expected to be included in the study on September 4, 2019. The ethics committee of&#xD;
      the Corporate Fund &quot;University Medical Center&quot; (UMC) has granted ethics approval for this&#xD;
      study (May 24, 2018, Approval Number 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population/participants and recruitment Recruitment will be carried out by responsible&#xD;
      bariatric surgeons with a minimum of 10 years of bariatric experience in the Department of&#xD;
      Surgery, National Scientific Center for Oncology and Transplantation (Astana, Kazakhstan).&#xD;
      Screening is done on the day - 7~ 0 prior to the treatment in order to ensure that patients&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients will attend an informational meeting, where they&#xD;
      will be informed about the study's purpose, process, and possible profits and risks. Patients&#xD;
      fulfilling the study criteria who have signed the informed consent form will start treatment&#xD;
      in accordance with the standard routines of the trial site. The informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by the investigators. During the trial, the investigators will continue to provide&#xD;
      additional health care or compensation for participants' health care needs that arise as a&#xD;
      direct consequence of trial participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Informed consent will be obtained from each participant before patient&#xD;
      enrollment in the study. Patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be consecutively included and randomized into one of the three study&#xD;
      arms by the study statistician, who is not involved in the enrollment, assignment, or&#xD;
      assessment of patients, on random allocation. Allocation concealment is ensured with the use&#xD;
      of sequentially numbered, identical, opaque, sealed envelopes. The intervention will be&#xD;
      assigned by a nurse, who has also no involvement in the enrollment or assessment of patients,&#xD;
      who will open the sealed envelope during the visit before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1(A). The patients in Group 1 are treated by laparoscopic band-separated&#xD;
           (stapleless) mini-gastric bypass procedure: Gastric band (absorbable ligature)&#xD;
           introduced in the abdomen and retracted through the retro-gastric tunnel. Mobilization&#xD;
           gastric fundus and creates obstructive gastroplication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2(B). The patients in Group 2 are treated by Linear cutter stapler-separated&#xD;
           mini-gastric bypass (MGB/OAGB): standard surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3(C). The patients in Group 3 are treated by hypocaloric diet therapy with energy&#xD;
           restriction (-500 kcal/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding In this study, the single-party independent evaluation method is used to evaluate&#xD;
      the outcomes of the study. The Outcome analyzer and the study statistician are in the masking&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General procedure and monitoring Data collection and management Treatment-related data are&#xD;
      collected at V1 (before intervention), at V2 (start of intervention). Follow-up data&#xD;
      according to the study protocol will be followed from V1 to months 6 (V3) and 12 (V4). Data&#xD;
      collection begins on the day a participant signs the informed consent and continues until the&#xD;
      termination of the trial or until the participant withdraws from the trial at any time for&#xD;
      any reason. If participants discontinue or deviate from the study protocols, the&#xD;
      investigators will make best efforts to keep all missing data to a minimum. All original data&#xD;
      are kept in chronological order for verification. Original data are timely transferred to a&#xD;
      paper-based case report form (CRF) and an electronic database system located in a guarded&#xD;
      facility at the trial site. Access to the study data is restricted. The PI will have access&#xD;
      to the final dataset. All data files have a complete audit trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Sample size The sample size of this superiority trial was estimated based&#xD;
      on the literature and our own unpublished data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Normally distributed variables will be expressed as their mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) and non-normally distributed variables will be expressed as their median and&#xD;
      interquartile range; categorical variables will be expressed as the sample size number plus a&#xD;
      percentage (n, %). In test groups of continuous normally distributed variables, the Student&#xD;
      t-test will be used; the Mann-Whitney U test will be used for continuous non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data. Categorical variables will be compared with the χ2 test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test or, when appropriate, as the relative risk. Statistical analysis will be conducted on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The multivariable analysis will be conducted by logistic&#xD;
      regression and a generalized mixed linear regression model to take into account any possible&#xD;
      confounding covariate adjustments necessary, and also to consider within-center variability.&#xD;
      A p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Populations for evaluation and missing data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      All evaluations, in particular, the evaluation of the primary outcome measure, will be made&#xD;
      on the basis of all randomized patients, regardless of whether or not they adhered to the&#xD;
      treatment protocol or provided complete data sets. In particular, these latter patients are&#xD;
      those:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who discontinued the clinical trial; they will be evaluated as if they had complied with it&#xD;
      Whose planned examinations were not carried out within the planned timeframe; they will still&#xD;
      be taken into consideration in the analysis Patients who withdraw their consent to use their&#xD;
      personal data for statistical analyses will be excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing reports of individual responses on the Quality-of-Life Questionnaire II will be&#xD;
      replaced by simple imputation according to the recommendations of the test manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for the missing data will be analyzed, and the data missing at random will be&#xD;
      handled with multiple imputations and model-based approaches, such as mixed models or&#xD;
      weighted generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for repeatedly measured outcomes.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis will be performed to examine the robustness of the results to&#xD;
      assumptions made in the complete case analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events An adverse event (AE) refers to any untoward event that occurs during the&#xD;
      clinical study but does not necessarily have a causal relationship with surgical treatment.&#xD;
      Safety evaluation is carried out from the point at which the signature of the informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained until the end of the study or until patient withdrawal from the trial,&#xD;
      according to management requirements. Adverse events or serious adverse events should be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event (SAE) refers to an event that causes hospitalization, prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, disability, incapacity, life-threatening illness or death, or congenital&#xD;
      malformation during the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, all AEs are recorded. Records include the name of the AE (using standard&#xD;
      medical terminology), the date of the AE occurrence, and disappearance/stability, severity,&#xD;
      impact on the surgery, relationship with the surgery, treatment measures, and outcomes. If an&#xD;
      SAE occurs, researchers fill in an SAE Report. The report is signed and dated and reported to&#xD;
      the ethics committee of the Corporate Fund &quot;University Medical Center&quot; (UMC) and the clinical&#xD;
      research center of the National Scientific Center for Oncology and Transplantation (Astana,&#xD;
      Kazakhstan) within 24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control All surgeons and analyzers will be required to undergo special training prior&#xD;
      to the trial to guarantee consistent practice. The training program will include diagnosis,&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion/exit criteria, surgery techniques, follow-up procedures, and completion&#xD;
      of CRFs. The trial will be monitored by quality assurance personnel from the clinical&#xD;
      research center of the National Scientific Center for Oncology and Transplantation, who will&#xD;
      be independent of the study team, and an independent steering committee. There will be&#xD;
      periodic monitoring to guarantee accuracy and quality throughout the study period. The&#xD;
      essential documents (consent information, enrollment, protocol deviations, number and&#xD;
      proportion of missed visits, and losses to follow-up) will be monitored and checked for&#xD;
      accuracy and completeness by the monitors.&#xD;
