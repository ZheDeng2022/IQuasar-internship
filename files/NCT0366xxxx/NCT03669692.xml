  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) include filling, emptying or post-voiding state&#xD;
      alterations; producing symptomatology depending of the underline mechanism. Benign prostatic&#xD;
      hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common underlying disease, which increases with age and&#xD;
      significantly affects men over 50 years. There are currently no prevention or curative&#xD;
      treatment guidelines, as their pathophysiological mechanism is not exactly known. Several&#xD;
      factors have been implicated, such as hormones, aging, lifestyle or diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPH is associated with metabolic disorders, the basis of which is insulin resistance and its&#xD;
      associated pathologies: diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      Patients without these metabolic signs have a lower incidence of BPH and / or LUTS. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance (IR) is associated with greater proliferation and a reduction of cellular&#xD;
      apoptosis at the prostate level; leading to an increase in prostate volume or symptoms.&#xD;
      Likewise, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance, both in favor of sympathetic&#xD;
      (emptying symptoms) or parasympathetic (filling symptoms), influences LUTS. SNA activity can&#xD;
      be measured non-invasively, repetitively and effectively by measuring the heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caloric restriction with optimal nutrition (CRON, hereinafter only CR) is the most&#xD;
      physiologically adapted nutritional alternative to our ancestral needs and has been shown in&#xD;
      humans to reduce insulin resistance and associated pathologies. It has also been observed&#xD;
      that CR improves the balance of the SNA and allows to improve LUTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proliferation inhibition and prostatic apoptosis induction, mediated through CR, by&#xD;
      insulin-IGF-1 axis reduction and mTOR metabolic pathways inhibition, are the central axis of&#xD;
      this project. CR will be used to reduce insulin resistance, IGF expression and inhibition of&#xD;
      the PI3K / AKT / mTOR pathway, to reduce prostate cell proliferation and promote prostatic&#xD;
      tissue apoptosis; in this way it will be possible to reduce its volume and improve the&#xD;
      symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, CR will allow us to evaluate the potential benefits it has on certain metabolic&#xD;
      diseases (diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, etc.), anthropometric values (BMI,&#xD;
      abdominal perimeter and skin folds) and autonomic nervous system functionality (HRV) .&#xD;
