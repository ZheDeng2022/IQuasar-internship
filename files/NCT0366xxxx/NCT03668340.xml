  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an investigational drug as a possible treatment for uterine&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -AZD1775&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD1775 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;investigational drug&quot; AZD1775 is being given alone to patients with this type of cancer.&#xD;
      AZD1775 is also being studied in lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and other solid tumors&#xD;
      throughout the world. AZD1775 blocks the activity of Wee1, a protein that helps to regulate&#xD;
      how cells divide and grow. Certain cancer cells may be more vulnerable to having this process&#xD;
      blocked. This study is being done to assess the safety and effectiveness of AZD1775 to learn&#xD;
      if AZD1775 works in treating this type of cancer.&#xD;

             management of advanced or metastatic uterine serous carcinoma or uterine&#xD;
             carcinosarcoma. Chemotherapy administered only in conjunction with primary RT as a&#xD;
             radiosensitizer should not count as a systemic regimen. There is no restriction on the&#xD;
             number of prior lines of therapy a participant may have previously received.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A)&#xD;

          -  Willingness to release archival tissue for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants in Part C must have biopsiable disease (in a lesion that is not being&#xD;
             utilized as the target lesion for RECIST assessment) and be willing to undergo pre-&#xD;
             and on-treatment biopsies. Participants in Part B with biopsiable disease must be&#xD;
             willing to undergo pre- and on-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AZD1775 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from 2 weeks prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             1 month after study drug discontinuation. Please see Appendix C for &quot;Definition Women&#xD;
             of Childbearing Potential and Acceptable Contraceptive Methods.&quot; Patients of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential should not be breastfeeding, and must have a negative serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to the start of study treatment. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy&#xD;
             within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to first dose of&#xD;
             AZD1775, or those who have not recovered to Grade 1 from adverse events (excluding&#xD;
             alopecia or anorexia) due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier.&#xD;
             Participants may not have had hormonal therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of&#xD;
             AZD1775.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have MSI-high or MMR-deficient tumors will not be eligible unless&#xD;
             they have already received prior therapy with pembrolizumab or another PD1/PD-L1&#xD;
             immune checkpoint inhibitor or are deemed not to be a candidate for immune checkpoint&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases or other CNS disease should be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Participants with treated brain metastases that have no&#xD;
             evidence of progression or hemorrhage for at least 2 weeks after treatment will be&#xD;
             allowed on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to AZD1775.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not have had prior receipt of a cell cycle checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
             (e.g., Chek1, Wee1, or ATR inhibition)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are sensitive CYP3A4&#xD;
             substrates or are CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, or which are&#xD;
             moderate to strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 which cannot be discontinued two&#xD;
             weeks prior to Day 1 of dosing and withheld through the study until 2 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug. Co-administration of aprepitant or fosaprepitant during this&#xD;
             study is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transporter studies (in vitro) have shown that AZD1775 is an inhibitor of breast&#xD;
             cancer resistance protein (BRCP). Please see Appendix B for additional details&#xD;
             regarding prohibited drugs and drugs to be used with caution, including drugs affected&#xD;
             by CYP3A4 or BRCP. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is&#xD;
             important to also regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have undergone major surgical procedures within 28 days of&#xD;
             beginning study treatment or minor surgical procedures within 7 days of beginning&#xD;
             study treatment. Port-a-cath placement will be allowed within a 7 day window of&#xD;
             starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to swallow oral medication and may not have a percutaneous&#xD;
             endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, be receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or&#xD;
             be dependent on IV fluid support.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6&#xD;
             months as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) ≥ Class 2 will not be&#xD;
             eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina pectoris&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic&#xD;
                  rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities&#xD;
                  are eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) ≥ 480msec at study entry,&#xD;
             as calculated by the Frederica formula (QTcF) by institutional standards obtained from&#xD;
             an electrocardiogram (ECG) or congenital long QT syndrome. (Note: if one ECG&#xD;
             demonstrates a QTcF &gt;480 msec, then a mean QTcF of ≤ 480 msec obtained from 3 ECGs 2-5&#xD;
             minutes apart is required at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any concomitant or prior invasive malignancies are ineligible with&#xD;
             the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treated limited-stage basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Carcinoma in situ of the breast or cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior cancer treated with curative intent with no evidence of recurrent disease 3&#xD;
                  years following diagnosis and judged by the investigator to be at low risk of&#xD;
                  recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD1775 is an agent with an&#xD;
             unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with AZD1775, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with AZD1775.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions of antiretroviral medications with AZD1775 and the&#xD;
             potential for an increased risk of lethal infections for these participants when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the composition, PK, and metabolism of many herbal supplements are unknown,&#xD;
             the concurrent use of all herbal supplements is prohibited during the study&#xD;
             (including, but not limited to, cannabis, St. John's wort, kava, ephedra [m huang],&#xD;
             ginkgo biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng).&#xD;
             Participants should stop herbal medications at least 7 days prior to first dose of&#xD;
             AZD1775.&#xD;
