  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of diluted insulin&#xD;
      aspart (U25) with undiluted insulin aspart (U100) in school-aged children and adolescents&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) utilizing the euglycemic clamp technique and a standardized meal&#xD;
      in a controlled research environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that dilution of insulin aspart (U25) will alter the PK&#xD;
      properties as compared to undiluted aspart.&#xD;

      Study Design: participants age 9-15 y/o will be enrolled in a randomized cross-over trial, in&#xD;
      which each participant will undergo two 24-hour admissions. Each admission will include a&#xD;
      meal-study on the evening of admission followed by a euglycemic clamp study performed the&#xD;
      following morning. During one of the admissions, participants will use undiluted insulin&#xD;
      aspart (U100) while on the other the participants will receive diluted insulin aspart (U25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Figure 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. 12 participants will be recruited between the ages of 9-15 years, who have had&#xD;
      diabetes for at least 6 months' duration, on continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy for at&#xD;
      least 1 month and have an HbA1c â‰¤ 10%. Those with a history of diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) or&#xD;
      severe hypoglycemia in the month prior to enrollment and those with other&#xD;
      conditions/medications affecting insulin sensitivity (e.g. metformin) will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drugs: Diluted insulin U25 will be formulated by adding diluent, which will be obtained&#xD;
      from Novo Nordisk, with insulin aspart. The diluted insulin will be formulated by the&#xD;
      investigational pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment Visit: The study will be explained to potential participants who meet&#xD;
           eligibility criteria and informed consent will be obtained. Demographic data will be&#xD;
           recorded and history and physical exam will be performed. HbA1c, hematocrit and urine&#xD;
           pregnancy tests in female participants who could become pregnant will be measured to&#xD;
           confirm eligibility. Participants will be randomized for the first admission to either&#xD;
           diluted insulin studies followed by a second admission for undiluted insulin studies or&#xD;
           vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1st Inpatient Standard Meal Study and Euglycemic Clamp Study: Participants will be&#xD;
           admitted to the research unit in the afternoon on the day before the clamp procedure.&#xD;
           The participants will be asked to change their infusion set and use the insulin provided&#xD;
           for the study procedures- either the diluted or standard concentration insulin, based on&#xD;
           randomization at enrollment. On the admission with diluted insulin, pump settings will&#xD;
           be adjusted to account for the dilution (increased by a factor of 4 for basal rates,&#xD;
           correction factors, and carbohydrate ratios). An intravenous catheter will be inserted&#xD;
           into antecubital vein for blood sampling. Once the IV is placed, Yellow Springs&#xD;
           Instrument (YSI) glucose values and insulin levels will be obtained at least every half&#xD;
           hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At dinner (~6p.m.), participants will receive a meal prepared in the metabolic kitchen&#xD;
           to allow for accurate determination of carbohydrate, fat and protein content.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to estimate the carbohydrate content of the meal prepared by&#xD;
           the metabolic kitchen. The participant will bolus just prior to the start of the meal&#xD;
           based on the carbohydrates estimated and the pre-meal glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Glucose will be measured by YSI and aspart levels will be measured using the Mercodia&#xD;
           iso-insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples will be taken before the meal and&#xD;
           every 10 minutes after the start of the meal for the first hour, every 15 minutes for&#xD;
           the second hour, and then every 30 minutes for up to 4 hours after the bolus; namely, at&#xD;
           0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will then have YSI glucose levels obtained at least every hour overnight&#xD;
           with titration of insulin doses as needed to achieve targeted control (goal 80-140mg/dL)&#xD;
           by 8a.m. A second IV line will be placed for glucose infusion. Once IV access is&#xD;
           established and glucose is in the target range, the euglycemic clamp study will be&#xD;
           initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to the start of the clamp, -15 and 0 minute samples will be obtained for baseline&#xD;
           plasma glucose and insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At time zero, a bolus of 0.1 U/kg will be administered via the pump. After&#xD;
           administration of the bolus, the insulin pump will be disconnected. Plasma aspart&#xD;
           insulin will be measured every 10 minutes for the first 120 minutes and then every 15&#xD;
           minutes for up to 240 minutes using the Mercodia iso-insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
           assay. Plasma glucose will be measured at least every 5 minutes for the duration of the&#xD;
           clamp study, which will allow for titration of the glucose infusion rate to maintain&#xD;
           euglycemia (target 90 +/- 10mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following completion of the clamp, the participant will be offered a meal and discharged&#xD;
           home with standard concentration insulin and their usual pump settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 2nd Inpatient Standard Meal Study and Euglycemic Clamp Study: Participants will return&#xD;
           for a second admission after a minimum of 7 days since the first study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will receive whichever concentration of insulin not received during their&#xD;
      first admission (ie. If first admission is diluted, then second admission will be standard&#xD;
      concentration and vice versa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remainder of the study procedures are as indicated above. Following completion of the&#xD;
      second clamp study, participants will have completed all study related procedures.&#xD;
