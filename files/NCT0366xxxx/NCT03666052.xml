      1. introduction 1.1 Overview of myopia and high myopia Myopia is the most common eye&#xD;
           disease in the world . Among them, the incidence and prevalence of myopia are highest in&#xD;
           developed countries and regions in East and Southeast Asia. It is predicted that by&#xD;
           2050, global myopia patients would reach 5 billion, 1 billion of which were high myopia.&#xD;
           In developed countries and regions in East and Southeast Asia, the prevalence of myopia&#xD;
           in high school graduates is as high as 80% to 90%. A study in Taiwan showed that more&#xD;
           than 80% of adolescents suffered from myopia when they graduated from high school, 10%&#xD;
           of whom were high myopia. Another study which focused on university students in Shanghai&#xD;
           showed that 95.5% of college students suffered from myopia, and 19.5% of them were high&#xD;
           myopia. In stark contrast, the prevalence of myopia in the same age in western developed&#xD;
           countries is between 20% and 40%. In less developed countries and regions of the world,&#xD;
           the incidence of myopia in young people is about 5% to 10% due to the low level of&#xD;
           education.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At present, the etiology and pathogenesis of myopia and high myopia are still unclear.&#xD;
           Environmental and genetic factors are involved in the development of myopia and high&#xD;
           myopia. Among them, the level of education and outdoor activity time are closely related&#xD;
           to the development of myopia and high myopia. At present, most studies believe that the&#xD;
           higher the education level, the higher the incidence of myopia and the deeper the degree&#xD;
           of myopia. In addition, most studies suggest that outdoor activities was a protective&#xD;
           factor for myopia, and increasing outdoor activity time could reduce the incidence of&#xD;
           myopia. Also, some studies have shown that the age of onset of myopia was closely&#xD;
           related to high myopia. Furthermore, genes may also be closely related to the occurrence&#xD;
           of myopia and high myopia. At least 19 myopic loci have been identified through family&#xD;
           studies and twin studies till now. With the completion of the Human Genome Project,&#xD;
           genome-wide association analysis technology is becoming more and more mature, and more&#xD;
           and more related genes and mutation sites have been elucidated, but the pathogenic genes&#xD;
           of myopia are still not completely clear. In addition, the genes related to pathological&#xD;
           myopia and fundus lesions are currently unclear. In recent studies, high myopia and&#xD;
           pathological myopia are not strictly differentiated (pathological myopia is defined by&#xD;
           diopter or axial length alone). Therefore, genes related to pathological myopia need&#xD;
           further research, in order to judge whether high myopia and pathological myopia are two&#xD;
           different diseases at genetic level or different states controlled by the same genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Relationship between high myopia and pathological myopia The fundus of patients with&#xD;
           high myopia is often accompanied by a series of pathological changes, such as posterior&#xD;
           scleral staphyloma, retinal choroidal atrophy, lacquer crack, choroidal&#xD;
           neovascularization（CNV）, macular hemorrhage, Fuchs plaque, retinal palpebral fissure,&#xD;
           retinal tear, retinal detachment. These pathological changes are important causes of&#xD;
           decreased vision and even blindness. Some studies have shown that macular degeneration&#xD;
           caused by myopia has become a major cause of blindness and low vision. In Jing'an&#xD;
           District of Shanghai, high myopia with macular degeneration has leapt to the first place&#xD;
           in adult blindness. A study in Beijing showed that pathological myopia has become the&#xD;
           leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in the 40-49 age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although high myopia is closely related to pathological myopia, and most patients with&#xD;
           pathological myopia are highly myopic, high myopia is not equivalent to pathological&#xD;
           myopia. The change of diopter and axial length do not fully reflect the characteristics&#xD;
           of pathological myopia. Some patients with high myopia have no definite fundus lesions,&#xD;
           and some non-high myopia patients may also have posterior scleral staphyloma,&#xD;
           retinochoroid atrophy and other complications. At present, Ohno-Matsui K et al define&#xD;
           pathological myopia as: myopic macular degeneration ≥ 2 (diffuse retinochoroid atrophy),&#xD;
           or additional lesions (lacquer cracks, choroidal neovascularization, Fuchs plaque), or&#xD;
           posterior scleral staphyloma. In this definition of pathological myopia, we focus on&#xD;
           fundus lesions caused by myopia, and do not emphasize diopter and axial length.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At present, there are still many unknowns about the relationship between high myopia and&#xD;
           pathological myopia. The process of developing simple high myopia in children and&#xD;
           adolescents as pathological myopia is still unclear. Does high myopia eventually evolve&#xD;
           into pathological myopia? Are pathological myopia and high myopia different stages of&#xD;
           the same disease or two different diseases? Which fundus changes can predict the&#xD;
           occurrence of pathological myopia? These problems need further exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Morphology and visual function changes in fundus of children with high myopia At&#xD;
           present, there are few studies on the changes of fundus morphology and visual function&#xD;
           in children with high myopia. And long-term follow-up studies are also lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Morphological studies suggest that the common fundus changes in children with high&#xD;
           myopia include β-peripapillary atrophy（β-PPA）, optic disc tilt, etc., but the incidence&#xD;
           of posterior scleral staphyloma and retinochoroid atrophy is low in childhood.&#xD;
           Furthermore, some studies have suggested that diffuse retinochoroid atrophy around the&#xD;
           optic disc in childhood could easily develop into pathological myopia in adulthood. In&#xD;
           addition, thinning of the retina, choroid, and sclera is also present in children with&#xD;
           myopia and high myopia. In addition to the fundus of the posterior pole, there are also&#xD;
           multiple lesions in the peripheral fundus. Some studies considered that peripheral&#xD;
           fundus lesions such as lattice-like degeneration, non-compressive whitening, and retinal&#xD;
           tears are more common in children with high myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Corresponding to structural changes, there are also changes in micro-field and&#xD;
           electrophysiology of patients with high myopia. However, there is few studies focusing&#xD;
           on children and adolescents with high myopia, and no long-term follow-up studies has&#xD;
           been reported. There are still many unknowns in the early morphological changes,&#xD;
           evolution process and visual function of high myopia, which deserve further exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 The direction of this research A． Follow-up study of morphological changes in the&#xD;
           fundus of children with high myopia; B． Follow-up study of visual function changes in&#xD;
           children with high myopia; C． Etiological studies related to high myopia in children; D．&#xD;
           Follow-up study of quality of life, psychology, behavior, and social interactions in&#xD;
           children with high myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection 2.1 Preparatory work A． Establish Shanghai Children and Adolescents High&#xD;
           Myopia Registration Information System and Workflow: a set of information function&#xD;
           modules including appointment, real-time collection of exam data, online feedback of&#xD;
           exam results, daily consultation contact and data management analysis. And then&#xD;
           establish the workflow SOP file; B． Train physicians, optometrists and other relevant&#xD;
           staff responsible for the research; C． Print promotional materials, questionnaires,&#xD;
           informed consent forms and examination flow charts; D． Contact the children and&#xD;
           adolescents in the Shanghai Children's Refractive Development Archives Information&#xD;
           Database System through their school and use science lectures, WeChat（a kind of APP）&#xD;
           official accounts, Weibo(Chinese version of Twitter), paper leaflets to promote the harm&#xD;
           of high and pathological myopia to children, adolescents and their parents, as well as&#xD;
           introduction of the content of this study, the participants' benefits and potential&#xD;
           risks; E． Sign an informed consent form to collect information on the participants; F．&#xD;
           The appointment is registered through the information system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Examination process The brief process is as follows: Identity information&#xD;
           registration &gt; height, weight &gt; naked eye vision &amp; wearing vision &gt; axial length &gt;&#xD;
           intraocular pressure &gt; slit lamp anterior segment examination &gt; Microperimetry&#xD;
           (selected) &gt; cycloplegia &gt; Autorefraction and subjective refraction &gt; Pentacam,&#xD;
           Swept-source optical coherence tomography（SS-OCT，Topcon), wide-angle optical coherence&#xD;
           tomography angiography(OCTA,Zeiss-9000), fundus color photography +&#xD;
           autofluorescence(Topcon), Ultra wide Angle fundus photography(Optos), mfERG (optional),&#xD;
           wavefront aberrations &gt; blood sample collection / saliva specimens &gt; fill out the&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The specific flow chart is as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Ophthalmology inspection project operation rules 2.3.1 Vision test The eyesight&#xD;
           examination used the ETDRS visual acuity chart (LCD backlit lamp, WH0701), the test&#xD;
           distance was 4 meters, and the visual target at 20/20 was the same height as the eye of&#xD;
           the examinee. The recognition time of each visual target is 2~3s; the eye of the subject&#xD;
           is required to be opened normally for examination, and the blinking, hoeing, neck&#xD;
           stretching and peeking are strictly prevented. Vision is converted to a decimal count&#xD;
           record. Visual acuity examination includes two parts: uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA)&#xD;
           and corrected visual acuity (CVA). Children who are not wearing glasses are only&#xD;
           examined by UCVA, and children who wear glasses are required to check CVA after&#xD;
           completing the UCVA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.2 Axis measurement The axial measurement was performed using an IOL Master (version&#xD;
           5.02, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). Simulated eye calibration was needed before&#xD;
           measurement. Each eye was measured repeatedly for 3 times, and the difference was less&#xD;
           than 0.02 mm each time. For those who still have large fluctuations in multiple&#xD;
           measurements, the examiner needs to record it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.3 Intraocular pressure measurement Intraocular pressure was measured using a&#xD;
           non-contact tonometer (NT-4000, Nidek, USA). Each eye was repeatedly measured 3 times&#xD;
           and averaged, and the difference between each two was less than 5 mmHg. Those with an&#xD;
           intraocular pressure higher than 24 mmHg should be recorded and added for visual field&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.4 Ophthalmologist examination Ophthalmologist examinations included anterior segment&#xD;
           slit lamp examination (66 Vision. Tech, Suzhou,China) and ophthalmoscopy examination(66&#xD;
           Vision. Tech, Suzhou,China). The examination of the anterior segment slit lamp includes&#xD;
           the eyelid, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, pupil, lens and anterior&#xD;
           vitreous body, which is completed by the investigator's senior ophthalmologist. For&#xD;
           patients with peripheral anterior chamber depth less than 1/2 corneal thickness, or&#xD;
           acute inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye and other related diseases, it is&#xD;
           not suitable for cycloplegia afterwards. It should be registered by the examining&#xD;
           physician and suspended or excluded from the study. In addition, the ophthalmologist&#xD;
           should use corneal reflection, occlusion-de-covering, etc. to determine whether the&#xD;
           subject has strabismus (hidden strabismus or strabismus). Those who were strabismus&#xD;
           should be excluded from the study. For those suspected of having fundus diseases,&#xD;
           ophthalmoscopy (direct ophthalmoscope or 90D) can be performed after cycloplegia, and&#xD;
           the nature of fundus disease is judged by an ophthalmologist. Participants with&#xD;
           myopia-related fundus lesions can be registered and included in the study, while&#xD;
           participants with other fundus lesions need to be excluded after recorded. Those who had&#xD;
           other organic eye diseases were also excluded after recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.5 Microperimetry Microperimetry examinations were performed in the darkroom and&#xD;
           needed to be performed prior to OCT and fundus photographic examinations to avoid&#xD;
           influence by bright light. Microperimetry was performed using an MP1 micro-perimeter&#xD;
           (MP-1, Nidek, Japan), and the Goldman III, 4-2-1 mode was selected to detect retinal&#xD;
           light sensitivity within 10 degrees of the macula. There were a total of 40 stimulation&#xD;
           points (1°-8 stimulation points, 3°-16 stimulation points, 5°-16 stimulation points),&#xD;
           and the stimulation intensity of each point is from 20 decibels (dB) (equivalent to 20&#xD;
           asb) to 0 dB ( Equivalent to 400 asb) change. Initial stimulation intensity is 16 dB and&#xD;
           stimulation duration is 100 ms. The background light is white, 4asb. All participants&#xD;
           will receive at least 5 light stimuli before the formal test, making them familiar with&#xD;
           the examination process and minimizing the impact of learning effects. The test&#xD;
           procedure is as follows: the infrared fundus camera takes a fundus shot (45° field of&#xD;
           view) and transmits it to the video monitor. The fixation target and the stimulation&#xD;
           point are projected onto the retina by the liquid crystal display. The eyeball automatic&#xD;
           tracking system tracks the position of the retina in real time to ensure each&#xD;
           stimulation point in the predetermined retinal position. Every 60 s system will project&#xD;
           a super-threshold stimulus on the physiological blind spot to monitor the false positive&#xD;
           reaction. If a false positive reaction occurs, it needs to be re-examined. This item is&#xD;
           optional for children under 10 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.6 Cycloplegia The cycloplegia procedure is as follows: 1 drop of 0.5% proparacaine&#xD;
           (Alcaine, Alcon) is added to the conjunctival sac of each eye, and 2 drops of 1%&#xD;
           cyclopentolate are added to each eye after 15 seconds. (Cyclogyl, Alcon), 5 minutes&#xD;
           apart. After each drip, ask the participant to press the inner canthus for a few seconds&#xD;
           gently and try to take the head back posture. The last drop of cyclopentolate was&#xD;
           instilled into the conjunctival sac for 30 minutes to check for light reflection. If the&#xD;
           light reflection disappeared and the pupil diameter was greater than 6 mm, cycloplegia&#xD;
           was considered complete. If the light reflection still exists, add a third drop of&#xD;
           cyclopentolate, and re-examine the light reflection and pupil diameter after 20 minutes.&#xD;
           If there was still light reflection, the inspector needs to record this. During&#xD;
           cycloplegia, if the participant has symptoms of ocular discomfort, the ophthalmologist&#xD;
           should carefully examine it and give an appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.7 Measurement of refractive state and corneal radius of curvature (CR) The&#xD;
           refractive status and CR measurements were performed using an automated computer&#xD;
           refractometer (KR-8900, Topcon, Japan), which was performed after ciliary muscle&#xD;
           paralysis. Simulated eye calibration needed before measurement. Each eye was repeatedly&#xD;
           measured three times to average, and if any two results differ by more than 0.5 D, the&#xD;
           measurement needed to be repeated. If there were still significant differences in the&#xD;
           results of multiple measurements, the examiner needed to record it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.8 Subjective optometry Children who do not wear glasses have a UCVA of less than 0.8&#xD;
           (less than 0.63 for children 6 years of age and younger) or children with glasses have a&#xD;
           CVA of less than 0.8 (children under 6 years of age and below 0.63) need to finish a&#xD;
           subjective optometry after cycloplegia in order to measure the best corrected visual&#xD;
           acuity (BCVA). If the BCVA is less than 0.8 (less than 0.63 for children aged 6 and&#xD;
           under), or the degree of compliance during the examination is poor, the examiner should&#xD;
           record it. If the BCVA is less than 0.8 (children under 6 years of age and below is less&#xD;
           than 0.63), further examination by an ophthalmologist is required to determine whether&#xD;
           the inclusion conditions are still met.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.9 Pentacam Pentacam (OCULUS Optikgeratic Gmbh, Germany) was examined after&#xD;
           cycloplegia. Measurements include corneal diameter and curvature, anterior chamber depth&#xD;
           and volume, anterior chamber angle, pupil diameter, crystal thickness, etc. Shooting&#xD;
           requirements: Image quality display &quot;OK&quot;, crystal thickness value is available. This&#xD;
           item is optional for children under 6 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.10 SS-OCT （Topcon） SS-OCT (DRI OCT Triton, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) was examined after&#xD;
           cycloplegia. OCT location: Macular + optic disc area. Shooting mode: 12*9 mm 3D scan&#xD;
           mode (4 overlap) / Line scan (64 overlap) + 9 mm radial scan mode (16 overlap, follow up&#xD;
           mode) + optic disc area 9 Mm radial scan mode (16 overlap, follow up mode) + macular&#xD;
           area 7*7 mm 3D scan mode (4 overlap) + optic disc area 6*6 mm 3D scan mode (4 overlap).&#xD;
           Shooting requirements: input spherical error, cylinder, axis length, corneal curvature&#xD;
           radius correction magnification before shooting; image signal of strength 3D scan mode&#xD;
           is not less than 50, radial scan mode is not lower than 60, peripheral image avoids&#xD;
           mirror flip as much as possible. When shooting the disc area, we need to manually adjust&#xD;
           the shooting center to the center of the disc. If the image quality is affected by&#xD;
           blinking or eye movement during shooting, you need to re-shoot. If you still can't meet&#xD;
           the requirements, you need to record it. SS-OCT comes with a fundus color photograph.&#xD;
           The shooting position is required to be consistent with the SS-OCT scanning position and&#xD;
           to avoid eyelids, eyelashes and hair occlusion. Dark areas are avoided in the image, and&#xD;
           the image quality is not less than 90. This item is optional for children under 6 years&#xD;
           old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3.11 Wide angle OCT/OCTA (Zeiss-9000) Wide-angle OCT/OCTA examinations were performed&#xD;
           after cycloplegia.OCT/OCTA location：macular + optic disc area. Shooting mode: 12*12mm,&#xD;
           15*9mm angio mode; 16mm loop sweep mode (horizontal and vertical directions) a total of&#xD;
           8 scans. Shooting requirements: communicate more with the subject;the forehead and chin&#xD;
           must be close to the instrument.If the image quality is affected by blinking or eye&#xD;
           movement during shooting, you need to re-shoot.This item is optional for children under&#xD;
           6 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.12 Fundus photography + autofluorescence Fundus photography + autofluorescence was&#xD;
           performed after cycloplegia.Shooting content: pseudo color eye fundus + spontaneous&#xD;
           fluorescent fundus.Shooting requirements: The exposure intensity is 30ws and 300ws&#xD;
           respectively and it needs to focus on the split line and rotate the upper refractive&#xD;
           compensation button. If you find the participant not completely cycloplegic, please take&#xD;
           another drop of cyclopentolate , otherwise there will be a dark area. This item is&#xD;
           recommended for final inspection as the exposure is too bright.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.13 Ultra wide-angle fundus photography (Optos) Optos ultra-wide-angle fundus&#xD;
           photography was performed after cycloplegia. Shooting content: pseudo color eye fundus +&#xD;
           spontaneous fluorescent fundus. Shooting requirements: the same as color fundus&#xD;
           photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.14 mfERG mfERG (RETIscan, 3.15 version, Roland, Germany) was examined after&#xD;
           cycloplegia. After 0.5% topical anesthesia with procaine hydrochloride, the contact lens&#xD;
           was placed on the cornea, the ground electrode was placed in the middle of the forehead,&#xD;
           and the reference electrode was placed on the lateral iliac crest to correct refractive&#xD;
           error. The stimulator has an average brightness of 102 cd/m 2 (4~200 cd/m 2), a contrast&#xD;
           ratio of 99%, and stimulates the retina with a center of about 30° around the macula.&#xD;
           There are 61 hexagons, each of which is six. The edge is flipped in black and white&#xD;
           under the control of the binary m sequence. Each stimulation cycle time is 47 s,&#xD;
           stimulating 6 cycles. This item is optional for children under 10 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.15 Wavefront aberration When the corneal topography and wavefront aberrations are&#xD;
           measured, the subject's eyes are enlarged, and the operator or assistant pulls the upper&#xD;
           eyelid if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4 Collection of blood/saliva specimens 5 ml of Blood/saliva specimens were collected.&#xD;
           Blood/saliva specimens are temporarily stored in a portable refrigerator on site and&#xD;
           transferred to a -80 °C deep-temperature refrigerator as soon as possible. The detection&#xD;
           of serum riboflavin and related cytokine levels will be carried out in the Ophthalmology&#xD;
           Laboratory of the Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5 Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
           The questionnaire is divided into 5 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A． General information, including birth status (maternal pregnancy status, premature&#xD;
           birth history, feeding status, etc.), family status (family history of myopia, family&#xD;
           economic status, parental education level, parental physical condition, etc.), growth&#xD;
           and development status, living and learning status (living environment , dietary status,&#xD;
           sleep status, academic burden, academic performance, etc.), past medical history&#xD;
           (including systemic and eye diseases); B． Quality of life for children with high myopia&#xD;
           (NEI-VFQ-25 scale); C． High myopia children's psychology (NEI-VFQ-25 scale, depression&#xD;
           self-assessment(SDS), anxiety self-assessment table(SAS), self-esteem scale(SES)); D．&#xD;
           High myopia child behavior (NEI-VFQ-25 scale); E． Social interaction for children with&#xD;
           high myopia (NEI-VFQ-25 scale). The questionnaire is completed by the parent or&#xD;
           guardian. Children and adolescents aged 10 or older are required to complete additional&#xD;
           questionnaires to conduct self-evaluation on quality of life, psychology, behavior and&#xD;
           social interaction. The questionnaires are mainly filled in online. For parents or&#xD;
           children who are not convenient to fill out the questionnaire online, a paper-based&#xD;
           questionnaire can be issued and collected after completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Organization and quality control of research 3.1 Drafting, revision and finalization of&#xD;
           the plan A. The program was drafted by the Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment&#xD;
           Center. The draft is reviewed by the expert group, and the draft is discussed, revised,&#xD;
           and finalized in the form of a seminar. The research plan was implemented after approval&#xD;
           by the ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. In the process of research implementation, if major revisions to the research plan&#xD;
           are required, they must be submitted to the ethics committee for approval before further&#xD;
           implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Research institute A. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Shanghai&#xD;
           Municipal Education Bureau are responsible for the coordination of major issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Shanghai third-level eye disease prevention and control system (city-district&#xD;
           (county)-community) jointly guarantees the implementation of research C. The Shanghai&#xD;
           Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center is the only municipal-level eye disease&#xD;
           prevention and control institution in Shanghai. It leads the city's 16 districts and&#xD;
           counties and more than 240 community-level eye care institutions to jointly develop eye&#xD;
           care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. The Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center can provide sufficient human&#xD;
           resources for the research. Most of the inspection teams are staff members of the&#xD;
           hospital and have extensive clinical experience. In addition, the Shanghai Eye Disease&#xD;
           Prevention and Treatment Center has extensive experience in recruiting temporary&#xD;
           volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 Quality control and supervision A． All participants in the study are required to be&#xD;
           trained before the study is officially launched. The training content is printed as a&#xD;
           work manual and distributed to researchers. The clinician, optometrist or technician who&#xD;
           participates in the examination needs to learn the corresponding part of the work&#xD;
           requirements, procedures, instrument use and operation specifications before going to&#xD;
           work. After the passing examination, the official examination can be carried out. For&#xD;
           items that are responsible by multiple people, it is necessary to complete the&#xD;
           consistency test before the study is officially carried out to ensure that the results&#xD;
           between different examiners are comparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B． All inspectors are only able to know the relevant parameters necessary for the&#xD;
           inspection items they are responsible for, and remain blind for other irrelevant&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           C． The instrument should be calibrated before the start of the work on each inspection&#xD;
           day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D． Researchers responsible for quality control should regularly check the inspection&#xD;
           data of each inspection post. The quality control standards refer to the operating rules&#xD;
           on the work manual. For those who have higher failure rate, they need to re-train and&#xD;
           pass the examination before they can re-employ.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E． Follow-up content and criteria were consistent with baseline. The equipment for&#xD;
           follow-up examination is as close as possible to the baseline, and the examiner is as&#xD;
           consistent as possible. If inspection instrument must be replaced due to the upgrade,&#xD;
           the comparability of the old and new instruments should be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           F． The follow-up interval was as consistent as possible. G． The reliability and validity&#xD;
           of the questionnaire needs to be assessed before use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.4 Data entry, analysis and deletion A． The online data system is researched and&#xD;
           developed by professional information technology companies, used to check real-time data&#xD;
           entry, questionnaire filling, etc. The accuracy and completeness of the data is&#xD;
           automatically determined by the data system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B． The entry of non-electronic data is done independently by two people. C． Data&#xD;
           deletion and analysis were performed independently by two statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical Analysis 4.1 Descriptive statistics A． Continuity variables: sample size,&#xD;
           mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quartile B． Classification variable or grade&#xD;
           variable: frequency distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 statistical methods A. Continuous variables: The normality test uses the&#xD;
           Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the normal distribution is satisfied, the t test or one-way&#xD;
           ANOVA is used; if the normal distribution is not satisfied, the Mann-Whitney U test or&#xD;
           the Kruskal Wallis test is used. The two-two comparison between groups was performed&#xD;
           using the Bonferroni method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Categorical variable: chi-square test. C. Correlation analysis: simple linear&#xD;
           regression and stepwise multiple linear regression, using nonlinear regression if&#xD;
           necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Statistical significance All differences were statistically defined as P &lt; 0.05&#xD;
           (bilateral)&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Subgroup analysis Subjects will be assigned to different subgroups for subgroup&#xD;
           analysis based on age, gender, diopter, axial length, fundus structure, and functional&#xD;
           changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Interim analysis Baseline data (2018) and follow-up data for every 3 years are used&#xD;
           for analysis and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ethical issues 5.1 Ethics committee The study will be carried out after the approval of&#xD;
           the Shanghai General Hospital Ethics Committee and strictly abide by the Helsinki&#xD;
           Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Protect the privacy of participants In order to protect the privacy of the children&#xD;
           and adolescents in the test, when the research materials are provided to other&#xD;
           organizations, the subject code or initials should be used instead of their ID number or&#xD;
           real name. In addition, the researcher and the relevant staff involved in the research&#xD;
           must keep the privacy information of the children and adolescents in the test&#xD;
           confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Informed consent The informed consent form will be distributed to the children and&#xD;
           adolescents participating in the study and their parents or guardians after approval by&#xD;
           the ethics committee. For children and adolescents and their parents or guardians who&#xD;
           voluntarily agree to participate in the study, parents or guardians are required to sign&#xD;
           an informed consent form prior to the baseline study. Before signing the informed&#xD;
           consent form, the researcher should fully introduce the content of the study, the&#xD;
           benefit of the subject and the potential risks, and confirm that the children and&#xD;
           adolescents and their parents or guardians fully understand and voluntarily sign the&#xD;
           informed consent form. When signing the informed consent form, the parent or guardian&#xD;
           has sufficient time to consider and has the right to ask questions. For questions from&#xD;
           parents or guardians, the researcher needs to provide adequate answers. For parents or&#xD;
           guardians who agree to sign an informed consent form, the investigator signs the&#xD;
           informed consent form after the informed consent is fully explained and states the&#xD;
           relationship with the child and adolescent. Informed consent is in duplicate, one of&#xD;
           which is kept by the parent or guardian and the other is kept by the researcher. During&#xD;
           the research process, if there is a major change in the research content, the revised&#xD;
           informed consent form should be sent to the ethics committee for approval. After the&#xD;
           approval, the researcher must fully communicate with the children and adolescents and&#xD;
           their parents or guardians, and confirm that they agree to continue to participate in&#xD;
           the study and re-sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Funds and insurance 6.1 funds Before the start of the study, funds were raised by the&#xD;
           Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center.&#xD;

        1 General characteristics of the research object&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on the refraction development archive system that has been constructed in Shanghai,&#xD;
        the list of children and adolescents with high myopia was selected from the database of&#xD;
        children's refractive development archives information in Shanghai. Children of different&#xD;
        ages with high myopia must meet the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 4-5 years old, equivalent spherical error ≤ -4.0 D;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 6-8 years old, equivalent spherical error ≤ -6.0 D;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. 9-18 years old, equivalent spherical error ≤ -8.0 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2 Sample size A total of 1.25 million children and adolescents are currently registered,&#xD;
        4,006 (0.32%) of which meet the entry requirements. Among the 4~5 year olds, there are 815&#xD;
        people with SE≤-4D; 842 people with SE≤-6 D among the 6~8 year olds; 2349 people with&#xD;
        SE≤-8D among the people aged 9 and over . Taking into account the 50% non-response and the&#xD;
        proportion of the exclusion, the initial registration number is about 2,000.&#xD;
