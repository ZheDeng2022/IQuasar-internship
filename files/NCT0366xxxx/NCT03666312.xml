  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) has changed the life expectancy of end-stage liver disease (ELD)&#xD;
      patients. However, important issues may hamper the early post-LT period (e.g. graft&#xD;
      dysfunctions, infectious complications). Risk stratification in ELD patients is based on&#xD;
      clinical scores which are often not predictive for the LT outcomes. More robust scores are&#xD;
      therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that microbial flora may play an important role in predisposing to several&#xD;
      pathological conditions. This is particularly true for the liver, which is constantly exposed&#xD;
      to high load of gut microbial antigens and metabolites. The effects of these factors have not&#xD;
      been studied on the transplanted liver yet. The investigators will study the faecal&#xD;
      microbiome of 275 LT patients, and, in combination with a large panel of clinical, lab and&#xD;
      functional parameters, will correlate it to different clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the following possible LT outcomes will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early allograft dysfunction (30-40% estimated incidence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treated acute cellular rejection (10-15%). Evaluated through lab parameters of liver&#xD;
           damage and, when possible, confirmed by histopathological evaluation of liver biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infectious complications (10-15% divided in microbiologically confirmed and clinically&#xD;
           suspected)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Length of stay in the hospital after LT&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mortality at 30, 90 and 365 days (7-8% at 1 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Biliary complications (10-15%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      220 adult patients undergoing orthotopic LT (OLT) will be enrolled (months 1-18) and followed&#xD;
      for 1 year after LT. Months 19-24: 55 pts will be enrolled as internal validation cohort, and&#xD;
      monitored until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool and blood will be sampled at the following timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0. Pre-LT (within the 3 months before LT) T1. Early Post-LT (7 days from surgery) T2. Late&#xD;
      Post-LT (90 days from surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool will be used for microbiome profiling and investigation of intestinal inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permeability analysis, evaluation of circulating catecholamines and of bacterial metabolites&#xD;
      will be performed also on blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and lab data will be collected. Clinical scores (MELD and Child-Pugh), clinical&#xD;
      complications and graft/patient survival will be recorded throughout the observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of microbiome data will be calculated at&#xD;
      different taxonomic levels for all investigated outcomes. Curves with an area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC) &gt;0.6 and a p value ≤0.05 will be considered potentially relevant. The most informative&#xD;
      and inclusive microbiome cutoffs at the lowest significant taxonomic level (usually the&#xD;
      family level) will be chosen and used with all the other clinical variables in contingency&#xD;
      tables to estimate their association with the different outcomes (Chi-square test). Single,&#xD;
      even if less inclusive, microbiome cutoffs indicating extreme dysbiosis (occupation of &gt;30%&#xD;
      of the microbiota by a single predominating bacterial taxon), will also be chosen from&#xD;
      non-significant ROC curves and further investigated. Generalized Linear Model (GLM) will then&#xD;
      be used for each outcome except survival, for which Cox regression will be used. All P values&#xD;
      will be adjusted for False Discovery Rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the analyzed variables will be considered in multivariate analysis, together with the&#xD;
      typical clinical assessments of liver transplantation procedures. These include: clinical&#xD;
      scores (i.e. Child-Pugh and MELD), hematologic lab analyses (leukocytes, erythrocytes,&#xD;
      hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets), biochemical lab analyses (creatinine, urea, sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, ALT, AST, total Bil, GGT, ALP, albumin, ammonium, CRP, circulating&#xD;
      catecholamines), coagulation tests (PT, PTT), and drug treatments at the different time&#xD;
      points (including antibiotics, immunosuppressive regimens and laxatives). The predictive&#xD;
      model by the &quot;best subset&quot; approach optimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) will be&#xD;
      selected. The model selection will also consider possible interactions with different&#xD;
      underlying conditions, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, nonalcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and comorbidities such as diabetes and renal&#xD;
      insufficiency In this phase the investigators will also estimate the model performance&#xD;
      (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) by&#xD;
      10-fold cross validation to avoid too optimistic estimates. As comparison, a Machine Learning&#xD;
      model will also be fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the data of the patients enrolled in the second year will be available, the investigators&#xD;
      will validate the predictive model in the independent sample.&#xD;
