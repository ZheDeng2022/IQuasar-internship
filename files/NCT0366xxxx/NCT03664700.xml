  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to investigate the user friendliness, and performance of the LMA&#xD;
      Protector. The principal research question is to assess the overall performance of the LMA&#xD;
      Protector. The investigators are merely making observations related to use of the device&#xD;
      during clinical practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of research data on regarding the use of the LMA Protector. There is no&#xD;
      regulatory requirement to collect or publish patient data on any device, either before CE&#xD;
      marking or after. These devices are freely purchased and used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is, however, a professional duty to know that a device conforms to established norms&#xD;
      for use. These norms are not official standards but rather, reference data against which a&#xD;
      device can be clinically judged. Therefore, a device that is easy to insert but has a low&#xD;
      'leak pressure' (see above) is different from one that is more difficult to insert but as a&#xD;
      high leak pressure. It is not that one is 'better' than the other, but rather that the data&#xD;
      help create a 'usability profile' of the device which can be useful when making a clinical&#xD;
      selection for the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preoperative visit, patient information leaflet will be given to the patients&#xD;
      meeting the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wherever possible, suitable patients will be identified in the preoperative assessment clinic&#xD;
      and the information leaflet given. The patients will be given adequate time to read this&#xD;
      information and any queries will be answered before being asked to sign a consent form. A&#xD;
      detailed airway assessment will be performed by one of the investigators and documented on&#xD;
      the study proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of anaesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival in the anaesthetic room patients will be monitored with pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      electrocardiography and invasive or non-invasive blood pressure measurements. After&#xD;
      intravenous access is secured and the pre-surgical checklist completed, all patients will be&#xD;
      pre-oxygenated using a facemask to achieve end tidal oxygen concentration of at least 80%. A&#xD;
      'sniffing' position of the head and neck and a 20 degree head-up bed tilt will be used for&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation. General anaesthesia will be induced intravenously. After induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia, facemask ventilation will be commenced and anaesthesia maintained with an&#xD;
      inhalational anaesthetic agent in oxygen or with total intravenous anaesthesia. The volatile&#xD;
      agent's (anesthetic gases) concentration of 1 MAC adjusted for the patient's age will be&#xD;
      achieved and maintained. This is normal process of anaesthesia applicable for all patients&#xD;
      irrespective of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supraglottic airway device (SAD) insertion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once deep plane of anaesthesia is confirmed, with the absence of movement to jaw thrust&#xD;
      stimulation the SAD (LMA protector) will be inserted. The size of the device will be based on&#xD;
      the manufacturer's recommendations for the body weight. The breathing system will be&#xD;
      connected to the device. Ventilation of the lungs will be then confirmed by observing&#xD;
      adequate bilateral chest inflation and square end-tidal capnogram wave with positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation. Adequate ventilation will be recorded if three tests are passed: 1) adequate&#xD;
      chest movement, 2) an expired tidal volume of at least 7 ml/kg and 3) stable oxygenation.&#xD;
      Time would continue until LMAÂ® ProtectorTM inserted successfully. If it is not possible to&#xD;
      insert the device or ventilate through it, two more attempts at placement of the device will&#xD;
      be allowed. If placement has failed after two further attempts, the study will be abandoned&#xD;
      and the other device will be used. If this fails on first attempt a different LMA or tracheal&#xD;
      tube will be used as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of anaesthesia and recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main interventions refer to the insertion of the airway device into the patient to obtain&#xD;
      a airway and allow the conduct of the anaesthetic and therefore the surgery. However, if&#xD;
      there are problems with the device and the airway obtained is suboptimal then the below&#xD;
      interventions are allowed (which will be noted in the data collection form):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neck extension - move patient's neck upward&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neck flexion - move patient's neck downward&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chin lift - manoeuvre to open the airway&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Jaw thrust - manoeuvre to open the airway&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reposition of the device At the end of operation, anaesthetic agents will be&#xD;
           discontinued while the device is left in place. The device will be removed after the&#xD;
           patient has regained consciousness, and has responded to verbal command to open the&#xD;
           mouth. Any complications that occur during the use of the device will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative assessment Postoperatively in recovery or on the ward, the investigators will&#xD;
      visit each patient and determine whether the following airway complications are present after&#xD;
      surgery: sore throat (constant pain, independent of swallowing), dysphagia (difficulty in, or&#xD;
      pain provoked by, swallowing), sore jaw, dysphonia (difficulty in, or pain on, speaking),&#xD;
      numbness of the tongue or the oropharynx, ear pain, neck or mouth ache, hearing changes. Each&#xD;
      complication will be graded as none, mild, moderate or severe. The same questions will be&#xD;
      asked 24-48 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit During the first visit by the anaesthetist to the participant, at the&#xD;
      anaesthetist's earliest opportunity, either in the recovery area or on the ward, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked about the following complications, which will be graded as none,&#xD;
      mild, moderate or severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lip or tongue swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hearing changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ear pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sore throat&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pain on swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Jaw pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Neck or mouth ache&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pain on speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Numbness of the tongue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit (or telephone consultation) During the second visit 24-48 hours post-operatively&#xD;
      on the ward or via telephone the participants will be asked about the following&#xD;
      complications, which will be graded as none, mild, moderate or severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lip or tongue swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hearing changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ear pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sore throat&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pain on swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Jaw pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Neck or mouth ache&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pain on speaking&#xD;
&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data will be collected prospectively on data collection sheets completed by the anaesthetist / investigator during anaesthesia. Each site will manage their own data set and the data will be pooled at the end of the recruitment phase across all sites. Data will be sent from sites to the lead study team only at the end of the data collection.&#xD;
Consent form and initial data collection forms will be filed in the master folder and kept locked in the dedicated research locker in the department. The PI at each site will have access to this log. Each site will assign a study ID for each participant and a record of these IDs will be kept in the site file. Only anonymised data will be sent from each trust to the main study team.
