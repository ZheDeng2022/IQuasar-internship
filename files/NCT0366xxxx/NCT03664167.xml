      This study evaluates effect of weight loss in a group of obese patients with gouty arthritis.&#xD;
      The study is a randomised group trial where half the patients receive intensive weight loss&#xD;
      in the form of meal replacement from Cambridge as well as supervision from a clinical&#xD;
      dietician and the other half get usual care.&#xD;

      Background Gout is an increasingly common disorder characterised by elevated serum urate (SU)&#xD;
      and by acute and chronic arthritis causing severe disability and pain. Long-term management&#xD;
      of gout focuses on urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and keeping SU under its solubility&#xD;
      threshold. When SU is kept under the threshold for solubility, the frequency of gout flares&#xD;
      will decrease and the urate crystals dispositioned in the joints will dissolve. New&#xD;
      therapeutic management of gout has in recent years emerged. However, despite the potential&#xD;
      for effective treatment, gout management remains suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      there is some physiological evidence, although sparse, that weight loss in patients with gout&#xD;
      reduces both SU and number of gout flares. Despite the scarcity of data regarding the effects&#xD;
      of weight loss in gout, international guidelines recommend dietary intervention and weight&#xD;
      loss as a core management strategy in patients with concomitant gout and obesity The aim with&#xD;
      the current study is to address whether or not there is a difference in success rate in&#xD;
      weight reduction, SU levels, and possible side-effects between the 2 approaches in the&#xD;
      &quot;short-term&quot;, by comparing a weight loss group to an ongoing no-treatment (usual care) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      recruitment Participants will be recruited from the out-patient clinics at the Parker&#xD;
      Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital and the Department of Rheumatology,&#xD;
      Herlev-Gentofte Hospital, Denmark, through advertisements in newspapers and on the website of&#xD;
      the Parker Institute. Additionally, local general practitioners will be informed about the&#xD;
      possibility to assign patients to the project. All participants will be pre-screened via&#xD;
      telephone using a series of standard questions about eligibility according to criteria of&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion. This study aims at being as pragmatic and inclusive as possible with&#xD;
      few exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions All the participants who sign informed consent will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either 16 (8+8) weeks of low-energy diet (LED; 3.4 MJ/day; i.e., the Intensive Diet [ID]&#xD;
      group) OR a corresponding 16-week conventional hypo-energetic, high protein diet (app. 5&#xD;
      MJ/day) defined as a control group (i.e., conventional diet [CD] group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive Diet (ID) Group: The first phase of the study consists of an 8-week weight&#xD;
      reduction programme where the participants initiate an LED diet-only, with 3.4 MJ/day (810&#xD;
      kcal per day) in a supervised dietary programme (products provided by The Cambridge Weight&#xD;
      Plan). They will be given nutritional and dietetic instructions by an experienced dietitian&#xD;
      in sessions of 1-2 h weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase (ID Group) of the study (week 8-16), will consist of an 8 weeks' fixed&#xD;
      energy diet programme using 5 MJ/day (1,200 kcal per day) incorporating two diet products&#xD;
      daily. The principles of the diet will be in line with the current guidelines for healthy&#xD;
      eating issued by the Danish National Board of Health, i.e. low-fat, low-sugar and high-fibre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Diet (CD) Group: The programme will consist of a presentation by the same&#xD;
      dietitian as for the ID group, who will provide nutritional advice in a 2 h session at&#xD;
      baseline (week 0), and in week 8. At these sessions the dietitian will recommend eating&#xD;
      ordinary foods in amounts which will provide the patients with approximately 5 MJ/day (1,200&#xD;
      kcal per day). The follow-up meeting at week 16 will not influence the outcome. Thus, during&#xD;
      the 16 week trial, the CD group will attend three sessions altogether with a total of&#xD;
      approximately 4h of instruction.&#xD;
