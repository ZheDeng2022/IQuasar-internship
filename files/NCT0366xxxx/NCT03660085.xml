  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year over 20,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Canada with the majority&#xD;
      undergoing some form of treatment option. Radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy are&#xD;
      common procedures that are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, they&#xD;
      typically incur both short- and long-term side effects (e.g. urinary incontinence, sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction, reduced physical function, etc) that can negatively impact one's quality of&#xD;
      life. This study aims to educate and teach pre- (as opposed to most common post-)&#xD;
      habilitation - preventive life habits aimed to empower men and address many of the issues&#xD;
      faced by men undergoing radical prostatectomy or other active forms of prostate cancer&#xD;
      treatments. The investigators hypothesize that daily text and email reminders, in addition to&#xD;
      connecting men with other men undergoing similar challenges, will improve participant&#xD;
      adherence to the pre-habilitation program. Secondary objectives will assess change in mental&#xD;
      health, physical fitness, urological symptoms, state of relaxation, and quality of life&#xD;
      parameters before and after the program.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a survey study of almost 400 survivors of prostate cancer (PC), we found that 17% of them&#xD;
      suffered currently from mental health issues, and most were not on medication to address this&#xD;
      issue. Compounding issues included urinary and sexual disfunction, poor attendance to support&#xD;
      groups, intimacy, problems sleeping and other health problems. To address these many issues&#xD;
      directly, with the endorsement of physicians and patients attending our regional PC&#xD;
      integrative care conference (April 2018) and expanding on pre-habitation (pre-surgery)&#xD;
      science, we created a Patient Empowerment Program (PEP) to be delivered from day one of&#xD;
      diagnosis, to educate and teach the men and partners life skills/habits which are aimed to&#xD;
      improve their fitness levels and quality of life, and to decrease treatment related side&#xD;
      effects. This program is in line with the Auditor General of Nova Scotia's 2017 report&#xD;
      endorsing the use of bottom-up evidence-based interventions, created from actively engaging&#xD;
      patients in development and process. We aim to trial PC-PEP for men undergoing curative&#xD;
      treatment for PC versus a control group receiving standard care. The PC-PEP program includes&#xD;
      in-person and multimedia informational, physical activity, pelvic floor, stress reduction,&#xD;
      and relationship/connection training. The men are connected with other participants to&#xD;
      increase social support and maximize compliance. We use technology to deliver daily alerts to&#xD;
      patients to remind them to engage in the program. A PC-PEP feasibility study of 30 men, over&#xD;
      28 days, showed that the program is feasible, leads to positive outcomes in patients and is&#xD;
      highly (9.79/10) endorsed by patients. We propose a Randomized Clinical Trial assessing&#xD;
      PC-PEP over 6 months from day one of diagnosis. We predict that PC-PEP will improve mental&#xD;
      health (primary outcome) and other quality of life outcomes of patients compared with 'usual&#xD;
      care'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, wait-list controlled clinical trial for men newly diagnosed with PC and&#xD;
      undergoing curative surgery and/or radiotherapy. The PEP group will receive the intervention&#xD;
      for six months (early intervention) while the wait-list group will start the same program at&#xD;
      the end of this intervention (late intervention; for six months). Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, six and twelve months. The primary outcome is mental health measured by the&#xD;
      Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10 questionnaire) at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      period. Multiple secondary endpoints include urinary, bowel and sexual function, fitness&#xD;
      levels, fatigue, sleep, intimacy/sexuality concerns, relationship satisfaction, social&#xD;
      support and surrogates of medical costs (e.g., number of visits to medical professionals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introducing a comprehensive empowerment program from day 1 of diagnosis may mitigate against&#xD;
      the high levels of mental distress short and long-term suffered by hundreds of Nova Scotian&#xD;
      men undergoing curative PC treatment every year, and the burden treatment related side&#xD;
      effects will place on our health care system. Given that the study has the endorsement of&#xD;
      patients, clinicians and administrators at NSHA, if proven successful it will have the&#xD;
      evidence base needed to change the current standard of care.&#xD;

Pelvic floor muscle training will include three, 10-minute sessions and mediation for 10 minutes daily. Intimacy and Connection component of PC-PEP consists of engaging in at least one form of intimacy practice prescribed, per day. Social connection will be fostered by pairing participants up with peers from the study. To encourage program compliance, study participants will receive 3 daily reminders to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises per day plus an additional motivational email daily containing helpful tips.</description>
