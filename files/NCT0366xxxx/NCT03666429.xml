  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mainstay of treatment in viral upper and lower respiratory tract disease is airway&#xD;
      clearance. Viral respiratory tract infections account for a substantial amount of emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) visits, financial and stress burden on caregivers. In addition, they also&#xD;
      account for a large number of ED return visits. While airway clearance is considered a&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment the pragmatic effectiveness of various devices remain unstudied in&#xD;
      patients who are discharged from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to compare the pragmatic effectiveness of two commonly used&#xD;
      suction devices the NoseFrida and bulb suction and to provide a descriptive analysis on 72&#xD;
      hour return to ED rates and readmission rates. Patients will be enrolled October 15, 2018 to&#xD;
      October 15, 2019 or until NoseFrida supplies are depleted. Fridababy will supply 500&#xD;
      NoseFrida devices and replacement filters. Patients aged 1 day to 24 months presenting&#xD;
      Vanderbilt Childrens ED with symptoms of nasal congestion or bronchiolitis who require&#xD;
      suctioning and will be discharged from the ED will be approached for enrollment. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include no upper airway abnormalities or previously enrolled in study. The study&#xD;
      design is a prospective and retrospective observational study. We anticipate about 500&#xD;
      patients to be enrolled in this study. Families will then be approached for consent to&#xD;
      participate. Caregiver will fill out a data collection form then be instructed on how to use&#xD;
      the NoseFrida. Next, family with trial it on their child while in the ED. Caregivers will&#xD;
      then fill out a 7 point Likert survey on both the bulb suction and NoseFrida device. The&#xD;
      family will go home with this device and a set of replacement filters and instructed to&#xD;
      suction their child as needed. The primary investigator (PI) will then complete a 72 hour&#xD;
      chart review to determine the number of return to ED visits and readmission rates. To compare&#xD;
      ED returns with retrospective data, KSP will conduct a review of the business objects&#xD;
      database using ICD9 codes specific for viral respiratory tract infections over the past 3&#xD;
      years to determine a control return ED visit rate. Data will be compared using a paired&#xD;
      T-test. If data is not normally distributed we will use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We will&#xD;
      also use a multivariable logistic model to examine associations adjusted for age and illness&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;

      Background The mainstay of treatment in viral upper and lower respiratory tract disease is&#xD;
      airway clearance. Viral respiratory tract infections account for a substantial amount of&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) visits, financial and stress burden on caregivers. In addition,&#xD;
      they also account for a large number of ED return visits. While airway clearance is&#xD;
      considered a mainstay of treatment the pragmatic effectiveness of various devices remain&#xD;
      unstudied in patients who are discharged from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference between the NoseFrida and the bulb suction at relieving objective&#xD;
      signs of nasal obstruction or return ED visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the use of the NoseFrida device with a retrospective control (bulb suction)&#xD;
           to determine if there is a decrease in the number of ED return visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To provide evidence based recommendations on the pragmatic effectiveness of two commonly&#xD;
           used suction devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To provide a descriptive analysis on 72 hour return to ED rates and readmission rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective and retrospective observational study. We anticipate about&#xD;
      500 patients to be enrolled in this study. Patients who present to Vanderbilt Childrens&#xD;
      Emergency Department will be identified by key study personnel (KSP) based on inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Families will then be approached for consent to participate. Caregiver&#xD;
      will fill out a data collection form then be instructed on how to use the NoseFrida. Next,&#xD;
      family with trial it on their child while in the ED. Caregivers will then fill out a 7 point&#xD;
      Likert survey on both the bulb suction and NoseFrida device. The family will go home with&#xD;
      this device and a set of replacement filters and instructed to suction their child as needed.&#xD;
      The primary investigator (PI) will then complete a 72 hour chart review to determine the&#xD;
      number of return to ED visits and readmission rates. The family will keep the suction device&#xD;
      at the completion of the study. To compare ED returns with retrospective data, KSP will&#xD;
      conduct a review of the business objects database using ICD9 codes specific for viral&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections over the past 3 years to determine a control return ED visit&#xD;
      rate. Data will be compared using a paired T-test. If data is not normally distributed we&#xD;
      will use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We will also use a multivariable logistic model to&#xD;
      examine associations adjusted for age and illness severity. Fridababy will provide supplies&#xD;
      needed for the study, however the company will not have access to the raw data or PHI. Once&#xD;
      the results are published in a scientific journal, then Fridababy will have access to the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
