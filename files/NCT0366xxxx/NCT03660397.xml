  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension or resistant hypertension. Surgery and and medicine are the main&#xD;
      treatment for primary aldosteronism(PA) by the current guidelines. However, only a small part&#xD;
      of patients with PA meet the surgical criteria, and most of patients with uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension and activation of RAAS have to take spironolactone or other antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs for long time. On the other side, long-term inhibition of aldosterone receptor may&#xD;
      cause hyperkalemia, male breast hyperplasia and other adverse reactions. Moreover,&#xD;
      hyperaldosterone is still not corrected by spironolactone, which causes extensive&#xD;
      cerebrovascular damages even though blood pressure and blood potassium had been normalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of adrenal vein sampling and adrenal ablation, selective arterial&#xD;
      ablation of adrenal gland(AAA) was observed with significant decrease of blood aldosterone&#xD;
      and blood pressure in patients with PA, which made it promising that uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension could be relieved by selective AAA.&#xD;
