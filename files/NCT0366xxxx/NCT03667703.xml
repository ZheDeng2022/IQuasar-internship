  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with congenital heart disease often require an intervention during their first year&#xD;
      of life. Infants are generally admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit and are routinely&#xD;
      prescribed stress ulcer prophylaxis to decrease acid release from the stomach to prevent&#xD;
      stress ulcer formation. However, these medicines may not be safe and could put infants at&#xD;
      increased risk for hospital-acquired infections, necrotizing enterocolitis and alteration to&#xD;
      the infant's microbiome. The investigators plan to assess the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      prospective, blinded randomized control trial to determine the safety of withholding stress&#xD;
      ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill infants with congenital heart disease. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to examine the changes to the infant's microbiome through oral, gastric&#xD;
      and stool samples and compare hospital-acquired infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background &amp; Significance. Approximately 36,000 infants are born with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) in the United States each year, often requiring surgical intervention in the&#xD;
      first year of life. They are vulnerable to postoperative morbidities including infection,&#xD;
      growth failure and neurodevelopmental delay. Upon admission to the cardiac intensive care&#xD;
      unit (CICU), infants are routinely prescribed stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) to decrease acid&#xD;
      release from the stomach thus preventing ulcer-induced upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding.&#xD;
      Although adopted from the adult literature, this practice is expensive and has not been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in infants. More importantly, recent literature suggests that this may not be&#xD;
      safe. Studies show an increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis and alterations in the evolving healthy gut flora in infants. The study&#xD;
      investigators have recently demonstrated an increased risk of infection in children receiving&#xD;
      SUP and also reported differences in microbial diversity among children in the CICU. It is&#xD;
      necessary to proceed with a prospective trial to determine the safety of withholding SUP in&#xD;
      critically ill children with CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims &amp; Hypothesis. The overarching hypothesis of the proposal is withholding SUP&#xD;
      from critically ill infants with CHD is safe and results in favorable microbial diversity,&#xD;
      thus decreasing hospital-acquired infections. Primary Aim 1 of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of this pilot randomized, controlled clinical trial of SUP versus placebo in&#xD;
      infants admitted to the CICU. The study investigators hypothesize that a priori feasibility&#xD;
      measures will be achieved during the study period. Primary Aim 2 of the study is to examine&#xD;
      the differences of UGI bleeding in critically ill infants with CHD receiving SUP versus those&#xD;
      receiving placebo. The study investigators hypothesize that the rate of UGI bleeding will be&#xD;
      no different between infants exposed to SUP and to placebo. Secondary Aim 1 of the study is&#xD;
      to compare the differences in the abundance of microbial taxa and functional profiles of the&#xD;
      aerodigestive tract microbiome between infants receiving SUP and those receiving placebo and&#xD;
      before/after the start of SUP. The study investigators hypothesize that there will be&#xD;
      significant differences in the abundance of microbial taxa and the functional profiles&#xD;
      between the 2 groups - with a more favorable microbial profile present in infants in the&#xD;
      placebo group. Secondary Aim 2 is to examine the difference in the incidence of&#xD;
      hospital-acquired infections in critically ill infants with CHD receiving SUP versus placebo.&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize the rate of hospital-acquired infections will be higher&#xD;
      in patients exposed to SUP when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Methods. A single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial will be conducted as a feasibility study for a larger multicenter trial. Consecutive&#xD;
      infants &lt; 12 months of age with CHD admitted to the CICU and anticipated to require&#xD;
      respiratory support for &gt; 24 hours will be enrolled and randomized to receive a histamine-2&#xD;
      receptor antagonist (H2RA) medication or study placebo. Patients will remain in the study&#xD;
      until discontinuation of respiratory support, discharge from the CICU or study day 14. Oral,&#xD;
      gastric and stool samples will be obtained prior to receiving the first dose of study drug&#xD;
      and subsequently at the end of the study. The samples will be analyzed for 16S RNA and&#xD;
      metagenomic shotgun sequencing for microbiome composition. Gastric pH will be recorded on all&#xD;
      gastric samples. Demographics, nutrition variables, medications, and respiratory data will be&#xD;
      collected for all patients while enrolled in the study. An independent Drug Safety and&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor patient safety every 6 months and after any significant&#xD;
      adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. The primary outcomes will be study feasibility and incidence of clinically&#xD;
      significant UGI bleeding. Feasibility will be defined as: 1) &gt; 80% screening of eligible&#xD;
      patients, 2) &gt; 20% consent rate, 3) &gt; 80% receive timely first dose of study drug, and 4) &gt;&#xD;
      80% protocol adherence. Clinically significant UGI bleeding will be defined as new-onset&#xD;
      bleeding with subsequent pre-defined physiologic or hemodynamic changes. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of the study will be observed differences in the aerodigestive microbial diversity&#xD;
      between study groups, mortality, length of stay, duration of respiratory support, bleeding&#xD;
      events, incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and incidence of hospital-acquired infections&#xD;
      (ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infections,&#xD;
      catheter-associated urinary tract infections, superficial sternal infection or&#xD;
      mediastinitis).&#xD;
