  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the correlation between pre-obturation bacterial detection&#xD;
      using fluorescence amplification and outcome of endodontic treatments. Thus, enabling a&#xD;
      suitable detection threshold to predict the likelihood of treatment failure. This has the&#xD;
      potential to be used a bench side tool in general dental practice to act as a surrogate&#xD;
      endpoint for clinicians performing root canal treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-obturation root canal samples were taken using paper points from patients undergoing&#xD;
      primary root treatments. The samples were analyzed using a fluorescent spectrometer and a&#xD;
      molecular fluorescent vital dye (Calcein AM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative and 1-year post-operative periapical radiographs and Cone Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CBCT) scans were assessed by two calibrated expert examiners to evaluate the&#xD;
      outcome of the root canal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a chairside bacterial stain can allow the clinician to predict the outcome of&#xD;
      treatment with confidence. Sampling the root canal space with endodontic paper points&#xD;
      followed by ex-situ fluorescent staining and analysis provides a patient-friendly, simple to&#xD;
      use and rapid way of predicting root canal treatment outcome.&#xD;
