  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will test if adding nitric oxide (NO) gas to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)&#xD;
      circuit in infants undergoing an arterial switch operation (ASO) for Transposition of the&#xD;
      Great Arteries (TGA) changes the incidence of major postoperative adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major postoperative AEs include cardiac arrest, emergency chest opening, use of ECMO (machine&#xD;
      that acts as an artificial heart and lung during surgery), and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to receive oxygen plus nitric oxide (intervention arm) or&#xD;
      oxygen without nitric oxide (control arm) during CPB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) is approximately 1/100 live born children, of&#xD;
      which up to 50% require cardiac surgery to correct the underlying abnormality at some stage&#xD;
      during their life. (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, USA). Despite major&#xD;
      improvements in CPB devices, the exposure of host blood to large artificial organ surfaces,&#xD;
      combined with myocardial injury during planned myocardial ischemia, results in a significant&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response. CPB-triggered systemic inflammatory syndrome is responsible&#xD;
      for the most serious and potentially life-threatening side effects associated with cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. It is characterized by endotoxin release, leukocyte and complement activation, and&#xD;
      widespread activation of inflammatory mediators, resulting in endothelial leak, increased&#xD;
      oxygen consumption, and organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO is an endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator that helps to protect endothelial beds and&#xD;
      immunologically active cells. NO has a myocardial protective effect by reducing reperfusion&#xD;
      injury. NO generation is essential for regulation of endothelial function and microvascular&#xD;
      inflammation. However, dysregulation of endogenous NO during CPB may aggravate the subsequent&#xD;
      inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled study adding NO into the bypass circuit was conducted by the Royal&#xD;
      Children's Hospital in Melbourne on 198 children. This pilot study confirmed the positive&#xD;
      effects of gaseous NO reported in the U.S. trial, as well as a reduction in the incidence of&#xD;
      low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS). Other improved patient outcomes included a reduced need&#xD;
      for extracorporeal life support (ECLS), trends towards a reduced length of stay, and shorter&#xD;
      duration of ventilation. In light of these promising preliminary results from these two&#xD;
      separate studies, a large multicentre trial to test these findings in children requiring&#xD;
      cardiac surgery is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NASO study is running concurrently with the Nitric Oxide during Cardio Pulmonary Bypass&#xD;
      during surgery for congenital heart defects: A Randomised Controlled Trial study (ANZCTR&#xD;
      Trial Registry ID: ACTRN12617000821392) within Australia (run by Lady Cilento, Brisbane).&#xD;
      This study is aiming to look at the effects of Nitric Oxide on all children under the age of&#xD;
      2 years undergoing bypass surgery for CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TGA presents in 5-7% of all patients with congenital heart disease and isolated TGA is&#xD;
      managed in a similar manner all over the world. The surgical treatment for this is the ASO.&#xD;
      Hence this single operation and diagnosis provides an appropriate setting to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of NO in the CPB circuit. By allowing each centre to have their own protocols of&#xD;
      care (pre, intra and postoperatively) and only collecting 'routine clinical data&quot;, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate each centre having high rates of screening and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified by centre and by age at time of surgery. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention arm will receive NO 20 parts per million (ppm) into the oxygenator of a&#xD;
           cardio-pulmonary bypass circuit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm will not receive NO&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of CPB, the participants will return to the Intensive Care Unit where normal care&#xD;
      will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 800 participants will be enrolled in the study and will be stratified by centre&#xD;
      and age at time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims to investigate whether exposure to gaseous NO reduces the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative major adverse events in infants on cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
