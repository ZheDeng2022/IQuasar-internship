    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is most common occupational health problem among nurses. Therefore, how&#xD;
      to prevent and reduce low back pain have been the important issue for nurses. A&#xD;
      Quasi-Experimental design is used in this study to compare the effectiveness of 12-week&#xD;
      exercise and counselling program to reduce low back pain in nursing personnel compared with&#xD;
      counselling alone.&#xD;

      A Quasi-Experimental design is used in this study. Purposive sampling is used to recruit&#xD;
      participants from medical center in Central Taiwan. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      two groups: (1) exercise and back counselling, and (2) back counselling only. The results of&#xD;
      this study will provide a guideline for nurses to prevent and to improve low back pain.&#xD;
