  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 912 cases of ischemic stroke in 48 hours were included in 5 centers in China&#xD;
      according to the principle of random, double-blind and parallel control .The experimental&#xD;
      group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times per day&#xD;
      for 7 consecutive days .The control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times per day, 7 days in a row . Two groups will be&#xD;
      followed up for 90 days to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
