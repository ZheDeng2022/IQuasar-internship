  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a nonrandomized, unblinded, uncontrolled case series clinical trial validating&#xD;
      the SmartSleep product, including SleepMapper app in the home setting. It is intended to&#xD;
      provide data related to product use and cognitive testing incorporating a longer baseline&#xD;
      period for comparison purposes. It will include adults (21-50 yr. old) who are working full&#xD;
      time and report shortened sleep due to lifestyle. For the purposes of this study, shortened&#xD;
      sleep is defined as sleeping at least 5 hrs. of sleep per night, and sleeping less than or&#xD;
      equal to 7 hrs. at least 3 nights per week. Participants also increase their sleep duration&#xD;
      by ≥ 1 hour on the weekends. In addition, participants report a sleep latency ≤ 30 minutes&#xD;
      less than or equal to 3 nights per week. Participants are generally healthy individuals who&#xD;
      have not been diagnosed with any sleep-related medical conditions. In addition, participants&#xD;
      diagnosed with major organ system diseases or requiring oxygen therapy are excluded from&#xD;
      participation. Up to 75 individuals will be consented in order to complete a total of 50&#xD;
      participants using a nonrandomized design. The study involves an initial screening visit&#xD;
      followed by home use of the SmartSleep device with SleepMapper app. The home use will include&#xD;
      an initial week of baseline use followed by 3 weeks of use with boost on. Study staff will&#xD;
      contact participants after the first week of use as a reminder. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a battery of cognitive tests upon wake up each morning. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a question twice daily during the home use period. Additional phone calls may&#xD;
      occur on an as needed basis if issues arise. The final visit will be an in facility visit in&#xD;
      which all study equipment will be returned. The anticipated study duration will be up to 6&#xD;
      weeks (including the 4 weeks of use period).&#xD;

      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Screening) Procedures (up to 2 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to report to the research site for a daytime visit. A detailed&#xD;
      interview will be performed verifying eligibility criteria, as well as a review of work and&#xD;
      non-work schedules. After a full explanation of the protocol and after all the participants'&#xD;
      questions have been answered, they will be asked to sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the following baseline information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics Questionnaires Medical History Questionnaire Review of Current Medications&#xD;
      Height, Weight, Head Measurements Cognitive Assessment training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility confirmed, participants will be trained in the use of the SmartSleep device,&#xD;
      including pairing and syncing of the SleepMapper app&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Use (weeks 1-4) All participants will be asked to wear the device consecutively every&#xD;
      night. The anticipated study participation is expected to be one month of use (+ 2 weeks&#xD;
      based on participant schedule). All participants will wear the device for 1 week of baseline&#xD;
      use. Post one week of use (+/- 2 days), participants will the active mode. Participants will&#xD;
      continue nightly home use of the SmartSleep with boost enabled for the next 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the cognitive testing daily after wake up. Cognitive&#xD;
      tests should be performed at the same time each morning following the same routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the a question twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study if a participant's medical history or medication changes, they will be asked&#xD;
      to inform the study team. Participants will be asked during the course of the study if they&#xD;
      experience any discomfort, red marks, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study completion (final visit) Participants will be asked to return to the lab for a final&#xD;
      study visit. They will be asked to bring their study materials.&#xD;
