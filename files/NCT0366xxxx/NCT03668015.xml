  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chewing gum containing xylitol may help prevent caries by reducing levels of mutans&#xD;
      streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli in saliva and plaque. Very little is known about other&#xD;
      species which are possibly beneficial to oral health. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene to&#xD;
      profile microbial communities of saliva and plaque following short-term consumption of&#xD;
      xylitol and sorbitol containing chewing gum. Participants (n = 30) underwent a washout period&#xD;
      and were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each group chewed either xylitol or sorbitol&#xD;
      gum for 3 weeks, before undergoing a second four-week washout period after which they&#xD;
      switched to the alternate gum for three weeks.&#xD;

      Subjects: Study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committees of the UWI, St. Augustine.&#xD;
      Thirty healthy volunteers from The University of the West Indies (UWI), St. Augustine,&#xD;
      Trinidad were enrolled in the study. To be eligible, subjects must have had at least 20&#xD;
      teeth, provided written informed consent and been willing to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
      Subjects with systemic, infectious or inflammatory diseases or taking medicines, antibiotics&#xD;
      or fluoride in the last month, habitual consumers of xylitol / sorbitol-containing products&#xD;
      and mouth rinses, with abnormal salivary flow (&lt;1ml / min), pregnant, on contraceptive pills,&#xD;
      or with abnormal dietary habits were excluded. Consent obtained at the initial visit was&#xD;
      verified at the second visit, prior to sample collection. The subjects were examined in the&#xD;
      dental chair after thorough medical and dental histories were recorded. The clinical&#xD;
      examination involved examination of the soft tissues and then dental hard tissue charting for&#xD;
      presence of decayed, missing or filled teeth. No radiographs were used. The presence of&#xD;
      untreated dental caries or periodontitis were not used as exclusion criteria. The decayed,&#xD;
      missing, and filled teeth for each individual at the initial visit was documented for&#xD;
      calculation of the index of decayed-missing-filled permanent teeth (DMFT) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chewing gums: Xylitol gum (Epic Spearmint; 1.5g/pellet) designated Gum X contains 70% xylitol&#xD;
      in addition to gum base, natural flavors, soy lecithin, gum arabic, titanium dioxide, carnuba&#xD;
      wax. Gum S (Eclipse Spearmint), was similar except that xylitol was replaced by 63% sorbitol&#xD;
      and 2% maltitol and aspartame was included. Gums were packed in colour-coded containers.&#xD;
      Codes were kept confidential from the participants and researchers who interacted with them&#xD;
      until study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This prospective cross-over, double-blind, randomised study lasted 14 weeks&#xD;
      (March - June, 2015). Throughout, subjects were instructed not to use mouthwashes or xylitol&#xD;
      products, to consume a normal diet, continue their usual tooth brushing and to report use of&#xD;
      antimicrobial medications. Subjects reporting the latter were dropped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups, A and B (see Figure 1). Both groups entered a&#xD;
      4-week &quot;washout period&quot; during which no gum was chewed, followed by a 3-week treatment period&#xD;
      (treatment period 1) during which Group A used Gum X and Group B used Gum S (2 gum pieces, 3&#xD;
      times daily after meals for 6 minutes). Both groups then underwent another 4-week washout&#xD;
      period before entering treatment period 2 during which Group A used Gum S and Group B used&#xD;
      Gum X for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection: Saliva and plaque were collected from participants immediately before and&#xD;
      after each treatment period (Figure 1). Subjects were instructed not to brush their teeth or&#xD;
      use any other oral hygiene procedures at least 24 hours before sample collection, and not to&#xD;
      eat or drink at least 1 hour before. For saliva collection, subjects chewed sterile paraffin&#xD;
      wax and whole saliva produced was collected for 5 minutes in sterile tubes. The subject was&#xD;
      asked to drool into the labelled 50ml collection tube (Falcon sterile, conical polypropylene&#xD;
      tube with flat-top screw cap). This process was repeated multiple times in order to collect&#xD;
      larger volumes of saliva (2-5 ml). The saliva was transferred via sterile pipettes into&#xD;
      labelled sterile centrifuge tubes which were stored at -70˚C until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supragingival plaque was collected with a curette from 2 molars (#16 and #36), 2 premolars&#xD;
      (#24 and #44), and 2 incisors (#21 and #41); Plaque collection involved using a Gracey&#xD;
      curette to remove all of the supragingival plaque from the buccal surface of the selected&#xD;
      index tooth with as many strokes as necessary. The curette tip was immersed in the sterile&#xD;
      DNase-free Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer in the centrifuge tube for 4-5 seconds. The face of the&#xD;
      curette was wiped on the inside edge of the collection tube and then wiped off with sterile&#xD;
      gauze so as to not let the buffer on the tip go into patient's mouth. The site was then&#xD;
      immediately sampled again using the same procedure. The lid on the tube was replaced and then&#xD;
      the tube shaken for 4-5 seconds in an attempt to maximize dispersion of the specimen in the&#xD;
      fluid. The tube was immediately placed on ice in a Ziploc bag and stored at -70˚C until use.&#xD;
      Samples were labelled by group (A/B), treatment period (1/2), gum used (X/S in the case of&#xD;
      those samples collected at the end of a given treatment period) and type (saliva (s) or&#xD;
      plaque (p)). Samples (n=232) were then shipped on dry ice to the J. Craig Venter Institute&#xD;
      (JCVI) USA, La Jolla campus for DNA extraction and sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA extraction: Samples were thawed at 4˚C and vortexed thoroughly prior to DNA extraction&#xD;
      from 500ul of saliva or plaque suspension using bead beating Lysing Matrix B tubes (MPBio&#xD;
      Inc.), then lysozyme digest, phenol/chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol&#xD;
      precipitation. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 1x TE buffer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Library Preparation and Sequencing: DNA from each sample was quantified using a Nanodrop&#xD;
      spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, Waltham, MA). Amplicons were generated&#xD;
      using adaptor and barcode ligated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers targeting the V4&#xD;
      region of the 16S rDNA gene (16S) and purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen,&#xD;
      Inc) following manufacturer's instructions. Purified amplicons were quantified using SybrGold&#xD;
      (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, Waltham, MA), normalized to ensure equimolar quantities of&#xD;
      each sample, and pooled in preparation for Illumina MiSEQ sequencing. The 16S library pool&#xD;
      was sequenced using the Illumina MiSEQ dual index 2x250bp V2 chemistry kit according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16S RNA sequence data processing: Sequences for each sample were binned according to&#xD;
      corresponding dual indices and exported as individual .fastq files using CASAVA v1.8.2&#xD;
      (Illumina Inc. La Jolla, CA). Sequences were processed to ensure that only quality sequences&#xD;
      were retained, as stringent settings were kept to ensure no barcode mismatches were permitted&#xD;
      during demultiplexing. Processed sequences were applied to the Infernal pipeline [35] for&#xD;
      additional quality control (QC) checks. Bacterial sequences were taxonomically assigned based&#xD;
      on the Genomic-based 16S ribosomal RNA Database (GRD; http://metasystems.riken.jp/grd/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses. Distribution by age, sex and DMFT score for subjects in groups A and B&#xD;
      were compared using independent-samples T- test, Pearson's Chi-Squared test and Wilcoxon rank&#xD;
      sum test respectively, with a cut-off of p &lt;0.05. To avoid possible sequence errors,&#xD;
      operational taxonomic unit (OTU) count tables were filtered such that OTUs present in fewer&#xD;
      than 0.1% in all samples were discarded. OTU tables were then transformed to relative&#xD;
      abundances before community analyses were performed using the R statistical computing&#xD;
      language (Cite R). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess statistical significance in&#xD;
      microbial community composition across treatments. Wilcoxon test was used for pairwise&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
