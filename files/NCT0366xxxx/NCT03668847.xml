  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      4-Demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN) is a polychlorinated pyridyl&#xD;
      cholesterol carbonate that is lipophilic, electrically neural, crosses the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB), ability to localize in intracranial tumor tissue, lacks neurotoxicity and not&#xD;
      transported out of the brain via Pgp (p-glycoprotein). DM-CHOC-PEN has completed a Phase I&#xD;
      Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) trial in humans, some of which possessed primary and&#xD;
      secondary tumors involving the brain. Complete remissions in both primary (astrocytoma, GBM)&#xD;
      and metastatic lung cancers were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase II trial is open for adolescent and young adults (AYA) subjects with advanced&#xD;
      cancer - brain involvement is required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this Phase II AYA oncology clinical trial will be to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of 4-demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN), as anticancer&#xD;
      therapy in AYA individuals with advanced cancer involving the central or spinal nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS &amp; SNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryloxycarbonate that crosses the blood&#xD;
      brain barrier (BBB), accumulates in CNS tumor tissue in humans and has produced objective&#xD;
      responses, with acceptable/reversible hepatic toxicities (in patients with prior liver&#xD;
      disease) and no evidence of hematological, renal, neuro-toxicities with improved quality of&#xD;
      life and overall survival in adolescent, young adult and adult Phase I/II clinical trials -&#xD;
      IND - 68,876.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA supports the proposed Phase II clinical trial designed to identify safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in AYA cancers subjects now that the Phase I AYA trial has been completed with&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity and MTDs identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost 700,000 people in the US are living with tumors involving the CNS or spinal nervous&#xD;
      system (SNS) tumors. Nearly 15% of these tumors involve the adolescent/young adult (AYA)&#xD;
      population, aged 15-39 years of age. It is predicted that 10,617 AYA individuals will be&#xD;
      diagnosed with brain or CNS tumors resulting in 434 deaths this year in the US. Trends in CNS&#xD;
      tumors have sharply increased since 1989 for AYA individuals with a history of cancer, who&#xD;
      appeared to have 'beaten the odds', only to have a re-occurrence from cancer involving the&#xD;
      CNS after years of remission; the most common types of cancer in AYA individuals are -&#xD;
      melanoma, leukemia and sarcomas. This group of individuals deserves special attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For males and female individuals &lt;20 years of age, primary brain and secondary cancers of the&#xD;
      CNS and spinal nervous system (SNS) are the most common causes of death from cancer and in&#xD;
      the 20-39 year age group the first cause of cancer-related deaths in males and the fifth&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related deaths in females. The incidence and histology of cancer types does&#xD;
      vary according to subject age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical component in designing an agent that will cross the protective blood brain barrier&#xD;
      (BBB) is that the agent must be readily transported intracerebrally, does not produce local&#xD;
      irritation/neurotoxicity and is not recycled back into the general circulation. After IV&#xD;
      administration DM-CHOC-PEN readily penetrates the BBB, is not a substrate for the transporter&#xD;
      protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and has shown anticancer activity in CNS tumors. The effective&#xD;
      transport of DM-CHOC-PEN into CNS tumors in adults without neurotic behavioral alterations&#xD;
      and associated events supports the drug's use in children with CNS tumors at an age in which&#xD;
      brain development and maturation is still very active with cognitive lability. The observed&#xD;
      responses noted in adults with metastatic cancers involving the CNS and cerebellum treated&#xD;
      with DM-CHOC-PEN may also occur in medulloblastoma in AYA. Thus, the drug's unique properties&#xD;
      and lack of toxicities noted in the adult studies merits the Phase I trial proposed here in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this Phase I study will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a Phase II clinical trial with DM-CHOC-PEN in AYA individuals that have advanced&#xD;
           cancers with central or spinal nervous systems involvements and monitor safety and&#xD;
           document anticancer activity for the drug. All data will be communicated through an&#xD;
           e-RAP program. This will be accomplished through IND - 68.876.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verify the pharmacokinetic/dynamic profiles of DM-CHOC-PEN and metabolites in AYA&#xD;
           subjects with advanced cancers involving the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze data and prepare an Orphan Drug Designated package for FDA submission for AYA&#xD;
           subjects with CNS involvement from cancer for review.&#xD;
