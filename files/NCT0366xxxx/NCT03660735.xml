    <textblock>
      Many IVF clinics offer testing for immune cells in the blood and endometrium as it has been&#xD;
      suggested that abnormal levels of these cells can affect fertility or the chance of an IVF&#xD;
      cycle working. However, routinely offering these tests remains highly controversial as the&#xD;
      scientific evidence behind the tests is not of a high quality. The PIP Study aims to find out&#xD;
      how a woman's blood and endometrial immune cells affect the likelihood of an IVF cycle&#xD;
      working and whether or not they are different in women with subfertility and implantation&#xD;
      failure. This feasibility study aims to find out if it is possible to enrol enough women into&#xD;
      the research study. If this is successful, the investigators will then go on to recruit a&#xD;
      larger group of women into the main PIP study to enable them to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      immune profiling on IVF success in more detail.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although there are examples of autoimmune associated pregnancy pathology, notably the&#xD;
      anti-phospholipid syndrome (1), robust evidence of immune mediated pregnancy failure is&#xD;
      limited. However for many years there have been persistent reports of a possible association&#xD;
      between 'abnormal' levels of peripheral or endometrial immune cell populations (predominantly&#xD;
      NK cells), altered cell function or cytokine production (by NK and T cells) and subfertility,&#xD;
      recurrent failed implantation or recurrent miscarriage (2-5). Many fertility clinics offer&#xD;
      testing for a variety of peripheral blood immune cell parameters (NK cell numbers,&#xD;
      cytotoxicity assays, Tregs, cytokine assays, etc) or endometrial parameters (most commonly NK&#xD;
      cell numbers). Furthermore, treatments including corticosteroids, immunoglobulin,&#xD;
      intralipids, biologic agents (e.g.: anti-TNFÎ± therapy) are commonly offered to treat&#xD;
      'abnormal' results. The testing and treatment of immune mediated subfertility and&#xD;
      implantation failure remains highly controversial for a number of reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To date there is little evidence that blood or endometrial immune cell numbers,&#xD;
           activation status or function, are associated with either implantation failure or&#xD;
           successful IVF treatment (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is little evidence in the literature as to normal parameters of endometrial or&#xD;
           blood immune cell populations in fertile women. Of note, a recent meta-analysis (6) of&#xD;
           blood NK cells describes a total of 106 fertile controls and compares them to 249 women&#xD;
           who were either subfertile or had recurrent implantation failure. This is the largest&#xD;
           dataset of controls however the 6 included studies vary in how the cells were measured&#xD;
           and therefore pooling these data is of limited value. Studies assessing endometrial NK&#xD;
           cells comprised only 20 fertile women and 40 subfertile women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The majority of studies compare a pathology (e.g.: Recurrent Implantation Failure (RIF))&#xD;
           with controls but do not have outcome data of the subsequent IVF cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. It is often argued that blood testing can be of no value as the immune cell populations&#xD;
           in the endometrium are phenotypically and functionally different to those in the&#xD;
           periphery (7). However the majority of clinical testing is done in blood. There are only&#xD;
           a few small studies that compare endometrial and blood parameters in the same patients&#xD;
           with no evidence to date that blood NK cells reflect the endometrial NK population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence above describes the limited data on which routine clinical testing is performed.&#xD;
      Added to which, there are no high quality Randomised Controlled Trials showing evidence of&#xD;
      benefit for the treatments that are used. In this study the investigators propose to describe&#xD;
      in detail normal endometrial and blood immune cell parameters as this has not previously been&#xD;
      done in a large population In order to achieve this, women who are undergoing a first cycle&#xD;
      or second cycle of IVF for male factor subfertility requiring Intracytoplasmic Sperm&#xD;
      injection (ICSI) will be recruited. Those women who go on to have a live birth will be&#xD;
      considered to be fertile controls (as their reason for IVF was a male factor and pregnancy&#xD;
      was achieved at the first attempt). A sub-group of such participants will be used to describe&#xD;
      the normal population (with standard deviations) and to use as a control group to compare to&#xD;
      pathologies (RIF and subfertility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to recruit broadly to the study-250 women overall but they have not&#xD;
      defined a recruitment target for each group so that they can, at the end of the feasibility&#xD;
      study identify the proportions of the 250 women who fall into each subgroup. Depending on the&#xD;
      findings the investigators may need to target specific groups in the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the feasibility study is to determine the recruitment rate in the screened&#xD;
      population for a larger fully powered study. The investigators will recruit all women under&#xD;
      the age of 40 (at time of egg collection) from IVI clinics in the UK and the Wolfson&#xD;
      Fertility Centre who are eligible and wish to recruit to the study. Within this population of&#xD;
      recruits there will be three specific groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women in a first or second cycle of IVF for male factor subfertility requiring ICSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women with a history of RIF (using the definition described in (8))&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any women with a history of at least 1 year of subfertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion in the study will require women to undertake a single visit to have a blood sample&#xD;
      and an endometrial biopsy during the mid-luteal phase of the cycle before IVF treatment.&#xD;
      There are minimal risks (besides the small risk of bruising and discomfort) from blood tests.&#xD;
      Endometrial biopsy (known clinically as an endometrial 'scratch') is a procedure that is&#xD;
      commonly undertaken prior to IVF treatment, as there is evidence that a scratch increases the&#xD;
      pregnancy rate in the subsequent IVF cycle (9). Endometrial biopsy causes some discomfort at&#xD;
      the time of the procedure but has no significant risks to participants.&#xD;
