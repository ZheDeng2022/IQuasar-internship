      This study is a phase 1 non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel-group study of PF&#xD;
      04965842 in subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects without renal impairment (Part&#xD;
      1) and in subjects with moderate renal impairment (Part 2).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 non randomized, open label, single dose, parallel cohort, multisite study&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of PF-04965842 after a single 200 mg oral dose. Subjects will be selected and&#xD;
      categorized into normal renal function or renal impairment groups based on their estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate. Part 1: A total of approximately16 subjects will be enrolled;&#xD;
      approximately 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and approximately 8 with normal renal&#xD;
      function. After statistical evaluation of results from Part 1, Part 2 may be conducted and&#xD;
      approximately 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment will be enrolled. The total duration&#xD;
      of participation from the Screening Visit to Day 4 will be a maximum of 31 days and from the&#xD;
      Screening Visit to Follow-up Contact/Visit will be a maximum of 67 days.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events (AEs): any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a product or medical device, without regard to causality. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs): AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Treatment-related TEAEs were any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study treatment. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

        <description>Adverse events (AEs): any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a product or medical device, without regard to causality. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs): AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Treatment-related TEAEs were any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study treatment. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>
