  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess&#xD;
      the effects of daily 4-gram marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (MO3PUFA), through&#xD;
      treatment with AMR101 (VASCEPA, icosapent ethyl) on the tumor immune microenvironment and gut&#xD;
      microbiome in patients who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer or with a colorectal mass or&#xD;
      polyp suspected to be a cancer or advanced adenoma and will undergo surgical resection or&#xD;
      interventional endoscopy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). It uses the novel&#xD;
      &quot;window-of-opportunity&quot; clinical trial design to take advantage of the window of time between&#xD;
      cancer/mass/polyp diagnosis and surgery to examine the effect of therapeutic agents on tumor&#xD;
      pathologic and molecular features unperturbed by prior therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effect of AMR101, as a chemopreventive agent to reduce&#xD;
      risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of colorectal cancer, colorectal mass&#xD;
      or polyp(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMR101 is made of marine omega-3 fatty acid, which is a family of natural substances found in&#xD;
      the oil of certain fish, such as salmon and mackerel. Marine omega-3 fatty acid cannot be&#xD;
      produced in sufficient amount by the human body and has to be obtained through diet or&#xD;
      supplemented to maintain normal function in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AMR101 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease. AMR101 is commercially available in the US as VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits during which participants will complete a lifestyle&#xD;
      questionnaire and a nutritional survey. A drug diary will be provided to be completed.&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken, and blood and stool specimens will be collected. Tumor,&#xD;
      colorectal mass, or polyp tissue will be collected for research purposes at the time of&#xD;
      surgery or interventional endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMR101 administered daily, orally for up to 30 days and it is expected that 36 participants&#xD;
      will take part in this study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon that is localized,&#xD;
        with no evidence of distant metastasis (stage I, II, or III), and for which surgical&#xD;
        resection of the primary tumor is being planned;&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants may have a colon biopsy that is suspicious for adenocarcinoma if clinical&#xD;
        and/or endoscopic findings strongly support the presence of malignancy, and if surgical&#xD;
        resection is being planned. NOTE: In the unlikely event that the final pathology of the&#xD;
        surgical resection specimen is consistent with high-grade adenoma or dysplasia, the patient&#xD;
        will not be considered ineligible and collected research samples will still be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants have a diagnosis of a colorectal mass or polyp suspected to be a cancer or&#xD;
        advanced adenoma at the most recent colonoscopy and are being referred to an advanced&#xD;
        endoscopist to undergo interventional endoscopy within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis in&#xD;
        children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with distinct&#xD;
        biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status â¤2 (Karnofsky â¥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be sufficiently healthy to undergo surgery/interventional endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of&#xD;
        child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
        study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible&#xD;
        for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior systemic or radiotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent use of other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy agents, targeted&#xD;
        agents, biological agents, immunotherapy, or investigational agents not otherwise specified&#xD;
        in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of malabsorption or uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea, or any other disease that&#xD;
        could interfere with absorption of oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergic reactions attributed to fish or compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
        biologic composition to MO3PUFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently using or have used any fish oil supplement at any dose more than once per week&#xD;
        within the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Regularly consuming more than three servings of fish per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known bleeding tendency/condition (e.g. von Willebrand disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapies, including aspirin and other&#xD;
        nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen [Advil, Motrin], Naproxen&#xD;
        [Aleve, Anaprox DS, Naprosyn], and Celecoxib [Celebrex]), Heparin, Warfarin, Dalteparin&#xD;
        sodium, Bivalirudin, Argatroban, Lepirudin, Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and an&#xD;
        unwillingness or inability to discontinue anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator, may increase the risks associated with study participation or study&#xD;
        treatment, limit compliance with study requirements, or interfere with the interpretation&#xD;
        of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of&#xD;
        child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier&#xD;
        method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
        participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is&#xD;
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
        Similarly, lactating women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but&#xD;
        potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother&#xD;
        with AMR101. Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled&#xD;
        on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of synchronous (at the same time) malignancy for which the patient is currently&#xD;
        receiving active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or acute or&#xD;
        chronic hepatitis B infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with these infections are ineligible because they are at increased risk of&#xD;
        significant complications in the perioperative period, and because fresh tissue from&#xD;
        patients with these infections cannot be harvested for research purposes, per institutional&#xD;
        policy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination&#xD;
        antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of Women and Minorities&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women and minorities will be eligible for this study without alteration in eligibility&#xD;
        criteria. Enrollment of these underrepresented populations to this trial will be&#xD;
        encouraged.&#xD;
