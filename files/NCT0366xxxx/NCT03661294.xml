      It is recognised that weight gain is a common problem in patients with a spinal cord injury&#xD;
      and can lead to an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome. Weight gain is thought to be&#xD;
      attributed to excess calorie intake, reduction in energy requirements and / or a reduction in&#xD;
      exercise. However, further understanding of this energy imbalance needs to be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will initially determine if it is feasible to measure the 'actual'&#xD;
      energy requirements of 15 paraplegic and 15 tetraplegic (ventilated and non-ventilated)&#xD;
      in-patients during bed rest and rehabilitation following acute SCI. This preliminary data&#xD;
      will be compared to 'predicted' energy expenditure levels. The calorie intake and body&#xD;
      composition for each patient will be measured as well as factors indicative of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. The study will initially provide statistical information in order to estimate the&#xD;
      sample size required for a future definitive study.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are an estimated 40,000 people living with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) in the UK alone&#xD;
      (http://www.apparelyzed.com/statistics.html). Although there have been improvements in&#xD;
      medical care, mortality rates are still elevated compared to the able-bodied population. The&#xD;
      most common underlying and contributing causes of death in SCI patients are diseases of the&#xD;
      circulatory and respiratory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recognised that weight gain is a common problem in patients with a SCI, typically&#xD;
      occurring within the first year of rehabilitation and continuing life long. SCI patients have&#xD;
      been shown to have an increased fat mass, waist circumference and altered lipid profile.&#xD;
      Obesity in SCI patients can lead to an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient weight gain is thought to be attributed to the reduction in energy expenditure&#xD;
      compared to pre-injury levels, the loss of voluntary muscle use below the spinal cord lesion&#xD;
      and reduction in lean tissue mass. It has been shown that the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of&#xD;
      SCI patients is lower than predicted, with the greatest difference being for high&#xD;
      tetraplegics. Findings suggest there is an overestimation of energy requirements in a small&#xD;
      population of medically stable SCI patients. In addition, SCI calorie and protein intake is&#xD;
      high in this patient population, suggesting that patients are also exceeding their&#xD;
      nutritional recommendations. Excess calorie intake, reduction in energy requirement and / or&#xD;
      a reduction in exercise will predispose the SCI patient to weight gain and obesity. Further&#xD;
      understanding of this energy imbalance needs to be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single centre feasibility study will initially determine if it is feasible to measure&#xD;
      the 'actual' energy requirements of paraplegic and tetraplegic (ventilated and&#xD;
      non-ventilated) in-patients during bed rest and rehabilitation following acute SCI. This&#xD;
      preliminary data will be compared to 'predicted' energy expenditure levels. The calorie&#xD;
      intake and body composition for each patient will be measured as well as factors indicative&#xD;
      of metabolic syndrome. The study will initially provide statistical information in order to&#xD;
      estimate the sample size required for a future definitive study on energy expenditure and&#xD;
      development of metabolic syndrome in SCI patients. In addition, the feasibility study will&#xD;
      address patient recruitment rates and reasons for withdrawal from the study and highlight any&#xD;
      practicality issues with study conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 acute paraplegic and 15 acute tetraplegic (ventilated and non-ventilated) inpatients will&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be performed at bed rest, early mobilisation and hospital&#xD;
      discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Actual Energy Expenditure Actual resting energy expenditure (REE) is&#xD;
      determined by measuring the oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production of a patient at&#xD;
      rest using the GE Healthcare metabolic oxygenator. During the test, the individual is&#xD;
      interfaced with a metabolic measurement system by means of a facemask. For ventilated&#xD;
      patients, the monitor will be used with a cuffed tracheostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Software will be used to calculate the respiratory quotient (RQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculating Predicted Energy Requirements Henry equations are used to predict the basal&#xD;
      metabolic rate. Adjustments are made based on metabolic stress associated with illness and&#xD;
      for obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining Dietary Intake The patient's dietary intake will be reported using the standard&#xD;
      hospital food charts. These will be completed for all food and fluids taken providing an&#xD;
      indication of portion sizes. The charts will be kept for 3 consecutive days at each time&#xD;
      point and is based on a pragmatic approach to improve accuracy of completion over a short&#xD;
      period of time whilst still providing daily variations in intake. Data will be collected so&#xD;
      that it covers at least one day of a weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements will be taken to determine patient body fat and muscle. The&#xD;
      following parameters will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tricep Skinfold Thickness (TSF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mid Arm Muscle Circumference (MAMC) will be calculated using the equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAMC = MUAC - 3.14 x TSF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Syndrome Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BMI Calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood Pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Waist Circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fasting glucose, HDL, triglycerides&#xD;
