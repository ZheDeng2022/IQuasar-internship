  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After breast cancer (BC) screening was introduced for all Swedish women in 1989-90 the number&#xD;
      of early invasive BC, clin N0 rose dramatically. For these BC it was known that only 10 % or&#xD;
      less was N+ after axillary dissection and the morbidity for axillary surgery was substantial.&#xD;
      Omitting axillary dissection in a randomized trial was ruled out because of anticipated few&#xD;
      events. A national cohort was decided for invasive unifocal BC, histological grade 1 or 2,&#xD;
      T=max 10mm, free margins, clin node neg. No axillary dissection should be undertaken. This&#xD;
      was before the Sentinel Node era. Adjuvant treatment could be given according to regional&#xD;
      guidelines for early breast cancer. Not uniform concerning postoperative radiotherapy and&#xD;
      antihormonal treatment. Follow-up was clinical the first 5 years with mammography and then by&#xD;
      hospital records and national Death register. Primary aim: Number of axillary recurrence and&#xD;
      BC specific survival.&#xD;

      After national breast cancer screening was introduced in Sweden in 1989-90 the number of&#xD;
      early invasive BC, clin N0 rose dramatically. Only 10 % or less of these was N+ after&#xD;
      axillary dissection with a substantial morbidity after the axillary intervention. Omitting&#xD;
      axillary dissection in a randomized trial was ruled out because of anticipated few events. A&#xD;
      national cohort was decided for invasive unifocal BC, Screening or clinical diagnosis were&#xD;
      eligible, only histological grade 1 or 2, T=max 10mm, free margins , clinical node negative.&#xD;
      No axillary dissection should be undertaken, only radical removal of the breast cancer.&#xD;
      (Note; This was before the Sentinel Node era). Adjuvant treatment could be given according to&#xD;
      regional guidelines for early breast cancer as no regular national guidelines existed then&#xD;
      concerning postoperative radiotherapy and antihormonal treatment. Chemotherapy was not&#xD;
      recommended to this type of breast cancer. Follow-up was done by the treating surgeon the&#xD;
      first 5 years including mammography. Then hospital records including mammography and reports&#xD;
      from Pathology and Oncology and Death register were followed at intervals 5, 10 and 15 years.&#xD;
      Primary aim: Number of axillary recurrence and distant metastases/ BC specific survival.&#xD;
      Correlation to adjuvant therapy. Inclusion started in 1997 and ended in 2002. 1584 patients&#xD;
      were included. If the axillary recurrence rate was more than 1% per year the first five years&#xD;
      the inclusion should be stopped.&#xD;

        In five out of six regions in Sweden (West was involved in another international trial)&#xD;
        patients were selected at the local breast cancer conference as eligible in this cohort&#xD;
        (study approved by the Ethical board and the Swedish Breast cancer group) and then informed&#xD;
        by the surgeon. If the patient accepted the patient was included (registered at the&#xD;
        regional Cancer Registry) and the primary breast surgery was done without any axillary&#xD;
        dissection. Follow-up included regular visits to the breast cancer unit and yearly&#xD;
        mammography for 5-10 years and then biannually to 74 years of age. Thereafter only hospital&#xD;
        records (including surgery, oncology and pathology) were reviewed at intervals as were the&#xD;
        national Death registry. Median age at study start was 60 years.&#xD;
