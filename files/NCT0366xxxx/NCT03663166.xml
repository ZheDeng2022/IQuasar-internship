    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if Stage III NSCLC patients treated with ipilimumab with thoracic&#xD;
      radiation therapy followed by nivolumab monotherapy every 4 weeks for up to 12 months show an&#xD;
      improved 12-month Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate compared with a 12-month historical&#xD;
      PFS rate of 49% among patients treated in a similar fashion with concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Unacceptable toxicity status at the end of 8-week safety observation period</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Unacceptable toxicity defined as:&#xD;
Any grade 4 immune related adverse event (irAE)&#xD;
Any grade 3 irAE, excluding pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to grade 2 within 7 days after onset of the event despite optimal medical management including systemic corticosteroids or does not downgrade to ≤ grade 1 or baseline within 14 days&#xD;
Liver transaminase elevation &gt; 8 × ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 5 × ULN,&#xD;
Any ≥ grade 3 non-irAE, with some exclusions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>12 month Progression Free Survival (PFS) status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration from date of registration to date of first documentation of progression assessed by local investigator or symptomatic deterioration (as defined in Outcome 1) or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive without report of progression are censored at date of last disease assessment. For patients with a missing scan (or consecutive missing scans) whose subsequent scan determines progression, the expected date of the first missing scan (as defined by the disease assessment schedule) will be used as the date of progression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>12 month distant metastasis free survival (DMFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>DMFS is defined as the duration from date of registration to date of first documentation of distant metastatic progression beyond the primary tumor site as well as regional lymph nodes assessed by local investigator or symptomatic deterioration (as defined in Outcome 1) or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive without report of distant metastatic progression are censored at date of last disease assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of all treated subjects whose best overall response is either a complete response or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Best Objective Response (BOR) will also be reported Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) determinations included in the assessment must be confirmed by a consecutive second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response that is performed at least 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. When Stable Disease (SD) is believed to be the best response, it must meet a minimum SD duration of 49 days. Measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry.</description>
