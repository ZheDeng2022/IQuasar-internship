  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of people seeking treatment for drug and alcohol issues also have&#xD;
      clinically significant depression symptoms. This combination of problems tends to have a&#xD;
      negative impact on treatment and leads to poor health and disability, yet relatively few&#xD;
      studies have focused on the development of interventions for treating this comorbidity. There&#xD;
      is emerging evidence to suggest that Behavioural Activation (BA) may be a viable and&#xD;
      cost-effective treatment for comorbid depression and substance use problems, however more&#xD;
      research is needed in order to establish its effectiveness in routine practice. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is therefore to investigate the efficacy of a brief (6-session), manualised BA&#xD;
      intervention among service users with depression who are accessing Community Drugs and&#xD;
      Alcohol treatment. We are planning to recruit up to 128 service users who are actively using&#xD;
      substances to be randomly assigned to either the 6-week BA intervention or Treatment as Usual&#xD;
      in Community Drugs and Alcohol services. These participants will be recruited from either a&#xD;
      Community Drugs and Alcohol service or a Community Mental Health service. Our research will&#xD;
      assess whether the BA intervention is more effective than usual care in (1) reducing&#xD;
      depression symptoms, (2) reducing substance use, and (3) improving treatment engagement (i.e.&#xD;
      session attendance). We expect that our results will establish the efficacy of integrating BA&#xD;
      for depression into routine Community Drugs and Alcohol Treatment.&#xD;

      RATIONALE Over 50% of treatment-seeking substance users present with clinically significant&#xD;
      depression symptoms (Johnson, Neal, Brems, &amp; Fisher, 2006). This combination of problems&#xD;
      tends to complicate treatment (e.g. Carroll et al., 1993) resulting in greater functional&#xD;
      impairment (Johnson et al., 1995) and poor health outcomes (Hasin et al., 2002). Treatment&#xD;
      protocols for co-occurring mental health and substance misuse have traditionally focused on&#xD;
      treating these issues separately, however there is now increasing consensus that integrated&#xD;
      approaches to treatment are more effective (Davidson et al., 2010) and subsequently a growing&#xD;
      interest into how targeted mental health support can be incorporated into standard drug and&#xD;
      alcohol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT is deemed to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for depression, though&#xD;
      may be too complex and time-consuming for effective delivery in routine CDAT. Emerging&#xD;
      evidence suggests that a more suitable intervention in this context may be Behavioural&#xD;
      Activation (BA); a brief, manualised intervention which targets depression symptoms by&#xD;
      increasing engagement in rewarding, values-based activities (Lejuez, Hopko, Acierno,&#xD;
      Daughters, &amp; Pagoto, 2011). Indeed, previous studies have found that BA is associated with&#xD;
      reductions in both depression symptoms and substance use (Daughters et al., 2018; Daughters&#xD;
      et al., 2008; Delgadillo et al., 2015), as well as improved treatment retention among&#xD;
      substance misuse service users with comorbid depression (Magidson et al., 2011). The only&#xD;
      known trial of BA in UK Community Drugs and Alcohol Treatment (CDAT) was conducted by&#xD;
      Delgadillo and colleagues (2015), however this study was under-powered and employed qualified&#xD;
      mental health practitioners to deliver the intervention which may be too costly or unfeasible&#xD;
      to implement in routine practice. More research is needed to establish the efficacy of BA in&#xD;
      CDAT services, and given that BA may be delivered effectively with minimal training by staff&#xD;
      who are not formally trained as psychological therapists (Ekers et al., 2008), it seems that&#xD;
      the most suitable and cost-effective way of integrating BA into routine drug and alcohol&#xD;
      treatment would be to upskill the existing workforce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, given the high prevalence and impact of comorbid depression among addiction&#xD;
      service users, along with evidence to suggest that BA is an effective and acceptable&#xD;
      intervention for treating this population, the present study will expand on previous research&#xD;
      by conducting a trial to evaluate the efficacy of BA delivered by trained drugs and alcohol&#xD;
      workers in a sample of patients accessing treatment for substance use. The central research&#xD;
      question is: How effective is Behavioural Activation for treating depression in substance&#xD;
      users compared to treatment as usual in Community Drugs and Alcohol services?&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the efficacy of brief one-to-one manualised BA delivered by trained drugs and&#xD;
           alcohol workers in a CDAT setting in terms of depression outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of delivering manualised BA in this setting in terms of substance&#xD;
           use and engagement (attendance and dropout rates) outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who receive the BA intervention will show improvements in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Depression symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Substance use&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment Engagement (sessions attended, % dropout)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS If the BA intervention is found to be more effective than the usual&#xD;
      care offered in CDAT services, this trial will provide evidence for the intervention to be&#xD;
      implemented in routine practice. Even if the BA intervention is not found to be more&#xD;
      effective, the results of this study will contribute to understanding of what works and what&#xD;
      doesn't work in this setting, which can be used to inform the development of future&#xD;
      interventions aimed at addressing co-occurring substance use and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This study is a pragmatic, parallel group, randomised controlled trial assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy of BA compared to treatment as usual (TAU) for patients with depression who are&#xD;
      accessing CDAT services. Outcome measures will be taken at baseline, 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-weeks&#xD;
      to enable the comparison of relative efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD Participants will be recruited from CDAT services in the UK. They will be working age&#xD;
      adults (18-65) with mild to moderate depression who are actively using substances. The study&#xD;
      aims to recruit 142 participants in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE Drugs and alcohol workers in CDAT services will employ a step-wise mental health&#xD;
      screening strategy as part of routine practice in order to identify potential participants.&#xD;
      This strategy involves routinely completing TOP and brief mental health questionnaires&#xD;
      sequentially in order to identify patients with common mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be provided with an information sheet and asked for permission to&#xD;
      pass their details on to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting participants will be contacted by a member of the research team within one week to&#xD;
      conduct eligibility screening and obtain informed consent. Participants will be aware of&#xD;
      confidentiality arrangements for the study, that their participation is voluntary and that&#xD;
      they have the right to withdraw at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent to participate has been established, the identified clients' details will be&#xD;
      passed on to an independent administrator for randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated into one of two arms ('BA Intervention' or 'Treatment&#xD;
      as Usual'). Participants randomised to Treatment as Usual will continue to receive their&#xD;
      usual care at the CDAT service. Participants randomised to the BA intervention will receive 6&#xD;
      x weekly one-to-one sessions of BA plus 2 booster sessions at 2-3 and 4-5 weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment. BA will be delivered by drugs and alcohol workers who have completed 2 days&#xD;
      of training in delivering the BA intervention. Staff delivering the intervention will also&#xD;
      receive an extra hour of supervision once per month with a supervisor-trained supervisor&#xD;
      which will be focused on delivery of the BA intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure fidelity to the BA treatment protocol, drugs and alcohol workers delivering the BA&#xD;
      intervention will complete a checklist at the end of each session indicating their adherence&#xD;
      to the session protocol, with the checklist for each session highlighting specific session&#xD;
      objectives. Additionally, drugs and alcohol workers will be asked to audiotape at least two&#xD;
      of their sessions at random over the course of the study. Audiotaped therapy sessions will be&#xD;
      rated using the rating scales from Magidson and colleagues' (2011) study by an independent&#xD;
      evaluator with an understanding of behavioural activation strategies. Independent evaluators&#xD;
      will be Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners with experience of delivering BA, the Study&#xD;
      Coordinator, or students under the supervision of the Study Coordinator. Issues of&#xD;
      non-adherence will be considered a training implication representative of areas for&#xD;
      improvement to be addressed via standard supervisory procedures. Non-adherence will not&#xD;
      preclude data inclusion for the purposes of this study; instead it will be addressed as a&#xD;
      limitation of the study related to therapist experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS Screening, recruitment, random allocation and treatment engagement (including&#xD;
      dropout) data will be summarised using a CONSORT diagram. The integrity of randomisation,&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics will be assessed by comparing between groups and&#xD;
      between recruitment sites using appropriate statistical tests. Loss to follow-up has been&#xD;
      estimated at 20% based on a previous feasibility study of BA conducted in this setting&#xD;
      (Delgadillo et al., 2015). Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted using Last&#xD;
      Observation Carried Forward method in order to account for the loss to follow-up. Secondary&#xD;
      to this, we will analyse the data only with participants who completed all of the follow-up&#xD;
      assessments in order to check that findings were not unduly affected by attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will calculate and report standardised effect sizes for depression outcome (PHQ-9) using&#xD;
      Cohen's d. Severity of depression at 12-week follow-up will be considered the main outcome&#xD;
      for the calculation of effect sizes; although we will also report 6- and 24-week follow up&#xD;
      data for comparison. Severity of depression at 12-week follow-up will be compared&#xD;
      between-groups using Analysis of Covariance with participant's pre-treatment scores on the&#xD;
      PHQ-9 used as covariates. This is to counter potential baseline variance in depression that&#xD;
      may influence results and was considered robust for relatively small sample sizes in a&#xD;
      similar study of BA (Ekers et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both intervention and control groups, we will present the proportions of participants who&#xD;
      had reliable and clinically significant change (RCSC) in depression status at 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      weeks. The RCSC outcome definition (Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991) has been recommended as a&#xD;
      standard reporting strategy for all published research involving psychological interventions&#xD;
      (Evans et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-post changes scores will also be calculated and reported for substance use outcomes&#xD;
      (Percent Days Abstinent and Severity of Dependence). Percent days abstinent will be&#xD;
      considered the primary substance use outcome. We will calculate and report standardised&#xD;
      effect sizes for percent days abstinent at 12-week follow-up using Cohen's d, with 6- and&#xD;
      24-week follow-up data reported for comparison. Percent days abstinent at 12-week follow-up&#xD;
      will then be compared between groups using Analysis of Covariance, with participant's&#xD;
      pre-treatment scores on the SDS entered as a covariate to account for potential baseline&#xD;
      variance in severity of dependence that may influence results. Changes in SDS scores pre-post&#xD;
      treatment will be compared between groups using Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both intervention and control groups, we will present the proportions of participants who&#xD;
      had reliable and clinically significant change (RCSC) in percent days abstinent and severity&#xD;
      of dependence at 6, 12 and 24 weeks based on guidelines by Jacobson and Truax (1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean number of key-working sessions offered to participants in the Treatment as Usual arm&#xD;
      during the 6-week intervention period will be reported. Percentage of sessions attended will&#xD;
      then be compared between groups using Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Based on previous research conducted in the USA, an effect size of&#xD;
      0.5 was used to calculate the required sample size (Daughters et al., 2018; Daughters et al.,&#xD;
      2008). Standard sample size calculation based on a medium effect size (0.5) with 2&#xD;
      independent sample means indicates that 128 participants (64 per group) would be required to&#xD;
      achieve 80% power using a significance level (p) of 0.05. After accounting for the&#xD;
      possibility that an estimated 10% of participants may drop out of the study (i.e. withdraw&#xD;
      consent), this means that we will need to recruit 142 participants in total (71 per group). A&#xD;
      previous feasibility study conducted by Delgadillo and colleagues (2015) indicated a screened&#xD;
      to recruited ratio of 4:1 in this setting, therefore we will aim to screen a minimum of 568&#xD;
      participants sequentially over a 2-year period in order to achieve an adequate sample size&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
