  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endometrium is a tissue with high capacity of renewal (&quot;self-renewal&quot;). This process is&#xD;
      regulated by stem cells. Recent studies have shown that bone marrow-derived stem cells&#xD;
      (BMDSCs) contribute to tissues and organs regeneration, including the murine and human&#xD;
      endometrium. Additionally, BMDSCs have the ability to differentiate into functional&#xD;
      endometrial and stromal epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asherman's Syndrome (AS) also referred to as intrauterine adhesions (AIU), is an acquired&#xD;
      uterine condition characterized by the formation of adhesions inside the uterus. In many&#xD;
      cases the front and back walls of the uterus stick to one another. Most patients with AS have&#xD;
      menstrual abnormalities, pelvic pain, recurrent miscarriage, and infertility, and&#xD;
      psychological disorders. Currently, hysteroscopy is considered the gold standard of methods&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of intrauterine adhesions. However, it has a limited capacity for&#xD;
      treatment, especially in moderate or severe cases in which permanent infertility can occur.&#xD;
      For the first time, our investigation group demonstrated the possibility of regenerating&#xD;
      endometrial tissue through bone marrow-derived stem cells (Santamaria et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to determine the safety, tolerability and biodistribution of IGX1 (CD133+&#xD;
      cells selected after mobilization and collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells - CPSP)&#xD;
      afte rthe intraarterial injection in rats with induced Asherman's Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the focus of this project is to satisfy the preclinical requirements set out by&#xD;
      the the AEMPS (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios) in relation to the&#xD;
      Phase I/II clinical trial &quot;Phase I-II clinical trial of advanced, prospective, open,&#xD;
      non-randomized, uncontrolled (before-after study), explanatory, multicentre cell therapy ,&#xD;
      national, intervention with a single treatment group in patients of reproductive age with&#xD;
      gestational desire diagnosed with Asherman's Syndrome grade II, III or IV, treated by&#xD;
      autologous non-expanded bone marrow stem/progenitor cells selected (IGX1)&quot;&#xD;
      (IGX1-ENT-XS-16-01)&#xD;

      The endometrium is the tissue that lines the inside of the uterine cavity and whose function&#xD;
      is to enable implantation of the embryo at the right moment. When implantation of the embryo&#xD;
      does not occur, the endometrium is partially destroyed and menstruation takes place,&#xD;
      producing a new generation of tissue in the next menstrual cycle. It is therefore a high&#xD;
      dynamic tissue undergoing changes of growth, differentiation and shedding every 28 days&#xD;
      during 400-500 cycles during a woman's reproductive lifetime. This level of tissue&#xD;
      regeneration is comparable to other tissues with high cellular turnover, such as epidermis,&#xD;
      gut epithelium and bone marrow. This highly regenerative self-renewal capacity of the&#xD;
      endometrium seems to be regulated by stem cells. An increased number of studies about&#xD;
      endometrium-derived stem cells have been published in the last years. Furthermore, bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) have been shown to contribute to the repair and&#xD;
      regeneration of tissues and organs, including human and murine endometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asherman's Syndrome (AS) is characterized by intrauterine adhesions and is associated with&#xD;
      infertility due to loss of normal endometrium. Hysteroscopy is the gold standard of methods&#xD;
      for diagnosis of these intrauterine adhesions. However, it has certain potential&#xD;
      complications such as uterine perforation and the possibility of adhesion recurrence in&#xD;
      moderate and severe cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, stem cell therapy targeting the endometrium with the aim of replacing the damaged&#xD;
      tissue, offers a promising approach for treating AS and Endometrial atrophy (EA). In a pilot&#xD;
      trial, our research group demonstrated, for the first time, that CD133+ BMDSC autologous cell&#xD;
      therapy may be useful in treating patients with AS and EA and a wish to conceive. These cells&#xD;
      are capable of inducing proliferation of the neighbouring endometrial cells in the damaged&#xD;
      endometrium. Given these results, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the&#xD;
      designation of orphan drug (ODD) to the investigational product IGX1 (treatment with&#xD;
      autologous CD133+ stem cells) for the experimental treatment of Asherman's Syndrome&#xD;
      (EMA/OD/313/16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these previous facts, a phase I/II clinical trial &quot;ENTIRE&quot; (code IGX1-ENT-XS-16-01&#xD;
      and European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials -EudraCT- number&#xD;
      2016-003975-23) was designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study relevant effects of stem cell therapy in AS and respond to the&#xD;
      clarifications requested by the AEMPs (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos&#xD;
      Sanitarios), the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      as well as the biodistribution, expression and cellular characterization of IGX1 (CD133+&#xD;
      cells selected after mobilization and collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells - CPSP)&#xD;
      in a murine model with Asherman-induced Syndrome (preclinical study). In addition, other&#xD;
      possible endothelial and blood markers of this cellular subpopulation will be characterized&#xD;
      by flow cytometry, as well as the viability and potency of these cells.&#xD;
