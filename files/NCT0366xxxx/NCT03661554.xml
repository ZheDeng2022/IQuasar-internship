      This clinical study is an exploratory study, mainly to study the safety and efficacy of BCMA&#xD;
      nano-antibody CAR-T in the treatment of MM. In this study, a 3 + 3 dose gradient climbing&#xD;
      design was used. Three dosage groups, 5 x 106 / kg, 7.5 x 106 / kg and 1.5 x 107 / kg, were&#xD;
      divided into three groups. Patients were enrolled in the sequence from low to high doses.&#xD;
      When each dose group was completed, the next dose group could be enrolled if there was no&#xD;
      more than 3-level toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity. If the dose group had more than&#xD;
      3-level toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity, two patients were enrolled to observe if&#xD;
      there was any toxicity. Sexual occurrence, if two patients in each group developed grade 3 or&#xD;
      more toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity, the dose group was the dose-limiting group,&#xD;
      and the dose group in front of the group was the maximum tolerated dose, at which the initial&#xD;
      efficacy was observed. Nine patients were enrolled in the hill climbing test, and six&#xD;
      patients were enrolled in the follow-up preliminary efficacy study, with an estimated 15&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to study the safety and efficacy of BCMA nanoantibody CAR-T in the&#xD;
      treatment of MM. BCMA CAR is composed of BCMA nano-antibody, CD8 strand region, transmembrane&#xD;
      region and 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and CD3-_T cell activation domain. BCMA nano-antibody&#xD;
      CAR-T cells were prepared by lentivirus infection of T cells. In this study, a 3 + 3 dose&#xD;
      gradient climbing design was used. Three dosage groups, 5x106 / kg, 1x107 / kg and 1.5x107 /&#xD;
      kg, were divided into three groups. Patients were enrolled in the sequence from low to high&#xD;
      doses. When each dose group was completed, the next dose group could be enrolled if there was&#xD;
      no more than 3-level toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity. If the dose group had more&#xD;
      than 3-level toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity, two patients were enrolled to observe&#xD;
      if there was any toxicity. Sexual occurrence, if two patients in each group developed grade 3&#xD;
      or more toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity, the dose group was the dose-limiting&#xD;
      group, and the dose group in front of the group was the maximum tolerated dose, at which the&#xD;
      initial efficacy was observed. Nine patients were enrolled in the hill climbing test, and six&#xD;
      patients were enrolled in the follow-up preliminary efficacy study, with an estimated 15&#xD;
      enrolled. After transfusion, adverse events were closely monitored and therapeutic effects&#xD;
      were evaluated on the 28th day after transfusion. Follow-up was conducted every 6 weeks&#xD;
      within 6 months and every 10 weeks after 6 months. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      BCMA nano antibody CAR-T in the treatment of refractory and relapsed MM.&#xD;
