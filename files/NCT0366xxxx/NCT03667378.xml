  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether adding personalized supportive care to medical treatment on a&#xD;
      clinical trial affects the study participants' ability and desire to discuss their symptoms,&#xD;
      their concerns about the future, and their approach to coping with cancer. The effects of&#xD;
      supportive care on participants' responses to questions about these topics will be compared&#xD;
      with those of other study participants who are being treated for cancer in a clinical trial,&#xD;
      but are not receiving personalized supportive care.&#xD;

        The study population will be patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor&#xD;
        cancers who progress beyond standard treatment and are deemed eligible to receive treatment&#xD;
        with investigational targeted or immune-based therapeutics with Phase I, Phase I/Ib, and&#xD;
        Phase I/II trials at MSK.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with disease progression on at least one standard chemotherapy regimen, and&#xD;
             now eligible and consented to begin Phase I, Phase I/Ib, Phase I/II and non-randomized&#xD;
             Phase II (including basket studies) investigational targeted and immune-based&#xD;
             therapeutics in MSK medical oncology, EDD, or ITC clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak, read, and understand English well enough to complete study assessments&#xD;
             in the judgment of the consenting professional&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a progressive or metastatic solid tumor cancer with MSK pathology confirmation at&#xD;
             the primary or metastatic anatomic site&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who already are receiving specialty supportive care (already referred for a&#xD;
             supportive care consultation) prior to enrollment in a Phase I protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if the Phase I, Phase I/Ib, Phase I/II or Phase II trial&#xD;
             involves known active drugs in combination with experimental drugs, in which the&#xD;
             patient has not previously received the known active drug or active drugs of the same&#xD;
             class. For example, a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer who has not received&#xD;
             gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, but enrolls on a study that tests an experimental drug in&#xD;
             addition to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant psychiatric or cognitive disturbance in the primary clinician&quot;s or&#xD;
             investigator&quot;s judgment, to preclude providing informed consent or participating in&#xD;
             the interventions (i.e. acute psychiatric symptoms which require individual treatment)&#xD;
