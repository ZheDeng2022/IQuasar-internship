      Does Aspirin reduce inflammation in the walls of unruptured brain aneurysms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain aneurysms are balloon-like outpouchings of a blood vessel resulting from a weakness in&#xD;
      the vessel wall. They generally cause no symptoms, but can burst and cause a bleed in the&#xD;
      brain, resulting in death or disability. Aneurysms occur in 1 in 30 people, but rarely burst,&#xD;
      with 1 in 10,000 people having a brain bleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, aneurysms would be treated before they burst to prevent bleeding in the brain. The&#xD;
      two ways of treating aneurysms currently are both risky and invasive, and no medications have&#xD;
      been shown to reduce the risk of aneurysms bursting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is one of the most common medications, used worldwide to treat pain, fever and&#xD;
      inflammation, and for the prevention of strokes and heart attacks. Its anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties may be beneficial for patients with aneurysms. We know that the walls of burst&#xD;
      aneurysms and aneurysms that are about to burst, are more inflamed than those that do not&#xD;
      burst. Therefore, a drug that reduces inflammation may reduce the risk of an aneurysm&#xD;
      bursting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have designed this study to test whether there is a measurable reduction in inflammation&#xD;
      in walls of brain aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants known to have an aneurysm that is not planned for treatment and&#xD;
      has not yet burst, take aspirin daily for three months, and have an MRI scan before and after&#xD;
      to look for a reduction in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study is successful it would be the first step towards developing the first&#xD;
      medication to help treat patients with aneurysms, representing a huge advance for the 2.1&#xD;
      million people in the UK with this condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Aspirin Trial (UIAAT) is a single centre, randomised,&#xD;
      single blind, open label trial of 300mg aspirin daily versus no treatment for 3 months. 58&#xD;
      patients with an intracranial aneurysm diagnosed on imaging will be recruited - potential&#xD;
      participants will be approached by their consultant neurosurgeon or a member of their direct&#xD;
      clinical care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient interviews will take place at Wessex Neurological Centre to coincide wherever&#xD;
      possible with standard appointments. Participants will be screened for eligibility and&#xD;
      consented during this interview. Following consent, baseline data will be taken to include&#xD;
      participants' baseline characteristics, other medications, and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then undergo a baseline MRI including VWI imaging, and then be randomised&#xD;
      to either the 'aspirin 300mg daily' or 'no treatment' arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will then be called by a member of the trial team between days 7 and 21&#xD;
      after being commenced in either arm of the trial, to review any issues with taking the&#xD;
      medication if they are on that arm, whether they are using their drug diary, and to check for&#xD;
      any adverse reactions or events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following three months of their allocated treatment, patients will undergo a second,&#xD;
      identical MRI scan, to assess whether there is any reduction in the inflammation in the&#xD;
      vessel walls of the aneurysms. Patients will be reviewed at this time with their drug dairy,&#xD;
      for drug reconciliation and recording of any adverse events. This will be the end of their&#xD;
      participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study topic and design was discussed at a meeting to set research priorities advertised&#xD;
      via the Wessex Subarachnoid Haemorrhage group that was convened by a consultant neurosurgeon&#xD;
      and a subarachnoid haemorrhage specialist nurse with patients with unruptured and ruptured&#xD;
      aneurysms and their carers. At this meeting the investigators clearly identified that it&#xD;
      would be beneficial for more research into medical treatments for unruptured aneurysms and&#xD;
      felt that with the evidence that the group would be happy to undergo the main two items&#xD;
      required for participation in the study - treatment with aspirin and increased scanning&#xD;
      frequency and were very supportive of the study design. Indeed the group saw the additional&#xD;
      scanning as a strong attraction to participating in the study.&#xD;
