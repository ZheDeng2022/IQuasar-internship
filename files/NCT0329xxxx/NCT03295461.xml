    <textblock>
      E. officinalis fruit possesses both the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities that&#xD;
      may prove to be useful against several periodontal diseases with the advantage that it is&#xD;
      devoid of side effects associated with synthetic drugs. After the careful search of&#xD;
      literature, none of the studies have reported the effect of local drug delivery of E.&#xD;
      officinalis preparations on chronic periodontitis.The present study is designed with the aim&#xD;
      of assessing the effectiveness of Emblica officinalis extract formulations as a potential&#xD;
      adjunctive therapeutic strategy in the management of chronic periodontititis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of bacterial plaque represents the principal etiologic factor involved in the&#xD;
      initiation of inflammatory periodontal diseases and the destructive host responses triggered&#xD;
      by microbial pathogens exaggerate the already existing condition resulting in connective&#xD;
      tissue loss characterizing the inflammatory periodontal diseases . The key element of&#xD;
      periodontal therapy is to achieve a significant reduction or eradication of suspected&#xD;
      periodontal pathogens as well as modulation of destructive host responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine has been extensively employed adjunctive to conventional mechanical treatment&#xD;
      for chronic periodontitis. But its use is limited by various side effects, including&#xD;
      development of resistance, decrease in saliva secretion, acceleration in calculus&#xD;
      accumulation, altered taste perception and teeth staining Researchers are increasingly&#xD;
      turning their attention to phyto-therapeutic agents and looking for new leads to develop&#xD;
      better drugs against multidrug resistant microbial strains. Bacteria are less likely to&#xD;
      develop resistance to these natural substances, which should be safer for patients and cause&#xD;
      fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emblica officinalis Gaertn. or Phyllanthus emblica Linn belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae.&#xD;
      All parts of the plant are of use in treating various ailments, but the fruit is of immense&#xD;
      use in various traditional systems of medicine as it possesses a wide array of activities&#xD;
      such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, immunomodulatory,&#xD;
      antibacterial, antipyretic, antidiabetic, hypolipidaemic, cardioprotective, antiresorptive&#xD;
      properties. E. officinalis fruit is one of the richest sources of Vitamin C (600mg/100g) and&#xD;
      contains water, proteins, carbohydrates, fibres, minerals, zinc, chromium, copper, gallic&#xD;
      acid. The antimicrobial property of E. officinalis fruit is attributed mainly to flavonoids,&#xD;
      phenols, saponins and tannins. Saponins and tannins proved to have a potent anti-microbial&#xD;
      property . Phenolic compounds of Emblica officinalis also ameliorate acute and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation due to their modulatory action on free radicals and by affecting COX&#xD;
      (Cyclo-oxygenase) pathway, specifically prostaglandins. Thus ,it was hypothesized that&#xD;
      adjunctive use of E. officinalis along with nonsurgical periodontal treatment may improve&#xD;
      periodontal tissue healing and /or treatment outcomes of chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Post Graduate&#xD;
      Institute of Dental Sciences (PGIDS), Rohtak in collaboration with College of Pharmacy and&#xD;
      Department of Microbiology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak. This&#xD;
      study was designed according to the ethical standards outlined in the 1964 Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, as revised in 2008. The study got approval from Institutional Review Board, PGIDS,&#xD;
      Rohtak (PGIDS/2013/IEC/87) and ethical committee of PGIDS, Rohtak. The study continued from&#xD;
      March 2013 to October 2014 and CONSORT guidelines for the randomized clinical trials were&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study patients were enrolled from systemically healthy individuals&#xD;
      attending regular outpatient department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, PGIDS, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design included a single-center, double-blinded randomized clinical trial in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I :test group (n = 23, 264 sites) received scaling and root planing (SRP) +10% E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      officinalis gel application and control group (n = 23, 264 sites) received SRP+ placebo gel&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II:test group (SRP+ 10% Emblica officinalis irrigation), positive control group (SRP +&#xD;
      0.2% Chlorhexidine irrigation), negative control group (SRP + 0.9% Saline irrigation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal examination: After inclusion into the study, all patients underwent full-mouth&#xD;
      periodontal examination in a standardized way using a mouth mirror, tweezer, Williams probe&#xD;
      (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL.) and explorer. Following parameters were considered: Primary outcome&#xD;
      variables including Probing Depth (PD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) and secondary outcome&#xD;
      variables including Plaque Index (PI) , Gingival Index (GI) , Sulcus Bleeding Index (SBI) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of E. officinalis extract: The authenticated plant material E.officinalis fruits&#xD;
      (herbal garden, College of Pharmacy, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak)&#xD;
      were collected, washed and shade dried at room temperature. E. officinalis extract was&#xD;
      prepared using the methodology according to Kokate, 2008 and 10% concentration of E.&#xD;
      officinalis extract was finalized for subgingival gel/ irrigation in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of Emblica officinalis extract (Euphorbiaceae). The authenticated plant material&#xD;
      E. officinalis fruits (herbal garden, College of Pharmacy, Post Graduate Institute of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences, Rohtak) were collected, washed and shade dried at room temperature. A total of 500&#xD;
      g of powdered shade dried fruits of E. officinalis were extracted exhaustively with water and&#xD;
      ethanol mixture without soaking. This suspension of powdered drug and hydroalcoholic mixture&#xD;
      (1:1 ratio of water and ethanol) in sterile conical flask was then placed on magnetic stirrer&#xD;
      at 50°C temperature for 4 h. Then the supernatant filtered by using Whatman filter paper, and&#xD;
      the filterate was finely dried by using rotary film evaporator operating at 60 °C temperature&#xD;
      and 75 rpm . This converted the extract into dried powder form, which was used for the gel&#xD;
      formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary antimicrobial and antiinflammatory screening - In this study, the authors&#xD;
      assessed zones of inhibition and minimum inhibitory concentrations of E. officinalis&#xD;
      hydroalcoholic extract against Streptococcus mutans (MTCC 497), Streptococcus oralis (MTCC&#xD;
      2696), Enterococcus fecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) by agar diffusion and broth dilution tests, respectively.&#xD;
      Zones of inhibition ranged between 10 and 28mm at 10% concentration of extract while minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration between 0.5% and 2% against tested micro-organisms. Antiinflammatory&#xD;
      activity of extract was assessed by human red blood cell membrane stabilization method in&#xD;
      vitro. Based upon these findings, 10%concentration of E. officinalis extract was finalized&#xD;
      for subgingival application in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal treatment: Patients received non-surgical treatment in the form of full mouth&#xD;
      supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) in 2-3 sessions .In part I of&#xD;
      the study application of placebo gel and 10% E. officinalis gel in deep pockets of control&#xD;
      and test group patients, respectively, in part II of the study singal application of&#xD;
      subgingival irrigation with 0.9% saline, 0.2% chlorhexidine and 10% E. officinalis irrigant&#xD;
      was performed in negative control group, positive control group and test group respectively,&#xD;
      on the day of completion of SRP by another investigator (ST). The subgingival irrigation was&#xD;
      accomplished by applying 5 ml irrigant to all the periodontal sites in both arches with the&#xD;
      use of a syringe and blunted needle placed as close as possible to the bottom of the pocket.&#xD;
      The patients were instructed to use only mechanical techniques to clean teeth during the&#xD;
      study period and mouthwashes and /or antimicrobials were not prescribed. All the periodontal&#xD;
      parameters were recorded at baseline and after 2 and 3 months of follow up period by a single&#xD;
      periodontist (SG).&#xD;
