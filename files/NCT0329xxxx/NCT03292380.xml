    <textblock>
      A 24-hour Caffeine Intake Recall (CIR-24) was developed to estimate caffeine consumption in&#xD;
      the previous 24 hours, modeled after the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary&#xD;
      Assessment Tool (ASA24), using a brand-specific database of caffeine-containing foods,&#xD;
      beverages and supplements. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the&#xD;
      CIR-24 compared to caffeine concentration biomarkers in urine and a caffeinated beverage&#xD;
      intake frequency screener (CBQ) among a young adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      79 young adults ages 18 to 29 years provided 24-hour urine samples and completed the CIR-24&#xD;
      and CBQ. Excretion rates for caffeine and eight caffeine metabolites were quantified from&#xD;
      urine samples using high performance liquid chromatography-polarity switching electrospray&#xD;
      ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry with stable isotope labeled internal&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the CIR-24 compared to caffeine&#xD;
      concentration biomarkers in urine and a caffeinated beverage intake frequency screener (CBQ)&#xD;
      among a young adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 24-hour Caffeine Intake Recall (CIR-24) was developed to estimate caffeine consumption in&#xD;
      the previous 24 hours. The online, self-administered CIR-24 was developed to measure dietary&#xD;
      intake of caffeine from food, beverages, and supplements. The tool was based on the Automated&#xD;
      Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24), a web-based, self-administered&#xD;
      tool for collecting dietary recalls and records. ASA24 uses a multiple-pass method adapted&#xD;
      from the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM) used in NHANES in the US and the Canadian&#xD;
      Community Health Survey in Canada. The same general question structure was used in this&#xD;
      custom online survey, but the items queried were limited to foods, beverages and supplements&#xD;
      that may contain caffeine. The tool was created for the Canadian context by listing only&#xD;
      Canadian products, changing container sizes to reflect the Canadian marketplace, and&#xD;
      including a French version. The food, beverage, and supplement categories and sub-categories&#xD;
      can be found in Supplemental Table 1. Specific items listed were based on ASA24 and the&#xD;
      Canadian Nutrient File, with additional items identified through the USDA National Nutrient&#xD;
      Databases and internet searches. Respondents were asked about the consumption of items from&#xD;
      each of four main categories (beverages, foods, energy products with added caffeine, and&#xD;
      supplements) in the prior day. Based on each food or beverage reported, the participant&#xD;
      receives tailored probes based on their responses, to identify the specific items that may&#xD;
      have contained caffeine (e.g., if carbonated beverage consumption was reported, the&#xD;
      participant is asked to specify the type of carbonated beverage and brand consumed). Amounts&#xD;
      of each item consumed were ascertained based on the particular category: food amounts were&#xD;
      estimated by the number of items/pieces consumed, or by a volume amount (depending on the&#xD;
      item); beverage amounts were estimated using images of container types and sizes (adapted&#xD;
      from the ASA24) (or volume for powders, liquids, and concentrates); and supplements were&#xD;
      estimated by unit (or volume for powders and liquids). The CIR-24 tool is available at&#xD;
      http://davidhammond.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2014-CED-Technical-Report.pdf.A database&#xD;
      was compiled of the caffeine content of all food and beverage items in the Canadian Nutrient&#xD;
      File listed as containing caffeine (with some additional items from the USDA National&#xD;
      Nutrient Database for Standard Reference), plus energy drinks, shots, and products (sourced&#xD;
      from the nutrition information on products purchased in previous studies, as well as internet&#xD;
      searches), and supplements listed as containing caffeine in Health Canada's Licensed Natural&#xD;
      Health Products Database&#xD;
      (http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/applications/licen-prod/lnhpd-bdpsnh-eng.php) or&#xD;
      identified through an online pharmacy (www.well.ca). More precise and brand-specific values&#xD;
      were added for popular products such as coffee, using information provided by manufacturers&#xD;
      (e.g., Starbucks, Tim Horton's, McDonald's) and/or websites that aggregate nutrition&#xD;
      information (http://www.cspinet.org/new/cafchart.htm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paper version of a caffeinated beverage questionnaire (CBQ) from the Fred Hutchison Cancer&#xD;
      Centre, adapted slightly for use in Canada (e.g., mL measures were included in addition to&#xD;
      fluid ounces), was also administered.The CBQ included 13 beverage categories, including&#xD;
      caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee (brewed and instant) and tea, energy drinks and highly&#xD;
      caffeinated sodas, regular colas and root beer, and caffeine-free colas and root beer. Nine&#xD;
      frequency categories were included: Never or less than once per month; 1-3 per month; 1 per&#xD;
      week; 2-4 per week; 5-6 per week; 1 per day; 2-3 per day; 4-5 per day; 6+ per day. A&#xD;
      reference for a 'medium' size for each type of beverage category was provided; respondents&#xD;
      stated whether each drink size was small, medium or large in comparison to the reference&#xD;
      amount. Responses to the CBQ were used to calculate average daily caffeine consumption for&#xD;
      each respondent. First, the number of annual servings consumed for each questionnaire item&#xD;
      was calculated by multiplying the reported frequency by the reported portion size. A 'small'&#xD;
      size was multiplied by a serving ratio of 0.5, and a 'large' size was multiplied by 1.5.&#xD;
      Next, the average annual volume of each beverage consumed was divided by 365 to estimate the&#xD;
      daily intake of each beverage. The caffeine database that accompanies the tool was used to&#xD;
      calculate the amount of caffeine consumed in milligrams. In cases in which frequency data for&#xD;
      items were missing, we assumed that none was consumed, and when a frequency was entered but&#xD;
      no portion size was indicated, the 'medium' size was assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, all urine samples were combined, and the total volume of the entire&#xD;
      24-hour sample was recorded. A sample from each participant was aliquoted into a 2 mL&#xD;
      cryovial, and immediately frozen at -80°C. Samples were moved for 8 days to a -20°C freezer&#xD;
      due to logistical issues, and were later returned to -80°C. At the end of the study period,&#xD;
      all samples were transported in insulated containers with dry ice to the CDC Nutritional&#xD;
      Biomarkers Branch in Atlanta, GA for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine concentrations for caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and 8 caffeine metabolites&#xD;
      (1,7-dimethylxanthine (Paraxanthine or 17X); 1,3-dimethylxanthine (theophylline, 13X);&#xD;
      1,3,7-trimethyluric acid (137U); 1,3-dimethyluric acid (13U); 1,7-dimethyluric acid (17U);&#xD;
      1-methyluric acid (1U); 1-methylxanthine (1X); and 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil&#xD;
      (AAMU)) were quantified by use of a high performance liquid chromatography-polarity switching&#xD;
      electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry with stable isotope labeled&#xD;
      internal standards based on a method reported previously.(26) Existing studies indicate that&#xD;
      these metabolites have moderate correlation with caffeine intake (14). The limits of&#xD;
      detection were: 0.05 μmol/L for 1U; 0.01 μmol/L for theophylline; 0.02 μmol/L for 13U and&#xD;
      17U; 0.005 μmol/L 137U; 0.03 μmol/L for 1X; 0.003 mmol/L for caffeine; 0.006 μmol/L for 17X;&#xD;
      and, 0.1 μmol/L for AAMU. Samples that had amounts below the limits of detection were&#xD;
      excluded for that particular metabolite.&#xD;

        A total of 85 young adults were recruited from a university community in southwestern&#xD;
        Ontario from June to August, 2015. Recruitment strategies included distributing flyers to&#xD;
        individuals on campus and in community settings, posting flyers in public areas, and making&#xD;
        announcements to undergraduate classes using a consecutive sampling technique. We attempted&#xD;
        to recruit an equal amount of individuals who self-reported consuming low, moderate, and&#xD;
        high amounts of caffeinated beverages (within each sex); however, the caffeine consumption&#xD;
        quotas were relaxed due to low response from high-intake consumers.&#xD;
