  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, adaptive, parallel arm study. The treatment group will receive&#xD;
      the Elira wearable patch system and provided instructions for use and advised to follow a&#xD;
      1200 calorie diet. The control group will be asked to follow a 12 calorie diet only. Each&#xD;
      group will be followed for 12 weeks. Total body weight loss will be measured as well as&#xD;
      appetite changes. Safety data will be collected throughout the study period. Safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness will be determined based on differences between the groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study employs a randomized, adaptive, parallel arm study in which, cohorts of enrolled&#xD;
      subjects (25 per arm) are assessed for dose response and progression to achievement of&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints. Enrollment will be up to 300 subjects at 4 US centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, subjects will be screened during a one week&#xD;
      screening/baseline period to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria and exhibit none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria. Weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, HgA1c, pregnancy test (for&#xD;
      women of childbearing age), and patient questionnaires will be collected. If eligible,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive&#xD;
      training on the Elira Wearable Patch System and the first TENS session will be administered&#xD;
      in the investigators office. Both groups will receive an electronic scale and instructions on&#xD;
      1200 calorie diet as well as diary completion requirements to be completed throughout the&#xD;
      study. All subjects will be required to have in office follow-up visits every 4 weeks for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Up to 2 additional follow-up visits will be permitted within that 12 week time period.&#xD;
