  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), also referred to as Churg-Strauss&#xD;
      syndrome, is a rare hyper-eosinophilic syndrome. Eosinophilia is central to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of EGPA and interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine regulating the life-cycle&#xD;
      of the eosinophil. Neutralization of IL-5 with mepolizumab, an anti-IL5 monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      therefore offers a potential therapeutic option for EGPA. The objective of study MEA115921&#xD;
      was to investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab compared with placebo wherein the&#xD;
      subjects were randomized to receive either: 300 milligram (mg) mepolizumab or Placebo&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 weeks in addition to their background standard-of-care&#xD;
      therapy. Subjects were treated for a period of 52 weeks and then followed up for a further 8&#xD;
      weeks to study completion at Week 60. This is a LAP to support provision of open-label&#xD;
      mepolizumab on an individual basis to eligible subjects who participated in clinical study&#xD;
      MEA115921 and who require a dose of prednisolone (or equivalent) of &gt;=5 milligrams per day&#xD;
      (mg/day) for adequate control of their EGPA. Eligible subjects can initiate mepolizumab under&#xD;
      this LAP within a 6-month period starting from completion of study MEA115921 (that is, at&#xD;
      Week 60) or, in case of premature discontinuation from study MEA115921, the subjects will&#xD;
      initiate mepolizumab at the time point that would have been Week 60 if the subject had&#xD;
      completed the study. Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneously administered mepolizumab&#xD;
      at a dose of 300 mg SC every 4 weeks. Eligible subjects will continue to receive mepolizumab&#xD;
      under this LAP until mepolizumab is commercially licensed for the treatment of EGPA in the&#xD;
      relevant country or until GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) discontinues the program or until the subject&#xD;
      meets any of the withdrawal/stopping criteria.&#xD;
