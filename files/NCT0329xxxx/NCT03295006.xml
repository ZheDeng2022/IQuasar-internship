  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective, multinational, single-arm study will be conducted in at least 8 sites. An&#xD;
      interim analysis will be conducted with data from 100 patients with up to 10 well defined HCC&#xD;
      tumor(s) and with at least one tumor ≥3 cm. Normal tissue absorbed dose using pre-procedural&#xD;
      99mTc MAA SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging will be measured to allow the mean absorbed normal tissue&#xD;
      dose corresponding to a ≤15% probability of CTCAE grade 3 or higher hyperbilirubinemia (in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression) to be calculated. Total bilirubin will be recorded and&#xD;
      graded according to CTCAE version 4.02. All dose-related SAEs at 3 months follow-up will be&#xD;
      followed until resolution, death or lost-to-follow-up. AEs related to disease progression&#xD;
      will not be considered related to TheraSphere.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently published evidence indicates a correlation between yttrium-90 dose delivered to the&#xD;
      tumor and normal tissue with safety and efficacy outcomes but there are no validated methods&#xD;
      to consistently measure dose delivered to the tumor and normal tissue. In contrast to the&#xD;
      standard clinical approach based on average dose to one target volume, this trial, sponsored&#xD;
      by Biocompatibles UK, will explore an alternative two-compartment TheraSphere dosimetry&#xD;
      methodology to calculate absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissue&#xD;
