  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation method, to improve word-finding abilities in Veterans and&#xD;
      non-Veterans with chronic language problems following stroke (aphasia). Improving&#xD;
      word-finding is important because word-finding difficulties are among the most common and&#xD;
      debilitating consequences of aphasia. Although rTMS has shown promise as a treatment&#xD;
      approach, not all individuals with aphasia show the same level of benefit. Specifically, this&#xD;
      study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine whether the likelihood&#xD;
      of improved word-finding abilities following rTMS depends on pre-intervention&#xD;
      language-related brain activity and will examine changes in brain activity in response to&#xD;
      stimulation. A better understanding of how and for whom rTMS works will 1) help to identify&#xD;
      the best candidates for rTMS treatment, 2) optimize rTMS treatment protocols to improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes, and 3) improve the investigators' understanding of how the brain&#xD;
      re-organizes language functions following stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia, an acquired communication disorder, is a common consequence of left-hemisphere&#xD;
      stroke. Persisting, or chronic, aphasia negatively impacts not only interpersonal&#xD;
      communication but participation in activities of daily living, independence, and autonomy. It&#xD;
      is also associated with higher rates of depression and lower quality of life. Therefore,&#xD;
      examining factors and treatments that result in the best possible recovery of language&#xD;
      function for individuals with chronic aphasia is of paramount importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention approach that has shown promise in early-phase research on treatment of&#xD;
      chronic aphasia is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is a&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can be used to focally modulate activity in&#xD;
      targeted brain regions. Studies have shown that multiple sessions of 1Hz inhibitory rTMS&#xD;
      applied to the right hemisphere Pars Triangularis (PTr) of people with chronic aphasia&#xD;
      results in improved naming abilities. These improvements accrue over time, and may persist&#xD;
      even after rTMS has ended. It has been proposed that rTMS induces this improvement by&#xD;
      reducing the disruptive influence of compensatory activity in the right hemisphere PTr,&#xD;
      allowing for recruitment of more efficient left hemisphere peri-lesional brain areas.&#xD;
      However, existing neuroimaging evidence to support this hypothesis is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to investigate the neurological mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      effect of rTMS on naming performance in chronic aphasia. This will extend existing knowledge&#xD;
      regarding hemispheric contributions to language recovery following stroke and elucidate how&#xD;
      rTMS-induced neuroplasticity can be co-opted to encourage optimal reorganization. The study&#xD;
      will also investigate a potential source of individual response variability to rTMS, one&#xD;
      which can inform both candidate selection and optimal stimulation parameters. Sixteen&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled, yielding a significantly larger sample size than previous&#xD;
      studies that have examined changes in functional brain activation in response to rTMS (n = 1,&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a sequence of 1200 pulses of 1 Hz rTMS to right hemisphere PTr&#xD;
      across 10 daily sessions. Half of the participants will also receive a 6 Hz rTMS excitatory&#xD;
      priming pulse sequence immediately prior to the 1 Hz sequence. This priming sequence ensures&#xD;
      a consistent inhibitory response to the subsequent 1Hz rTMS and will permit an examination of&#xD;
      state-dependent individual response variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of rTMS over time, participants will undergo functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (fMRI) scans at four time points: prior to initiation of rTMS (&quot;baseline&quot;),&#xD;
      immediately following the first rTMS session (&quot;post-rTMS&quot;), following the conclusion of the&#xD;
      rTMS series (&quot;post-treatment&quot;) and at a 2-month follow-up visit. During the scans,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to name pictures, and both patterns of regional naming-related&#xD;
      activation and effective connectivity (directional causal influence between activated brain&#xD;
      regions) will be evaluated at each time point. In addition, naming performance will be&#xD;
      measured via standardized assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in naming performance will be assessed over time, as a measure of rTMS effectiveness&#xD;
      overall and between groups (priming sequence vs no priming sequence). In addition, changes in&#xD;
      activation and effective connectivity will be correlated with naming improvement to assess&#xD;
      the relative effectiveness of right hemisphere recruitment compared to left hemisphere&#xD;
      peri-lesional recruitment. Overall increases in left hemisphere recruitment are hypothesized&#xD;
      to result in greater improvements. However, the magnitude of left hemisphere recruitment due&#xD;
      to rTMS is expected to depend on baseline levels of right hemisphere PTr activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will significantly improve the investigator's understanding of the&#xD;
      effects of rTMS on stroke recovery. The results will also inform future studies evaluating&#xD;
      rTMS as an adjunct to behavioral speech-language intervention, augmenting therapeutic gains&#xD;
      from traditional aphasia treatment.&#xD;

    <description>rTMS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which a focal, time-varying magnetic field is applied to a specific brain area to induce neuronal depolarization. rTMS can be used to selectively target a given brain region with a resolution as focal as 0.5 cm3 .Typically, administering a slow (1 Hz) sequence of magnetic pulses via rTMS temporarily reduces cortical excitability in the targeted brain region.</description>
