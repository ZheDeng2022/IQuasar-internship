    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with T3/T4 laryngeal cancer in general have several treatment options&#xD;
      available, including total laryngectomy and/or (chemo-) radition. In order to help these&#xD;
      patients in the decision making process, MAASTRO CLINIC designed and developed a web-based&#xD;
      decision aid tool (Treatmentchoice). The aim of this study is twofold: user-testing&#xD;
      Treatmentchoice using a systematically development process and establish the impact of&#xD;
      Treatmentchoice on the decision making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study covers 4 chronological activities: 1. assess decisional needs of patients and&#xD;
      clinicians, 2. testing patients' and clinicians comprehensibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      usability on the alpha-version of the tool, 3. establish the impact of Treatmentchoice on&#xD;
      knowledge, decisional conflict and the shared decision making process, as well as the extent&#xD;
      clinicians involve patients in decision making and 4. development of an implementation and&#xD;
      dissemination plan for shared decision making which is based on the evaluation of barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators for the use of patients decision aid tools in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed method will be used. It comprises structured interviews combined with think aloud and&#xD;
      questionnaires with stakeholders involved in the whole process (patients, medical doctors,&#xD;
      nurses, general practitioners, patient organizations, and insurance companies).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal cancer is the second most common head and neck cancer. Each year about 700 people&#xD;
      are diagnosed with larynxcarcinoma in the Netherlands (Van Dijk et.al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with laryngeal cancer, various treatment options are available, including&#xD;
      surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and endoscopic (laser) treatment. Each option has its own&#xD;
      benefits and side effects. The optimal treatment for patients having stage 3 or 4 laryngeal&#xD;
      cancer is not unambiguously proven. Different treatment options cause different side effects&#xD;
      that may impact the patients' health-related quality of life. The treatment of choice depends&#xD;
      on preferences and personal values. In these preference-sensitive choices it is important to&#xD;
      involve the patient in the decision-making process. In this process both the practitioner and&#xD;
      the patient exchange information and collaborate in the decision, the physician knows more&#xD;
      technical information about the disease, the treatment options and the side effects, the&#xD;
      patient knows how the treatment options correspond with his lifestyle, values and preferences&#xD;
      (Frosch DL and Kaplan RM, 1999; O'Connor AM, et.al. 2003; O'Connor AM, et.al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Decision Aids (PDAs) are tools that can help patients to get involved in decision&#xD;
      making by clarifying treatment options, outcomes, and personal values. In the development&#xD;
      process of a decision aid it is mandatory to follow a systematic and iterative approach to:&#xD;
      (a) understand patient's decisional needs; (b) create prototypical tools; (c) evaluate these&#xD;
      prototypes with patients and clinicians, and (d) use these results to improve the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (http://ipdas.ohri.ca/), we&#xD;
      designed an initial prototype, called Treatmentchoice (http://www.treatmentchoice.info).&#xD;
      These standards recommend assessing patients and doctors views in decisional needs, use this&#xD;
      information to develop an alpha version of the PDA and validate it again with patients and&#xD;
      doctors to create a beta version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is user-testing the initial prototype of the Treatmentchoice. This&#xD;
      will allow us to follow a systematically development process and to gain knowledge on the&#xD;
      validity of our approach. The project covers 4 chronological activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVITY 1: ASSES DECISIONAL NEEDS: Elicit patients and clinicians views on patient's&#xD;
      information, expectations, and needs on decision support. Conclusions and recommendations for&#xD;
      improvement of Treatmentchoice will be derived and the current prototype will be improved&#xD;
      creating an alpha prototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVITY 2: ALPHA-TESTING: Testing patients' and clinicians comprehensibility, acceptability&#xD;
      and usability on the alpha-version. A mixed method will be used; structured interviews&#xD;
      combined with think aloud (Ahmed, 2009) and questionnaires (Unified Theory of Acceptance and&#xD;
      Use of Technology (UTAUT) - Venkatesh et al.2012) with both patients and clinicians (head and&#xD;
      neck surgeon,medical oncologists an radiation oncologists). Conclusions and recommendations&#xD;
      will be documented. Considering this assessment, the prototype will be improved. Alpha&#xD;
      testing will be repeated with this improved prototype using an iterative process, until the&#xD;
      tool is comprehensible, acceptable and usable for both patients and physicians. A second&#xD;
      assessment will be performed with a beta prototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVITY 3: BETA-TESTING: Establish the impact of Treatmentchoice on knowledge, decisional&#xD;
      conflict and the shared decision making process, as well as the extent clinicians involve&#xD;
      patients in decision making. The study composes the evaluation of the impact of the&#xD;
      Treatmentchoice. A variety of questionnaires will be used to assess different outcome&#xD;
      measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age and educational level, home situation with regard to internet connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge test will be assessed using 20 statements, which can be rated as &quot;true&quot;, &quot;not&#xD;
           true&quot; or &quot;do not know&quot; (Savelberg, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decisional conflict will be assessed using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). This&#xD;
           16-item scale has five subscales: feeling informed, decisional uncertainty, clear&#xD;
           values, support, and quality of decisions. Each of these items is scored on a five-point&#xD;
           Likert scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) (DCS, O'Connor AM, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's desire to participate in medical decisions will be assessed using a 5-item&#xD;
           Control Preference Scale (Degner 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Shared Decision Making (SDM) process will be assessed by the perceptions of&#xD;
           patients, using the SDM-Q9 instrument for patients. The instrument provides 9&#xD;
           statements, which can be rated on a six-point scale from 0 (completely disagree) to 5&#xD;
           (completely agree). (SDM-Q9, Rodenburg, 2015 Dutch version).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The process of SDM will also be assessed by the perceptions of the physician (the&#xD;
           oncologist or the radiotherapist if the decision is made together with the&#xD;
           radiotherapist), using the SDM-Q9 instrument for professionals. The instrument provides&#xD;
           9 statements, also rated on a six-point scale (SDM-Q9,Rodenburg,2015/Dutch version).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to fill in the questionnaires at two time points, directly after&#xD;
      the decision making process and 3 months after the decision making process. Their physician&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in the questionnaire at 1 time point, directly after the decision&#xD;
      making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVITY 4: IMPLEMENTATION: Develop an implementation and dissemination plan for shared&#xD;
      decision making in prostate cancer. Questionnaires and qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate barriers and facilitators for implementation in clinical practice, to&#xD;
      develop strategies for the implementation of the decision aid and facilitate optimal shared&#xD;
      decision making, tailored to the barriers and needs of the end-users. Based on the results,&#xD;
      an implementation plan will be written&#xD;
