      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with the brain disease AUD (alcohol use disorder) have a serious problem with&#xD;
      drinking. Researchers want to study how different people react to alcohol, and how genes&#xD;
      affect this. They will focus on a nicotine receptor gene that may increase a person s AUD&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if people with variations of a nicotine receptor gene take alcohol differently and&#xD;
      have different brain responses to alcohol cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 21 - 60. This study includes smokers and non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have three 9-hour visits. They must have no alcohol or non-prescription&#xD;
      drugs before all visits and no food or drink before 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get a light meal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have breath and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get taxi rides there and back&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visits 1 and 3, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a thin plastic tube inserted in an arm and connected to a pump for alcohol&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have sensors on their chest to monitor heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sit in a chair for 2.5 hours and get alcohol by pushing a button. Their breath alcohol&#xD;
           level will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions about mood and effects of alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relax at the clinic while their breath alcohol level drops&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions and do computer tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have an alcoholic drink and a snack&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. They will lie in a machine that takes&#xD;
           pictures of the brain. They will do computer tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have another drink and snack&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relax until their alcohol level drops&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up call after each visit.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic disease that has a tremendously negative impact on&#xD;
      individuals and their families and a substantial burden on society. Research on quantitative&#xD;
      endophenotypes such as alcohol response, and their genetic and environmental determinants, is&#xD;
      critical to understanding the risk for AUD. There has been a great interest in examining&#xD;
      variation in target genes that may play a mechanistic role in the expression of these&#xD;
      endophenotypes, such the missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding&#xD;
      the 5 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA5) - rs16969968. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that CHRNA5 A-allele carriers are at greater risk for nicotine addiction and&#xD;
      smoking-related consequences. However, little work has been done to examine the effect of&#xD;
      this SNP on alcohol use, dependence, or alcohol response. Given the high prevalence of&#xD;
      nicotinic receptors on dopamine (DA) neurons in brain reward regions, and the high co-use and&#xD;
      abuse of alcohol and nicotine, these receptors may play a critical role in modulating&#xD;
      incentive salience and reward responses to alcohol. Thus, the goal of this project is to&#xD;
      examine the influence of CHRNA5 variation and smoking status (smokers and non-smokers) on&#xD;
      alcohol-related phenotypes, including intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA)&#xD;
      behavior and neuroimaging responses to cues signaling alcohol rewards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 128 male and female, non-dependent drinkers, 21-60 years of age.&#xD;
      Participants will be stratified into equally-sized groups based on their smoking status&#xD;
      (smokers and non-smokers) and rs16969968 genotype: 1). A-allele carriers (AA or AG genotype),&#xD;
      and 2). G-allele homozygotes (GG genotype). The study will be open to all racial and ethnic&#xD;
      groups, as long as the individual meets the genotype criteria. Participants will be in good&#xD;
      health as determined by medical history, physical exam, ECG, and lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening, participants will undergo three study visits. The first visit will&#xD;
      include an IV alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA) session using the Computer-Assisted&#xD;
      Infusion System (CAIS), which employs a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)&#xD;
      model-based algorithm that allows participants free access to standardized alcohol infusions.&#xD;
      During this session, breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) and subjective responses will be&#xD;
      measured as markers of the rewarding effects of alcohol. In another visit, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a second IV-ASA session where they will have free-access to alcohol infusions along&#xD;
      with the ability to control the rate of each individual self-administered infusion. This will&#xD;
      provide an operant measure of sensitivity to rate of change of BrAC as an additional marker&#xD;
      of the rewarding effect of alcohol. Finally, participants will undergo a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) session where they will be scanned while performing the Alcohol-Food Incentive&#xD;
      Delay (AFID) task, which assesses neural processing while responding to cues signaling&#xD;
      alcohol reward. Additional fMRI task-based scans and a resting-state scan will also be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measures will be examined as a function of smoking status (smokers and&#xD;
      non-smokers) and CHRNA5 genotype. The influence of sex, age, and recent drinking history will&#xD;
      be examined as covariates. Primary outcome measures include: (1a) BrAC exposure (peak BrAC,&#xD;
      number of infusions, time to binge-level BrAC) during the free-access IV-ASA; (1b) BOLD&#xD;
      response during the AFID task in neural regions associated with alcohol reward processing,&#xD;
      including ventral striatum, amygdala, and insula. Secondary outcome measures include: (2a)&#xD;
      resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the regions associated with the salience&#xD;
      network, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and extended amygdala;&#xD;
      (2b) preferred rate of self-infusion during the second IV-ASA session.&#xD;
