  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term prospective registry study to determine whether Prolaris testing in&#xD;
      patients with favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer influences physician management&#xD;
      decisions toward conservative treatment in patients with Prolaris low-risk scores without&#xD;
      negatively impacting patient oncologic outcomes, thereby sparing low-risk patients from&#xD;
      unnecessary treatments and associated side-effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a long-term prospective registry to evaluate the impact of Prolaris testing on&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions in patients with newly diagnosed favorable intermediate-risk localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer and to summarize clinical oncologic outcomes. The design of the study is&#xD;
      non-interventional, and therefore the protocol will not require a specific treatment plan for&#xD;
      study participants. However, in the absence of a universally accepted timeframe for repeat&#xD;
      biopsies within existing active surveillance recommendations, study sites will be encouraged&#xD;
      to monitor patients for disease progression as per the standard of care (e.g., current&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] guidelines) with the expectation of a repeat&#xD;
      biopsy within 18 months of the initial biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who undergo Prolaris testing will be included in the registry as well as patients&#xD;
      who do not undergo Prolaris testing. Data collection for the first primary objective extends&#xD;
      over a 3-year period. During this time, data is collected on the treatment initiated, any&#xD;
      follow-up prostate biopsy performed in patients initially treated with active surveillance,&#xD;
      definitive treatments performed (with pathology data if surgical therapy is performed), and&#xD;
      the reasons definitive treatment was pursued, as well as data related to disease progression&#xD;
      such as biochemical recurrence, development of prostate cancer metastases, or disease&#xD;
      specific death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for the second primary objective extends out to 8 years. During this time&#xD;
      data is collected on any follow-up prostate biopsy in patients still treated with active&#xD;
      surveillance, definitive treatments performed (with pathology data if surgical therapy is&#xD;
      performed), and the reasons definitive treatment was pursued, as well as data related to&#xD;
      disease progression such as biochemical recurrence, development of prostate cancer&#xD;
      metastases, or disease specific death.&#xD;
