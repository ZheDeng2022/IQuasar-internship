    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to demonstrate the feasibility of point-of-care identification of&#xD;
      Rh-negative women in a poor, rural setting in Pakistan. Feasibility will be assessed across 2&#xD;
      major domains: 1) acceptance by pregnant women to receive the point-of-care test; and, 2)&#xD;
      ability of health workers to administer the point of care test and interpret results. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure whether RhIg prophylaxis can be successfully delivered and is&#xD;
      accepted by pregnant women in this setting. The socio-demographic correlates of the&#xD;
      acceptance of point-of-care testing and where applicable, the acceptance of RhIg prophylaxis&#xD;
      will also be assessed. In addition, the investigators will also explore the baseline&#xD;
      knowledge of Rh disease among pregnant women and lady health visitors in this study&#xD;
      population and will investigate socio-demographic correlates of baseline knowledge and the&#xD;
      uptake of knowledge among pregnant women. Finally, the prevalence of Rh negativity will be&#xD;
      calculated and stillbirth and neonatal mortality will be tracked among all participants. All&#xD;
      stillbirths and neonatal deaths in this population will be characterized with respect to&#xD;
      cause and Rh-negativity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rhesus (Rh) disease is a preventable condition caused by an incompatibility between maternal&#xD;
      and fetal red blood cells (RBCs). If a person's RBCs lacks a certain protein s/he is said to&#xD;
      be Rh-negative. Similarly, if a person's RBCs have that same protein, s/he is said to be&#xD;
      Rh-positive. If a pregnant woman's is Rh-negative and her fetus is Rh-positive, the baby is&#xD;
      at risk of Rh disease. The complications associated with Rh disease include miscarriage,&#xD;
      stillbirth, and neonatal death. Among surviving newborns, Rh disease can cause anemia (low&#xD;
      RBCs, which can appear as feeling tired or weak or having a shortness of breath), jaundice&#xD;
      (yellowing of the skin), and brain damage. If Rh-negative women are identified, there is a&#xD;
      very high chance that Rh disease of the newborn can be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of point-of-care identification&#xD;
      of Rh-negative women in Dadu district, Pakistan. Determining the Rh status of pregnant women&#xD;
      is the first step towards prevention of Rh disease of the newborn. By collecting information&#xD;
      about a) the Rh status and blood type of pregnant women; b) the acceptability of a point of&#xD;
      care test blood test of Rh disease; and, c) the acceptability of treatment for Rh negativity&#xD;
      in pregnant women, the investigators will be able to improve antenatal care and prevent Rh&#xD;
      disease of the newborn in rural settings. The implementation of a point-of-care Rh test will&#xD;
      allow us for the identification of Rh-negative women, prompt provision of treatment, and&#xD;
      prevention of Rh disease of the newborn in rural settings in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, participants will be asked a series of questions to assess&#xD;
      reproductive history of pregnant women and other demographic characteristics (i.e. questions&#xD;
      about home environment and lifestyle). The investigators will also ask whether they are&#xD;
      willing to provide a drop of blood, collected via finger prick, to allow us to determine your&#xD;
      Rh status by ELDONCARD. If Rh test reveals that the pregnant women are Rh negative, the&#xD;
      investigators will offer them up to two doses of treatment, first at approximately 28 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation and again within 72 hours of delivery. The injections will be administered at&#xD;
      the health facility. They will also be asked to undergo an ultrasound procedure by a trained&#xD;
      technician at health facility. Moreover, after the newborn is delivered, the investigators&#xD;
      will also ask a series of question and perform an in-person assessment of newborn to assess&#xD;
      their health within 72 hours of delivery and then again on their 29th day of life. If they&#xD;
      are found to be Rh-negative and they have a miscarriage, stillbirth, or baby dies within the&#xD;
      first month of life, the investigators will ask them if we can collect a sample of their&#xD;
      blood for further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study in Tehsil Headquarter Hospital&#xD;
      (THQ) and District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ) that are situated in Dadu District, Sindh,&#xD;
      Pakistan. In total, between 3 and 5 Lady Health Visitors (LHVs) will be enrolled at the study&#xD;
      THQ and DHQ to administer the point-of-care test and if necessary, prophylaxis. Over the&#xD;
      course of the study period, approximately 2000 pregnant women will be enrolled in total&#xD;
      (across both study sites); liveborn newborns delivered to enrolled pregnant women will be&#xD;
      followed for the first month of life. The sample size of 2000 pregnant women in this study is&#xD;
      driven by the estimated prevalence of Rh negativity in the population (7%) and hence, the&#xD;
      number of women investigators expect to offer two injections of RhIg (n=140). A sample size&#xD;
      of 140 participants will enable us to measure the acceptance RhIg by pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort will include two groups of participants: a) between 3 and 5 LHVs who&#xD;
      are full time employees at THQ Johi and DHQ Dadu and, b) 2000 pregnant women from the&#xD;
      communities in the catchment area of THQ Johi and DHQ Dadu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address one of our study aims, a single questionnaire will be administered to a cadre of&#xD;
      approximately 30 health professionals (i.e., physicians, lady health visitors, nurses, etc.)&#xD;
      who are not otherwise engaged in study activities.&#xD;
