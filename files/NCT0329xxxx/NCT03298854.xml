      To evaluate the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, Negative and positive&#xD;
      predictive value) of skeletal co-registered SPECT/CT imaging in the detection of the etiology&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain(LBP) is extremely common. Though estimates vary widely, studies in developed&#xD;
      countries report one year prevalence of 22-65% and lifetime prevalence up to 84%. (Walker,&#xD;
      2000) (1) The differential diagnosis for back pain is broad and includes degenerative&#xD;
      disease, infection, inflammation, tumors and trauma(Zukotynski, Curtis et al. 2010) (2). The&#xD;
      etiology of low back pain in young athletes differs from that seen in adults, with bony&#xD;
      etiology being more common than disc-related disease(Matesan, Behnia et al. 2016) (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society classify LBP into the&#xD;
      following broad categories: nonspecific LBP, back pain potentially associated with&#xD;
      radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, and back pain potentially associated with another specific&#xD;
      spinal cause. Additionally, guidelines emphasize a focused history and physical examination,&#xD;
      reassurance, initial pain management medications if necessary, and consideration of physical&#xD;
      therapies without imaging in patients with nonspecific LBP. Duration of symptoms also helps&#xD;
      guide treatment algorithms in patients with acute, sub-acute, or chronic LBP.(Chou, Qaseem et&#xD;
      al. 2011) (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many imaging modalities are available to the clinician and radiologist for evaluating LBP.&#xD;
      Application of these modalities depends on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical&#xD;
      problem, and comorbidities of the patient. Radiographs of the lumbar spine are not routinely&#xD;
      recommended in acute nonspecific LBP because they are of limited diagnostic value.&#xD;
      Radiography is the initial imaging study of choice for assessing LBP in patients with a&#xD;
      history of trauma and patients suspected of possible vertebral compression fracture.In&#xD;
      addition, radiographs are recommended to evaluate a young patient for ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis.(Jarvik, Gold et al. 2015) (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with LBP lasting for &gt;6 weeks having completed conservative management with&#xD;
      persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with&#xD;
      severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated&#xD;
      with MRI. Computed tomography (CT) scans provide superior bone detail but are not as useful&#xD;
      in depicting soft tissue pathologies such as disc disease when compared with MRI. CT is&#xD;
      useful for revealing bone structural problems such as spondylolysis, pseudarthrosis,&#xD;
      fracture, scoliosis, and stenosis and for postsurgical evaluation of bone graft integrity,&#xD;
      surgical fusion, and instrumentation (Brinjikji, Luetmer et al. 2015) (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tc-99m methylene diphosphonates bone scan is a highly sensitive technique for detection of&#xD;
      bone diseases and can allow the detection of the pathophysiology of trauma at a very early&#xD;
      stage. Due its excellent sensitivity it is often used as a screening tool, however limited&#xD;
      anatomical details result in poor specificity, It can be performed as limited or whole body&#xD;
      bone scintigraphy (Van der Wall, Lee et al. 2010) (7). Dynamic and blood pool phases can&#xD;
      increase specificity in the diagnosis of inflammatory pathology, but they are not routinely&#xD;
      used in cases of facet joint disease (Shur, Corrigan et al. 2015) (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone scan is a useful clinical tool to explore the etiology of low back pain like&#xD;
      spondylolysis and other less common etiologies in young athletes. It is also particularly&#xD;
      important to detect the active source of pain when more than one bony abnormality is seen in&#xD;
      anatomical imaging. The addition of three dimensional data acquisition SPECT (single photon&#xD;
      emission computed tomography) increases the clinical accuracy due to increased contrast&#xD;
      resolution and anatomical localization.(Matesan, Behnia et al. 2016) (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radionuclide bone scintigraphy with (SPECT) provides functional imaging and is used to detect&#xD;
      microcalcification due to increased osteoblastic activity. In the absence of other pathology&#xD;
      the foci of increased osteoblastic activity reflect areas of mechanical stress and&#xD;
      degenerative change in the skeleton. SPECT has been widely used to evaluate patients with&#xD;
      spinal pain and facet joint arthropathy. For the detection of clinically significant facet&#xD;
      arthropathy, The SPECT/CT images have an incremental diagnostic value that can influence&#xD;
      clinical management by selecting only SPECT positive facet joint targets. (Matar,&#xD;
      Navalkissoor et al. 2013) (9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some aspects, SPECT/ CT can be helpful even in a trauma setting. In particular, the&#xD;
      combination of highly sensitive but nonspecific scintigraphy with non-sensitive but highly&#xD;
      specific computed tomography makes it particularly useful in anatomically complex regions&#xD;
      such as the pelvis and spine. From a trauma surgeon's point of view, the four main&#xD;
      indications for nuclear medicine imaging are the detection of (occult) fractures, and the&#xD;
      imaging of inflammatory bone and joint diseases, chronic diseases and postoperative&#xD;
      complications such as instability of instrumentation or implants. which can consistently be&#xD;
      found in a substantial number of patients (Scheyerer, Pietsch et al. 2014) (10), However its&#xD;
      use as an appropriate imaging modality should be considered carefully given the increased&#xD;
      radiation dose in young individuals with benign disease and low dose CT protocols should be&#xD;
      used (Shur, Corrigan et al. 2015) (8)&#xD;
