      Self paring study, double blind placebo controlled with chronic tinnitus patients attended at&#xD;
      the Tinnitus Research Group HC- FMUSP, complaining of neck and/or cervical pain and with&#xD;
      myofascial trigger point in the head, neck and/or shoulder. They were submitted to a complete&#xD;
      otolaryngologist evaluation which included history, physical examination and myofascial&#xD;
      trigger point checkup. Patients also performed blood tests, tonal and vocal audiometry, and&#xD;
      psychoacoustic tinnitus measures. Self paring study, double blind placebo controlled. Each&#xD;
      patient will be subjected to the dry needling placebo, 4 sessions, 1 per week, with placebo&#xD;
      stretching, followed by washout period of two weeks, and 4 more dry needling therapeutic&#xD;
      sessions and active stretching. On the first day of the study will be conducted the following&#xD;
      evaluation: questionnaires THI and NDI, quantification of cervical pain and tinnitus through&#xD;
      the Visual analogue scale (VAS), search and confirmation of the presence of PGM and cervical&#xD;
      pain, psychoacoustic measures and somatic tests. This evaluation will be repeated at the end&#xD;
      of the four placebo sessions, at the beginning of therapeutic needling sessions and at the&#xD;
      end of the same.&#xD;

      The first phase of the study will be the placebo needling, performed with a sham needle and&#xD;
      following the same procedures than the therapeutic treatment. Four placebo sessions will be&#xD;
      performed, 1 per week, with placebo stretching, followed by washout period of two weeks, and&#xD;
      4 more dry needling therapeutic sessions, also once a week and active stretching. The muscles&#xD;
      selected for dry needling were frontal, temporal, trapezius, masseter, sternocleidomastoid&#xD;
      (SCM), head splenius, scalene, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, rhomboid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure technique Each patient was recommended to assume a relaxed posture suitable to&#xD;
      access the muscles being treated, instructed to expose the painful area, settled himself in&#xD;
      supine, prone, or side lying positions, at a stretcher or a chair, depending on the muscle to&#xD;
      be treated. The main therapist performed MTP target with a pen, hands antisepsis, gloves wear&#xD;
      and skin area cleaning with 70% isopropyl alcohol prior to needling. Along all procedure the&#xD;
      main therapist was able to view the patient's face and to receive regular treating feedback.&#xD;
      A sterile disposable filament needle was inserted directly perpendicular through the skin&#xD;
      using a guide tube that was then removed. Depth needle penetration with slow sidelong&#xD;
      direction in and outside displacements were performed through the muscle until reach MTP&#xD;
      spot. The patient's reaction indicated a &quot;DEQI&quot; (name given for the vague sensation of&#xD;
      needle-specific pain) or a &quot;twitch response&quot; (deflagration of a contractile muscle answer in&#xD;
      the moment that maximum muscle shortening fibers were broken). At this point needle was&#xD;
      leaved static in situ for 30-60 seconds. After the correct treatment needle was removed and&#xD;
      the muscle was active stretched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables studied before and after therapeutic needling were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tinnitus annoying as measured by AVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain magnitude as measured by AVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tinnitus impact on patient's quality of life through THI questionnaire validated for&#xD;
           Portuguese language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cervical pain impact on patient's quality of life through NDI questionnaire validated&#xD;
           for Portuguese language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tinnitus MML through psychoacoustic measures.&#xD;
