    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and trametinib in treating&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer and KRAS gene mutations that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and trametinib may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given in&#xD;
      combination with trametinib in the proposed sequencing schemes in patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess in a preliminary manner the clinical efficacy of these combinations with the&#xD;
      proposed sequencing schemes including overall response rate and progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine in an exploratory manner changes in PD-L1 expression as well as other immune&#xD;
      correlates induced by mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
