  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main idea behind MICRO-LEARNER is to provide new insights about the response of healthy&#xD;
      tissues to radiation by using information from the micro-environment obtained by biological&#xD;
      measurements and imaging. This new knowledge will be included in current available predictive&#xD;
      models of radio-induced toxicity, thus allowing to add unique biological characteristics of&#xD;
      patients to dosimetry and treatment/clinical related variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MICRO-LEARNER focuses on prostate cancer (PCa) and head-and-neck cancer (HNCa). For both&#xD;
      cancers, radiotherapy is effectively used as curative treatment, in single modality or within&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary approach including surgery (PCa) and/or chemotherapy (HNCa). Prediction&#xD;
      and reduction of radio-induced side effects are becoming a priority: for PCa, high survival&#xD;
      rates should be accompanied by a very low rate of moderate/severe toxicities; for HNCa, there&#xD;
      is the need to tailor radiation dose according to disease recurrence risk profile. The shared&#xD;
      aim of both cancers is to balance the improvement in outcome with a well-tolerated toxicity&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research indicates that the intestinal/salivary bacteria are strongly suspected of&#xD;
      being very important in mediating the response to inflammation and lesions. Although their&#xD;
      balance deeply changes during radiotherapy, studies done so far in the field of the&#xD;
      microbiota-host relationship in radiotherapy have not addressed their role in insurgence of&#xD;
      radiation toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will assess how microbial populations evolve and how this&#xD;
      influences the host and radiation induced toxicity in a significant number of patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, the individual response at the tissue microstructure level, through analysis of&#xD;
      images with advanced bioengineering techniques, will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this research, besides suggesting new ways to predict patients at risk of&#xD;
      relevant side-effects, may also suggest possible treatments to change the baseline microbiota&#xD;
      of patients at high risk or to modify it during therapy, in order to mitigate toxicity.&#xD;
      Understanding the microbiota-radiotherapy interaction may thus lead to novel, effective and&#xD;
      inexpensive ways of assessing and managing complications of cancer treatment.&#xD;

      **Prospective Clinical Trial: discovery population**&#xD;
&#xD;
      130 PCa and 130 HNCa consecutive patients will be enrolled in 18 months. All patients will&#xD;
      receive radiotherapy at radical curative doses at the National Cancer Institute in Milan, and&#xD;
      follow-up visits at the same centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed pre-treatment evaluation will include: recording of demographic features, clinical&#xD;
      history, comorbidities and habits, evaluation of normal tissue functioning by the health&#xD;
      practitioner (CTCAE scoring system), evaluation of quality of life and normal tissue&#xD;
      functioning through validated patient reported outcome (PROs) questionnaires, evaluation of&#xD;
      organ functioning by instrumental measures (i.e. baseline swallowing screening with flexible&#xD;
      endoscopic evaluation of swallowing - FEES - and unstimulated salivary flow for HNCa&#xD;
      patients), biochemical examinations, gut (PCa)/salivary (HNCa) microbiome measurement,&#xD;
      determination of baseline level of plasma/salivary inflammatory markers, baseline&#xD;
      multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive radiotherapy and possible adjuvant (hormone or chemo) therapies as&#xD;
      foreseen by international guidelines. In this aspect the here proposed trial is an&#xD;
      observational study, no modification to standard regimens is considered. Radiotherapy is&#xD;
      performed with 6 MV photon beams delivered with Volumetric Modulated arc Therapy (VMAT)&#xD;
      technique at conventional fractionations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation during treatment will include weekly assessment of toxicity, as measured by the&#xD;
      clinician (according to CTCAE v 4.0) and by PROs and biochemical measurements, and evaluation&#xD;
      of inflammatory markers (plasmatic and salivary cytokines) after a dose of 20 Gy. For a&#xD;
      subpopulation of 60 oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy +/-&#xD;
      chemotherapy an additional MRI study during the second week of treatment is foreseen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment at the end of radiotherapy will include evaluation of toxicity by the clinician&#xD;
      and by PROs, FEES and unstimulated salivary flow for HNCa patients, biochemical examinations,&#xD;
      gut/salivary microbiome measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months will include: evaluation of toxicity by the clinician and by&#xD;
      PROs, FEES and unstimulated salivary flow for HNCa patients and biochemical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum follow-up is set to 12 months for the specific purpose of evaluation of acute and&#xD;
      mid-term toxicity, which are the endpoints considered in this project. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      follow-up will continue until 3 years after the end of radiotherapy (beyond the end of the&#xD;
      project) in order to allow evaluation of incidence, prevalence and patterns of late&#xD;
      side-effects, as well as for survival outcome assessment. After 12 months, follow-up will be&#xD;
      performed every 6 months and limited to assessment of toxicity by the clinician and by PROs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up MRI studies will be performed at 3, 12 and 24 months for HNCa patients and at 12&#xD;
      months for PCa patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Prospective Clinical Trial: validation population**&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 PCa and 70 HNCa consecutive patients will be enrolled in 12 months, starting immediately&#xD;
      after the end of enrolment of the discovering population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this second phase is validation of results on microbiota, specifically on&#xD;
      association between selected baseline microbiota profiles and the risk of acute toxicity (for&#xD;
      the purpose of this project) and for mid-term/late toxicity (beyond this projects). This&#xD;
      result should be the more significant from the clinical point of view, allowing development&#xD;
      of a therapeutic algorithm to be used before treatment and permitting introduction ways of&#xD;
      changing the make-up of gut/salivary bacteria in patients at high risk of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment, treatment and follow-up evaluation of toxicity by the clinician and by&#xD;
      PROs will follow the scheme described for the developing population. Microbioma measurement&#xD;
      will be only performed at baseline, due to the higher clinical interest in having a test&#xD;
      determining patient radiosensitivity before treatment. Imaging and assessment of inflammatory&#xD;
      marker levels will not be accomplished in the validation population.&#xD;
