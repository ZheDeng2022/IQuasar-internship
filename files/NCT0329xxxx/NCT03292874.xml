  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This high resolution MRI (hrMRI), along with stand MRI (sMRI) will be obtained at baseline&#xD;
      and again in approximately 1 year in patients on prostate cancer active surveillance. Changes&#xD;
      in lesion size and ADC values will be assessed on the serial studies. This study evaluates&#xD;
      the hypothesis that hrMRI will detect changes that sMRI cannot detect and that these changes&#xD;
      will correlate with prostate cancer progression as determined on prostate biopsy.&#xD;

      2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparametric MRI Multiparametric MRI combining T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and&#xD;
      dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) images is commonly employed for detection and localization of&#xD;
      prostate lesions. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is sensitive to the diffusion of water&#xD;
      molecules interacting with surrounding macromolecules. DWI, which provides a quantitative&#xD;
      biological parameter called apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, is a robust MRI&#xD;
      parameter for differentiating benign and malignant prostate tissue. In fact, the latest&#xD;
      version of the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scoring system relies&#xD;
      almost exclusively on DWI to identify tumors in the peripheral zone, which is where the vast&#xD;
      majority of prostate cancers form. Findings on T2 images are not used to identify cancer, and&#xD;
      DCE images are only used to differentiate between some PI-RADS 3 and 4 lesions. In a pilot&#xD;
      study of prostate cancer AS, DW-MRI was useful for detecting progression of Gleason score&#xD;
      based on changes in ADC value. Tumor size is another important clinical criterion for&#xD;
      defining low risk prostate cancer, and tumor size based on DWI has been shown to crudely&#xD;
      predict low risk prostate cancer. However, conventional DWI using single-shot echo-planar&#xD;
      imaging is unable to detect small tumors, low grade tumors, or small changes in tumor size on&#xD;
      serial imaging. Approximately 20% of small, low grade tumors found in men on AS are detected&#xD;
      on modern prostate MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Resolution MRI Investigators introduce a new three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted imaging sequence (HR-DWI), which improves image quality while conferring&#xD;
      at least a 5-fold improvement in resolution when compared to standard two-dimensional (2D)&#xD;
      DWI (S-DWI). This novel 3D DWI technique has been developed by our team and can be applied on&#xD;
      existing 1.5T or 3T MRI systems. S-DWI suffers from two important limitations. a) It uses&#xD;
      single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) for data acquisition, which produces magnetic&#xD;
      susceptibility induced streaking artifacts and geometric distortions so that round objects&#xD;
      may appear oval. b) The relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and 2D image acquisition with&#xD;
      S-DWI limit spatial resolution, which is defined by the minimum distance between two objects&#xD;
      required to resolve them uniquely. Our HR-DWI overcomes these limitations by using&#xD;
      magnetization prepared, multi-shot, turbo-spin-echo acquisition, which improves&#xD;
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution, and image quality, and eliminates geometric&#xD;
      distortions and streaking artifacts associated with EPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary studies assessing the performance of our HR-DWI in a prospective pilot trial&#xD;
      of prostate cancer AS patients, the technique could detect tumors not seen on S-DWI and&#xD;
      measure ADC, which correlates with grade. This is important because the long-term natural&#xD;
      history of small prostate cancers invisible to S-DWI has never been prospectively defined, in&#xD;
      part due to lack of adequate imaging technology. In the era of molecular diagnostics and&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing, an important step in understanding the biology of these lesions&#xD;
      is to develop technologies to image and characterize these lesions. Importance of HR-DWI&#xD;
      includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better imaging will allow these lesions to be monitored serially and targeted for&#xD;
           biopsy, providing tissue for both histologic and molecular characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher resolution imaging will better delineate tumor boundaries, which can improve&#xD;
           tumor staging and identify margins during partial-gland ablation by cryotherapy or high&#xD;
           intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), which was approved in 2015 by the U.S. FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved imaging resolution will allow for more accurate measurement of tumor size and&#xD;
           ADC, and detection of small changes in size or grade over time. Standard prostate DWI&#xD;
           has poor resolution; therefore, tumor growth kinetics have never been accepted as&#xD;
           clinical criteria for cancer progression while on AS. If tumor growth kinetics or&#xD;
           changes in grade determined by ADC prove prognostic, AS can rely less on serial&#xD;
           transrectal biopsies, which can lead to serious complications.&#xD;
