  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate to identify specific polyunsaturated fatty acids that show&#xD;
      significant differences between ADHD and control groups. In addition, these findings may&#xD;
      offer more biological understanding in explaining the relationship between polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids and visual memory among children with ADHD. The results will significantly&#xD;
      contribute to the knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD, especially the&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids related to the behavioral/visual memory deficits of ADHD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early onset and long-term&#xD;
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies, detection&#xD;
      and diagnosis are very important for ADHD. According to the investigators' previous work,&#xD;
      children with ADHD have visual memory deficits as well as inattentive deficits. Previous&#xD;
      studies show that polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with cognitive problems in&#xD;
      children. Analyzing differences in polyunsaturated fatty acids between children with ADHD and&#xD;
      healthy controls could provide insight into underlying disease pathology of cognitive&#xD;
      deficits. In this one-year project, the researchers will perform an analysis of&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum to identify potential biomarkers for the visual memory&#xD;
      deficits of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the specific polyunsaturated fatty acids of ADHD symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the relationship between specific polyunsaturated fatty acids and visual&#xD;
           memory deficits of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a one-year project. After careful calculation of sample size, the study will recruit&#xD;
      35 children with ADHD, aged 7-18, and 35 healthy controls with matched age, sex and BMI. The&#xD;
      investigators will quantify the polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum. The behavioral measures&#xD;
      include ADHDRS-IV, SNAP-IV, CBCL, CGI-ADHD-S, SAICA, and Family APGAR-C. The Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) will be used to assess the visual memory&#xD;
      of all participants. Conditional logistic regression and partial least squares discriminant&#xD;
      analysis will be applied to identify significant polyunsaturated fatty acids for ADHD and&#xD;
      visual memory deficits.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with ADHD are eligible to be included in this study only if they meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients will be outpatients who are between 7 and 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have ADHD that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
             disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) disease diagnostic criteria assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator's clinical evaluation, as well as confirmed by the Chinese version of the&#xD;
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age&#xD;
             Children-Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) score &gt; 4&#xD;
             at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be psychotropic drug-naïve. Patients will be considered to be drug-naïve&#xD;
             if they have never received medications specifically to treat ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients and parents (or legal representative) must have a degree of understanding&#xD;
             sufficient to be able to communicate suitably with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be of normal intelligence in the judgment of the investigator. Normal&#xD;
             intelligence is defined as achieving a score of 80 or more when IQ testing is&#xD;
             administrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments&#xD;
             for clinic visits and all tests, including neuropsychological testing and&#xD;
             venipunctures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          1. Patients with current or past history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective Disorder,&#xD;
             organic psychosis, bipolar I or II disorder, autism, or autism spectrum disorder.&#xD;
             Other comorbid psychiatric disorders are not excluded if the ADHD symptoms are the&#xD;
             primary source of impairment for the patient.&#xD;

             patients who are taking anticonvulsants for seizure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients have been at serious suicidal risk, determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 3 months, or who are&#xD;
             currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any described or over-the-counter&#xD;
             medication in a manner that the investigator considers indicative of abuse.&#xD;
