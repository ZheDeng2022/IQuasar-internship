  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to better define and evaluate Serelys PMS in terms of&#xD;
      the impact on the different premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms , tolerance, satisfaction&#xD;
      and overall quality of life of women with known discomforts during the premenstrual period.&#xD;
      The data from this study will be compared to data when the two different ingredients are&#xD;
      given as monotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than every other women aged 15 to 50 years of age have premenstrual symptoms such as&#xD;
      irritability, mood swings, fatigue, headaches, sleep disturbances, breast and abdominal pain,&#xD;
      bloating, water retention and weight gain. Some signs continue during menstruation. These&#xD;
      psychological and physical manifestations can make women vulnerable and have a negative&#xD;
      impact on their professional, social and sexual life. Randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of pollen extract in&#xD;
      premenstrual discomfort. The premenstrual period is probably caused by a change in the normal&#xD;
      amount of sex hormones which can induce disorders in the central neuroendocrine system and&#xD;
      estrogens are reported to reduce PMS symptoms to some extend. Moreover, it is well&#xD;
      established that serotonin may play a role in PMS, as some inhibitors of serotonin re-uptake&#xD;
      (SSRI) have an impact on premenstrual disorders. However, side effects may occur even when&#xD;
      using estrogens as well as SSRI. Recently the pollen extract formulation has been improved by&#xD;
      adding a natural extract of saffron. This latter component is known for its beneficial action&#xD;
      on maintaining comfort during the menstrual cycle of the woman and it especially supports&#xD;
      mood changes, one of the mayor PMS symptoms. The effect of Safran was studied more&#xD;
      specifically in a randomized controlled double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in&#xD;
      women with premenstrual discomfort. This study showed a progressive and significant&#xD;
      improvement after the use of saffron. In an other study saffron was documented to improve&#xD;
      mood in patients with milder depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the components of saffron helps to improve the well-being of women during the&#xD;
      premenstrual and menstrual period and have a well documented impact on mood. The pollen based&#xD;
      extracts have well documented impact on most of PMS symptoms but possibly lesser on mood&#xD;
      changes, which is also one of the mayor symptoms of PMS. The mechanisms by which saffron and&#xD;
      pollen based extraction works is expected to be different and an additive impact is expected.&#xD;
      The investigation is initiated by the researchers who feel that in PMS an alternatives to&#xD;
      SSRI and estrogen treatment is needed.&#xD;
