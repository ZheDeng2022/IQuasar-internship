    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve compression disorder in the upper&#xD;
      extremity. Therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome includes physical and occupational therapy, the&#xD;
      use of splints and other local measures, and corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel.&#xD;
      When these measures fail, open surgical release is considered the next step. Although the&#xD;
      main disadvantage of corticosteroid injection is that symptoms are often short-lived relief&#xD;
      and partial relief, it may not provide a permanent solution, corticosteroid injections are&#xD;
      chosen because of lower level of invasiveness, faster recovery, and ease of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) reveals tissue microstructure based on&#xD;
      random movements of water molecules. The measured diffusion-weighted images are further&#xD;
      analyzed for parameter images that describe different characteristics of diffusion: apparent&#xD;
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) is an absolute measure of the strength of diffusion, and&#xD;
      fractional anisotropy (FA) describes the asymmetry of the diffusion direction due to tissue&#xD;
      structures. Because the axonal cell membrane and the myelin sheath in nerve fibers prevent&#xD;
      diffusion in the direction which is perpendicular to their fascicles, resulting in the&#xD;
      isotropy of the diffusion of water molecules being lost. DTI is the only method which can&#xD;
      give an indirect view of the microstructure of nervous tissue in addition to the pathway of&#xD;
      the fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTI has been applied to study peripheral nerves, to demonstrate the feasibility of the method&#xD;
      and to study nerve entrapment in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a decrease in FA in patients with CTS compared to healthy volunteers. The DTI&#xD;
      parameters of the median nerve have revealed significant increase of FA and decrease in ADC&#xD;
      with complete symptom relief 6 months after carpal tunnel release. However, Hiltunen et al.&#xD;
      have demonstrated a significant decrease in ADC but no alter in FA in patients received open&#xD;
      carpal tunnel release 1 year later and felt complete symptoms relief. By means of open carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release, follow-up recordings were made at least 6 months after the operation to&#xD;
      ensure time for post-operative tissue recovery. As a result, the investigators still do not&#xD;
      understand the relevance between the parameters of DTI to symptoms relief in CTS patients&#xD;
      receiving conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different from carpal tunnel release, steroid injections are popular technique for CTS&#xD;
      treatment and are believed to reduce perineural inﬂammation or soft tissue swelling, and may&#xD;
      stabilize the neural membrane, thus limiting the ephaptic transmission in ischemic nerve&#xD;
      ﬁbers which causes symptoms. Corticosteroid injections can provide a rapid symptom relief at&#xD;
      2 weeks follow up. However, there is no report addressing the relation of functional change&#xD;
      of median nerve at several anatomic locations to the symptom relief of CTS. Here the&#xD;
      investigators monitored, by means of DTI, median nerve integrity in CTS patients before and&#xD;
      after corticosteroid injection. This information may help to explain the hypothesis regarding&#xD;
      the effect of corticosteroid to the median nerve, to identify which anatomic location of&#xD;
      median nerve relevant to the symptom relief of CTS after corticosteroid injection, and be&#xD;
      useful for the clinical follow-up of patients with nerve entrapments following conservative&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Study subjects This study was approved by the institutional research ethics board. Written&#xD;
      informed consent was prospectively obtained from all study subjects. Twelve consecutive&#xD;
      patients (nine females, three male; mean age, 56 years; range, 38 to 76 years) suffering from&#xD;
      bilateral CTS referred for consideration of carpal tunnel steroid injection were&#xD;
      prospectively recruited. Inclusion criteria consisted of a clinical diagnosis of unilateral&#xD;
      or bilateral CTS based on a standardized and validated diagnostic scale. The degree of the&#xD;
      entrapment ranged from mild to severe according to the American Association of&#xD;
      Electrodiagnostic Medicine ratings: mild = slowing of sensory conduction velocity (&lt;50 m/s),&#xD;
      moderate = slowing of sensory conduction velocity (&lt;50 m/s) and delayed motor distal latency&#xD;
      (&gt;4 ms), and severe = absence of sensory response. Exclusion criteria included prior carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release or contraindications to MRI. All patients also had the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      supported by electrodiagnostic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound needle guidance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US-guided injection procedure was performed in a standardized manner. The one-needle&#xD;
      two-syringe technique with US guidance was used (1) one needle is used for anesthesia,&#xD;
      hydrodissection, and intra-carpal tunnel injection; (2) the first syringe is used to&#xD;
      anesthetize, hydrodissect, and dilate the intra-carpal tunnel space; and (3) the second&#xD;
      syringe is used to inject the corticosteroid therapy into the new hydrodissected space. After&#xD;
      hydrodissection, the empty lidocaine syringe was detached from the needle while still in the&#xD;
      carpal tunnel, and a 3-ml syringe prefilled with 10 mg triamcinolone acetonide suspension was&#xD;
      attached to the indwelling needle, and the treatment was slowly injected into the&#xD;
      hydrodissected neutral space. The injections were performed in a standardized fashion by a&#xD;
      musculoskeletal radiologist (Y.C.H.) with 13 years of experience in US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI protocol Magnetic resonance images were acquired at 3.0 T (Discovery MR750, GE&#xD;
      Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using a 8-channel wrist coil (GE Healthcare, Gainesville, FL,&#xD;
      USA). The coil was at the center of the magnet to maximize the magnetic-field homogeneity.&#xD;
      The subject's hand was fixed with a plastic plate and Velcro tape to the coil to restrict&#xD;
      movements; the subjects were examined in prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For DTI, the investigators recorded non-diffusion-weighted b0 image and 15 diffusion gradient&#xD;
      directions with b = 1,200 s/mm2 from 20 axial slices of 4 mm thickness. Slices were&#xD;
      positioned to cover the whole carpal tunnel and in part the proximal and distal nerve. The&#xD;
      two most proximal and distal slices were excluded from the analysis because of potential bias&#xD;
      caused by the rapid decrease in homogeneity at the edge of the coil. Thus, the total&#xD;
      proximal-distal range examined was 80 mm. The other imaging parameters were as follows:&#xD;
      repetition time (TR) = 10,000 ms, echo time (TE) = 101 ms, number of averages = 3 (during&#xD;
      post-processing), field of view (FOV) = 12 cm and matrix 100 × 80 pixels. The voxel size was&#xD;
      thus 1.46 × 1.46 ×4 mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to DTI, the imaging protocol comprised the following MRI sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Axial T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE): TR = 5,430 ms, TE = 88 ms, echo train length&#xD;
           (ETL) = 16, FOV = 12 cm, matrix 224 × 256 pixels, phase FOV = 0.7, the same slice&#xD;
           positions as in DTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Axial T1-weighted fast spin echo (FSE): TR = 457 ms, TE = 11~33 ms, flip angle = 110°,&#xD;
           FOV = 12 cm, matrix 384 × 256 pixels, phase FOV = 0.7, the same slice positions as in&#xD;
           DTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' medical records were reviewed by a neurologist (F.C.Y.). Routinely, the&#xD;
      investigators recorded clinical data (including sex, age, and side of injection, and the&#xD;
      effect of treatment. The satisfaction scale of patients was rated using a Likert scale: 5 =&#xD;
      greatly satisfactory; 4 = some residual symptoms and satisfaction &gt; 50%; 3 = some residual&#xD;
      symptoms and satisfaction = 50% ; 2 = residual symptoms and satisfaction &lt; 50%; 1=&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) is the most commonly used&#xD;
      questionnaire for the measurement of the severity of symptoms and functional status with&#xD;
      reproducibility, internal consistency, and validity in patients with CTS. The symptom&#xD;
      severity subscale of BCTQ consists of 11 questions with scores from 1 point (mildest) to 5&#xD;
      points (most severe), and the functional status of BCTQ subscale is made up of 8 questions&#xD;
      with scores from 1 point (no difficulty in activity) to 5 points (unable to perform the&#xD;
      activity at all). Patients were seen in the subsequent clinical visit to determine outcomes.&#xD;
      The investigators also recorded the decrement of BCTQ between the pre-injection and&#xD;
      post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Two investigators (Y.C.H., H.Y.C.) with experience in peripheral nerve imaging&#xD;
      assessed the quality of the DTI source data. No case with visible motion artefacts was&#xD;
      identified. Eddy current induced distortion occasionally appeared on the very proximal&#xD;
      imaging planes, but did not affect the measurement regions. The DTI source data was post&#xD;
      processed using the commercial post-processing workstation (GE Healthcare, ADW4.5). The&#xD;
      investigators blinded to clinical data, side, and time point relative to steroid injection&#xD;
      randomly performed all measurements. The same author performed a second blinded analysis of&#xD;
      all acquired datasets after a 2-week period. Raw DTI data was initially reviewed with regard&#xD;
      to image quality and occurrence of artefacts. After performing the GE Workspace imaging&#xD;
      co-registration of EPI images for motion correction (through plane), DTI-based tractography&#xD;
      (DTT) of the median nerve was performed. By defining at least two seed points, fibers passing&#xD;
      in anterograde and retrograde direction followed a streamline algorithm and terminated if FA&#xD;
      values were below 0.15 or if there were angle changes over 27°. The median nerve was&#xD;
      visualized using at least three different attempts with two ROIs placed at different slice&#xD;
      positions along the nerve (covering the entire imaged carpal tunnel). The 3D course of the&#xD;
      nerve was tracked with DTT computed with the FACT algorithm (Fiber Assignment by Continuous&#xD;
      Tracking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured&#xD;
      bilaterally at each time point. FA and ADC were calculated from free-hand regions of interest&#xD;
      (ROIs) placed in the center of the median nerve at three levels: at the level of the distal&#xD;
      radioulnar joint (the most proximal slice where by the distal radio ulnar joint was&#xD;
      visualized) and at the level of the flexor retinaculum (level of the pisiform). To avoid&#xD;
      partial volume artifacts, care was taken to draw the ROIs slightly smaller than the&#xD;
      cross-sectional area of the median nerve. The size of the ROIs depended on the&#xD;
      cross-sectional area of the nerve and all ROIs were placed on one slice only. Anatomic&#xD;
      reference images were used to identify the median nerve. The measurement of each parameter&#xD;
      was repeated three times and the mean was calculated. Representative images are presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the assessment of DTT, the investigators determined the nerve fiber tractography by&#xD;
      morphology. Four different nerve trajectory patterns were defined by Breitenseher et al.: (1)&#xD;
      If there was no alteration of the peripheral nerve trajectories, the pattern was rated&#xD;
      &quot;continuous&quot;. (2) If the trajectories were continuous, but irregularly organized, peripheral&#xD;
      nerve tractography result was rated &quot;deranged&quot; .(3) In cases where only some of the ulnar&#xD;
      nerve trajectories were interrupted in one peripheral nerve segment, the finding was defined&#xD;
      as &quot;partially discontinuous &quot;. (4) If there was a complete discontinuity of all trajectories&#xD;
      and a &quot;gap&quot; on at least one plane, tractography was classified as &quot;completely discontinuous&quot;.&#xD;
      DTT images were evaluated by two readers (Y.C.H., G.S.H.) in consensus.&#xD;
