      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of the embrace device after repair&#xD;
      of linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis. We will use a split wound model,&#xD;
      half of the wound is treated with the embrace device and the other half is not treated.&#xD;
      Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician observer scar&#xD;
      assessment scale, a validated scar instrument. The scar width and adverse events will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the surgical repair of cutaneous wounds, scar formation is inevitable and results&#xD;
      in varying degrees of aesthetic and/or functional impairment. Numerous treatment modalities&#xD;
      have been employed to treat scars. Carbon dioxide and pulse dye lasers, as well as&#xD;
      dermabrasion can reduce erythema and irregular topology of the scar surface1,2.&#xD;
      Silicone-based products have also been used to treat post-surgical scars, including gels,&#xD;
      sheets, and tape3-5. Intralesional steroids are often injected into to induce flattening of a&#xD;
      scar6. More recent research has highlighted the impact of mechanical forces and tension on&#xD;
      scar formation. In one report, incisions in both pigs and humans were treated with a&#xD;
      tension-shielding device and showed a reduction in scarring7. More recently two clinical&#xD;
      trials have been published in the plastic surgery literature showing that the use of the&#xD;
      embrace device, a silicone-based dressing designed to minimize wound tension, is effective in&#xD;
      improving the aesthetic outcome following scar revision surgery8,9. While these initial&#xD;
      studies of the embrace device have promising findings, there are significant drawbacks to&#xD;
      both studies including small study population, inclusion of patients seeking scar revision (a&#xD;
      select group likely predisposed to poor scar cosmesis and not representative of first-time&#xD;
      surgical patients), investigator conflict of interest, and the use of a digital&#xD;
      software-based scar assessment tool using patients photos that were not standardized with&#xD;
      respect to lighting or distance. Therefore, larger studies in first-time surgical patients&#xD;
      with standardized photos for scar assessment are required to validate this potentially&#xD;
      promising device for improved scar cosmesis.&#xD;
