  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional and prospective studies are proposed to test the prediction that a higher&#xD;
      proportion of HIV+ individuals with hazardous alcohol drinking with subclinical fasting&#xD;
      dysglycemia will present with impaired oral glucose tolerance and dysfunctional metabolic&#xD;
      skeletal muscle phenotype. Prospective studies will test the efficacy of an exercise&#xD;
      intervention in improving glycemic control. Results will inform larger scale interventions to&#xD;
      ameliorate metabolic comorbidities, improve health, quality of life, and possibly decrease&#xD;
      hazardous alcohol drinking.&#xD;

      Adult male and female in care PLWHA with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt;94 mg/dL and &lt;125&#xD;
      mg/dL will be recruited. Measures of FPG and HbA1c obtained from overnight fasted subjects.&#xD;
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) will be assessed by AUDIT and time-line follow back&#xD;
      questionnaires, coupled with Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) measures. Glucose tolerance will be&#xD;
      assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood sample collected at the time of the&#xD;
      OGTT will be used for determination of circulating levels of adipokines (adiponectin and&#xD;
      resistin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of adult male and female PLWHA +/- AUD with impaired OGTT will be recruited to&#xD;
      undergo skeletal muscle (SKM) biopsy (vastus lateralis), 90 min after a defined (calorie and&#xD;
      nutrient composition) meal (i.e.,Ensure, Carnation Instant Breakfast). Muscle samples will be&#xD;
      used for phenotype characterization (markers of inflammation, insulin signaling,&#xD;
      mitochondrial homeostasis) and for myoblast isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult male and female PLWHA +/- AUD with impaired OGTT will undergo a moderate intensity&#xD;
      aerobic exercise intervention that will include the wearing of an accelerometer (i.e. Fitbit&#xD;
      Zip) to monitor daily activity and steps. A SKM biopsy will be performed after completion of&#xD;
      the exercise protocol in a subset of subjects to examine the changes in gene expression and&#xD;
      myoblast mitochondrial oxidative capacity. We will expand recruitment by enrolling PLWHA +/-&#xD;
      AUD based on a FPG between 94-120 mg/dL to participate in the exercise intervention.&#xD;
      Clearance for participation in this study will require EKG, completion of a physical activity&#xD;
      readiness questionnaire, and medical clearance from a staff clinician. Individuals with&#xD;
      significant peripheral neuropathies or the prevalence of significant cardiovascular&#xD;
      impairments (i.e. resting cardiac abnormalities or arrhythmias, severe hypertension, etc.)&#xD;
      will be excluded from exercise testing or intervention. The 10-week exercise intervention&#xD;
      program will consist of aerobic exercise 3 days per week of moderate intensity for 30-45&#xD;
      minutes each session with the goal of achieving 135 minutes per week. The program will begin&#xD;
      at low-moderate intensity (40 to 50% of heart rate reserve; HRR) and progress to a higher&#xD;
      intensity (50 to 60% HRR) exercise after week 4 of the program. The frequency and duration of&#xD;
      exercise sessions will remain constant after week 4 so the absolute dose of exercise will be&#xD;
      altered through increasing intensity, i.e. from low-moderate to more vigorous. All exercise&#xD;
      will be completed on a treadmill at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center&#xD;
      (LSUHSC) Wellness Center. Additionally, each participant will be provided with a Fitbit Zip&#xD;
      to monitor daily activity and steps. Data from the Fitbit Zip will be downloaded weekly&#xD;
      basis. Participants will be given a healthy step goal of 7000 steps per day. Based on initial&#xD;
      step counts after the first week of wearing the accelerometer, individual goals will be&#xD;
      discussed with the participants. Personal limitations that develop during the study period&#xD;
      (i.e. peripheral neuropathy, orthopedic limitation, etc.) will be monitored and will be&#xD;
      reason for exclusion from the exercise program. All sessions will be supervised and adherence&#xD;
      to the exercise prescription will be fully monitored under the supervision and care of Dr.&#xD;
      Stefany Primeaux in consultation with Dr. Neil Johannsen.&#xD;
