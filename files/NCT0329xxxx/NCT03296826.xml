    <textblock>
      To determine the incidence and risk factors in the development of ovarian, fallopian tube,&#xD;
      and peritoneal cancers in Japanese women carrying Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene (BRCA)1/2&#xD;
      variants.&#xD;

      1. To estimate the incidence of ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers in women&#xD;
           carrying BRCA1/2 variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate risk factors concerning the development of ovarian, fallopian tube, and&#xD;
           peritoneal cancers (loci of BRCA1/2 genetic variants, modifier genes, genetic&#xD;
           polymorphism, hormones, and lifestyle habits.) in women carrying BRCA1/2 variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the detection rates of occult cancer based on histopathological evaluations,&#xD;
           using risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the risk-reducing effect of RRSO on the development of ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
           tube, and peritoneal cancers in women carrying BRCA1/2 variants, and compare with those&#xD;
           not undergoing RRSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify clinicopathological features in women carrying BRCA1/2 variants who had&#xD;
           undergone RRSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To identify the appropriate interval or degree of surveillance.&#xD;
