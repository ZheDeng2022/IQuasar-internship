  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify the optimal second line treatment option for patients&#xD;
      with a poor prognosis metastasized Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) with respect&#xD;
      to Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) rate and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is CBR in mCRPC patients with poor prognostic features and previously&#xD;
      treated with docetaxel, randomized between cabazitaxel (Arm A) and novel hormonal agents&#xD;
      (abiraterone OR enzalutamide) as second-line therapy (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm A will receive cabazitaxel and prednisone and patients in Arm B will receive&#xD;
      abiraterone and prednisone OR enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens evaluated in this trial are used in common mCRPC treatment practice and&#xD;
      are reimbursed. Risk of side effects or death as a result of treatment is not affected by the&#xD;
      trial design. At baseline, prior to each treatment cycle and at end of treatment, patients&#xD;
      are requested to visit the out-patient clinic, where a physical exam will be performed in&#xD;
      combination with vena puncture for blood analysis. Radiological evaluation will be performed&#xD;
      at base line, after 3 months of treatment and at end of treatment. All above mentioned&#xD;
      interventions can be considered as standard practice. Patients are requested to fill out QoL&#xD;
      and pain/analgesic use questionnaires at base line, prior to each cycle and at end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a prospective, multicenter, national, randomized, open label phase IIB study. Study&#xD;
      population: Males over 18 years with mCRPC, previously treated with docetaxel and features of&#xD;
      poor prognostic disease; including duration of response to androgen deprivation shorter than&#xD;
      one year, liver metastases, disease progression during docetaxel treatment or within 6 months&#xD;
      after docetaxel treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm A will receive cabazitaxel and prednisone and patients in Arm B will receive&#xD;
      abiraterone and prednisone OR enzalutamide.&#xD;

      endpoints include: formal comparison of the CBR in both study arms, Time To Symptomatic&#xD;
      Progression (TTSP), Time To PSA (prostate specific antigen), Progression (TTPP), and Time To&#xD;
      Radiologic Progression (TTRP), progression free survival, overall survival, safety/ toxicity&#xD;
