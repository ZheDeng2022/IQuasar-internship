  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Half of the women present an episode of cystitis once in their lives. A recurrence occurs in&#xD;
      about 20% to 30% of the patients, and half of these patients will make more than 4 episodes&#xD;
      per year, defining recurrent cystitis (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications such as pyelonephritis are rare (less than 0.5% of patients in the absence of&#xD;
      underlying complication), however, CRs are responsible for a significant impact on women but&#xD;
      also on society. Pain is at the forefront, but also the fear of not managing pollakiuria,&#xD;
      with its social exclusion. The impact on sexuality is major. The medical circuit imposed on&#xD;
      the patients is long and arduous. The clinical assessment sometimes reveals favorable&#xD;
      factors, variable in pre- or post-menopause, but in the majority of cases, no explanatory&#xD;
      cause can resolve the problem and some authors suggest resignation as a classic reaction to&#xD;
      this problem. The only study on psychological disorders associated with recurrent cystitis&#xD;
      suggests patients who are much more anxious than the average of female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnotherapy is an old technique, used for care in Western societies for at least two hundred&#xD;
      years. By the word, the practitioner induces in the patient a particular state of&#xD;
      consciousness characterized by an indifference on the outside and a hyper suggestibility.&#xD;
      This &quot;hypnotic&quot; state of consciousness can be used to amplify the patient's internal&#xD;
      resources to fight against anxiety and pain, and to eliminate symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological mechanisms at work in hypnosis are the subject of recent studies becoming&#xD;
      more and more precise. The results of these studies made it possible to objectify changes in&#xD;
      cerebral functioning related to hypnotic trance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report by Inserm of 2015 confirms the effectiveness of this practice in hypnosedation,&#xD;
      hypnoanalgesia and hypnotherapy, particularly in irritable bowel syndrome, although the&#xD;
      methodology to be used in its evaluation is difficult and subjective. The principal&#xD;
      investigator hypothesizes that the symptoms presented in recurrent cystitis (pain, anxiety)&#xD;
      can be improved by hypnotherapy, and that thus the prognosis of this pathology can be totally&#xD;
      modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of any study published in the literature, the investigator propose an&#xD;
      intervention pilot study with minimal risks and constraints monocentric prospective&#xD;
      non-randomized prospectively in 15 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to demonstrate that hypnotherapy improves the&#xD;
      psycho-emotional parameters of patients suffering from recurrent cystitis after 3 hypnosis&#xD;
      sessions combined with home exercises performed by the patient. The evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out during the last session of hypnosis.&#xD;
