  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main challenges of thoracic oncology lies in earlier diagnosis of lung cancer to&#xD;
      improve survival rate, wich is about 15% at 5 years. This poor prognosis is often linked to&#xD;
      late diagnosis. Efforts are being made worldwide to offer testing in patients at risk or&#xD;
      earlier diagnosis of lung cancer in order to offer the patient curative treatments. Indeed,&#xD;
      supported at the stage of nodule (less than 3 cm lesion), lung cancer is curable by surgery&#xD;
      in 80% of patients. Nevertheless, there are many differential diagnoses and access to these&#xD;
      lesions is often difficult and risky. In this context, the management of pulmonary nodules,&#xD;
      which can be either benign lesions or beginners cancers, is a real challenge for&#xD;
      pulmonologists and thoracic oncologists every day: it is important not to disregard a&#xD;
      potentially operable nodule and avoiding offer patients invasive procedures for benign&#xD;
      nodules. Indeed, many procedures (endoscopy, puncture under scanner, thoracotomy) are made to&#xD;
      determine if suspicious nodules are benign or not. In the large National Lung Screening&#xD;
      Trial, 28% of the procedures were associated with complications (including 11% classified&#xD;
      severe and 16 deaths). It is therefore essential to develop non-invasive tools to refine&#xD;
      treatment decisions.&#xD;
