    <textblock>
      This project aims to explore how social media use, in particular food photography, influences&#xD;
      eating behaviours. It will be approached through three methods - a correlational experience&#xD;
      sampling method, an experimental experience sampling method, and an experimental laboratory&#xD;
      method. This registration describes the correlational experience sampling method.&#xD;

      This project aims to explore how social media use, in particular food photography, influences&#xD;
      eating behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question will be approached using a combination of methods. The first is the&#xD;
      experience sampling method, where data is gathered from participants as they are going about&#xD;
      their day-to-day lives. This method comprises two sub-sections - a correlational study, and&#xD;
      an experimental study. This registration describes the correlational experience sampling&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will measure participants' regular phone use and eating behaviours. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited via online platforms and participate in the study for one week. At the&#xD;
      beginning of the week, they will be required to fill in some online questionnaires (e.g.&#xD;
      demographic information). For the rest of the week, they will be prompted at specific time&#xD;
      points in the day via smartphone to answer some questions about their phone use and eating&#xD;
      behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome of the project is to collectively evaluate the data from the various&#xD;
      methods to conclude how social media use, and in particular the act of food photography,&#xD;
      influences the various aspects of eating behaviours.&#xD;
