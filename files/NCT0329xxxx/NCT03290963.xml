    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the antidepressant effect of lithium versus&#xD;
      placebo in adults receiving ketamine. Lithium is available commercially for depression;&#xD;
      ketamine is available commercially and can help the symptoms of depression; however, it has&#xD;
      not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this use. The FDA has&#xD;
      allowed the use of this drug in this research study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial in adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression. All&#xD;
      participants will receive three intravenous (IV) Ketamine (KET) infusions over 7 days. Before&#xD;
      receiving the first KET infusion, subjects will be randomized to 2 weeks of pre-KET treatment&#xD;
      with either Lithium or matching placebo. Pre-treatment medications will then be continued in&#xD;
      a double-blind manner during the acute phase administration of ketamine. Questionnaires will&#xD;
      be administered at baseline, prior to each KET infusion, and at 40, 100, and 120 minutes&#xD;
      after each infusion, and again at weekly intervals following the third (final) KET infusion&#xD;
      for 4 weeks, using standardized rating scales. Those who achieve positive response (&gt;50%&#xD;
      decrease in questionnaire total score from baseline) will be given 4 additional once-weekly&#xD;
      KET infusions (same dose and infusion rate).&#xD;
