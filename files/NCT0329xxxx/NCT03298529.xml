    <textblock>
      The glycemic index (GI) compares the plasma glucose response to a specific amount of&#xD;
      carbohydrates with the response induced by the same amount of carbohydrates from a standard&#xD;
      carbohydrate source, pure glucose in our case. The GI is defined as the incremental area&#xD;
      under the curve (iAUC) for blood glucose after consumption of a test food divided by the iAUC&#xD;
      of a reference food containing the same amount of carbohydrates. GI is based on the&#xD;
      physiologic functions of food carbohydrates rather than on their chemical structure, allowing&#xD;
      to a more accurate classification. Several studies found that the regular consumption of low&#xD;
      glycemic meals reduces the risk of developing diabetes, insulin-resistance, cardiovascular&#xD;
      and neoplastic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GI was originally developed for insulin-resistant subjects. The maintenance of stable blood&#xD;
      glucose levels is a challenge for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes and is also&#xD;
      beneficial for the general population, as reported by several studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-GI diets have been shown to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stabilize blood sugar levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  better control appetite&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve memory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce the risk of some forms of cancer According to Walter Willet, nutrition researcher&#xD;
           at the Harvard School of Public Health, an excess of sugars and refined starches&#xD;
           stimulates insulin hypersecretion, hunger pangs and frequent snacking, slowing down&#xD;
           lipid metabolism and making people physically less active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to evaluate the glycemic index of five different types of pasta with the&#xD;
      same format, named &quot;Fettuccine&quot;, but with different composition (the pasta format is related&#xD;
      to GI variations). The different types of pasta vary for flour and egg composition. However,&#xD;
      having the same format, the GI will change only in response to the percentage content of the&#xD;
      ingredients used to produce pasta. In particular, the aim is to measure egg's effect,&#xD;
      distinct in yolk and white, on the glycemic and insulin response of healthy subjects.&#xD;

      The five types of pasta to be tested are produced by the so called &quot;La Campofilone&quot; Company&#xD;
      (Ficiar√†, Campofilone, Marche), a national excellence in the production of traditional egg.&#xD;
      Every pasta is designed and realized with the scientific support of two consultants: Prof.&#xD;
      Paolo De Cristofaro, endocrinologist, diabetologist and professor at the School of&#xD;
      Specialization in Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Chieti, and Prof. Giampiero&#xD;
      Sacchetti, biotechnologist at the Marche Polytechnic University. Specifically, the products&#xD;
      to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Traditional Fettuccine, original recipe (8 eggs/kg flour) currently available on the&#xD;
           market;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pasta with only 8 egg whites/kg flour;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pasta with 4 eggs/kg flour;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hyperproteic pasta (with added gluten and albumin);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pasta with only 4 egg whites/kg flour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phase of the project will be implemented in accordance with the Jenkins and Wolever&#xD;
      protocol (World Health Organization-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United&#xD;
      Nations,1998). 12 healthy subjects, aged 18-65 years, will be recruited. After a 10 to&#xD;
      12-hour overnight fasting period, standard food (a glucose solution) and food test (the&#xD;
      different types of fettuccine La Campofilone) will be administered to volunteers, organized&#xD;
      into groups of two or three people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both test food administrations and standard food administrations will take place on a&#xD;
      different day. The standard food consists of 50 g of glucose dissolved in oligomineral water,&#xD;
      the test food consists of a portion of pasta containing 50 g of available carbohydrates.&#xD;
      Blood samples for determination of glycemia and insulinemia will be taken at time 0 and then&#xD;
      at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes from the beginning of the test or standard food intake.&#xD;
      Three glucose response curves will be performed on each subject (this allows to obtain an&#xD;
      average value of the subject's response to glucose over time) while a single test with the&#xD;
      food to be tested will be done. Blood samples will be analyzed at the Service of Medical&#xD;
      Laboratory Analysis of the Hospital &quot;S. De Bellis&quot;. Glucose and insulin values will be used&#xD;
      to calculate the glycemic and insulin index of each product. For each type of tested pasta, a&#xD;
      detailed report will be drawn up, complete with graphs of glycemic response for each subject.&#xD;
      Each report will include the glycemic and insulin index of the product under review.&#xD;
