  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HepQuant SHUNT test, which is provided as a HepQuant SHUNT Liver Diagnostic Kit, is a&#xD;
      minimally-invasive test of liver function and physiology which has been designated by the FDA&#xD;
      as an investigational drug/device combination product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into one of the 3 Gilead Selonsertib clinical trials (GS-US-416-2124,&#xD;
      GS-US-384-1943/1944) is required for enrollment into the HepQuant study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HepQuant study is to run parallel to the Gilead clinical trials,GS-US-416-2124 trial of&#xD;
      Alcoholic Hepatitis, GS-US-384-1943 trial of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) fibrosis&#xD;
      Stage 3 (STELLAR-3), and, GS-US-384-1944 trial of NASH and compensated cirrhosis (STELLAR-4).&#xD;
      The time points for the HepQuant SHUNT tests coincide with pre-specified time points within&#xD;
      the Gilead clinical trials. Subjects enrolled in GILEAD's STELLAR and Alcoholic hepatitis&#xD;
      trials may participate concurrently in this HepQuant sponsored investigational device study&#xD;
      at participating US sites only (IDEs as listed above) once approved by the applicable&#xD;
      IRB/IEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main eligibility criteria for enrollment into the HepQuant study is enrollment into one&#xD;
      of the three Gilead clinical trials listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HepQuant SHUNT Test is minimally-invasive and measures hepatocyte function and inflow to&#xD;
      the liver from the simultaneous clearances (hepatic filtration rates, HFRs) of cholate from&#xD;
      systemic and portal circulations. The Test quantifies portal-systemic shunting (SHUNT) and&#xD;
      generates a liver disease severity index (DSI). DSI is a score from 0 (no disease) to 50&#xD;
      (terminal illness) that is a composite of both HFRs and correlates with stage of fibrosis,&#xD;
      presence of varices, especially large varices, and risk for future clinical outcomes. DSI is&#xD;
      the primary output variable from the HepQuant SHUNT test. The HepQuant SHUNT test potentially&#xD;
      satisfies the unmet medical need for a minimally-invasive test of global liver function and&#xD;
      physiology&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects receive HepQuant SHUNT test and DSI measurement, but must first be enrolled into one of the three Gilead clinical trials listed above before they can be enrolled in the HepQuant study. Since the assigned intervention, the HepQuant SHUNT test, is the same for all participants in all three Gilead clinical trials, there is only one arm and intervention for the HepQuant study itself. Some analyses are conducted by grouping subjects into those who took the placebo in the parallel drug study versus those who were on active study drug in the parallel study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The baseline DSI, or disease severity index, is a measure of severity of liver disease at baseline. The scores for DSI range on a scale from 0 (healthy liver) to 50 (severe liver disease).</description>

    <description>Improvement or worsening of liver disease severity from baseline to the week 48 visit as measured by the change in the disease severity index (DSI) (DSI at 48 weeks minus DSI at baseline). The scores for DSI range on a scale from 0 (healthy liver) to 50 (severe liver disease).</description>

    <measure>Severity of Liver Disease Index (DSI) Scores Stratified by Baseline NASH CRN Stage of Fibrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Compared baseline disease severity index (DSI) scores, which are used to measure severity of liver disease on a scale from 0 (healthy liver) to 50 (severe liver disease), between subjects with F3 or F4 Fibrosis at baseline. Fibrosis stages were obtained clinically using the NASH CRN Scoring System to grade liver biopsy results. This scoring system yields scores ranging from F0 (no fibrosis/healthiest) to F4 (cirrhosis/severe disease). Subjects in this study either had F3 Fibrosis (bridging fibrosis) or F4 Fibrosis (cirrhosis), so F3 subjects have less severe disease than F4 subjects.</description>

&#xD;
        The key inclusion criteria for this HepQuant Parallel Study are the inclusion criteria into&#xD;
        one of the Gilead selonsertib trials (GS-US-416-2124, GS-US-384-1943 or 1944). Once that&#xD;
        has been met, subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;

             cerebral hemorrhage, sepsis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subject cannot have had extensive resection of large segments of small intestine&#xD;
             (short gut)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject cannot have severe gastroparesis&#xD;

        <title>Severity of Liver Disease Index (DSI) Scores Stratified by Baseline NASH CRN Stage of Fibrosis</title>
        <description>Compared baseline disease severity index (DSI) scores, which are used to measure severity of liver disease on a scale from 0 (healthy liver) to 50 (severe liver disease), between subjects with F3 or F4 Fibrosis at baseline. Fibrosis stages were obtained clinically using the NASH CRN Scoring System to grade liver biopsy results. This scoring system yields scores ranging from F0 (no fibrosis/healthiest) to F4 (cirrhosis/severe disease). Subjects in this study either had F3 Fibrosis (bridging fibrosis) or F4 Fibrosis (cirrhosis), so F3 subjects have less severe disease than F4 subjects.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was conducted to compare DSI scores between Fibrosis categories instead of by placebo vs active study drug groups because the subject numbers were too low. There was only one subject in the placebo group with F4 Fibrosis. Additionally, this outcome measure was established to compare DSI scores to other liver disease severity scores regardless of study drug use, so this analysis was conducted by grouping fibrosis scores.</population>
