  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative visual loss is a rare but serious complication after surgery. It is most&#xD;
      significantly correlated with prone spinal surgery with a prolonged duration. The cause and&#xD;
      risk factors are not elucidated, but the majority of the cases are due posterior ischaemic&#xD;
      optic neuropathy (PION). This entity is directly related to the ocular perfusion pressure&#xD;
      (OPP), which is estimated as the difference between mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP). Autoregulation is believed to maintain a constant perfusion to&#xD;
      the optic nerve despite fluctuations in the perfusion pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOP is known to increase in the prone position thus putting susceptible patients at risk for&#xD;
      inadequate ocular nerve perfusion. Most of the evidence comes from animal and healthy&#xD;
      volunteer studies and cannot give an accurate insight into the subtle changes of&#xD;
      intra-operative IOP. All the published studies employed the use of a tonometer, which may&#xD;
      have rooms for measurement errors due to inadvertent pressure on the globe while retracting&#xD;
      the eyelids, particularly when there is significant periorbital/conjunctival swelling in the&#xD;
      prone position. The majority of the studies recruited healthy volunteers in a simulated&#xD;
      surgical setting so other fluctuating parameters, which can affect intraoperative IOP, cannot&#xD;
      be measured. In the few reports where patients undergoing surgery in the prone position were&#xD;
      studies, IOP measurements were taken at non-continuous monitoring at time intervals, thus the&#xD;
      effects of changes in blood volume, MAP, central venous pressure (CVP) and PaCO 2 could not&#xD;
      be studied. Lastly, all the literature consists of case series only with no control group so&#xD;
      the effect of position cannot be evaluated independently of the other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to conduct a prospective study with continuous&#xD;
      intraoperative IOP monitoring to give us further insight into the physiological changes of&#xD;
      IOP in patients undergoing spine surgery, and identify the risk factors related to&#xD;
      fluctuations of IOP during prone spinal surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post-operative visual loss (POVL) is a rare but serious complication after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the known associations is prone spinal surgery with a prolonged duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause is not completely understood, but some of the risk factors for developing POVL&#xD;
      include anaemia, hypotension, the duration of surgery and patient factors such as age,&#xD;
      hypertension and atherosclerosis. There are also some unidentifiablerisk factors that may&#xD;
      predispose young healthy patients to POVL. Once the patient develops POVL, it is usually&#xD;
      irreversible, and the patient is left with a permanent disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of POVL cases that occur with prone spinal surgery are due to posterior&#xD;
      ischaemic optic neuropathy (PION). PION is directly related to the ocular perfusion pressure&#xD;
      (OPP), which is estimated as the difference between mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP). Autoregulation is believed to maintain a constant perfusion to&#xD;
      the optic nerve despite fluctuations in the perfusion pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a knowledge gap in the physiological changes of IOP during prone surgery.&#xD;
      IOP is a highly dynamic parameter, and the most widely used method to measure it is using a&#xD;
      handheld tonometer. The main limitation of this technique is the isolated nature of its&#xD;
      measurements, as it can only be taken at regular intervals, and may not reflect the full&#xD;
      range of IOP changes. Studies on IOP during prone position in the current literature have all&#xD;
      used this technique. 1-5 Hence subtle changes of IOP can be undetected, as interval&#xD;
      measurements cannot reflect short-term variations that occur within seconds or minutes.&#xD;
      Furthermore, most of the studies are performed on animals or healthy volunteers 5,6 , which&#xD;
      further limit the interpretation of their results. For the few studies performed on&#xD;
      anaesthetised patients undergoing spinal surgeries, the duration of surgery is short or&#xD;
      mixed, so the critical time point may not have been studied. The American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists Postoperative Visual Loss Registry suggests that an anaesthetic duration of&#xD;
      greater than 6 hours is more correlated with POVL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using state of the art technology Over the past five years, advances in technology have led&#xD;
      to the development of devices that allow 24 hour continuous IOP monitoring. The new system&#xD;
      makes use of microelectromechanical systems, nanotechnology, and telemetry to allow&#xD;
      continuous monitoring. A disposable contact lens sensor, first proposed by Leonardi et al. 8&#xD;
      , is now commercially available (SENSIMED Triggerfish; Sensimed AG, Lausanne, Switzerland).&#xD;
      This technology can acquire data points over a 24 hour period corresponding to 30 seconds of&#xD;
      continuous measurements. It measures changes in the ocular dimensions at the corneoscleral&#xD;
      junction, which corresponds to changes to IOP and volume. The microprocessor within the lens&#xD;
      transmits data to an external antenna, and the profiles can be stored in a portable recorder.&#xD;
      9 Although this sensor does not measure IOP directly, it gives measurements with a composite&#xD;
      of IOP and volume changes, and it is most valuable in documenting relative changes of&#xD;
      IOP-related events and their timing. It is also well tolerated in real life patients, and&#xD;
      have been used to document IOP changes in patients with glaucoma and thyroid eye disease.&#xD;
      9-11 This is the only non-invasive temporary continuous monitoring in the system that can be&#xD;
      used in human beings. This new technology is therefore ideal in detecting subtle changes in&#xD;
      IOP pattern in prone spinal surgery. It will provide a continuous monitoring which can be&#xD;
      correlated with the patient's level of anaesthesia, arterial pressure fluctuations and volume&#xD;
      status, and can contribute to improved understanding of IOP changes during prone spinal&#xD;
      surgery, which may in turn bridge the knowledge gap of the causes of POVL.&#xD;
