  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Positive Health Check (PHC), an online&#xD;
      intervention that delivers tailored, evidence-based prevention messages to HIV positive&#xD;
      patients, on improving clinical outcomes and retention in care of people who are HIV positive&#xD;
      and have unsuppressed viral loads. The costs and processes of implementation will also be&#xD;
      assessed to inform future dissemination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PHC Evaluation Trial uses a randomized trial to test if a brief web-based counseling&#xD;
      intervention can improve clinical outcomes among people living with HIV. The study will also&#xD;
      assess implementation processes, collect data to determine cost effectiveness, and document&#xD;
      the standard of care in each clinic. The study will take place in four locations including&#xD;
      Atlanta VA Medical Center (Atlanta, GA), Hillsborough County Health Department (Tampa, FL),&#xD;
      Rutgers Infectious Disease Practice (Newark, NJ) and Crescent Care (New Orleans, LA). The&#xD;
      objectives of the PHC Evaluation Trial are four-fold: Objective 1) Implement a randomized&#xD;
      trial to test if the PHC intervention improves clinical health outcomes, specifically viral&#xD;
      load suppression and retention in care. While PHC is designed to improve antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) initiation, ART adherence and retention in care as well as reduce unprotected&#xD;
      sex and promote safe injection practices, the primary outcome on which the trial is powered&#xD;
      is viral suppression; Objective 2) Conduct an implementation evaluation to determine&#xD;
      effective implementation strategies and integration of PHC into HIV primary care clinics;&#xD;
      Objective 3) Collect and document data on the cost of the PHC intervention implementation;&#xD;
      Objective 4) Document the standard of care at each participating site. PHC is a web-based&#xD;
      intervention that delivers tailored evidence-based prevention messages to HIV positive&#xD;
      patients through a series of brief interactive videos designed to simulate a conversation&#xD;
      with an HIV primary care provider. Web-based interventions have been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      improving adherence and reducing sexual risk. Eligible patients, who use the intervention,&#xD;
      are given a tablet with a privacy screen, a set of headphones, a unique login ID and will be&#xD;
      prompted to create their own private password. Once logged in, the intervention guides a&#xD;
      patient through tailored messaging from a video doctor on patient-selected topics including&#xD;
      treatment initiation or adherence, retention in care, sexual risk reduction, pregnancy, and&#xD;
      intravenous drug use. Throughout the intervention patients answer tailoring questions about&#xD;
      themselves and based on their answers, are given tailored messages from their chosen video&#xD;
      doctor. PHC is designed to facilitate patient-provider communication on these topics. In the&#xD;
      intervention, patients can select which questions they have for their doctor on the topics&#xD;
      covered and which health promotion strategies they want to practice before their next visit.&#xD;
      The questions and chosen health promotion strategies (&quot;tips&quot;) automatically populate to a&#xD;
      handout which is given to the patient after logging off. Patients also have access to another&#xD;
      module that provides other information about HIV management, how to prevent transmission, and&#xD;
      living a healthy lifestyle while being HIV positive. The intervention will be considered&#xD;
      implemented with fidelity if a patient completes the intervention in the clinic before or&#xD;
      after seeing their primary care provider, or before or after a blood draw or ancillary&#xD;
      appointment in advance of their appointment with their clinical provider. A patient may also&#xD;
      begin the intervention in the clinic and complete it after the appointment or at home within&#xD;
      21 days. Evaluation of the intervention will include comparisons of the intervention and&#xD;
      control arms on the primary outcome using data abstracted via electronic medical records,&#xD;
      with the 12- month viral load value considered the primary outcome measure.&#xD;

    <description>While PHC is designed to improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, ART adherence and retention in care as well as increasing safer sex and safe injection practices, the primary outcome on which the trial is powered is viral suppression. The viral load (VL (log10)) laboratory results at baseline and all VL values available thereafter until the end of the project will be part of the analysis with the 12 month VL reading being the primary outcome.</description>
