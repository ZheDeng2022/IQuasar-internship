    <textblock>
      This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and Natural&#xD;
      Killer T cells (NKT). Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious&#xD;
      diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special white blood&#xD;
      cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. Investigators have&#xD;
      found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them&#xD;
      recognize cancer cells and kill them. In a previous clinical trial, investigators made&#xD;
      artificial genes called a chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), from an antibody called 14g2a&#xD;
      that recognizes GD2, a molecule found on almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR).&#xD;
      Investigators put these genes into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to patients&#xD;
      that had neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NKT cells are another special subgroup of white blood cells that can specifically go into&#xD;
      tumor tissue of neuroblastoma. Inside the tumor, there are other white blood cells called&#xD;
      macrophages which help the cancer cells to grow and recover from injury. NKT cells can&#xD;
      specifically kill these macrophages and slow the tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will expand NKT cells and add GD2-specific chimeric antigen receptors to the cells. We&#xD;
      think these cells might be better able to attack NB since they also work by destroying the&#xD;
      macrophages that allows the tumor to grow. The chimeric antigen receptor will also contain a&#xD;
      gene segment to make the NKT cells last longer. This gene segment is called CD28. In&#xD;
      addition, to further improve the antitumor activity of the GINAKIT cells we added another&#xD;
      gene expressing a molecule called Interleukin -15 (IL-15). The combination of these 3&#xD;
      components showed the most antitumor activity by CAR expressing NKT cells and improved these&#xD;
      cells' survival in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GD2-CAR expressing NKTs have not been tested in patients so far. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to find the largest effective and safe dose of GD2-CAR NKT cells (GINAKIT cells), to evaluate&#xD;
      their effect on the tumor and how long they can be detected in the patient's blood and what&#xD;
      affect they have on the patient's neuroblastoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the first step is to collect blood from the patient to make the GINAKIT cells.&#xD;
      Once the GINAKIT cells are made they will be administered to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started&#xD;
      on the lowest dose (1 of 4 different levels) of GINAKIT cells. Once that dose schedule proves&#xD;
      safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue&#xD;
      until all 4 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be&#xD;
      lowered or the infusions will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before getting the GINAKIT cells, the patient will receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine&#xD;
      intravenously (through a needle inserted into a vein or the patient's port-a-cath) for 2 days&#xD;
      and then fludarabine alone for one more day. The patient will then have one day of rest with&#xD;
      no chemotherapy before receiving the GINAKIT cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an injection of GINAKIT cells into the vein through an IV line at&#xD;
      the assigned dose. Before the patient receives the injection, they may be given a dose of&#xD;
      Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (acetaminophen). The injection will take up to 10&#xD;
      minutes. The patient will be monitored in the clinic after the injection for about 4 hours.&#xD;
      The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will need to stay in Houston for 4 weeks after the infusion so investigators can&#xD;
      monitor the patient for side effects. The patient will have follow-up visits (at weeks 1, 2,&#xD;
      3, 4 and 8; months 3, 6, 9, and 12; twice a year for 4 years and then once a year for the&#xD;
      next 10 years - for a total of 15 years) and scheduled disease evaluations after the GINAKIT&#xD;
      cell infusion (at week 6 and then as clinically needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of your tumor by routine imaging studies and bone marrow evaluation within&#xD;
           4 weeks (preferably 2 weeks) before treatment study entry (no other cancer treatment&#xD;
           should be given after these studies and the GINAKIT cell infusion). Imaging studies that&#xD;
           have been used in the past to best assess your tumor will be used (Computer Tomogram&#xD;
           (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT),&#xD;
           and/or MIBG scan). A PET scan is an imaging test that uses radioactive material to look&#xD;
           for disease in the body. A MIBG scan is an imaging test that uses radioactive material&#xD;
           and a special scanner to find or confirm the presence of neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and&#xD;
      afterwards as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells counts, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the patient's tumor by routine imaging studies 4-6 weeks after the&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy at 2 weeks and between 4-6 weeks after the infusion and as clinically&#xD;
           indicated thereafter. The evaluation at week 2 after the infusion is for research only&#xD;
           and is done to see whether or not there are GINAKIT cells in the tumor. For all&#xD;
           clinically indicated tumor biopsies a portion of the sample for research will be&#xD;
           requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a tumor was in the bone marrow at the time of treatment, the procedure will be&#xD;
           repeated at 2 weeks and between 4-6 weeks after the infusion and as clinically indicated&#xD;
           thereafter. The evaluation at week 2 after the infusion is for research only and is done&#xD;
           to see whether or not there are GINAKIT cells in the bone marrow. For all clinically&#xD;
           indicated bone marrow collections a portion of the sample for research will be&#xD;
           requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the GINAKIT cells are working and how long they last in the body,&#xD;
      an extra amount of blood will be obtained before the chemotherapy, on the day of the GINAKIT&#xD;
      cell infusion (before and at the end of the infusion), 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      GINAKIT cell infusion, every 3 months for the 1st year, every 6 months for the next 4 years&#xD;
      and then once a year for the next 10 years (for a total of 15 years). The amount of blood&#xD;
      taken will be based on the patient's weight with up to a maximum of 60 ml (12 teaspoons) of&#xD;
      blood to be obtained at any one time. For children, the total amount of blood drawn will not&#xD;
      be more than 3 ml (less than 1 teaspoon) per 1 kg of body weight on any given day. This&#xD;
      volume is considered safe, but may be decreased if the patient is anemic (have a low red&#xD;
      blood cell count).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the GINAKIT cells are found in the patient's blood at&#xD;
      a certain amount, an extra 5ml of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a procedure where tumor samples are obtained, investigators will request a&#xD;
      sample to be used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient develops a second abnormal growth, significant blood or nervous system&#xD;
      disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested (if a sample can be&#xD;
      obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic toxicities, including blood&#xD;
      components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the patient will receive cells with a new gene in them they will be followed for a&#xD;
      total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
