      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and blood kinetics of&#xD;
      autologous T cells genetically modified to express CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor and PD-1&#xD;
      knockout engineered T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      Lymphoma and Leukaemia.&#xD;

      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced&#xD;
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) and PD-1&#xD;
      knock out engineered T-cells (CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells) in children and&#xD;
      adults (age &lt;70 years) with high risk, relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies (Acute&#xD;
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration&#xD;
      to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the&#xD;
      CD19 CAR T-cells. Patients will receive the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells&#xD;
      following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      duration of response of the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells in children with&#xD;
      high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.&#xD;
