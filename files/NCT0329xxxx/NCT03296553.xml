  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kaposi sarcoma (KS) has an unpredictable course, patients with severe KS and low CD4 counts&#xD;
      (&lt;100 cells) can develop Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (IRIS) after the initiation of&#xD;
      combined Antiretroviral Therapy (cART). The objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of IRIS and its attributable mortality in patients with HIV and severe KS with the&#xD;
      use of Ganciclovir or the prodrug Valganciclovir prior to the initiation of cART compared&#xD;
      with the standard management of immediate cART initiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disease associated with infection by the Human&#xD;
      Immune Deficiency virus (HIV), mediated by cytokines, in which the presence of Human&#xD;
      Herpes-Virus 8 (HHV-8) and immunosuppression are essential for the disease process. It has an&#xD;
      unpredictable course and can be indolent or can entertain a progressive and fulminant disease&#xD;
      course. Patients with severe KS can have pulmonary involvement and/or disseminated cutaneous&#xD;
      disease and/or lymphadenopathic involvement, generally associated with low CD4 counts (&lt;100&#xD;
      cells); this patients are at risk of Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (IRIS) after the&#xD;
      initiation of cART aggravating the clinical status of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganciclovir and Foscarnet (antivirals) are active in vitro against HHV-8. Our work group&#xD;
      documented, in a retrospective study with patients treated with Ganciclovir for the&#xD;
      management of organ-end infection due to Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the era pre-cART that they&#xD;
      developed complete remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with infections such as meningeal tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or&#xD;
      CMV-related chorioretinitis, and low CD4 are at a greater risk of developing Immune&#xD;
      Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), and, as a consequence of IRIS, of developing&#xD;
      severe complications that cause death or irreversible sequel. In these cases, it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that treating the opportunistic infection and delay 4 weeks the initiation of&#xD;
      cART; usually avoids these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the presence of IRIS and it attributable mortality in patients with HIV and&#xD;
      severe KS (pulmonary and/or disseminated, and/or lymphadenopathic, and/or generalized&#xD;
      lymphedema, and/or intestinal tract compromise) with the use of Ganciclovir or the prodrug&#xD;
      Valganciclovir prior to the initiation of cART compared with the standard management of&#xD;
      immediate cART initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of Ganciclovir and the suppression of HHV-8 replication prior to&#xD;
      administration of cART, with or without chemotherapy in patients with Acquired&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and disseminated KS will diminish the frequency of IRIS and&#xD;
      will exert an impact on diminishing mortality attributable to KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open randomized clinical assay. Will include patients with AIDS and disseminated KS who&#xD;
      accept to participate and who sign the letter of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A disseminated case of KS is considered when it presents one or more of the following&#xD;
      involvements: pulmonary compromise, and/or disseminated cutaneous KS, and/or lymphadenopathic&#xD;
      and/or generalized lymphedema, and digestive tract compromise documented in at least two&#xD;
      segments (oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, large intestine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are patients who present another synchronic neoplasm, those receiving&#xD;
      corticosteroids, those with replicative co-infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C and&#xD;
      patients with an APACHE score ≥ 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1 (randomized): Patients with HIV and disseminated KS, who will receive treatment&#xD;
           with Ganciclovir during 4 weeks prior to initiation of cART and/or until suppression of&#xD;
           HHV-8 or 12 weeks (whichever comes first).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2 (randomized): Patients with HIV and disseminated KS, who initiate standard&#xD;
           treatment with cART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated for a study power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05. Event rate in the&#xD;
      control group was 40%, while that in the treated group was 5%. The number of patients in each&#xD;
      group will be 19 for as total sample of 38 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antiretroviral scheme will be assigned according to the criteria of the &quot;The&#xD;
      Antiretroviral Management Guide of Persons with HIV&quot; in effect in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline clinical evaluation will be carried out to define the extension of KS (on skin, at&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal level by means of upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy), at&#xD;
      the pulmonary and lymphatic levels (Computerized tomography scan [CT] of the thorax and&#xD;
      abdomen. In case of suspicion of pulmonary compromise a Gallium 67 Spect-CT Scan will be&#xD;
      performed, in the case of suspicion of lymphadenopathic compromise; lymph node biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed. Investigation will be conducted to document or rule out other active infections&#xD;
      and treatment will be given if necessary including bone marrow culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRIS criteria: Patients with 2 weeks of cART initiation according to their presenting one&#xD;
      laboratory criterion and two laboratory criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduction of at least 1 log10 of HIV-1 in viral load levels and an increase of ≥50&#xD;
      cells/mm3 or an increase of at least ≥2 times in the baseline levels of the CD4+ cell count&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbation of KS by at least two of the following clinical criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increase in size of KS lesions Increase in number of KS lesions Appearance or exacerbation of&#xD;
      lymphedema Appearance or increase of otherwise inexplicable pulmonary opacities in the&#xD;
      thoracic x-ray or Computerized tomography (CT) of the thorax with negative Gallium-67&#xD;
      Spect-scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of the evolution of KS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete Response (CR) when all of the KS lesions disappear Partial Response (PR) when there&#xD;
      was a diminution of &gt;50% in number and/or size of original lesions without the appearance of&#xD;
      new lesions Stable Disease (SD) was when there was a reduction of &lt;50% of lesions and new&#xD;
      lesions have not appeared Disease Progression (DP) when an increase is documented of the&#xD;
      number and size of the KS lesions during follow-up periods Relapse when new lesions appeared&#xD;
      in patients with CR or documented CR in previous evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten ml. will be obtained of anticoagulated peripheral blood with EDTA. This routine procedure&#xD;
      will be carried out by the Attending Physician of the patients and by a qualified&#xD;
      Phlebotomist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 weeks, inflammation markers will be&#xD;
      measured related with the response of the cytosines, known in KS, such as the following: C&#xD;
      reactive protein; D-dimer; IL-6; Il-10, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Gamma Interferon&#xD;
      (IFNγ). Serum and plasma will be obtained for the HIV viral load, the HHV-8 viral load, and a&#xD;
      complete blood count will be performed, as well as the CD4 lymphocyte count, and liver&#xD;
      function and blood chemistry tests. From the plasma samples, the absolute amount of each&#xD;
      analyte will be quantified, and we will analyze the Luminex methodology (Bio-Rad). The plasma&#xD;
      will be incubated with monoclonal antibody-coated spheres directed against each analyte and&#xD;
      to a specific fluorochrome, and fluorescence will be read in Bio-Plex 2000 equipment&#xD;
      (Bio-Rad). Absolute readings will be obtained in μg/mL for each analyte.&#xD;
