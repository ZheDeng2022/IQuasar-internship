  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common and the most aggressive primary brain cancer in adults.&#xD;
      Indeed, despite very intensive treatments (i.e. maximal safe surgery, radiotherapy and&#xD;
      several lines of cytotoxic chemotherapies), inducing significant adverse events, the&#xD;
      prognosis of glioblastoma patients remains dismal with a median overall survival of ~15&#xD;
      months. Therefore, more efficient and less toxic therapies are urgently needed to improve&#xD;
      survival and quality of life of glioblastoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oncolytic virus TG6002 has shown efficacy and good safety profile in several preclinical&#xD;
      models of glioblastoma in vitro (i.e. cell line) and in vivo (i.e. xenografts in Swiss/Nude&#xD;
      mice). Comprehensive toxicology studies of TG6002/Flucytosine have been completed in rabbits&#xD;
      and monkeys supporting safety investigations of TG6002/Flucytosine in human patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken these data all together, TG6002/Flucytosine appears as a very promising therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy in glioblastoma patients that merits consideration for early phase clinical trial.&#xD;

      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial using an accelerated titration 3+3&#xD;
      design in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Eligible patients will first be consecutively&#xD;
      enrolled in a one-patient cohort at lowest dose level and then in 3-patients cohorts up to a&#xD;
      DLT observation. In case a DLT is observed specific rules apply to enrol additional (from 3&#xD;
      to 5) patients in the same cohort and to proceed to higher doses. All patients within a given&#xD;
      cohort will be treated with the same dose schedule of TG6002, administered as 3 weekly IV&#xD;
      infusions at Days 1, 8, and 15. Following the 1st and 2nd infusion of TG6002 on Day 1 and 8,&#xD;
      patients will be given oral 5-FC for 3 days starting on Day 5 and 12 and ending on Day 7 and&#xD;
      14, respectively. Following the 3rd infusion of TG6002 on Day 15, patients will be given oral&#xD;
      5-FC for 21 days starting on Day 19 and ending on Day 39 (end of treatment). Patients will be&#xD;
      followed until documented tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose of 1 x 105 pfu is determined after toxicology results in the most sensitive&#xD;
      species on which a security factor (100x) has been applied; accelerated titration will&#xD;
      consist in one patient being administered with the starting dose and one-log dose increment&#xD;
      between the three first cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest TG6002 dose level at which at most&#xD;
      1 Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is observed in 6 patients exposed to that dose level.. The DLT&#xD;
      period is defined as the interval between the first TG6002 IV infusion (Day 1) and the 8th&#xD;
      day of the 21-day 5-FC treatment occurring on Day 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between consecutive cohorts during dose escalation, an at least 3-week safety interval will&#xD;
      be applied, starting from the completion of the DLT period of the last patient of the&#xD;
      previous cohort (D26), before the infusion of the first patient of the next higher dose&#xD;
      cohort (D47). The initiation of the next higher dose cohort will be determined following an&#xD;
      analysis by the DSMB of the safety results from one cycle of TG6002 treatment in combination&#xD;
      with 5-FC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2a:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the outcome of the Phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts, i.e. RP2D, the Phase 2a will&#xD;
      include 24 patients. Patients will be treated IV at the RP2D.&#xD;
