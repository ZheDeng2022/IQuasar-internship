      CVJ anomalies affecting skeleton might lead to the pressure on the neuraxis, and disturbance&#xD;
      of the cerebrospinal fluid circulation and blood supply. The patients undergoing surgeries on&#xD;
      CVJ might develop airway complications in immediate postoperative period warranting urgent&#xD;
      reintubation or emergency tracheostomy. Reintubation is usually difficult in immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period due the fixation of cervical spine and gross upper airway oedema due to&#xD;
      prolonged surgery in prone position. This will be the first prospective observational study&#xD;
      to find out the risk factors related to patient, anaesthesia, radiological findings and&#xD;
      surgical procedure to predict extubation failure in patients undergoing CVJ surgeries.&#xD;

      Research Query We conducted a pilot study and found that the incidence of reintubation is&#xD;
      20%. Reintubation poses a clinical, psychological and financial burden on the patients.&#xD;
      Consequently, our study aims to identify the various risk factors to predict the need for&#xD;
      reintubation and postoperative mechanical ventilation so that success of extubation can be&#xD;
      anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The craniovertebral junction (CVJ) includes the basiocciput, atlas, axis and various&#xD;
      supporting ligaments. The contents enclosed in CVJ include Medulla, cervical spinal cord&#xD;
      (cervico-medullary junction), spinal arteries, and lower cranial and cervical nerves1. CVJ&#xD;
      anomalies affecting skeleton might lead to the pressure on the neuraxis and disturbance of&#xD;
      the cerebrospinal fluid circulation and blood supply. The clinical manifestations of CVJ&#xD;
      abnormalities include weakness of both upper and lower limbs, respiratory dysfunction due to&#xD;
      compression of the respiratory centres in brainstem and weakness of respiratory muscles&#xD;
      including diaphragm2. The patients undergoing surgeries on CVJ might develop airway&#xD;
      complications in immediate postoperative period warranting urgent reintubation or emergency&#xD;
      tracheostomy3. Reintubation is usually difficult in immediate postoperative period in the&#xD;
      view of fixation of cervical spine and gross upper airway oedema due to prolonged surgery in&#xD;
      prone position4,5. To avoid such airway emergencies few centres favour to delay the&#xD;
      extubation. The patients with weak respiratory muscles and poor respiratory reserve tend to&#xD;
      develop major pulmonary complications and become ventilator dependant so, we always plan an&#xD;
      early weaning and extubation6-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epstein et al10 reported that the potential risk factors associated with postoperative&#xD;
      emergency airway management following cervical spine surgery included; obesity (&gt;220 ponds),&#xD;
      surgery duration greater than 10 hours, anterior corpectomy with fusion of second cervical&#xD;
      vertebra, greater than 4 units of transfused blood, asthma, advanced age (&gt;65 years), a&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid fistula, extent surgery, and severe preoperative neurologic deficit.&#xD;
      These risk factors are generalised for all cervical surgeries. CVJ is an important area where&#xD;
      most of the vital centres present in medulla are at risk of injuries that leads to central&#xD;
      respiratory depression and even sudden death. These patients can have airway and respiratory&#xD;
      compromise even in the absence of the risk factors described by Epstein et al10. Hence, we&#xD;
      plan to conduct this study to identify the risk factors leading to extubation failure in&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgeries for CVJ anomalies, so that, early or delayed extubation can be&#xD;
      planned before the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOVELTY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first prospective observational study to find out the risk factors related&#xD;
      to patient, anaesthesia, radiological findings and surgical procedure to predict extubation&#xD;
      failure in patients undergoing CVJ surgeries. This will help in planning and predicting&#xD;
      postsurgical extubation and psychological preparation of the patients who will need&#xD;
      postoperative mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of Research Proposal to Public Health and in Given Area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both extubation failure and ventilatory dependence are the common problems and contribute&#xD;
      significantly to the mortality and morbidities in the patients with CVJ surgeries. Till date&#xD;
      we do not have specific parameters to predict the risk of extubation failure resulting in&#xD;
      life threatening emergency situation during extubation of these patients. With this research,&#xD;
      we might find certain risk factor that can clearly predict extubation failure and patients&#xD;
      with those risk factors can be electively ventilated or tracheostomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of Literature The CVJ anomalies might lead to the compression on the vital neural&#xD;
      structures and disturbance in cerebrospinal fluid circulation and blood supply1. These&#xD;
      patients manifest with the weakness of both upper and lower limbs, respiratory muscles&#xD;
      weakness or central suppression of ventilation2. These surgeries on CVJ might lead to airway&#xD;
      complications in immediate postoperative period warranting urgent reintubation or emergency&#xD;
      tracheostomy3. Reintubation is usually difficult in immediate postoperative period in the&#xD;
      view of fixation of cervical spine and gross upper airway oedema due to prolonged surgery in&#xD;
      prone position4,5. To avoid such airway emergencies few centres favour to delay the&#xD;
      extubation. The patients with weak respiratory muscles and poor respiratory reserve tend to&#xD;
      develop major pulmonary complications and become ventilator dependant so, we always plan an&#xD;
      early weaning and extubation6-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National data on the CVJ surgeries Marda et al10 hypothesize that the respiratory system is&#xD;
      compromised and sub-clinical manifestations may get aggravated postoperatively due to the&#xD;
      anesthetic or surgical reasons. They evaluated the incidence of postoperative pulmonary&#xD;
      complications (PPCs) and associated risk factors in patients undergoing combined procedure&#xD;
      for transoral odontoidectomy (TOO) and posterior fixation (PF). The authors concluded that&#xD;
      the patients with CVJ anomaly are at increased risk of developing PPCs and there is a strong&#xD;
      association between intraoperative blood transfusion and PPCs. They also found that the&#xD;
      patients PPCs had a longer ICU and hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study, Marda et al11 compared the early and late extubation following transoral&#xD;
      odontoidectomy and posterior fixation. They concluded that ventilation and oxygenation was&#xD;
      comparable between the groups but the duration of ICU and hospital stay was prolonged in the&#xD;
      delayed extubation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reddy et al12 evaluated the pulmonary function after surgery for congenital atlantoaxial&#xD;
      dislocation and compared with compressive myelopathy and cerebellar surgeries. The authors&#xD;
      concluded that a significant deterioration of pulmonary function that persists till one week&#xD;
      after surgery for congenital AAD and this deterioration was significantly higher than that&#xD;
      seen after surgeries for compressive myelopathies and cerebellar lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Data on the CVJ surgeries Epstein et al13 reported that the potential risk&#xD;
      factors associated with postoperative emergency airway management following cervical spine&#xD;
      surgery included; obesity (&gt;220 ponds), surgery duration greater than 10 hours, anterior&#xD;
      corpectomy with fusion of second cervical vertebra, greater than 4 units of transfused blood,&#xD;
      asthma, advanced age (&gt;65 years), a cerebrospinal fluid fistula, extent surgery, and severe&#xD;
      preoperative neurologic deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These risk factors are generalised for all cervical surgeries. CVJ is an important area where&#xD;
      most of the vital centres present in medulla are at risk of injuries that leads to central&#xD;
      respiratory depression and even sudden death. These patients can have airway and respiratory&#xD;
      compromise even in the absence of the risk factors described by Epstein et al13. Hence, we&#xD;
      plan to conduct this study to identify the risk factors leading to extubation failure in&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgeries for CVJ anomalies, so that, early or delayed extubation can be&#xD;
      planned before the end of surgery.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the predictors of extubation failure in patients undergoing surgeries for CVJ&#xD;
      anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the association of various predictors with&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of ICU stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of Hospital Stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work: We have done 10 pilot cases that shows reintubation rate of 20%. Rest of&#xD;
      the data is yet to be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design/Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Prospective Observational study will be commenced after taking approval from&#xD;
      Institutional Ethics committee and patients consent. A total of hundred patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CVJ Anomalies posted for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients requiring preoperative intubation and ventilator support&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Severe cardiac and pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Morbid obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Obstructive sleep apnoea&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Clinically significant scoliosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Severe neurological disability The &quot;Extubation Failure&quot; will be defined as&#xD;
                inability to extubate within 24 hours or reintubation within 24 hours. Early&#xD;
                extubation failure will be reintubation within 6 hours postoperatively and late&#xD;
                extubation failure will be after 6 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for reintubation will include desaturation (PaO2 &lt;60), hypoventilation (PaCO2&#xD;
      &gt;50), tachypnea (RR &gt;35/min), impending respiratory failure, stridor and retention of&#xD;
      secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides routine preoperative investigations respiratory reserve will be evaluated by room air&#xD;
      Arterial Blood Gas analysis, Pulmonary function tests, Chest expansion and Breath holding&#xD;
      time. These parameters will be repeated after 3 months on follow up. Neurological status will&#xD;
      be assessed by using Benzel's modification of Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring system&#xD;
      (mJOA score) 11 (Annexure-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard fasting protocol will be followed. Anaesthesia and intubation techniques and&#xD;
      monitoring will be as per attending anaesthesiologist's discretion but records of these&#xD;
      techniques will be kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following intraoperative clinical parameters will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic instability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount and type of intravenous fluids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and blood products transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative complications such as vascular injuries/Dural tear Radiological&#xD;
           abnormalities and dislocation axis will be noted. At the end of surgery patient will be&#xD;
           reversed and assessed for possibility of extubation. Postoperative status will be&#xD;
           evaluated. Patient will be followed up till discharge for any cardio-pulmonary events&#xD;
           and three months later for assessment of pulmonary reserve.&#xD;
