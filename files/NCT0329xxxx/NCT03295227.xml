  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to confirm the highest tolerable dose&#xD;
      of pembrolizumab that can be given to patients with unresectable thymoma or thymic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Part 2 of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab given at the&#xD;
      dose that was found in Part 1 of the study can help to control thymoma or thymic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the study drug will be studied in both parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for treatment of many types of cancers. It is considered investigational to use pembrolizumab&#xD;
      to treat thymoma or thymic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can describe how pembrolizumab is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part in MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of&#xD;
      the study, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of every Cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may take the study drug for up to 2 years. You will no longer be able to take the study&#xD;
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after the follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each Cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Cycle 1, this blood&#xD;
           sample will also be used for antibody testing. Antibodies are created by the immune&#xD;
           system and may attack foreign cells or substances, such as the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks, you will have an MRI and/or CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Dosing Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop receiving the study drug, and then again 30 days after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it has been more than 8 weeks since your last scan, you may have an MRI and/or CT&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you stopped receiving the study drug for reasons other than the disease getting worse, you&#xD;
      will continue to have MRI and/or CT scans every 6 weeks. After 1 year, this will be reduced&#xD;
      to every 9 weeks. These scans will continue unless the disease gets worse or you start a new&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be called every 3 months for up to 3 years and asked about any cancer treatments you&#xD;
      may be receiving. This phone call should take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your medical record will also be reviewed every 8 weeks to check for changes in your health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger after&#xD;
      you stop study treatment, you may still be able to receive the study drug if you and your&#xD;
      doctor decide it is in your best interest. Sometimes the disease appears to get worse but the&#xD;
      study drug is actually working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug because the disease may&#xD;
      actually be getting worse. You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug. This&#xD;
      could also delay starting other treatments. The disease may get worse to the point that you&#xD;
      are no longer able to receive other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to receive the study drug after the disease gets worse, you will continue to&#xD;
      have study visits as described above. The study doctor will discuss this option with you.&#xD;
