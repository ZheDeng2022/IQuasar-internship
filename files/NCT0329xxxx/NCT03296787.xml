    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of varying degrees of renal function on&#xD;
      the PK of TAK-954 following single-dose IV administration and to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      hemodialysis on the PK of single IV doses of TAK-954.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. This study will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      varying degrees of renal function on the PK of TAK-954 following single-dose IV&#xD;
      administration and to investigate the impact of hemodialysis on the PK of single IV doses of&#xD;
      TAK-954.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately up to 40 participants. Participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      one of the 5 treatment groups based on their renal impairment which will be determined based&#xD;
      on Cockcroft and Gault (CG) equation as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A TAK-954 0.2 mg: Healthy Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B TAK-954 0.2 mg: Mild Renal Impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C TAK-954 0.2 mg: Moderate Renal Impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D TAK-954 0.2 mg: Severe Renal Impairment or End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD)&#xD;
           Without Hemodialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group E TAK-954 0.2 mg: End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) With Hemodialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in groups A to D will receive a single dose of TAK-954 and two single doses&#xD;
      in Group E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment in Group B (Mild) and Group E (ESRD requiring dialysis) will be based on&#xD;
      assessment of safety and available PK data from Group C and Group D respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Czech Republic and Hungary. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 8 weeks. Participants in Groups A to D will remain&#xD;
      confined to clinic for 3 days. For both treatments, participants in Group E requiring&#xD;
      dialysis will remain confined to clinic for 3 days. All participants will make a final visit&#xD;
      to the clinic 10-14 days after receiving their last dose for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
