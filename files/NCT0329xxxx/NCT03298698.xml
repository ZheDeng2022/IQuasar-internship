      This will be an open-label, randomized controlled trial which compares continued treatment&#xD;
      with high dose prednisone (standard therapy) to treatment with rituximab in patients with&#xD;
      minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis unresponsive to 8 weeks of high&#xD;
      dose prednisone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients either receive 2 doses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv at time 0 and 14 days with&#xD;
      termination of prednisone or standard therapy which consist of 8 additional weeks of high&#xD;
      dose prednisone treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are important&#xD;
      causes of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. First-line treatment with high dose prednisone up to&#xD;
      16 weeks is associated with serious side effects. Especially if treatment continues for more&#xD;
      than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies suggested that Rituximab may be more effective in patients unresponsive&#xD;
      to 8 weeks of high dose prednisone. Treatment with rituximab was associated with a higher&#xD;
      proportion of patients attaining remission of proteinuria and with fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open-label, randomized controlled trial which compares continued treatment&#xD;
      with high dose prednisone (standard therapy) to treatment with rituximab in patients with an&#xD;
      idiopathic nephrotic syndrome due to biopsy proven MCD or FSGS age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with high dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can be included in the trial in case of persistent persistent proteinuria ≥ 2 g/ 24&#xD;
      hours or a protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 2 g/10mmol (2 g/g) after 8 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      high dose prednisone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients either receive 2 doses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv at time 0 and 14 days with&#xD;
      termination of prednisone or standard therapy which consist of 8 additional weeks of high&#xD;
      dose prednisone treatment. In the Rituximab group, B-cells will be monitored weekly, and if&#xD;
      no complete depletion is achieved, additional dose(s) of Rituximab will be given at a weekly&#xD;
      interval (maximum of 2 additional doses) until complete B cell depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected duration of the follow-up is 12 months, consisting of 9 visits.&#xD;
