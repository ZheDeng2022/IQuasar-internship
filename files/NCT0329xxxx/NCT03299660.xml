  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is investigating the inclusion of avelumab post long-course chemo-radiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with resectable locally advanced rectal cancer. It is hypothesised that this may&#xD;
      enhance the pathological and imaging response rates whilst potentially reducing the relapse&#xD;
      rates. Participants will receive standard long course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT) treatment&#xD;
      with radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil (5 FU)/Capecitabine for 6 weeks, this then followed by 4&#xD;
      cycles of Avelumab and then surgical resection. The trial will measure disease response just&#xD;
      prior to surgery and participants will be followed up for a minimum of 18 months (from study&#xD;
      entry) and up to 42 months.&#xD;
