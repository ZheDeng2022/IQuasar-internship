    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based response rate. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest). The SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Two lesions increasing from 2 mm to 3 mm, for example, does not qualify). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
