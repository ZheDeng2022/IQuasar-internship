    <textblock>
      Iodine ingestion insufficiency was widespread existence in the 50's in Taiwan, induced the&#xD;
      hypothyroidism with the popular name &quot;the big neck&quot;. After many experts study and evaluation,&#xD;
      goiter was gradually disappeared after salt adding iodine in the 60's. But the nodule of the&#xD;
      thyroid gland was widespread on the Taiwan island. This situation was a particular victim in&#xD;
      living in the mountainous area inhabitant. The middle area populaces suffer from the thyroid&#xD;
      gland disease really popular than other areas. Recently literature reported that the cancer&#xD;
      rate of thyroid gland rises gradually. In according to the statistics, thyroid cancer&#xD;
      prevalence probably has 10% in the nodular goiter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major early preliminary diagnosis of the thyroid cancer is thyroid fine-needle aspiration&#xD;
      cytology (FNAC), but this technique must to have skilled clinical puncture's doctor and to&#xD;
      have special training cytological pathology doctor. Therefore, if we can have simple fast&#xD;
      screening tool and can make up this insufficiency, then we can achieved the fast diagnosis,&#xD;
      rapid processing, the promotion diagnosis and treatment quality and promotes the survival&#xD;
      percentage. The thyroid ultrasonography (Thyroid US) is one universal, fast, cheap, and the&#xD;
      simple diagnosis nodular goiter tool. If we can friendly use this tool, we can early&#xD;
      diagnosis &amp; management this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research collect subjects from Jan 2002 to Dec 2016 under procedure of thyroid US, FNAC&#xD;
      and thyroidectomy. Preliminary design index of thyroid gland tumor score (TTS) was to survey&#xD;
      and analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Enrolled subjects with nodular goiter had thyroid sonography and thyroidectomy from 2002 January to 2016 December in CMUH. Total enrolled subject about 2000. These subjects were confirmed by pathology. Each subject had been transverse and longitudinal views of thyroid ultrasonography with high-resolution ultrasound (7-14 MHz) (HP Image Point-HS, Toshiba SSA250, GE ,Aloka SSD-1200 and Siemens S2000) that was performed by our partners - endocrinologist in all patients. Gray scale ultrasonography was routinely performed in every subject. Color Doppler ultrasonography for blood flow and thyroid fine needle aspiration was not absolute done in routine procedure. All data at least was interpreted by 3 endocrinologists under the blind method. Each subject was analyzed under thyroid echogenicity, margin, calcification, inclusion, grooving change and size &amp; ratio size of tall and transverse.</description>
