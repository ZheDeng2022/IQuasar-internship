      The trial is funded by Cancer Foundation of China. The trial is prepared to be registered on&#xD;
      the clinicaltrail.gov. Quality assurance plan: every participant is enrolled or excluded by&#xD;
      two practiced investigators. And two investigators participated in all steps of the trail,&#xD;
      including the record of the data, and the investigators will compare the data. If the data is&#xD;
      consistent, the investigators would record the data; if not, the data would be checked and&#xD;
      decided by the two investigators. All the steps and data are site monitored and audited by&#xD;
      the workers of research and financial department of National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital,&#xD;
      Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data check: the investigators compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules&#xD;
      for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry. Source data verification to&#xD;
      assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by comparing the&#xD;
      data to external data sources, including medical records and electronic case report forms.&#xD;
      Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by the registry,&#xD;
      including the source of the variable, coding information, and normal ranges if relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as&#xD;
      participants recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for&#xD;
      adverse events, and change management. All registry operations would be done according to&#xD;
      specific steps, and by two practiced investigators. Sample size assessment to specify the&#xD;
      number of participants or participant years necessary to demonstrate an effect. According to&#xD;
      the formula to differ advantages and disadvantages, the investigators need at least 400&#xD;
      participants to take part in the trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators can recruit about 200 participants every year according to previous&#xD;
      experiences, so the investigators should recruit at least for two years. Plan for missing&#xD;
      data: the investigators would collect as much data as possible, and the investigators exclude&#xD;
      the participants who cannot cooperate on recruitment. And the investigators manage situations&#xD;
      according to statistical principles where variables are reported as missing, unavailable,&#xD;
      &quot;non-reported,&quot; uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data inconsistency or&#xD;
      out-of range results. Statistical analysis plan: Kaplan-Meier method would be used to analyze&#xD;
      the difference of survival time between the two groups, and the local control rate of the two&#xD;
      groups would be compared by chi square test. Statistical analyses would be performed by using&#xD;
      IBM SPSS Statistics(version 20; IBM, Chicago, USA). The level of significance is defined as P&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
