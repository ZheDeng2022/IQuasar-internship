  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is focused on helping one of the most vulnerable patient populations in&#xD;
      medicine, patients with end-stage chronic lung disease. Lung transplantation is the only cure&#xD;
      for end-stage lung disease, however, due to the persistent shortage of donor organs, either&#xD;
      due to low organ donation rates or unacceptable organs, only a minority of patients receive&#xD;
      desperately needed lung transplants. Currently less than 30% of potential donated thoracic&#xD;
      organs are being used for transplantation. The major causes for under utilization of donor&#xD;
      thoracic organs are injury sustained by the lungs in trauma or emergency resuscitation or&#xD;
      lungs that come from donors who are pronounced dead due to cardiac arrest (known as DCD&#xD;
      donors). It has been hypothesized that these injuries may be reversible or repairable if&#xD;
      there was an opportunity to evaluate and repair these organs outside of the body (ex-vivo),&#xD;
      prior to transplantation. In fact, studies have shown that the use of normothermic Ex-Vivo&#xD;
      Lung Perfusion (EVLP) has increased the rate of donor organ utilization at centers that have&#xD;
      adopted the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methodology for all clinically available EVLP devices uses Positive Pressure&#xD;
      Ventilation (PPV). Researchers at the University of Alberta (UofA), however, have developed&#xD;
      an EVLP device that will apply Negative Pressure Ventilation (NPV) to the lungs, as opposed&#xD;
      to PPV, which is the most ideal mimicry of native lung physiology. The objective of this&#xD;
      early feasibility safety trial is to show that the UofA developed NPV-EVLP device is&#xD;
      acceptable in evaluating and improving the quality of marginal donor lungs compared to&#xD;
      currently used EVLP devices, ultimately allowing for these types of donor lungs to be safely&#xD;
      transplanted into patients on the lung transplant recipient waitlist.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The purpose of this Phase I Early Feasibility Proof of Concept clinical trial will be to evaluate initial performance and safety of the NPV-EVLP device to assess and improve the function of marginal donor lungs. By nature, efficacy measures and outcomes of the device will also become evident from the results of this study.&#xD;
This is a prospective, non-randomized, interventional trial, taking place solely at the University of Alberta Hospital/Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute. Lungs deemed marginal, based on standard lung donor criteria that meet the study's eligibility criteria, will be assessed on our NPV-EVLP device to determine suitability for lung transplantation. Objective assessment of quality will be made while the lungs are on the device based on pre-determined functional parameters of lung physiology. Once a total of 12 sets of lungs are transplanted after using the device, safety will be determined by post-operative lung function and recipient survival.</intervention_model_description>
