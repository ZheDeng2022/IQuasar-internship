    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to continue the evaluation of antibody persistence through 11 to&#xD;
      15 years after first booster with Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) vaccine. This study will&#xD;
      further investigate the booster response in subjects who will receive their second booster&#xD;
      dose* in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Any booster given in this study will be the second that the subject has received (with&#xD;
      regard to the follow-up of the previous study).&#xD;

Subjects who have an NT titre below 10 at one of the scheduled visits will receive a second booster dose 6 months after this visit at an unscheduled visit.
