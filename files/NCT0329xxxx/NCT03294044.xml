  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study verifies efficacy of Smart Health Management Program developed for patients with&#xD;
      chronic illness. The aim of the study is to observe the changes in clinical indicators,&#xD;
      quality of life and health related behaviors when providing self-management programs with ICT&#xD;
      for chronic disease patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to demonstrate that chronic disease patients (hypertension, diabetes and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia) with ICT-based self-management and educational program can improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and overall health status, including quality of life and health habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the economic burden, people with chronic disease experience various&#xD;
      psychosocial crises such as anxiety and depression, which causes the deterioration of overall&#xD;
      quality of life and increases social burden. However, standard Chronic Care Model (CCM) have&#xD;
      limitations in that they do not provide self-management strategies of the patient in detail.&#xD;
      Therefore, to improve the effectiveness of the CCM model, it is required to propose a new&#xD;
      approach to the utilization of IT-based self-management program that is currently being&#xD;
      developed to increase accessibility and efficiency of health care service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes of this study are as follow: Improvement of clinical indicators in patients&#xD;
      with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will respond a baseline questionnaire about health habits, health&#xD;
      behavior patterns and quality of life, diet, exercise, etc. After that, participants will be&#xD;
      allocated randomly into the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group&#xD;
      will receive self-management and educational program with ICT (&quot;S Healthing&quot;) while the&#xD;
      control group will receive basic educational material with same contents on the disease. &quot;S&#xD;
      Healthing&quot; is based ICT- program and includes educational contents and self-management&#xD;
      program based on Smart Management Strategy for Health (SMASH). The intervention group will&#xD;
      conduct self-management for 3 months through smart phone application and web program.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a questionnaire about the quality of life and health habits with&#xD;
      the clinical examination 3 months after baseline survey was conducted. The result from two&#xD;
      questionnaires (baseline, post-intervention) and clinical outcomes will be compiled and be&#xD;
      compared with each other.&#xD;
