      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Venetoclax in combination with FDA&#xD;
      approved treatments Bendamustine, Rituximab and Ibrutinib (BR-I). This study will examine the&#xD;
      effects Venetoclax has on participants when it is given in combination with BR-I.&#xD;

                  months after the last dose of rituximab. Men must refrain from donating sperm&#xD;
                  during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during&#xD;
                  the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of rituximab&#xD;
