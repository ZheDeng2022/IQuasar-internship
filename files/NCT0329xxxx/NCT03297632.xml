  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls and fractures are serious and costly events for elderly individuals: they cause&#xD;
      functional impairments, increase mortality and contribute to huge healthcare costs for the&#xD;
      society. The number of falls, and following consequences, are expected to increase in society&#xD;
      as the proportion of the elderly population will increase, therefore it is crucial to be able&#xD;
      to detect and prevent falls and fractures in the population. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously published results that objective measurements of postural balance can predict fall&#xD;
      risk in 70-year-olds in Umeå and subsequently investigated whether balance can be improved&#xD;
      through 4-week balance exercise program. However, preliminary results suggest that the&#xD;
      frequency and duration of exercise should be longer than 3 times a week for 4 weeks to&#xD;
      produce effects. Furthermore, there is also evidence indicating a link between muscle&#xD;
      weakness and fall risk in elderly subjects, while research findings show that it is possible&#xD;
      for older individuals to influence muscle strength and muscle mass with resistance exercise.&#xD;
      Functional strength training can also positively influence the balance. In this context, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate whether a 10-week resistance exercise program may positively&#xD;
      affect balance, muscle strength, muscle mass and physical function, with the aim of&#xD;
      preventing future falls and fractures in the population.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls and fall-related injuries are major health concerns for elderly individuals; they cause&#xD;
      functional decline and increased mortality, as well as incurring vast health care costs for&#xD;
      society. Occurrences and consequences of falls are expected to increase globally with the&#xD;
      growing number of elderly individuals. Hence, the improved detection of potential fall risk&#xD;
      markers is of importance when predicting individuals at risk for falls and subsequently for&#xD;
      improving strategies in fall-prevention. Falling can be the end result of intrinsic and&#xD;
      extrinsic factors negatively affecting an individual's ability to maintain balance, which are&#xD;
      often revealed during sequences of body movement. Balance can be both dynamically and&#xD;
      statically measured, the latter involves having the individual in a stationary standing&#xD;
      position, from which results researchers have proposed impaired postural stability as a risk&#xD;
      factor for falling. However, evidence regarding the association of postural instability with&#xD;
      prospective falls is limited, and population-based cohort studies in this field are scarce.&#xD;
      Other shortcomings of previous studies include the use of retrospective study designs, which&#xD;
      increase the risks of recall bias and the identification of risk factors as the result of&#xD;
      falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural instability is preferably investigated using objective measures of posturography,&#xD;
      which has advantages over regular clinical assessments since it reduces test performance&#xD;
      variability and avoids the subjective nature of scoring systems. Recently, researchers has&#xD;
      analyzed the performance of the Wii Balance Board (WBB) as an instrument for measuring&#xD;
      postural instability, revealing excellent concurrent validity and an ability to complement&#xD;
      existing fall assessments. However, these findings needed to be evaluated in a&#xD;
      population-based sample with a rich set of covariates. Hence, the investigators performed a&#xD;
      prospectively observational study to investigate how objective measures of postural sway&#xD;
      predicted prospective falls in a cohort of more than 1800 community-dwelling men and women,&#xD;
      all of whom were 70 years of age at the time of the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results revealed that impaired postural stability can increase the risk of incident falls&#xD;
      by 75 to 90% among older adults in the highest quintile of postural sway, measured during&#xD;
      trials of both eyes open and eyes closed. One of the conclusions was that it would be&#xD;
      valuable to examine the clinical utility of the investigated parameters in future studies,&#xD;
      compare performance to established clinical balance tests, and to investigate whether&#xD;
      strategies to improve balance would reduce the fall risk. Thus, in a follow-up study the&#xD;
      investigators examined wether they could reduce the increased postural sway of participants&#xD;
      who was identified as having abnormal balance values, based on previous measurements. The&#xD;
      investigators also examined participants' functional balance through Time-Up-and-GO (TUG)&#xD;
      performance, together with measures of muscle strength and validated questionnaires on Fear&#xD;
      of Falling and Falls Efficacy. This follow-up study was conducted as a randomized&#xD;
      intervention study, with a total of 52 individuals recruited from the existing HAI study&#xD;
      cohort, with measures of postural sway in the 5th quintile, which indicated impaired balance&#xD;
      function. The intervention group performed three supervised group training sessions a week,&#xD;
      consisting of 30 minutes of balance training for 4 weeks while the control group received a&#xD;
      health consultation highlighting the importance of physical activity and balance exercise.&#xD;
      Preliminary data indicated that the exercise intervention had little to no effect on selected&#xD;
      measures on balance, strength and physical function. Thus, it may seem that a exercise volume&#xD;
      of 4 weeks of progressive balance exercise, 3 sessions per week, might be to low to produce&#xD;
      beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this previous study indicated the need for a more comprehensive exercise&#xD;
      program in order to produce beneficial effects on balance, strength and physical function,&#xD;
      and in the long term, fall prevention. Previous research has shown that low muscle strength&#xD;
      together with low muscle mass, also known as sarcopenia, independently predicts falls,&#xD;
      fractures and overall poor health. However, a growing body of evidence also indicates that&#xD;
      older individuals are able to counteract the trend of age-related loss of muscle mass, as&#xD;
      well as improve dynamic balance, through the use of resistance exercise. For older&#xD;
      individuals, it is recommended that the exercise regimen lasts for 10-12 weeks, with 3&#xD;
      exercise sessions each week, in order to produce effects on muscle strength, muscle mass and&#xD;
      physical function, which is a higher total exercise volume than what was used in the balance&#xD;
      exercise study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary aim of the current study is to investigate the effect and feasibility of a&#xD;
           10-week instructor-supervised resistance exercise program designed for older individuals&#xD;
           with low muscle mass. The goal is to implement exercises that are possible for the&#xD;
           participants to also perform in their home environment, through the use of basic&#xD;
           equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A secondary aim is to evaluate the effect of the very same exercise program, recorded in&#xD;
           digital videos and written instructions, to be used by the participant in their own&#xD;
           residence or similar location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment is based on participants previously enrolled in the Healthy Ageing Initiative&#xD;
      (HAI) health examination, an on-going population based cohort study which invites all&#xD;
      70-year-olds in the Umeå municipality to participate. Eligible participants for this study&#xD;
      will be drawn from the lowest quintile of muscle mass (pre-sarcopenia) for men and women,&#xD;
      based on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA, GE Healthcare, Lunar, Madison, WI, USA)&#xD;
      measurements in the HAI study and criteria taken from the European definition on sarcopenia.&#xD;
      Participants are first contacted by telephone where they receive information about the study&#xD;
      and are invited to participate. Upon agreement, participants are randomized either to the&#xD;
      control group, a home-based training group or instructor-led training group. The latter group&#xD;
      is offered instructor-based weight training in groups, three times a week for 10 weeks. The&#xD;
      exercise program is designed to engage whole-body muscle groups, with focus on leg and core&#xD;
      musculature, as well as being functional and include movements and muscle actions important&#xD;
      for active daily living. The home-based training includes 10 weeks of the same exercise&#xD;
      program, performed at home with digital support. The control group are offered access to&#xD;
      training instructions as well as digital support during follow up 6 months after the start of&#xD;
      the study. In addition, all participants receive cost-free training equipment for home use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing is performed at baseline, after the intervention period during follow-up at 10 weeks,&#xD;
      as well as 6 months after baseline. The following tests and outcomes are included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome is Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test score. The SPPB&#xD;
           includes several functional tests evaluating leg strength and power, postural stability&#xD;
           and gait speed. The SPPB is a common and validated clinical test of physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Objective measurement of postural stability, using the Wii Balance Board (WBB;&#xD;
                Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) device, described and validated in a previously published&#xD;
                study (8). Each participant conducts two 60-s trials in a quiet stance, consisting&#xD;
                of eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions. Participants are instructed to&#xD;
                maintain an upright position throughout the test, stand relaxed and avoid any arm&#xD;
                or head movement. The WBB measures total centre of pressure (COP) sway length,&#xD;
                representing the sum of postural sway in the anteroposterior and mediolateral&#xD;
                directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isometric muscle strength, tested by using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar;&#xD;
                Patterson Medical, Warrenville, IL, USA) to measure each participant's maximum grip&#xD;
                strength in the non-dominant hand. Participants are instructed to keep the arm at a&#xD;
                90° angle and to maintain the elbow in proximity to the waist during the test. The&#xD;
                maximum value obtained in two consecutive attempts is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Appendicular lean mass (ALM), measured with a iDXA device (GE Healthcare, Lunar,&#xD;
                Madison, WI, USA). Measurements are based on whole-body scans with a duration of&#xD;
                approximately 8 minutes. An ALM index is subsequently calculated by combining the&#xD;
                total muscle mass in arms and legs and dividing by height squared (ALM/m2) of the&#xD;
                participant, according to the standards set by the European Working Group on&#xD;
                Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test performance, a test commonly used by clinicians to&#xD;
                assess lower leg muscle strength, gait performance, and overall functional mobility&#xD;
                in elderly individuals. In this test, each participant are asked to rise unaided&#xD;
                from an armchair and walk forward 3 meters until he or she reached a line marked on&#xD;
                the floor, then to turn around and return to a seated position in the chair. Test&#xD;
                leaders provide instructions and measure total testing time using a stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Objective measures of physical activity, measured by triaxial accelerometers&#xD;
                (GT3X., 4.6 3.3 1.5 cm; Actigraph, Pensacola, FL) for 7 days. These devices are&#xD;
                capable of measuring acceleration in the range of 6 G. Measured accelerations are&#xD;
                digitalized, transformed into &quot;counts,&quot; and stored in a resilient flash memory.&#xD;
                Participants wear the accelerometers on their non-dominant hips, removing them only&#xD;
                when showering, swimming, or during nighttime sleep. They also receive instructions&#xD;
                to be normally active during the measurement period, to obtain accurate reflections&#xD;
                of their lifestyles.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fear of Falling, using the validated Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)&#xD;
                questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-recalled physical activity, using the validated International Physical&#xD;
                Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Furthermore, the investigators aim to investigate&#xD;
                postural stability, TUG test performance, Fear of Falling and self-recalled&#xD;
                physical activity 4 weeks after baseline, in order to facilitate comparison between&#xD;
                resistance exercise to the balance exercise program performed in the previous 4-&#xD;
                week randomized controlled trial (Ethical approval Dnr: 2017-132-31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation is based on the main outcome for the study, i.e. the short physical&#xD;
      performance battery (SPPB). SPPB was previously tested in 2.710 older sample of Italian&#xD;
      adults with a mean age of 75 (range 65-97). Women scored 7.79±3.22 (mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation) and men scored 9.03±3.12. In the present study the investigators will include a&#xD;
      more homogeneous sample of younger age but with pre-sarcopenia. Therefore, estimations are&#xD;
      that the score in this sample at baseline will be 8±2.5. From a previous study including 424&#xD;
      elderly persons at risk for disability (ages 70-89 years), it was shown that SPPB increased&#xD;
      16% from 6 months of moderate physical activity in the intervention group, which decreased&#xD;
      slightly to 13.3% after 1 year. These effects were significantly different compared to in the&#xD;
      control group (p&lt;0.001), where no changes were seen in SPPB. There was slightly better effect&#xD;
      of training in women and those with a SPPB of at least 7 at baseline. Based on these figures&#xD;
      the investigators estimate that the intervention group will increase 12% in SPPB during the&#xD;
      10 weeks of training, with no changes in the control group. Based on these assumptions, 107&#xD;
      persons will be needed in each group, to have 80% power to detect a two-sided effect with&#xD;
      α-level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first round of enrollment starting this fall, the investigators have begun randomizing&#xD;
      36 participants to each group. The aim is to continue and enroll remaining participants&#xD;
      during the second round starting late spring/early fall 2018.&#xD;
