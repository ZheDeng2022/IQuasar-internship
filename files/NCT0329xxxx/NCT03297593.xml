    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors that target PD-1 and CTLA-4 have shown activity in&#xD;
      mRCC. However, the optimal schedule of the combination therapy has yet to be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the trial is to determine the efficacy of combination immunotherapy of&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion phase shall address the role of ipilimumab in case of clinically insignificant&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the encouraging results of recent trials, only a minority of patients shows&#xD;
      significant response to single agent immunotherapy with nivolumab (Overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) around 20%). Therefore, further investigations are urgently needed to improve the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with mRCC. Recent analyses of phase I trials in mRCC and also in&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients as well as more advanced studies in melanoma&#xD;
      patients have provided evidence that combination of immunotherapies can improve response&#xD;
      rates and response duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumors can be recognized as foreign rather&#xD;
      than as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective&#xD;
      immune response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of tumor antigens&#xD;
      expressed on cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer&#xD;
      cell death. Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow&#xD;
      cancer cells to evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses. Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the&#xD;
      immune system to tumor cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccination or by modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysfunctional T cells in cancer show an upregulation of inhibitory receptors (T cell&#xD;
      exhaustion). Combined blockade of inhibitory receptors including CTLA-4 and PD-1 are&#xD;
      considered to act synergistically. Indeed, early trials in mRCC showed improved response&#xD;
      rates and combinations have also demonstrated to be prolonging progression-free survival in&#xD;
      melanoma. While CTLA-4 is mainly involved in transmitting negative signals in T cells during&#xD;
      priming in the lymph node, PD-1 is thought to mainly inhibit T cell cytotoxicity within the&#xD;
      tumor by engagement of ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are upregulated by tumor cells and&#xD;
      inflammatory cells within the tumor microenvironment as shield against the immune attack. It&#xD;
      is therefore reasonable to combine PD-1 blockade with CTLA-4 blockade and this has been&#xD;
      tested with an intriguing doubling of ORR in a phase I trial in patients with mRCC. An&#xD;
      important aspect of any combination therapy is the question of additional/ excessive&#xD;
      toxicity. In that trial the combination of nivolumab 3mg/kg/q3w (cont.) and ipilimumab&#xD;
      1mg/kg/q3w (4 times) proved to be safe, efficacious and feasible (much better safety profile&#xD;
      in patients with mRCC compared to patients in melanoma trials). 78% of patients had any AE,&#xD;
      but only 28% a grade 3-4 AE event. While diarrhea was quite common, only 4.8% had grade 3-4&#xD;
      diarrhea. Other treatment related immune-mediated AEs, especially endocrinopathy,&#xD;
      pneumonitis, skin disorders were recorded at lower grades than 3. No deaths were reported for&#xD;
      this combination. The overall response rate was 43% with durable responses of 78% in patients&#xD;
      that had an initial response (durable responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, recent variations of dosing schedules and strengths of the nivolumab-ipilimumab&#xD;
      combinations have shown improvement of toxicity rates with no loss of efficacy. For example,&#xD;
      ipilimumab every 6 weeks at 1mg/kg was shown to be well tolerated in patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer when combined with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab has proven efficacy and a favorable toxicity profile as a 2nd line therapy in mRCC.&#xD;
      It is therefore destined to become the standard therapy after a first line TKI therapy.&#xD;
      However, only a minority of patients shows clear responses leaving plenty of room for&#xD;
      improvement. The addition of a further agent including blockade of CTLA-4 that acts&#xD;
      synergistically could improve the response rate and also extend the progression-free and&#xD;
      overall survival in patients with mRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab in order to increase response rates and induce more&#xD;
      often durable remissions in patients is a reasonable next step and is currently tested in&#xD;
      several randomized trials. However, at this point it is unclear which subgroup benefits most&#xD;
      from the combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade and the optimal regimen/schedule remains&#xD;
      unknown. To this end, this trial will test a combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab at an&#xD;
      alternate schedule and a subsequent adaptation of the treatment regimen to the individual&#xD;
      response with the aim to increase efficacy while reducing toxicity in mRCC patients.&#xD;
      Ipilimumab is often used only in the first weeks of antineoplastic treatment for initial&#xD;
      immune priming, allowing the presumption that it could be stopped after an initial priming&#xD;
      phase. A phase I dose finding study is not needed, as experience with this dose and even&#xD;
      higher doses have been reported and data are on file at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). In&#xD;
      addition, sequential biopsies and biomarker studies shall identify patients that benefit the&#xD;
      most of a combination immunotherapy. In this trial, it was decided to have a nivolumab&#xD;
      lead-in phase to be able to determine whether any acute side effect is nivolumab or&#xD;
      ipilimumab related.&#xD;
