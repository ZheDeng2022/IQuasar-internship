  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase II trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ONC201, an oral small molecule imipridone DRD2 antagonist, in adult subjects with recurrent&#xD;
      high-grade glioma. This study will test the research hypothesis that histone H3 K27M mutation&#xD;
      sensitizes to oral administration of ONC201 in gliomas.&#xD;

             on any glioma tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unequivocal evidence of progressive disease on contrast-enhanced brain CT or MRI as&#xD;
             defined by RANO-HGG criteria, or have documented recurrent glioma on diagnostic&#xD;
             biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease by RANO-HGG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have had previous therapy with at least radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No more than two prior episodes of recurrence from radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
             Use of bevacizumab solely for treatment of radiation necrosis, pseudoprogression, or&#xD;
             treatment effect will not be considered a recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Interval of at least 90 days from the completion of radiotherapy to the first dose of&#xD;
             ONC201. If patients are within 90 days of radiotherapy, they may still be eligible if&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Nuclear medicine imaging, MR spectroscopy, or MR perfusion imaging consistent&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must&#xD;

             include: stable use of oral contraceptives such as combined estrogen and progestogen&#xD;
             and progestogen only hormonal contraception or other prescription pharmaceutical&#xD;
             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device&#xD;

                  hysterectomy or tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Availability of a paraffin-embedded or frozen tumor-tissue block with a minimum of 1&#xD;
             cm2 of tumor surface area, or 20 unstained slides from the tumor tissue specimen if a&#xD;
             tumor block cannot be submitted. If a patient has had only a stereotactic biopsy, then&#xD;
             5 unstained slides may be accepted with prior approval from the Sponsor, however all&#xD;
             efforts must be made to obtain as close to 20 slides as possible.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Arm B: Primary malignant lesion located in the pons or spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Arm B: Atypical non-astrocytic histologies such as ependymoma, ganglioma and&#xD;
             pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, or pilocytic astrocytoma and subependymal giant cell&#xD;
             astrocytoma (SEGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Arm B: Prior bevacizumab treatment of &gt;4 doses of &gt;7.5 mg/Kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ONC201 or its excipients (See Section 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current or planned participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an&#xD;
             investigational device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease or evidence of CSF dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;

          8. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women or unable to maintain use of contraception while&#xD;

             with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with ONC201.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias&#xD;
             or bradycardia, unless arrhythmia is controlled and after Cardiology has cleared&#xD;
             patient to receive ONC 201. Receiving therapeutic agents known to prolong QT interval&#xD;
             will be excluded. History of CHF, or MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Active illicit drug use or diagnosis of alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Tumors with known IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) or known IDH2 mutations as&#xD;
             determined by immunohistochemistry for the IDH1 R132H variant or by direct sequencing.&#xD;
             IDH1/2-mutant gliomas have a markedly longer overall survival rate compared to those&#xD;
             with IDH1/2-wildtype glioma (Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009), indicating&#xD;
             IDH1/2-mutant gliomas have a distinct natural history.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Tumors with known 1p/19q co-deletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within 3&#xD;
             years of start of study drug. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ melanoma, or in situ cervical cancer that&#xD;
             has undergone potentially curative therapy.&#xD;

             within 2 weeks of baseline disease assessments; or not fully recovered from any side&#xD;
             effects of previous procedures. An interval of 1 week for stereotactic brain biopsy&#xD;
             from the start of study treatment is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitors during the treatment phase of the study&#xD;
             and within 72 hours prior to starting study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inducers, which include enzyme inducing&#xD;
             antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (see Appendix B), during the treatment phase of the study&#xD;
             and within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment. Concurrent dexamethasone is allowed.&#xD;
