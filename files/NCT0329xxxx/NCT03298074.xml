      It is a prospective multi-center trial, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in two groups, one group will be treated with Apatinib plus Etoposide, the other&#xD;
      will be treated with Etoposide alone. It is aimed to see the efficacy and safety of Apatinib&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled trial, the aim is to see the efficacy and safety of Apatinib&#xD;
      plus Etoposide treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The main primary end point is DCR&#xD;
      (disease control rate), the secondary endpoint is Duration of response（DOR），overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), time to progression (TTP)，quality of life (QoL, according to EORTC QLQ-C30).The key&#xD;
      safety indicators include the patients' vital signs, laboratory indicators, adverse&#xD;
      events(AE),serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection duration is from the day ICF assigned to the day(30 days after the end of&#xD;
      the last medication).From the day ICF signed to the end of the study, all adverse events were&#xD;
      recorded in the CRF. The severity of the adverse events will be evaluated according to the&#xD;
      NCI CTCAE 4.0 standard.Each patient will receive a planned visit and specific data at&#xD;
      different points will be recorded in the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up after quitting the trial because of disease progression or&#xD;
      intolerance. The following parameters were recorded during follow-up: disease&#xD;
      recurrence,metastasis,death time,SAE occurred during the study; survival (available with&#xD;
      telephone follow-up, record required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events that have not been recovered when the drug is discontinued should be tracked&#xD;
      and finalized. All patients should undergo a 30-day follow-up after the last medication to&#xD;
      find any new adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases should be recorded carefully and completely, the investigator should be responsible&#xD;
      for the authenticity of the center's data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinical trial, the inspector should send the CRF to the data management unit (in&#xD;
      batches), the data administrator will carry out the independent double entry, and carry out&#xD;
      the double verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial as an exploratory test, using a small sample comparison, the test plans to enroll a&#xD;
      total of 60 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis plan includes case analysis,demographic data and baseline&#xD;
      analysis,efficacy analysis and safety analysis.All statistical tests will be performed on&#xD;
      both sides, the difference between the tests was considered statistically significant with a&#xD;
      P value less than or equal to 0.05,&#xD;
