  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescent technology continues to advance in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).&#xD;
      Currently, this requires switching from near-infrared light to white light to be able to&#xD;
      identify the fluorescent tissue contrasting with normal surrounding tissue. Currently, no&#xD;
      system has been studied specifically for head and neck sentinel lymph node biopsies using a&#xD;
      hands free goggle system that can visualize white light (normal surgical visualization) and&#xD;
      nearinfrared light (ICG fluorescence) simultaneously. This technology may have implications&#xD;
      on the safety and accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy for head and neck mucosal and&#xD;
      cutaneous tumors. Secondarily, this may reduce operative costs by decreasing the amount of&#xD;
      time required to perform the SLNB procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding parathyroid identification, this technology has the potential to identify these&#xD;
      very small glands during procedures they are at risk. These glands are not only at risk of&#xD;
      inadvertent removal if not adequately identified, but may also be at risk if devascularized&#xD;
      by manipulation during the surgical procedure. Therefore, early and accurate identification&#xD;
      may decrease the rate of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. This is&#xD;
      not only an issue during thyroid and parathyroid surgery, but during laryngectomy surgery&#xD;
      where the anatomic region these glands are located are often resected to remove at risk lymph&#xD;
      nodes from cancer spread. Therefore, identifying these glands may help preserve parathyroid&#xD;
      function in this patient population as well.&#xD;

    <description>-Patient will then be taken to the operating room for this surgical procedure. Prior to starting the operation, the patient will undergo injection of ICG around the tumor per standard techniques while in the operating room. Those undergoing intraoperative visualization of parathyroid glands will not have any administration of ICG as these glands autofluoresce. Patients will then undergo the standard SLN biopsy procedure (those undergoing parathyroid visualization will not undergo this). The surgeon will put on the goggle system to attempt to identify the SLN using fluorescence guidance or parathryroid visualization. After this is performed, the goggle system will be removed and the procedure will be completed per normal.</description>
