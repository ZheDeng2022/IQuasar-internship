      The DECIDE - Salt in Elderly (Diet, ExerCIse and carDiovascular hEalth - Salt Reduction&#xD;
      Strategies for the Elderly in Nursing Homes in China) is to evaluate the effects, safety and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of salt substitution (SS) and stepwise salt supply control (SSSC) in&#xD;
      reducing blood pressure in Chinese elderly in nursing homes. The study will recruit over 960&#xD;
      old people from 48 nursing homes in northern China. The 48 nursing homes will be randomised&#xD;
      into the following 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. salt substitute (SS) and stepwise salt supply control (SSSC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SS only;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SSSC only; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. no SS and no SSSC (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will last over 2 years. The randomization will be conducted centrally after&#xD;
      the baseline survey completed. Primary outcome will be the change in systolic blood pressure.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes include: the changes in diastolic blood pressure, 24hr urinary sodium,&#xD;
      potassium and microalbumin, and incidence of hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia,&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, and all causes death, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.&#xD;

      The DECIDE - Salt in Elderly (Diet, ExerCIse and carDiovascular hEalth - Salt Reduction&#xD;
      Strategies for the Elderly in Nursing Homes in China) is a study in the DECIDE project, which&#xD;
      includes five studies. The others are DECIDE - Diet, DECIDE - Exercise, DECIDE - Obesity in&#xD;
      Children, and DECIDE - Smart Living. The DECIDE - Salt in Elderly study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects, safety and cost-effectiveness of salt substitution (SS) and kitchen-based stepwise&#xD;
      salt supply control (SSSC) in reducing blood pressure in Chinese elderly in nursing homes.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to test if a stepwise salt supply control strategy could significantly reduce systolic&#xD;
           blood pressure among elderly living in nursing homes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to test if replacing regular salt with the market available salt substitute could&#xD;
           significantly reduce systolic blood pressure among elderly living in nursing homes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to test if the joint effect of the two strategies is larger than that from one of each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corresponding null hypotheses that will be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the mean change from the baseline in systolic blood pressure of elderly residents in&#xD;
           nursing homes that are supplied with SS is equal to the mean change from the baseline in&#xD;
           systolic blood pressure of elderly residents in nursing homes that are supplied with&#xD;
           regular salt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the mean change from the baseline in systolic blood pressure of elderly residents in&#xD;
           nursing homes that apply SSSC is equal to the mean change from the baseline in systolic&#xD;
           blood pressure of elderly residents in nursing homes that do not apply SSSC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is no interaction between the two interventions above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit over 960 old people from 48 nursing homes in northern China, where the&#xD;
      mean salt intake is generally higher than 12 g/day. A 2x2 factorial cluster-randomized trial&#xD;
      will be used to test two independent salt reduction strategies: 1) using salt substitute to&#xD;
      replace the regular salt in the kitchen of nursing homes; and 2) training the nursing manager&#xD;
      to control/reduce, step by step, the amount of salt supplied to the kitchen of nursing homes.&#xD;
      The 48 nursing homes will be randomized to the following 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. salt substitute (SS) and stepwise salt supply control (SSSC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SS only;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SSSC only; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. no SS and no SSSC (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief health education on salt and health will be applied to all four groups. The salt&#xD;
      substitute (NaCl 62.5% and KCl 25%) will be centrally provided. And the Train-the-trainers&#xD;
      model will be used to train the nursing home managers how to implement the SSSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will last over 2 years. The baseline examination including three blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements and one 24-hr urine collection will be conducted for all participants.&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples will be drawn for measurement of serum potassium and detect&#xD;
      hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia and renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be conducted centrally by the study coordinating center at Peking&#xD;
      University Clinical Research Institute, after the baseline survey completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed up for blood pressure measurements at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months, for serum potassium at 12 and 24 months, and for 24-hr urine collection at 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: The incidence of hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia and renal&#xD;
      dysfunction from the baseline to 24 months. The change in 24-hr urinary sodium, potassium and&#xD;
      microalbumin from the baseline to 24 months. The change in diastolic blood pressure from&#xD;
      baseline to follow-up. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and all causes death during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the assumptions of a 20% dropout rate, an intraclass correlation of 0.02, the number of&#xD;
      clusters of 48 and at least 20 elderly people in each nursing home, and an α value of 0.05,&#xD;
      the study to detect a mean 3.0 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SD, 18 mm Hg)&#xD;
      between the intervention groups would have a power of 0.81. To detect a 4.0 mmHg reduction in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (SD, 18 mm Hg), the power of the same sample size would be 0.96.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Linear models adjusted for clustering based on participants with&#xD;
      available measures were used to assess continuous outcomes. Frailty survival models that&#xD;
      account for clustering based upon all randomised participants were used for analysis of the&#xD;
      effects on cardiovascular and mortality outcomes. Generalized linear mixed model were used&#xD;
      for analysis of effects on hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia and renal dysfunction..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be submitted to and approved by the Peking University IRB, which has the full&#xD;
      accreditation from AAHRRP. The study salt substitute is the product available on Chinese&#xD;
      market and has been approved manufactured according to the product standards issued by the&#xD;
      ministry of health. The SSSC approach will take every step for 3 months and the biggest step&#xD;
      of salt reduction will be just 10% of the original amount of use. And the study will ensure&#xD;
      an interview will be conducted to collect the feedback before every next step will take&#xD;
      place. The SSSC intervention will stop at any time that elderly people feel unlike the foods.&#xD;
