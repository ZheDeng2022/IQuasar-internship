  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a major gap in knowledge about safe and effective treatment options for older adults&#xD;
      with chronic low back pain. This project will determine the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      full-scale trial evaluating Tai Chi, a promising &quot;mind-body&quot; intervention that seems&#xD;
      particularly well-suited for older adults with chronic low back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this project is to help fill the substantial gap in knowledge about safe&#xD;
      and effective treatments for older adults with chronic low back pain. This deficiency is a&#xD;
      particular problem because treatments that have been found safe and effective for younger&#xD;
      adults may not be appropriate for an older population that is at higher risk of adverse&#xD;
      effects and that may have different needs and treatment preferences. Tai Chi, which has been&#xD;
      found effective for chronic back pain in younger adults, seems particularly well-suited for&#xD;
      older adults with chronic low back pain because it includes multiple therapeutic elements, is&#xD;
      gentle and has been found beneficial for a variety of health conditions more common to older&#xD;
      adults. The goal of this project is to prepare the foundation for successfully conducting a&#xD;
      full-scale trial evaluating the effectiveness of two doses of Tai Chi (Standard and Enhanced,&#xD;
      which includes Standard + Maintenance Tai Chi) for improving chronic low back pain in older&#xD;
      adults over the course of a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of this study (Aim 1), the the Investigators will focus on finalization of&#xD;
      a Standard Tai Chi protocol, development of the maintenance Tai Chi protocol and development&#xD;
      of a credible attention control group. In the course of finalizing the feasibility trial&#xD;
      documents, members of the research study team will work with patient partners (older adults&#xD;
      with chronic low back pain) to adapt strategies for recruitment, adherence to Tai Chi,&#xD;
      safety, and optimizing follow-up rates for this population and the Investigators will&#xD;
      finalize the inclusion/exclusion criteria to maximize safety and generalizability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finalizing the key study components, the Investigators will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      feasibility trial comparing Enhanced Tai Chi with Health Education and Usual Medical Care.&#xD;
      Sixty-four older adults with cLBP - 65+ years of age will be randomized to the Enhanced&#xD;
      (standard + maintenance) Tai Chi, to Health Education or to Usual Medical Care. Outcomes will&#xD;
      be collected at 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The Investigators will evaluate the adequacy of key&#xD;
      elements of the study developed in Aim 1 for inclusion in a full-scale trial. Finally, the&#xD;
      research study team will conduct debriefing discussion groups with 30 trial participants to&#xD;
      elicit their ideas for improving the procedures and protocols. This evaluation will address&#xD;
      the overall feasibility of conducting a large trial and the value of including the Enhanced&#xD;
      dose Tai Chi treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this feasibility study will pave the way for conducting an adequately-powered&#xD;
      randomized\ controlled trial evaluating the ability of Tai Chi to reduce the impact of&#xD;
      chronic low back pain on older adults. In view of the absence of knowledge about clearly safe&#xD;
      and effective treatments for this population, this line of research has the potential for&#xD;
      substantially reducing the suffering of many Americans with back pain.&#xD;
