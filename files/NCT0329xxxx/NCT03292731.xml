    <textblock>
      The study plans to determine the relationship between plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC&#xD;
      (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) and the rate of preterm birth. The study is a randomized, open&#xD;
      label study of pregnant women with one or more prior spontaneous preterm births. Subjects are&#xD;
      randomized to a weekly single injection of either 250 or 500mg 17-OHPC (hydroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      caproate).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine the association between plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC&#xD;
      (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) and the rate of preterm birth and will evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      several potential covariates on plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC and its efficacy. 17-OHPC&#xD;
      (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) administration has proven effective in reducing preterm births&#xD;
      in high risk groups but the current dose of 250mg administered IM is thought to be an&#xD;
      inadequate for a substantial portion of women receiving the therapy. The potential benefit of&#xD;
      identifying a therapeutic concentration range and of optimizing the dosage of 17-OHPC are&#xD;
      substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant subjects with a history of a prior spontaneous preterm birth with be randomized to&#xD;
      either the 250mg or 500mg weekly intramuscular injections. All subjects will have trough&#xD;
      blood samples collected immediately prior to their second injection of the 17-OHPC, at 26-30&#xD;
      weeks (but only after a minimum of 7 injections have been administered) , 6-9 weeks later and&#xD;
      at the time of delivery. Another tube of maternal blood will be collected during one of the&#xD;
      scheduled blood samples for genotyping. A cord blood specimen will also be collected and with&#xD;
      consent, a cord blood specimen will be collected for genetic studies of the infant.&#xD;
      Investigators will also collect a small sample of the placenta after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to enhance sample size for this trial, investigators will also enroll a separate&#xD;
      group of subjects (ancillary cohort) who are not in the randomized clinical trial (RCT)&#xD;
      described above. Women already receiving 250 mg 17-OHPC weekly from their healthcare provider&#xD;
      as part of their standard of care will be approached prior to 26 weeks gestation. This will&#xD;
      be an observational cohort and subjects enrolled in the ancillary cohort will not be&#xD;
      randomized, as they are already receiving the 250 mg dose. Research staff will not administer&#xD;
      the study drug to subjects enrolled in the ancillary cohort. These subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      provide two blood samples: one at 26-30 weeks and one 6-9 weeks later, which will be utilized&#xD;
      to address the primary objective of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the addition of the ancillary cohort, randomization for subjects in the RCT&#xD;
      will be 2:1 for the 500 mg vs the 250 mg dose. The ancillary study will be implemented&#xD;
      initially at the UPITT site only but may be expanded to other sites, as required.&#xD;
