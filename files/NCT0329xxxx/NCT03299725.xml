  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infection causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and is involved&#xD;
      in the development of gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current accepted strategies to eliminate the infection in children are a 10 days sequential&#xD;
      treatment (proton pump inhibitor + amoxicillin 5 days followed by proton pump inhibitor +&#xD;
      metronidazole + clarithromycin 5 days) or a triple therapy 14 days (proton pump inhibitor +&#xD;
      amoxicillin + clarithromycin or metronidazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a concern due to the growing resistance of Helicobacter pylori strains to&#xD;
      antibiotics, especially clarithromycin, and the decreased efficacy of first line treatment&#xD;
      regimens to satisfactorily eliminate the infection in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data show that combinations using bismuth salts must be considered in adults. Indeed,&#xD;
      the efficacy of a 10 days of quadruple therapy with omeprazole plus a single three-in-one&#xD;
      capsule containing bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole and tetracycline was shown to be highly&#xD;
      superior to the standard triple therapy combining omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin&#xD;
      without related severe adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of re-using bismuth salts on a more regular basis in pediatrics is being&#xD;
      restudied through a monocentric, prospective, open label, single arm clinical trial to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of a 10 days colloidal bismuth sub-citrate as an adjunctive therapy&#xD;
      in combination with esomeprazole, amoxicillin and metronidazole in children aged 6-17 years,&#xD;
      infected by Helicobacter pylori.&#xD;
