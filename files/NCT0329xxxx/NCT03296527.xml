      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1167 subjects were screened, wherein, 1011 subjects met the eligibility criteria and were randomized. Of these, 1009 subjects were exposed to the investigational medicinal product (IMP): 499 subjects were exposed to FE 999049 and 510 subjects were exposed to GONAL-F.

          <title>FE 000049 (Follitropin Delta)</title>
          <description>FE 999049 was administered as single daily subcutaneous injections in the abdomen. Subjects randomized to FE 999049 had their individual dose determined on the basis of their anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level at screening and their body weight at randomization. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period and minimum and maximum allowed daily dose was 6 and 12 μg, respectively. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Subjects could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>

The starting dose of GONAL-F was 150 IU and fixed for the first five stimulation days, after which it could be adjusted by 75 IU based on the individual response. The maximum allowed daily dose was 450 IU. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met.

Subjects randomized to FE 999049 had their individual dose determined on the basis of their AMH level at screening and their body weight at randomization. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period and minimum and maximum allowed daily dose was 6 and 12 μg, respectively. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Subjects could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>
