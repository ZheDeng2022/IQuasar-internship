  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microbial communities are key components of human environment. Consequently, human gut&#xD;
      microbiome have been extensively studied providing a better understanding of the relations&#xD;
      between bacterial populations and host physiology. However, a typical analysis tends to elude&#xD;
      the complexity of the mixes in term of species, strains, as well as extra-chromosomal DNA&#xD;
      molecules such as and phages. MetaKids project aims at bringing, at an unprecedented&#xD;
      resolution, a new view of those populations and the internal relationships during human gut&#xD;
      establishment, a crucial step with long-term impacts on host health. This project relies on&#xD;
      the ability of Meta3C, a newly technique developed in the lab, to identify the bacterial host&#xD;
      genomes of the different phages the investigators will detect thanks to the physical&#xD;
      collision these molecules experience. Given the role that human gut phages may play in&#xD;
      shaping the development of host microbiomes, their potential for application is of great&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;

      Over the last decade, the role of microorganisms residing in human intestines has been&#xD;
      intensively studied. The intestinal microbiome includes bacteria, viruses, fungi and archaea.&#xD;
      The importance of microbiome to human health is highlighted by the observation that dysbiotic&#xD;
      shifts in these microbial communities have been associated with numerous human diseases,&#xD;
      including obesity, inflammatory bowel disorders, autoimmune disease or gastrointestinal&#xD;
      cancer. It is also clearly established that some of these microorganisms interact with the&#xD;
      immune system and contribute to its development. The intestinal microbiome is established&#xD;
      soon after birth, and its composition changes over the next several years toward a&#xD;
      stereotypical 'adult-like' bacterial community structure. Epidemiological studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the importance of this period for a long-term health. It also has been shown&#xD;
      that this process can be influenced by multiple interacting factors such as nutrition,&#xD;
      antibiotic use and others environmental factors. Much less is known on the viral part of&#xD;
      human microbiome. Most of them are phages (phageome) that are known to modulate microbial&#xD;
      population through predation or transfer of genetic information between bacteria, and are&#xD;
      likely to have important effects on intestinal microbiome establishment and, consequently,&#xD;
      human physiology. MetaKids project aims at understanding how the gut phageome develops during&#xD;
      the early human life and how it influences the composition of the bacterial microbiome. The&#xD;
      investigators will carry a longitudinal study of 15-20 infants from 3-9 months till age 24-30&#xD;
      months. By combining latest metagenomic methods, will be investigated: 1) the composition,&#xD;
      evolution and dynamic of the phageome and bacterial microbiome over this critical period; 2)&#xD;
      the interactions between phages and bacteria and their relationships; and 3) the impact of&#xD;
      environmental factors, like vaccinations or antibiotics treatment on the phages populations.&#xD;
      The project is based on the combination of innovative recent metagenomic techniques developed&#xD;
      in the lab. DNA is an ubiquitous and stable molecule that can be used as a marker of&#xD;
      &quot;compartmentalization&quot; at cellular and population levels, providing important information&#xD;
      regarding the genomic structure of a mix of species. Therefore, by combining approaches like&#xD;
      purification of virales particles and 3C related methods, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      characterize infant gut microbiome establishment and decipher the relationships between the&#xD;
      different genomic entities present during this period. This project will bring crucial data&#xD;
      on the role of phages during early life of human intestinal tract. Intervention to&#xD;
      modify/control intestinal population is a dynamic field and MetaKids project will bring new&#xD;
      perspectives for this research area.&#xD;
