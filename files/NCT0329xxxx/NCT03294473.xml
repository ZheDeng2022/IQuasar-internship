    <textblock>
      This study is related to a previous study, Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02924467. There are some&#xD;
      modifications in relation to the intervention arms as well as the use of a different cohort,&#xD;
      thereby justifying the second submission to Clinicaltrials.gov. This trial is taking place in&#xD;
      New York State, through partnership with the New York State Health Department (excluding New&#xD;
      York City), and Colorado. Each state will have it's own Clinicaltrial.gov submission -- this&#xD;
      was decided as some of the intervention components are different enough that separate&#xD;
      registrations were warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite U.S. guidelines for influenza vaccination of all children starting at 6 months, only&#xD;
      about half of children are vaccinated annually leading to substantial influenza disease in&#xD;
      children and spread of disease to adults. A major barrier is that families are not reminded&#xD;
      about the need for their children to receive influenza vaccination. The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of patient reminder/recall (R/R) performed by state immunization&#xD;
      information systems to improve influenza vaccination rates by using 4 clinical trials (2 per&#xD;
      state) in two different states. The investigators will assess effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of 1) autodialer R/R 2) text messages R/R 3) mailed postcard R/R as&#xD;
      compared to 4) standard of care control (no R/R).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annual epidemics of influenza A and B cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the US&#xD;
      with high rates of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and&#xD;
      medical costs. Epidemics cause up to 40,000 deaths/year (mostly elderly) and extensive&#xD;
      morbidity among children who play a key role in instigating and expanding epidemics. In&#xD;
      addition, concerns about pandemic influenza heighten the importance of new mechanisms to&#xD;
      rapidly inform the population about influenza and direct efforts for rapid vaccine delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended influenza&#xD;
      vaccination for all children &gt;6 months of age. However, vaccination rates remain very low.&#xD;
      For the 2012-2013 season, only 56% of children 2-17years were vaccinated. Modeling studies&#xD;
      suggest that as many as 19 million cases of influenza could be prevented if child vaccination&#xD;
      rates were raised to 70% nationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most effective strategy recommended by CDC and the Task Force on Community Preventive&#xD;
      Services for improving childhood influenza vaccination rates is reminder/recall (R/R), sent&#xD;
      by phone or mail, notifying parents of the need to vaccinate their child. We and others have&#xD;
      shown that R/R can improve influenza vaccination rates by up to 20%. However, &lt;16% of&#xD;
      practices use R/R; barriers are practice costs, insufficient staff time and expertise, and&#xD;
      lack of predictability regarding receipt of vaccine supplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statewide immunization information systems (IISs) now exist in all states to track childhood&#xD;
      vaccinations, but they have not been used for influenza vaccine R/R because of lack of&#xD;
      evidence for their effectiveness and a lack of a template for IIS-based R/R. The&#xD;
      investigators have united two leading immunization research groups (Denver, CO and Rochester&#xD;
      (lead by personnel at UCLA), NY) to assess the impact of centralized IIS-based influenza&#xD;
      vaccine R/R and to evaluate the effect of three types of R/R (autodialer, text message and&#xD;
      mail R/R) over usual care. The investigators will also develop tools to aid other states in&#xD;
      creating efficient IIS R/R systems for seasonal and possible pandemic influenza outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this second R/R trial in New York State, the intent is to evaluate the impact of reminder&#xD;
      recalls, in the form of 1) autodialers 2) text messages and 3) postcards versus the standard&#xD;
      of care control group, specifically in relation to raising influenza vaccination rates among&#xD;
      children 6m-17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed design of this 4-arm RCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. standard of care control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. autodialer R/R -- with brief educational messages, practice name and practice phone&#xD;
           number&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. text message R/R-- with brief educational messages, practice name and practice phone&#xD;
           number&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. mailed (postcards) R/R-- with brief educational messages, practice name and practice&#xD;
           phone number&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: All IIS-C R/R modalities will be more effective than usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Text messaging will be more cost-effective than other modalities&#xD;

    <description>Based on our prior studies, we plan to send up to 3 autodialer, text messages or postcards (based on randomization) reminders, roughly every 5-6 weeks. This will begin in October 2017 and end in December 2017. Outcomes are assessed at 6 months using IIS data.</description>

    <description>A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to determine which modality of R/R (autodialer, text message or mailed postcard) is the most cost-effective in relation to improving influenza vaccination rates. The cost analysis will also compare autodialer to text, autodialer to postcard, and texting to postcards.</description>
