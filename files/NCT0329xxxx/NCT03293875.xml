  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a research collaboration between the University of Texas at El Paso,&#xD;
      The Alliance for Border Collaboratives and Programa Companeros to adapt, implement, and&#xD;
      evaluate a multi-level community-based HIV prevention intervention (Project Encuentro). The&#xD;
      intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to&#xD;
      HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk&#xD;
      via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting&#xD;
      community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention&#xD;
      was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El&#xD;
      Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users&#xD;
      living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention&#xD;
      site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to&#xD;
      reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect&#xD;
      HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources.&#xD;
      In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of&#xD;
      HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention&#xD;
      accordingly. Findings will allow the investigators to tailor intervention components to meet&#xD;
      the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, the investigators propose to test&#xD;
      intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To&#xD;
      accomplish project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. The&#xD;
      investigators will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug&#xD;
      users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as&#xD;
      a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to&#xD;
      characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary&#xD;
      information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the&#xD;
      region and will help the investigators focus recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks&#xD;
      are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of the community advisory boards&#xD;
      and the community coalitions, the investigators will implement the intervention and will&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users&#xD;
      (n=1,200). The investigators will assess the process of implementation by conducting&#xD;
      ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and&#xD;
      Community Advisory Board and coalition meetings. The investigators will assess the fidelity&#xD;
      and quality of the intervention. Lastly, the investigators will conduct key informant&#xD;
      interviews with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations will&#xD;
      be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention&#xD;
      components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico). Findings&#xD;
      will be highly significant as the investigators will be conducting parallel research on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very&#xD;
      different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico border. Findings will elucidate&#xD;
      implementation challenges and barriers and such information can then be used to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of diverse implementation strategies in organizations working to serve the&#xD;
      needs of Latino drug users.&#xD;

      The intervention framework of the proposed Intervention is exerting change at multiple&#xD;
      levels, through community based approaches. At the structural level, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to increase the access to HIV testing of high risk drug users and to create change at&#xD;
      the community level regarding factors that influence the risk of drug users such as stigma&#xD;
      towards drug use and HIV among other topics. At the individual level, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to modify normative beliefs around risky behaviors in a social network and hence,&#xD;
      effecting change in participants by changing normative behavior around safer sexual&#xD;
      encounters, HIV testing, and reduced risk in injection and non-injection drug use. Following,&#xD;
      strategies to be employed in each intervention component are delineated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Network HIV Testing Component. To prepare for the rolling-out of the social network&#xD;
      HIV testing component (during month 6 of year 2), the investigators will convene a two day&#xD;
      training with partner organizations from both sides of the border to train staff on the&#xD;
      social network referral methodology. Research staff will initiate the recruitment of seeds by&#xD;
      recruiting four to six seeds per city. Counselors, at the partner organizations, will begin&#xD;
      by administering a rapid HIV test and provide pre and post-test counseling to seeds.&#xD;
      Counselors, who will be trained in the social network assessment methodology, will then ask&#xD;
      seeds to list other drug users in their social network who they believe are at risk of&#xD;
      contracting HIV. Counselors will then provide participants with 3 coupons to recruit&#xD;
      identified network members for an HIV test. Referred participants who engage in high-risk&#xD;
      behavior will be also provided with 3 coupons to refer their own network members for an HIV&#xD;
      test. Whenever social network HIV testing rates slow, research staff will re-seed in the&#xD;
      communities to begin the recruitment process again. Counselors will make appointments for all&#xD;
      participants who test positive for confirmatory HIV testing at the respective local&#xD;
      governmental health care institutions. A research staff will follow-up with HIV positive&#xD;
      participants to engage them in care. Throughout the duration of the project, monthly meetings&#xD;
      will be convened between research staff involved in the project to ascertain that procedures&#xD;
      are being followed and retrain if the need arises. The social network component of the&#xD;
      intervention will continue until month 12 of year 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Peer Network Intervention. During month 1 of year 4, we will roll-out the peer network&#xD;
      behavioral intervention. Two peer leaders will be selected from each city to deliver the&#xD;
      intervention sessions. Eligibility criteria will be being former drug users, having extensive&#xD;
      contacts, high degree of trust among peers, and motivation and demonstrated ability to work&#xD;
      fixed hours. During month 12 of year 3, training sessions, in collaboration with partner&#xD;
      organization, will be conducted to train peer leaders over the course of two weeks during ten&#xD;
      training sessions lasting 3 hours per session. Peer leaders will be trained in the curriculum&#xD;
      as well as in psychosocial theory as the basis for behavioral interventions, interactive&#xD;
      group management, HIV risk reduction, effective instruction for role-plays, and social&#xD;
      network recruitment methods. Peer leaders will recruit drug users they know who will be&#xD;
      asked, in turn, to recruit other drug users in their networks. If this initial contact is&#xD;
      unable to recruit network members, peer leaders will select other initial contact. Peer&#xD;
      leaders will deliver the intervention to 300 drug users (150 per border city) in cycles&#xD;
      composed of small social networks of 5-6 drug users. Four intervention cycles will be held&#xD;
      per month and will consist of 3 consecutive sessions of 2 hours in duration delivered in the&#xD;
      early afternoon. Peer leaders will be expected to comply with a fixed work schedule of 10&#xD;
      hours per week and will be asked to actively recruit social networks for each intervention&#xD;
      cycle. Although we expect the specific information and roles plays to change based on the&#xD;
      findings of our formative phase and our sessions of acceptability and feasibility with our&#xD;
      CAB and coalition, the peer network intervention will have the following structure. The first&#xD;
      session of the intervention will cover training in social contexts of risk and strategies to&#xD;
      avoid them through role plays, techniques for harm reduction for injection and non-injection&#xD;
      drug use, and available community resources to deal with substance abuse. The second session&#xD;
      will provide information about HIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases through games, didactic&#xD;
      sessions, and exercises to rank the risk of contracting HIV from various behaviors,&#xD;
      negotiation skills for condom use in situations of high risk such as exchange of sex for&#xD;
      drugs. The third session will consist of training in advocacy and sexual rights and&#xD;
      establishment of a personal and social network risk reduction plan. Ethnographers will be&#xD;
      trained to document the process of delivery such as number of participants per intervention&#xD;
      cycle. Research staff will attend one intervention session per cycle to assess intervention&#xD;
      fidelity. Weekly meetings will be held with peer leaders and research staff to discuss&#xD;
      problems, solutions, and planning of community wide events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-Wide Events. The community coalition in collaboration with the CAB and peer leaders&#xD;
      will be asked to plan and convene educational meetings at the community level with drug and&#xD;
      non-drug users to deliver information on topics such as drug use prevention and treatment,&#xD;
      HIV and risk reduction skills, and other issues affecting the HIV risk of communities such as&#xD;
      persecution of drug users by police, human rights violations, and sexual violence. They will&#xD;
      identify experts on topics identified and invite them as guest speakers.&#xD;
