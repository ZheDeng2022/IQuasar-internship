      This is an open-label, safety study designed to assess the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      potential for adrenal suppression following topical treatment with halobetasol propionate&#xD;
      0.05% spray applied twice-daily in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
      At least 40 eligible patients with plaque psoriasis that satisfy all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be enrolled into the study. Patients must be overall in good health and should have a&#xD;
      current diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with Investigator Global Assessment&#xD;
      (IGA) score of at least 3 or 4. Patients will be stratified by age with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: At least 20 patients 18 years of age and older with ≥ 20% body surface area (BSA)&#xD;
      affected Cohort 2: At least 20 patients 12-16 years and 11 months of age with ≥ 10% BSA&#xD;
      affected Cohort 2 will initiate enrollment once all enrolled patients in Cohort 1 have&#xD;
      completed the study and a safety analysis has been reviewed by the Medical Monitor and&#xD;
      approved by the Novum Independent Institutional Review Board (NIIRB). Sites will not begin&#xD;
      enrollment of patients in Cohort 2 until the site is notified by email that the safety&#xD;
      analysis for Cohort 1 has been reviewed and approved. Confirmation of email receipt will be&#xD;
      required from each Investigator before enrollment of Cohort 2 can begin. Each cohort will be&#xD;
      enrolled based on the availability of patients. Each cohort will be reviewed for the&#xD;
      potential of HPA axis suppression. The Medical Monitor or NIIRB may discontinue the study at&#xD;
      any time if safety concerns are found. If 6 or more patients in Cohort 1 experience HPA axis&#xD;
      suppression, then enrollment for Cohort 1 will be stopped. Cohort 2 will not be initiated if&#xD;
      6 or more patients enrolled in Cohort 1 experience HPA axis suppression or 30% or more of the&#xD;
      final enrolled number of patients in Cohort 1 experience HPA axis suppression. If 6 or more&#xD;
      patients in Cohort 2 experience HPA axis suppression, then enrollment for Cohort 2 will be&#xD;
      stopped. If the study is stopped at any time, patients currently enrolled will be contacted&#xD;
      via phone and instructed to discontinue study product immediately. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to return for their next scheduled visit for cortisol response testing. Sites will&#xD;
      follow up with patients and monitor for HPA axis suppression. All patients will be followed&#xD;
      until cortisol levels are normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to apply topical spray twice daily onto the affected skin areas&#xD;
      for 28 days. Patients will be instructed not to rub over the affected area after application&#xD;
      of spray Patients will apply the morning dose of the study product in the clinic at each&#xD;
      clinic visit and at home during non-clinic visits. A phone call will be made approximately 14&#xD;
      days after the patient has completed dosing to follow-up on any new adverse events that may&#xD;
      have occurred&#xD;
