      To Compare Between Radiological Guided Treatment And Arthroscopic Guided Treatment Of&#xD;
      KIENBOCK Disease&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      Kienbock'sdisease is defined as avascular necrosis of the lunate bone, which may ultimately&#xD;
      progress to lunate sclerosis, collapse, and wrist instability. Incidence is highest in males&#xD;
      20-40 years of age, although it may occur in any age group. Kienbock's disease is uncommon in&#xD;
      skeletally immature patients. The cause of Kienbock's disease is likely multi factorial, but&#xD;
      potential risk factors have been identified including variant lunate arterial supply and&#xD;
      ulnar negative variance. In fewer than 20% of patients, the dorsal blood supply is absent and&#xD;
      the lunate is supplied by the palmar radiocarpal arch only; this may represent a risk factor&#xD;
      for Kienbock's disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative ulnar variance may also predispose to Kienbock's disease due to abnormal force&#xD;
      loading on the lunate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kienbock's disease may be staged according to radiologic appearance using Lichtman&#xD;
      classification Stage I is defined as normal radiographic appearance of the lunate with marrow&#xD;
      edema present on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage II disease, there is sclerosis of the lunate, with or without a fracture line, but&#xD;
      without lunate collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage III, defined as presence of lunate articular surface collapse, may be divided further&#xD;
      into three subcategories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage IIIA, there is no scaphoid rotation; in Stage IIIB, there is fixed scaphoid rotatory&#xD;
      subluxation, and in Stage IIIC, a coronal fracture of the lunate is present in addition to&#xD;
      scaphoid rotation. Stage III C in 2010 as an addition to the classification scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage IV disease is present when secondary radiocarpal or midcarpal osteoarthritis is present&#xD;
      in addition to Stage III findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternate classification of Kienbock's disease, the Bain and Begg&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment and management of Kienböck Disease (KD) has always been conundrum. The&#xD;
      Lichtman classification has traditionally been used to guide treatment based on imaging.&#xD;
      Arthroscopy provides a direct visualization of the articular surface,allows probing of the&#xD;
      surfaces, and enables minimally invasive techniques to be performed. The Lichtman-Bain&#xD;
      classification is a new classification that takes into account the osseous, vascular, and&#xD;
      cartilage aspects of the lunate and the secondary effects on the wrist. It identifies the&#xD;
      important prognostic factors including age, the status of the lunate, and the status of the&#xD;
      wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With arthroscopy, the articular surfaces of the lunate can be assessed to better understand&#xD;
      the status of the lunate. The lunate can be defined as intact, compromised,or not&#xD;
      reconstructable. If the lunate is intact then lunate decompression (forage) and arthroscopic&#xD;
      assisted bone grafting can be performed. If the lunate facet and capitate are functional,&#xD;
      then proximal carpectomy can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the wrist includes assessment of the adjacent articular surfaces of the central&#xD;
      column articulations (radiocarpal and midcarpal articulations). Instability of the proximal&#xD;
      carpal row can also be assessed. The radioscaphoid articulation is often preserved except in&#xD;
      late KD, which allows the scaphocapitate fusion to be a good surgical option. This can now be&#xD;
      performed as an arthroscopic procedure. Once the radioscaphoid articulation is degenerate, a&#xD;
      salvage procedure is required Wrist arthroscopy is a commonly used procedure that has&#xD;
      undergone many modifications and improvements since it was first described. The advent of new&#xD;
      portals (both dorsal and volar) means that the wrist joint can be viewed from virtually any&#xD;
      perspective (&quot;box concept&quot;). Indications for wrist arthroscopy have continued to expand and&#xD;
      include diagnostic and reparative procedures and, more recently, reconstructive, soft-tissue,&#xD;
      and bony procedures. Arthroscopic grading of Kienböck's disease better describes articular&#xD;
      damage compared with plain radiographs and can help guide surgical treatment options This&#xD;
      grading system assists in classifying the severity of the disease and better directs the&#xD;
      surgeon toward the reconstructive surgical options grade 0 disorder could be treated with an&#xD;
      extra-articular procedure, such as a joint-leveling procedure or revascularization of the&#xD;
      lunate. Patients with grade 1or 2a can be treated with a radio-scapho-lunate fusion Patients&#xD;
      with grade 1 or 2b can be treated with aproximal-row carpectomy, whereas those with grade 3or&#xD;
      4 require salvage procedures (such as wrist arthrodesis or arthoplasty) Menth-Chiari et al.15&#xD;
      reported on the use of arthroscopic debridement for Kienböck's disease. They&#xD;
      reportedexcellent pain relief and improved range of motion in all grades of patients with up&#xD;
      to 2 years of follow-up.&#xD;
