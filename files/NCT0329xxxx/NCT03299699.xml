  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe hemophilia is a rare and chronic disease characterized by spontaneous bleedings from&#xD;
      early childhood, which may lead to various complications especially in joints. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of this disease, but also its long term care have an impact on the relatives of the affected&#xD;
      persons, including the siblings who bear daily the cognitive, emotional and social impacts of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies conducted in the framework of pediatric chronic diseases showed that siblings of&#xD;
      affected children presented a higher prevalence of physical and psychological troubles&#xD;
      (emotional distress, behavioral disorders, etc.) than siblings who were not concerned by a&#xD;
      disease. Few studies have been conducted in the framework of severe hemophilia, and to our&#xD;
      knowledge, no study addresses this issue in France.&#xD;

      -The assessment of the quality of life would allow assessing both positive and negative&#xD;
      impacts, by exploring in a global manner the children and adolescents functioning in various&#xD;
      domains (physical and psychological well-being, relations with parents and friends, schoolâ€¦).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the specific context of hemophilia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Few studies have been conducted on the experience of severe hemophilia of a young&#xD;
           patient by the siblings, and to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in France&#xD;
           on this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are numerous studies concerning the impact of chronic diseases such as diabetes or&#xD;
           cancer of a child on the siblings, contrary to those concerning rare diseases.&#xD;
           Hemophilia, a frequent disease among rare diseases, might be an interesting model in&#xD;
           order to understand the impact of this type of disorder on the functioning of the&#xD;
           siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrary to insufficiently treated hemophilia potentially leading to disability,&#xD;
           well-treated hemophilia might be considered as an at-risk disorder. In this specific&#xD;
           context, the representation of the disease by the siblings might be singular.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents are the major actors of the surveillance of the affected young patient in the&#xD;
           everyday life. The transfer of parental responsibilities to healthy siblings, and its&#xD;
           impact on the fraternal relationships might therefore be increased. Gender might have a&#xD;
           specific modulating role on these elements (risk of transmission in female and different&#xD;
           representation of the social role).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results presented in the literature are reported from studies whose representativeness&#xD;
           of the study sample (or sample size) is questionable. The cohort of the French National&#xD;
           Network FranceCoag represents at an international level a rare exhaustive population of&#xD;
           persons with severe hemophilia followed over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The main objective of this study is to understand the mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      quality of the siblings' functioning and interactions in the context of severe hemophilia, in&#xD;
      order to be able to propose adapted support modes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary (and operational) objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of the functioning and interactions of the family on the quality of&#xD;
           life (considered as a marker of the global health) reported by the siblings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the quality of life reported by siblings of children and adolescents with&#xD;
           severe hemophilia, with the quality of life of the patients themselves, and with&#xD;
           published reference values (age and gender-matched controls from the general population)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the emotional and social adjustment (behavioral disorders, academic success),&#xD;
           which represents a mediator of the quality of life, among siblings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the moderating effects of gender, age, rank among siblings, time since&#xD;
           diagnosis, quality of social support received, skills acquired to manage emotions, on&#xD;
           quality of life as well as on the emotional and social adjustment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To highlight clusters of siblings with different profiles of quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To propose tools, meetings and training sessions in order to support concerned families&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods This study is complementary to the multicentric, observational,&#xD;
      cross-sectional, TRANSHEMO study. TRANSHEMO focuses on the issues surrounding the transition&#xD;
      into adulthood among young persons with severe hemophilia in France. This study also aims to&#xD;
      identify some of the socio- cognitive, emotional, and familial determinants of a good&#xD;
      transition into adulthood. Perceptions of older children and adolescents (aged 14-17 years&#xD;
      old) with severe hemophilia and those of young adults (aged 20-29 years old) will be&#xD;
      described et compared, regarding their expectations and their feelings about growing into&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study which is also a multicentric, observational, cross-sectional study,&#xD;
      proposes to include the siblings [i.e. brothers, sisters, half-brothers and half-sisters&#xD;
      (aged 8-18 years old)] of the older children and adolescents included in the TRANSHEMO study,&#xD;
      living in the same household. The investigators will ask them to fill-up a booklet with&#xD;
      several questionnaires, focused on quality of life. This study will allow to have preliminary&#xD;
      results in order to extend the project to another age group of children with severe&#xD;
      hemophilia and their siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results This study will allow to comprehend what the impact of the disease on the&#xD;
      siblings could be, which is of particular interest in the global approach whose goal is to&#xD;
      take care of and to support the affected persons and their relatives. The identification of&#xD;
      difficulties among siblings and of their determinants will allow to detect children at risk&#xD;
      of adjustment problem, in order to offer them an adapted support, but also to develop&#xD;
      specific tools to support the families (brochures, meetings, therapeutic education&#xD;
      activities).&#xD;
