  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying the drug Ribociclib (LEE011) in combination with an&#xD;
      immunotherapy drug called PDR001 (a therapy that uses the body's own immune system to control&#xD;
      cancer) as a possible treatment for metastatic hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer (in combination with fulvestrant) or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the medications involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ribociclib (LEE011)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDR001&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fulvestrant&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
           investigational combination of drugs (LEE011 with PDR001), and tries to define the&#xD;
           appropriate dose of the above combination of investigational drugs to use for further&#xD;
           studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved LEE011 as a treatment for&#xD;
           hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA has not approved PDR001 as treatment for any type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA has approved fulvestrant as a treatment for hormone receptor positive metastatic&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When given separately these medications work in different ways to try and stop cancer&#xD;
           cells from growing and spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LEE011 is a drug designed to block certain proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases&#xD;
                (CDKs) that are required for cells to divide. These proteins may also control the&#xD;
                ability of certain cancers to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PDR001 is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins usually produced by the body that&#xD;
                help protect against foreign matter, such as bacteria and viruses. PDR001 blocks a&#xD;
                protein called PD-1 which is present on cells called T-lymphocytes, which are&#xD;
                involved in the immune response. PDR001 is being tested to see if it will allow the&#xD;
                body's immune system to work against tumor cells. Other studies have shown that&#xD;
                blocking PD-1 may result in reduced tumor cell growth in a variety of solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist that is indicated for the treatment&#xD;
                of postmenopausal women with HR+ MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this research study, the investigators are looking for a safe and tolerable dose of&#xD;
           LEE011 that can be given in combination with PDR001 for participants with metastatic&#xD;
           hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer (in combination with&#xD;
           fulvestrant) or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
