  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minority women and women of lower socioeconomic status are at significantly increased risk of&#xD;
      unintended pregnancies, short inter-pregnancy interval, and short duration of breastfeeding.&#xD;
      The consequences of poorly timed pregnancies and short duration of breastfeeding for the&#xD;
      health of mothers, infants and children are well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To decrease rates of poorly timed pregnancies, increase breastfeeding duration and address&#xD;
      other postpartum concerns women must be engaged in their postpartum care outside of the&#xD;
      traditional postpartum visit. In addition to contraceptive counseling and breastfeeding&#xD;
      support, providers discuss a number of important maternal and child health issues at the&#xD;
      postpartum visit. These include (1) screening and referral for postpartum mood disorders (2)&#xD;
      screening for cardiometabolic consequences of pregnancy complications, (3) discussing&#xD;
      inter-conception care and (4) connecting women with a primary care provider. Thus, as&#xD;
      recommended by numerous professional societies, the standard postpartum visit at 4 to 6 weeks&#xD;
      after delivery has considerable value to women's postpartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance rates for the postpartum visit are markedly lower for women with limited resources&#xD;
      contributing to racial and economic health disparities. Despite receiving excellent prenatal&#xD;
      care, only 40% of the economically disadvantaged women who receive prenatal care at the Magee&#xD;
      outpatient clinic return for their postpartum visit. These parallel national trends, where&#xD;
      60% of women with Medicaid insurance return for a postpartum checkup compared with over 82%&#xD;
      of women with private insurance. Medicaid programs serve pregnant women who are particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable to poor health outcomes and thus this gap is critical. Additionally, minority&#xD;
      women disproportionally receive Medicaid and thus interventions that focus on Medicaid&#xD;
      recipients have the potential to address racial as well as economic disparities. These data&#xD;
      demonstrate that the current care model does not engage all women to make good health care&#xD;
      decision postpartum and is disproportionately failing our most vulnerable moms and babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empirically derived concepts from behavioral economics can be leveraged to design&#xD;
      interventions that support participants to make better health decisions and may be&#xD;
      particularly useful for postpartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility trial will focus on four tenants of behavioral economics-bounded rationality&#xD;
      (information overload), status quo bias (lack of self-control), hovering (limited attention),&#xD;
      and framed incentives-- that have been successfully used to tackle stubborn health problems&#xD;
      such as smoking and obesity. Importantly, unlike tobacco cessation or weight loss, many&#xD;
      aspects of postpartum care such as compliance with the visit or uptake of LARC, do not&#xD;
      require on-going action on part of the patient and thus may be particularly amenable to the&#xD;
      lessons of behavioral economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To conduct a pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      future randomized trial to determine the efficacy of Healthy Beyond Pregnancy on adherence&#xD;
      with the postpartum visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of Healthy Beyond Pregnancy on adherence with the&#xD;
      postpartum visit.&#xD;
