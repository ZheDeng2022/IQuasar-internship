  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients that develop blood clots are treated with low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      injections (LMWH). One kind of these LMWHs, dalteparin, has its dose determined based on a&#xD;
      patient's weight using a formula of 200 international units (IU) per kilogram (kg). The&#xD;
      current dosing of dalteparin approved by Health Canada has a maximum daily dose of 18 000&#xD;
      IU/day which is weight-adjusted for patients up to 90 kg. Any patient weighing more than 90&#xD;
      kg would take the same dosage regardless of their weight. The aim of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the safety of using weight-adjusted dalteparin in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      patients that weigh more than 90 kg.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study is designed as a multicentre prospective cohort study with multiple Canadian sites.&#xD;
      It will be initiated at The Ottawa Hospital prior to being offered externally. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, and confirming eligibility, participants weighing more than 90 kg&#xD;
      with acute cancer-associated thrombosis will be treated with therapeutic weight-adjusted&#xD;
      dalteparin (subcutaneous once daily injection, or twice daily, if the conditions of the&#xD;
      participant do not allow once daily injection as per clinical judgement) beginning at&#xD;
      enrolment (within 12 hours) and continuing until Day 30 visit. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      therapeutic doses of dalteparin at a dose of approximately 200 IU/kg SC daily (up to 33,000&#xD;
      IU) for one month. Following this study period of 30 days (± 4 days), patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 5 months. During the follow-up period, each patient will pursue his/her&#xD;
      treatment as per usual standard treatment protocols provided at each institution. Treatment&#xD;
      used and clinical outcomes will be collected at the end of the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of Canadian Thrombosis specialists use weight adjusted dosing of dalteparin in&#xD;
      patients weighing more than 90 kg with cancer-associated VTE. No expert recommends capping&#xD;
      the dose of dalteparin to 18,000 IU in patients weighing over 90 kg as suggested by the&#xD;
      product monograph. However, the risk of major bleeding episodes in patients over 90 kg&#xD;
      receiving weight-adjusted LMWH remains unclear. The estimated rate of major bleeding episodes&#xD;
      of patients with cancer associated VTE (Mean weight 79.1 kg) managed with therapeutic dose of&#xD;
      dalteparin is 3.6% (95% CI: 1.9 to 6.2). We hypothesize that the rate of major bleeding&#xD;
      events will be similar in patients (&gt; 90 kg) with cancer-associated VTE treated with&#xD;
      dalteparin 200 IU/kg daily (up to 33,000 IU). We plan to recruit 150 patients in this cohort&#xD;
      study. We expect 6 major bleeding events. This would provide us with an overall bleeding&#xD;
      event of 4% with an upper bound of the confidence interval of 8.5%). An informal survey of&#xD;
      Canadian thrombosis expert has demonstrated that clinicians would feel reassured and continue&#xD;
      to use weight-adjusted dalteparin in cancer patients weighing more than 90kg if the upper&#xD;
      bound of the 95% confidence interval is less than 9% (i.e. &lt; 3% possible absolute rate&#xD;
      difference).&#xD;
