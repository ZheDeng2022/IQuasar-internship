      This project aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      investigating point of care ultrasound guided resuscitation compared with usual care in the&#xD;
      management of shock at the Critical Care Trauma Centre (CCTC) in London Health Science Centre&#xD;
      (LHSC).&#xD;
