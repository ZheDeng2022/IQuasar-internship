      Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in adverse soft tissue body composition changes and&#xD;
      an extremely sedentary lifestyle. These abrupt changes often lead to a high prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases, such as impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, conditions which predispose those with SCI to an increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease compared to the general population. Due to paralysis and wheel chair&#xD;
      dependence, maintaining an adequate level of physical activity to counteract these&#xD;
      deleterious metabolic changes presents a unique obstacle because conventional first line&#xD;
      interventions are lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet and exercise), which may be difficult&#xD;
      to achieve. Recently, a new medication has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      to improve glycemic control in individuals with diabetes mellitus, and it has also been&#xD;
      investigated as an off-label treatment to induce weight loss. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)&#xD;
      agonists are a class of drugs designed to mimic the endogenous incretin hormones released&#xD;
      from the gut in a glucose dependent manner following a meal. The mechanisms of action for&#xD;
      this drug class of medications include stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion,&#xD;
      inhibiting glucagon release, slowed gastric emptying, and reduction of postprandial glucose&#xD;
      excursions following food intake. In addition to improved glycemic control, this class of&#xD;
      medications also shows promise for its non-glycemic action of facilitating weight loss. The&#xD;
      method of delivery of the GLP-1's is by self-administered injections once daily or once&#xD;
      weekly, depending on the severity of the clinical case and therapeutic targets for a specific&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is an underlying condition that predisposes to the development of several medical&#xD;
      disorders and diseases. It is well appreciated that obesity has reached pandemic proportions&#xD;
      in Western societies. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.9 billion adults&#xD;
      worldwide are overweight and 600 million of these individuals are further sub-classified as&#xD;
      obese, with a 44% estimated burden for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) being attributed to&#xD;
      being overweight/obese, as well as a 23% estimated burden for heart disease (&quot;Obesity and&#xD;
      overweight,&quot; 2016). Excess adipose tissue is assumed to play an integral role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction and the development of T2DM (Lau, Dhillon, Yan, Szmitko,&#xD;
      &amp; Verma, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the acute and chronic phases of SCI, marked adverse changes occur in soft tissue body&#xD;
      composition and associated carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. After an initial rapid loss of&#xD;
      lean tissue below the neurological level of injury, a more insidious and progressive lean&#xD;
      tissue loss is observed (Modlesky et al., 2004; Spungen et al., 2003), which is accompanied&#xD;
      by an increased total body adiposity (Spungen et al., 2003), with accumulation of fat in the&#xD;
      abdominal (e.g., visceral) compartment (Gorgey, Mather, Poarch, &amp; Gater, 2011). These adverse&#xD;
      changes to body composition contribute to, and are associated with, a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      insulin resistance and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., impaired glucose tolerance&#xD;
      and T2DM) than that reported in the general population (Bauman &amp; Spungen, 1994). The primary&#xD;
      approach to treat T2DM in the general population is diet and exercise (i.e., lifestyle&#xD;
      modification). Of note, the profound inactivity and adverse soft tissue body composition&#xD;
      changes that occur in individuals after SCI result in metabolic morbidity which is extremely&#xD;
      difficult to manage with lifestyle modification alone. Conventional therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      employed in the adjunctive treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders in the general&#xD;
      population include several pharmacological approaches to maintain and improve glycemic&#xD;
      control are in standard practice and include reducing the serum glucose concentration (i.e.,&#xD;
      insulin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones or glitazones), suppressing hepatic&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis (i.e., insulin, biguanides), stimulating endogenous insulin secretion (i.e.,&#xD;
      sulphonylureas), and/or by inhibiting glucose renal reabsorption and increasing glycosuria&#xD;
      (i.e., SGLT-2 inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005 a new class of drugs was approved for the treatment for T2DM by targeting the GLP-1&#xD;
      receptor. Exenatide is a GLP-1 agonist that acts as an incretin hormone, and it belongs to a&#xD;
      class of gastrointestinal hormones which are released from the L cells of the intestines in&#xD;
      response to food ingestion that, as one of its mechanisms of action, increase insulin&#xD;
      secretion from pancreatic beta cells (Vilsboll et al., 2003). This phenomenon that was coined&#xD;
      &quot;the incretin effect&quot; in the 1960's described the significantly higher plasma insulin levels&#xD;
      following orally versus intravenously administered glucose, which can account for 50 to 70%&#xD;
      of the insulin secretion observed after food intake (Baggio &amp; Drucker, 2007). Treatment with&#xD;
      GLP-1's has increased over the past several years because of their mechanism of action to&#xD;
      increase insulin secretion, inhibit glucagon release in a glucose-dependent manner, thus&#xD;
      minimizing the risk for hypoglycemia (Baggio &amp; Drucker, 2007; Nauck, Stockmann, Ebert, &amp;&#xD;
      Creutzfeldt, 1986; Vilsboll, Krarup, Madsbad, &amp; Holst, 2002). Numerous multi-ethnic and&#xD;
      multi-national trials have been performed with exenatide, but none have been reported in&#xD;
      persons with SCI. Previous investigation with exenatide once-weekly in able-bodied&#xD;
      individuals has resulted in weight loss ranging from 1.6 to 3.9 kg following 24 weeks of&#xD;
      intervention (Bergenstal et al., 2010; Blevins et al., 2011; Buse et al., 2013; Chiquette,&#xD;
      Toth, Ramirez, Cobble, &amp; Chilton, 2012; Davies et al., 2013; Diamant et al., 2010; Drucker et&#xD;
      al., 2008; Inagaki, Atsumi, Oura, Saito, &amp; Imaoka, 2012; Ji et al., 2013; Russell-Jones et&#xD;
      al., 2012). As such, to date there is no evidence of the potential efficacy of exenatide to&#xD;
      result in weight loss, improve glycemic control, and/or reduce insulin resistance in persons&#xD;
      with SCI.&#xD;
