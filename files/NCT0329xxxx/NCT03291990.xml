      This investigation is not only to develop an improved radiation/temozolomide approach, but&#xD;
      also develop a regimen with potential to form the basis of better combined therapy with&#xD;
      immune based treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma has a poor prognosis with median survival is 14-16 months for patients enrolling&#xD;
      in clinical trials, and across the United States one year survival is reported in the&#xD;
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to be only 35%. Radiation&#xD;
      treatment related lymphopenia has been associated with poor tumor outcome in Glioblastoma and&#xD;
      a variety of other tumor types. As this lymphopenias is prolonged, it may also reduce&#xD;
      efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor lymphocyte mediated immune therapies now approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for an increasing number of indications. Modeling and clinical studies suggest that&#xD;
      administering radiation over 5 or fewer days (rather than standard 30 days of treatment) may&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of lymphopenia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have confirmed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximum postoperative dimension of cavity plus residual contrast enhancing tumor of &lt;&#xD;
             * If a patient is found on the radiation planning scan to have a tumor target larger&#xD;
             than this size, the patient will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be selected for standard temozolomide chemotherapy to be administered&#xD;
             with radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient agrees to have 10 week follow-up visit at a participating Johns Hopkins&#xD;
             facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient agrees to allow access to or provide clinical, imaging, and laboratory&#xD;
             follow-up information for three years whether or not obtained from Johns Hopkins&#xD;
             providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
