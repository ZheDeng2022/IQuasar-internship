  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: A detailed study of the biomechanical changes before and after abdominal wall&#xD;
      reconstruction (AWR) has not been performed. Changes in abdominal wall tension and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure have physiological consequences on respiratory and cardiology&#xD;
      function. AWR surgeons currently do not know if they are applying too much tension when&#xD;
      re-aligning the abdominal wall muscles during AWR. Too much tension is likely to cause&#xD;
      respiratory and cardiac post-operative complications. The investigators propose to study the&#xD;
      perioperative changes in abdominal biomechanics and cardiorespiratory physiology after AWR.&#xD;
      In addition, investigators will also analyze the pre-operative patient CT scan to see if&#xD;
      there any CT predictors of post-operative cardiorespiratory complications and hernia&#xD;
      recurrence. The researchers hypothesize that there is a threshold value or force at which&#xD;
      ventral hernias are repaired 'too tight' subjecting the patient to the increased risk of&#xD;
      recurrence and cardiorespiratory complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: An in depth biomechanical and physiological study of 18-22 participants with midline&#xD;
      ventral hernias will be carried out. Ventral hernias at least 5cm in width and only those in&#xD;
      which primary fascial closure have been achieved will be included. Any operative technique&#xD;
      used to achieve primary fascial closure will be included. Biomechanical and physiological&#xD;
      measurements will be taken at five separate stages during the course of the patients'&#xD;
      abdominal wall reconstruction. The final lung function tests, taken six weeks post op, will&#xD;
      be compared to the patients' pre-operative tests. Meticulous attention will be paid to the&#xD;
      study protocol making sure that in each patient the measurements are all taken at the same&#xD;
      time and under the same conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This full biomechanical and physiological work up will enable AWR surgeons to&#xD;
      assess when an AWR patient is subjected to too much biomechanical and physiological stress.&#xD;
      The abdominal wall tension and strain will be measured to see if this predicts post&#xD;
      complications and hernia recurrence.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with midline hernia defects. Only patients with one or more midline defect&#xD;
             will be included. For our study, we will define a midline hernia as herniation through&#xD;
             the linea alba and with the rectus muscles falling either side of the hernia. The&#xD;
             pre-operative CT scan will be used to study the hernia morphology and to see whether&#xD;
             the patient fulfills these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing primary or incisional ventral hernia repair, without formation of&#xD;
             or closure of a stoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with either a maximal ventral hernia axial width of greater than 5cm or a&#xD;
             loss of domain of greater then 20%, as measured on their pre-operative CT or MRI scan.&#xD;
             The loss of domain will be measured using the patients' preoperative CT or MRI scan&#xD;
             following the method of Tanaka et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Midline hernias closed in the midline with primary fascial closure with or without&#xD;
             mesh augmentation. Any reconstruction technique can be used (e.g. anterior or&#xD;
             posterior component separation) as long as primary fascial closure is achieved. The&#xD;
             mesh may be placed in either the retro-rectus position (with or without a transverse&#xD;
             abdominis release) or the onlay position.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a synthetic or bio-synthetic mesh implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Midline ventral hernias of VHWG grade 2 or 3. Clean and or Clean-contaminated wound&#xD;
             classification.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the relevance of the study, voluntarily agrees to take part and has duly signed the&#xD;
             consent form.&#xD;

             wound classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant procedures such as bowel resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The hernia requires a bridged repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with co-morbid respiratory disease requiring oral corticosteroids or home&#xD;
             oxygen therapy.&#xD;
