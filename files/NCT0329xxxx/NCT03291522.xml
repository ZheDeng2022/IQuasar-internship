  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to use ultrasound-guided rete testis flushing and aspiration&#xD;
      technique to retrieve sperm, non-surgically, from the testes of azoospermic men. If sperm are&#xD;
      retrieved by this method, it will provide a direct benefit to the infertile men. This&#xD;
      protocol will also establish the safety and feasibility of the ultrasound-guided rete testis&#xD;
      injection approach in consenting men before the approach is translated to teenage boys.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that ultrasound-guided rete testis aspiration is a&#xD;
      safe and effective method to flush and aspirate rare sperm from the testes of men with&#xD;
      azoospermia (no sperm in the ejaculate). Current methods to recover sperm from men with&#xD;
      azoospermia range from invasive and time consuming micro testicular sperm extraction&#xD;
      (microTESE) to fine needle aspiration (FNA), which is less invasive and less time consuming,&#xD;
      but also less effective because it is a blind approach. This approach is less invasive; it&#xD;
      involves the percutaneous insertion of a hypodermic needle into the rete testis space. This&#xD;
      approach is also not blind because the needle is accurately positioned under ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules (where&#xD;
      sperm are made). The investigators will first perform the experimental ultrasound-guided rete&#xD;
      testis flushing and aspiration on both testis. If sperm is found, no standard of care&#xD;
      procedure (TESE, microTESE etc) will be performed. If sperm is not found, the participant can&#xD;
      choose whether or not to proceed with a standard of care procedure. In cases were&#xD;
      participants have previously tried a standard of care procedure, they may not want to do that&#xD;
      again if the experimental procedure does not work. For the ultrasound-guided rete testis&#xD;
      flushing and aspiration, the investigators will flush and aspirate the tubules with 500ul of&#xD;
      physiological saline and Optison ultrasound contrast agent in sterile 0.9% saline (routinely&#xD;
      used in clinics). Presence of sperm in the aspirate will be determined. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that sperm recovery using the ultrasound-guided rete testis injection/aspiration&#xD;
      approach will at least as effective as the standard of care approach employed in the Magee&#xD;
      male fertility clinic and it will be less invasive.&#xD;
