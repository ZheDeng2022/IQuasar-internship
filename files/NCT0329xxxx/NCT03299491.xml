  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ethiopia has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality among all countries in Africa and&#xD;
      indeed worldwide, with a maternal mortality ratio of 676 per 100,000 live births in 2011&#xD;
      (UNFPA, 2012). The majority of maternal deaths are preventable through early detection and&#xD;
      management of complications, and access to adequate obstetric care (Say et al, 2014).&#xD;
      However, in 2011 only 34% of women received antenatal care, 10% of births were delivered at a&#xD;
      health facility and 7% of women received postnatal care during the first two days after&#xD;
      delivery (Ethiopian DHS, 2011). Large distances and poor access to transport are two major&#xD;
      obstacles that women face when trying to access services. In order to facilitate timely&#xD;
      access to obstetric care, the Ethiopian Government introduced Maternity Waiting Areas (MWAs)&#xD;
      at health centres to enable women to stay close to health facilities as they await delivery.&#xD;
      Utilization of MWAs has generally been low due to the poor state of the homes and lack of&#xD;
      adequate community support. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      interventions to promote safe motherhood in increasing coverage of maternal health care&#xD;
      services: (i) upgraded MWAs (ii) community and religious leader sensitization using&#xD;
      information, education and communication (IEC) materials. The IEC materials are expected to&#xD;
      increase leader awareness and support of antenatal care, facility deliveries, postnatal care&#xD;
      and MWA use. Together with increased use of functional MWAs, improved support from leaders is&#xD;
      expected to increase the proportion of facility-based births in interventions area. The&#xD;
      interventions are also expected to positively impact antenatal care and postnatal care use in&#xD;
      the study districts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A three-arm cluster trial design will be used to measure the impact of the intervention&#xD;
      packages in three districts (Gomma, Seka Chekorsa, Kersa) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia.&#xD;
      Twenty-four clusters with 160 individuals each are required to detect a 17% change in the&#xD;
      primary outcome (proportion of facility-based births) with 80% power,assuming a cluster&#xD;
      autocorrelation of 0.8 and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1. Primary health&#xD;
      care units (PHCU) which consist of a health centre and several community-based health posts&#xD;
      will serve as trial clusters. All PHCUs with maternity waiting areas (MWAs) constructed will&#xD;
      be eligible for selection. Eligible women will be randomly selected from PHCU catchment areas&#xD;
      stratified by MWA functionality and health centre basic emergency obstetric care (BEmOC)&#xD;
      capacity. This is to ensure balanced distribution of poorly functioning MWAs and facilities&#xD;
      with diminished BEmOC capacity between trial arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional household surveys will be conducted with eligible women to collect&#xD;
      information on socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding maternal&#xD;
      health services, reproductive history and maternal health service utilization. Surveys will&#xD;
      be administered by trained interviewers on tablet computers programmed using Open Data Kit at&#xD;
      baseline prior to intervention roll out and at endline. Multilevel regression models will be&#xD;
      used to quantify the effect of the intervention packages on outcomes of interest. Random&#xD;
      effect terms for PHCUs will be included to account for the clustered nature of the data.&#xD;
