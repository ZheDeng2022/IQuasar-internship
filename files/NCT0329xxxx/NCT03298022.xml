  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab (AbGn-168H) administered intravenously in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis who are refractory or intolerant&#xD;
      to anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α and/or anti-integrin treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label, single arm, multiple dose proof of principle study to test&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab in patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and who has failed or are intolerant to anti-TNFα and/or anti-integrin therapy. A&#xD;
      minimum of 30 patients and a maximum of 40 will be recruited in 1 dosing group. For efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation, the primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with clinical response,&#xD;
      defined as ≥ 3- point reduction in MCS, a 30% or greater decrease from the baseline score,&#xD;
      and with a 1-point or greater decrease of the rectal bleeding subscore or an absolute rectal&#xD;
      bleeding score of 0 or 1 at Week 12. Safety assessments will consist of evaluating physical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation), safety laboratory tests, adverse events and tolerability.&#xD;
