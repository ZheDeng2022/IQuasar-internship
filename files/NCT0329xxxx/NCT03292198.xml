      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effectiveness of 2 treatment protocols for patients with breast&#xD;
           cancer-related subclinical lymphedema identified through bioimpedance spectroscopy,&#xD;
           L-dex scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the necessary duration of intervention to reverse L-dex scores back to a&#xD;
           normal range in patients with breast cancer-related subclinical lymphedema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the time elapsed post-surgically to the development of subclinical&#xD;
           lymphedema identified by bioimpedance spectroscopy, L-dex scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify risk factors for the development of subclinical lymphedema in patients with&#xD;
           breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors associated with the progression to clinical lymphedema following&#xD;
           treatment of subclinical lymphedema as identified by bioimpedance spectroscopy, L-dex&#xD;
           scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with breast cancer diagnoses and planned axillary lymph node procedures will receive&#xD;
      pre-operative screening of arm volume with bioimpedance, which will capture baseline&#xD;
      measurements. Then, subjects will undergo periodic screenings for the first 3 years following&#xD;
      surgery. If a significant change in volume compared to baseline is detected with&#xD;
      bioimpedance, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. The outcomes of 2&#xD;
      treatment protocols will be compared. Additionally, subjects will be screened each week&#xD;
      during their treatment interventions to determine the necessary quantity of intervention&#xD;
      before L-dex scores normalize.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial tissues resulting from an&#xD;
      impairment of the normal lymphatic drainage of the affected region. Lymphedema is often a&#xD;
      side effect of breast cancer treatments such as axillary lymph node surgery and radiation, as&#xD;
      these procedures are damaging to the lymphatic structures. Due to poor awareness of the&#xD;
      condition, minimal education is given to patients about their risk for lymphedema as a result&#xD;
      of cancer treatments. With inconsistent diagnostic methods, many cases of breast&#xD;
      cancer-related lymphedema are diagnosed after the condition has progressed to its&#xD;
      irreversible and chronic form, i.e. clinical lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) uses a low frequency electrical current to assess&#xD;
      extracellular fluid of the limbs. BIS has proven to be a sensitive and specific tool for&#xD;
      detecting subclinical lymphedema (Stage 0) and has been validated in its use within a&#xD;
      surveillance model. Recent literature supports the use of a surveillance model to identify&#xD;
      breast cancer-related subclinical lymphedema to allow for early intervention and improved&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of early identification of&#xD;
      lymphedema in the subclinical stage, there is limited evidence to guide treatment of this&#xD;
      patient population. Treatment parameters for subclinical lymphedema stem primarily from a&#xD;
      study by Stout et al. indicating that a short compression trial (mean duration of 4.4 weeks)&#xD;
      of 20-30 mmHg garments effectively treated subclinical lymphedema identified by perometry by&#xD;
      preventing progression to late-stage lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance of arm volume will be performed using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) testing&#xD;
      with the ImpedimedÂ® L-dex U400. Subjects will receive BIS testing (1) pre-operatively, (2)&#xD;
      post-operatively at 6 weeks, (3) 3 months, (4) 6 months, (5) 12 months, (6) 18 months, (7) 24&#xD;
      months, and (8) 36 months. The outcome measure will be the L-dex score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only subjects who have an abnormal result will be enrolled in the experimental portion of the&#xD;
      study. If an L-dex score is abnormal (defined by a change of +7 units from her pre-operative&#xD;
      baseline), the subject is determined to exhibit subclinical lymphedema. As a result, these&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into one of two intervention groups. The group receiving only&#xD;
      compression intervention will be referred to as the compression group (CG). The group&#xD;
      receiving Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) and compression will be referred to as the therapy&#xD;
      group (TG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed through screenings for a maximum of 3 years post-surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that this study will take the next step in the surveillance model by&#xD;
      answering questions about how patients with subclinical lymphedema should be clinically&#xD;
      managed.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects in the Compression Group will wear 20-30 mmHg sleeves and gauntlets daily for a maximum of 4 weeks. L-dex will be performed at the end of each week. If the L-dex score has reversed back into normal range, intervention (garment wearing) will be discontinued and the subject will resume the surveillance schedule of screenings. If the L-dex score is still abnormal, garment wearing continues. If L-dex score is abnormal even at the end of the 4 weeks, the subject will be removed from the study and referred to standard lymphedema therapy.&#xD;
An abnormal L-dex is defined by 7 or more units change compared to the subject's pre-surgical baseline.</description>

    <description>Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) is a gentle skin-stretch massage that stimulates the lymphatic system and assists in creating collateral drainage pathways out of non-intact (damaged) lymphatic territories. MLD is a critical part of Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT), which is accepted as the international standard of care in the treatment of lymphedema.&#xD;
The MLD sessions will be performed by 2 Certified Lymphedema Therapists, Megan Klote and Sarah Stolker, both trained through the Norton School of Lymphatic Therapy. The therapists have completed reliability meetings regarding MLD sequencing and techniques.</description>
