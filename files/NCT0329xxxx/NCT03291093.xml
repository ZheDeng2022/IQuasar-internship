  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Amyloid beta (Ab) is mainly known for its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#xD;
      pathology. However, Ab seems not only to be involved in AD pathology, but also in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, which might explain the remarkable similarities in risk factors between&#xD;
      these two pathologies. In vitro studies suggest that a major part of this association is&#xD;
      based on the ability of amyloid to lead to macrophage activation and thus inflammation. These&#xD;
      data lead to the hypothesis that Ab is associated with plaque vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-Flutemetamol is a PET tracer with high affinity for Ab. This has been extensively studied&#xD;
      in AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To validate 18F-Flutemetamol PET in the evaluation of plaque vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cross-sectional validation study. Study population: 25 adults, who have&#xD;
      recently (&lt;14days) experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke with a carotid&#xD;
      artery plaque of â‰¥30% and without evidence of another etiology than carotid atherosclerosis&#xD;
      (i.e. cardiac or small vessel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of these 25 patients, 10 patients will be included who have been scheduled for carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy (CEA). The other 15 will be selected of patients who are not scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients will undergo a PET/MRI scan with 18F-Flutemetamol, either before&#xD;
      the scheduled CEA or within the first 30 days following the cerebrovascular event. Imaging&#xD;
      will include the carotid and coronary arteries as well as the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Tracer uptake in the carotid artery will be correlated to&#xD;
      vulnerable plaque characteristics as assessed by MRI. In the 10 CEA patients, tracer uptake&#xD;
      and MR imaging of different plaque characteristics will be validated with plaque histology of&#xD;
      the surgically removed specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: There is no additional benefit for study subjects. Study subjects will receive&#xD;
      the same treatment as non-participating patients. Patients will be screened for in- and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria to minimize risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For optimal MR imaging patients will be injected with a Gadolinium based contrast agent,&#xD;
      which is a common procedure and associated with very low risk of complications. The PET&#xD;
      tracer 18F-flutemetamol has been studied extensively and is currently used in patients with&#xD;
      AD. Adverse events were not frequent and mainly mild. The radioactivity dose will be around&#xD;
      6.8 mSv.&#xD;
