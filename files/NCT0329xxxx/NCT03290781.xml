    <measure>Number of Participants With Remission at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Remission is defined as a composite score of patient reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy as follows: stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from induction baseline; and rectal bleeding subscore of 0; and endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). The Mayo score is a measure of UC disease activity. It ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The subscores are Stool frequency (0-3); Rectal bleeding (0-3); Findings of endoscopy (0-3); Physician global assessment (PGA, 0-3). The composite score is a recommended measure consisting of the Mayo score without the PGA subscore and ranges from 0 to 9 points.</description>
