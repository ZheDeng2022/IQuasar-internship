    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label study of immune checkpoints inhibitors Nivolumab+Ipilimumab&#xD;
      administered in combination with the anti-TNF-α either Infliximab or Certolizumab, in&#xD;
      patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 consecutive parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 with 2 parallel cohorts (Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination with&#xD;
           anti-TNF-α Certolizumab (Cohort 1) and Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination&#xD;
           with anti-TNF-α Infliximab (Cohort 2)). 6 patients will be included in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 (expansion phase) will then be scheduled after the most promising combination has&#xD;
           been confirmed; the choice of the combination will be based on safety, efficacy, and PD&#xD;
           data observed in both cohorts during the Part 1 of the study.&#xD;
