    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trifluridine/tipiracil&#xD;
      hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 (TAS-102) when given together with radiation therapy&#xD;
      in treating patients with rectal cancer that has come back, spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body, or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as TAS-102, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving TAS-102 with radiation therapy may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of TAS-102 when&#xD;
      administered in combination with concurrent radiation therapy in patients with locally&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy&#xD;
      in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic rectal cancer who receive concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the overall survival (OS) in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      rectal cancer who receive combined TAS-102 and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine quality of life (QoL) among patients with locally recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      rectal cancer who receive concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the number of patients who are able to undergo surgical resection following&#xD;
      concurrent treatment with TAS-102 and radiation therapy. Of this subset of patients, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess rates of pathologic complete response (pCR), tumor regression grade&#xD;
      (TRG) and rates of R0 resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination&#xD;
      agent TAS-102.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO)&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) and undergo radiation therapy in 10 fractions on days 1-5 and 8-12 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, and at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
