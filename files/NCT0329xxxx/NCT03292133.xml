    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGF816&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gefitinib&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease or patient population. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug or drugs are&#xD;
      being studied and have not been approved together for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved gefitinib as a treatment option&#xD;
      for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved EGF816 as a treatment for any disease at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of the study drugs EGF816 and gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both EGF816 and gefitinib are inhibitors which target a specific mutation in cancer and may&#xD;
      stop tumors growing and multiplying.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants that achieve either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). Response is evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
All CRs and PRs must be confirmed by a second assessment not earlier than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a pathologically-confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have advanced disease - either stage IV disease, stage IIIB disease&#xD;
             not amenable to definitive multi-modality therapy, or recurrent disease after a prior&#xD;
             diagnosis of stage I-III disease. All staging is via the American Joint Committee on&#xD;
             Cancer (AJCC)/IASLC 7th edition proposed staging criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An EGFR sensitizing mutation must be detected in tumor tissue. Specifically, patients&#xD;
             harboring the most common mutations, deletions in exon 19 or the L858R mutation in&#xD;
             exon 21 are eligible. Other EGFR sensitizing mutations may be eligible after&#xD;
             discussion with the principal investigator. Patients may be enrolled in the study&#xD;
             based on an activating EGFR mutation detected by a CLIA-certified tissue or&#xD;
             plasma-based assay, but will be required to undergo a mandatory tumor biopsy during&#xD;
             study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, per RECIST 1.1. See Section 11 for the&#xD;
             evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in the six patient safety run-in cohort may have had a prior EGFR TKI in the&#xD;
             metastatic setting (to allow for patients who started initial therapy at an outside&#xD;
             hospital), but treatment duration must have been less than three months. After the&#xD;
             initial six-patient safety run-in, no prior EGFR TKI therapy in the metastatic setting&#xD;
             is allowed. An EGFR TKI given in the adjuvant setting (i.e. with no measurable disease&#xD;
             at the time of administration) is allowable provided the subject has been off of EGFR&#xD;
             TKI therapy for at least six months at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had no more than one prior line of chemotherapy or immunotherapy in&#xD;
             the metastatic setting. At least 14 days must have elapsed from the last&#xD;
             chemo/immunotherapy administration until the start of protocol treatment, and patients&#xD;
             must have recovered from the side effects of any of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be screened for HBV. Patients who are either HBsAg positive or HBV-DNA&#xD;
             positive must be willing and able to take antiviral therapy 1-2 weeks prior to 1st&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and continue on antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks after&#xD;
             the last dose of EGF816. Additional management of the patients would be provided by a&#xD;
             physician with expertise in management of HBV, if needed. Patients must have negative&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab) or positive HCV-Ab but undetectable level of HCV-RNA.&#xD;
             Note: patients with detectable HCV-RNA are not eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must receive insurance approval for or be willing to pay for commercial&#xD;
             gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  *For patients with Gilbert's syndrome total bilirubin &gt;3.0 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3 × institutional upper limit of normal; for patients with&#xD;
                  known hepatic metastases AST and/or ALT &gt; 5x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of EGF816 and gefitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use highly&#xD;
             effective contraception during the study and for 3 months after stopping the study&#xD;
             treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptom thermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male Partner: male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For&#xD;
                  female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole&#xD;
                  partner for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other&#xD;
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%),&#xD;
                  for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  B. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  C. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  D. In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 30 days before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal&#xD;
                  ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active males must agree to use a condom during intercourse while taking&#xD;
                  drug and for 3 months after stopping treatment; men should not father a child in&#xD;
                  this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
                  prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with clinically active or symptomatic interstitial lung disease or&#xD;
             interstitial pneumonitis (i.e., affecting activities of daily living or requiring&#xD;
             therapeutic intervention) and patients with history of clinically significant&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease or radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
             Patients may be on a stable dose of corticosteroids to control brain metastases if&#xD;
             they have been on a stable dose for two weeks prior to study treatment and are&#xD;
             clinically asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had radiation to the lung fields within four weeks of starting&#xD;
             treatment. For patients receiving palliative radiation to thoracic vertebrae, ribs or&#xD;
             other sites where the radiation field includes the lungs, radiation must be completed&#xD;
             at least two weeks before starting treatment. For all palliative radiation to all&#xD;
             other sites, at least 7 days must have elapsed prior to starting to treatment. At&#xD;
             least six months must have elapsed from radiation given with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or&#xD;
             intra-pelvic) within 2 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered&#xD;
             from side effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and&#xD;
             mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and patients can be enrolled in&#xD;
             the study ≥1 week after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable or unwilling to undergo a biopsy for research during the screening&#xD;
             period, 2-3 weeks into the course of therapy and at the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a second, clinically active, cancer. Patients with second cancers which&#xD;
             have been treated with curative intent and/or are currently inactive are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone a bone marrow or solid organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity (HIV testing is not&#xD;
             mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients previously&#xD;
             treated with investigational agents must complete a washout period of at least one&#xD;
             week or five half-lives, whichever is longer, before starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive agents or chronic corticosteroid use,&#xD;
             except those on steroid to control brain metastases, those on topical or inhaled&#xD;
             steroids, or steroids given via local injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina within 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening&#xD;

                  Association functional classification III-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension defined as a Systolic Blood Pressure&#xD;
                  (SBP) ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mm Hg, with or&#xD;
                  without anti-hypertensive medication. Initiation or adjustment of&#xD;
                  antihypertensive medication(s) is allowed prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias not controlled with medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with corrected QT (QTc) ≥450 ms (male patients) or ≥460 ms (female&#xD;
                  patients) using Fridericia correction (QTcF) on the screening ECG (using&#xD;
                  triplicate ECGs)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with history of congenital long QT syndrome or history of torsade de&#xD;
                  pointes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to EGF816 or gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to swallow tablets or capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of EGF816 and&#xD;
             gefitinib on a developing fetus are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             EGF816 or gefitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with EGF816 and gefitinib&#xD;
