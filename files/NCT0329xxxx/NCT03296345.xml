  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) in sickle cell disease (SCD) are primarily managed with&#xD;
      opioids. Tolerance and hyperalgesia to opioids develops due to N-methyl-D-aspartate&#xD;
      (NMDA)-receptor mediated activation of the nociceptive system, and as a receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      ketamine mitigates this. Intravenous (IV) ketamine has demonstrated efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      post-operative, chronic, and cancer-related pain in pediatrics, as well as in reducing time&#xD;
      to pain control in the emergency department (ED) in adults. Limited studies suggest efficacy&#xD;
      in adult opioid-refractory SCD patients. This study is investigating the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of adjuvant low-dose IV ketamine bolus for pediatric SCD VOE in the ED, as well&#xD;
      as its efficacy in improving pain control and reducing hospitalization.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, all consenting pediatric sickle-cell patients between 10 and 25 years&#xD;
      old who were cared for at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (UCSFBCHO) presenting to&#xD;
      the emergency department for VOC were enrolled in the study. Patients were compared to&#xD;
      themselves in a time series, pre and post exposure to the study intervention (low-dose&#xD;
      ketamine bolus at 0.2 mg/kg x 1 prior to second dose of IV opiate). The pediatric FACES pain&#xD;
      scale was used to measure pain scales at pre-designated time points in the ED per standard&#xD;
      nursing protocol (FACES for younger kids, visual analog scale in adolescents/young adults).&#xD;
      Opiate usage was summed in the ED, converted to mg/kg/hour of morphine equivalents (since&#xD;
      different opioids agents were given to different patients based on individual historical&#xD;
      efficacy, and since length of stay in the emergency room could affect total morphine&#xD;
      equivalents received), and compared between the pre and post-intervention groups. In&#xD;
      addition, length of stay, time to 50% pain control, presentation and discharge pain scores,&#xD;
      and likelihood of discharge from the ED were compared. Data was be collected via chart review&#xD;
      in the UCSFBCHO system by study investigators. Pre-intervention data from the past three&#xD;
      patient encounters (e.g., the mean of the mg/kg/hour of morphine equivalents used in the last&#xD;
      three patient encounters prior to receipt of ketamine) was compared to the post intervention&#xD;
      data. In addition, a survey, which is attached, was given to patients/families at the time of&#xD;
      the drug administration to attempt to discern if patients subjectively experienced&#xD;
      improvement in their pain and if they experienced any negative side effects due to the drug&#xD;
      administration. Monitoring for adverse events was recorded for each patient encounter.&#xD;

    <description>The number of serious and minor adverse events was measured via patient-completed survey as well as by nurse and medical providers on presentation to the emergency department (ED). Serious adverse events are defined as cardiorespiratory events requiring intervention. Minor adverse events are defined as nausea/vomiting, emergence reaction (dysphoria; hallucinations; frightening dreams), and a sense of de-realization or &quot;dreamy&quot; sensation. Both study providers and patients themselves, via a survey that the parent and/or patient (based on age) fills out post receipt of ketamine, reported serious and minor adverse events.</description>

    <description>Opioid usage for at least one but up to three prior patient visits in the last one year for each patient enrolled in the study was summarized, expressed as morphine equivalents in mg/kg/h, to account for different types of opioids used per patient preference, and then this was compared to the intervention group that received LDK.

    <description>Prior to the second dose of IV opiates, the experiment was to give patients a single IV bolus of ketamine at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Pain scores were collected using the FACES scale currently in place. In consenting patients, chart review was performed with the following data collected: mg/kg/hour of morphine equivalents, pain scores on admission, during the encounter, and at discharge, the time to 50% pain reduction, and whether or not the patient was discharged.&#xD;
In addition, a survey, which is attached, was given to patients/families at the time of drug administration to determine if they experienced a subjective improvement in their pain and if they suffered any undue side effects due to drug administration.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]</title>
        <description>The number of serious and minor adverse events was measured via patient-completed survey as well as by nurse and medical providers on presentation to the emergency department (ED). Serious adverse events are defined as cardiorespiratory events requiring intervention. Minor adverse events are defined as nausea/vomiting, emergence reaction (dysphoria; hallucinations; frightening dreams), and a sense of de-realization or &quot;dreamy&quot; sensation. Both study providers and patients themselves, via a survey that the parent and/or patient (based on age) fills out post receipt of ketamine, reported serious and minor adverse events.</description>

Ketamine: The intervention was IV low-dose bolus ketamine as an adjuvant to standard therapy (IV opiates and NSAIDs).&#xD;
Ultimately, 62 patient encounters were enrolled in the study.</description>

        <description>Patient pain scores at presentation for the enrolled encounters and for at least one but up to three visits prior to receipt of ketamine in the last one year, were assessed. At least one but up to three prior visits were averaged and compared to the intervention visit.

The score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain).</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Given the study design (non-blinded, non-randomized), the effect of LDK on opioid usage and other secondary outcomes cannot be definitively associated with LDK itself given the possibility of a placebo effect.</limitations_and_caveats>
