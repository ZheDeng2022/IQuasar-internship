  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the observational VENTASTEP study was to investigate the association between&#xD;
      changes in clinical outcome measures and changes in device outcome measures in PAH patients&#xD;
      using the new Breelib nebulizer in a real life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was not designed to investigate or confirm the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      iloprost.&#xD;
