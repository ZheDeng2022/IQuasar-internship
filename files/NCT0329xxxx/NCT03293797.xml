  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of depression and anxiety are extremely prevalent in the population. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      patients often face barriers to accessing mental health care, particularly psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, including long wait-times and demanding therapeutic protocols. For instance,&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Therapy (MBT) has demonstrated effectiveness at decreasing symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, and improving wellbeing; however, 'traditional' MBT can demand over&#xD;
      30 hours of clinical time, and 50-60 hours of homework, all of which can be barriers to care.&#xD;
      A pilot, uncontrolled study conducted at Sunnybrook illustrated the potential feasibility /&#xD;
      efficaciousness of a novel abbreviated MBT in improving hospital staff wellbeing. The goal of&#xD;
      this controlled study is to further test feasibility and acceptability of this intervention&#xD;
      to reduce depressive / anxious symptoms, reduce stress and improve wellbeing in outpatient&#xD;
      mood/anxiety patients. If efficacious, this Abbreviated MBT could reduce barriers to&#xD;
      accessing mental health care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: ABBREVIATED-MINDFULNESS BASED THERAPY (A-MBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the age of 40, 1 in 2 Canadians have been or are presently experiencing mental health&#xD;
      issues. In particular, anxiety and mood disorders are the most prevalent lifetime mental&#xD;
      health illnesses, affecting 11.6% of the population. Mindfulness based treatments (MBTs) have&#xD;
      strong evidence for improving patient wellness through reduction of anxiety and mood symptoms&#xD;
      in clinical populations. Although efficacious, 'traditional' MBTs are very demanding in terms&#xD;
      of time and homework a relevant factor when considering the recent calls for waittime&#xD;
      reductions in psychotherapeutic mental health services. These programs take 30+ hours&#xD;
      (including 2-3 hr. weekly sessions across 8 weeks, plus a 1-day retreat) and expect 45-60&#xD;
      min./day of meditation homework. The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      abbreviated MBI in reducing anxiety and/or mood disturbances and improving patient&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBTs use a non-stigmatizing approach, combining secularized eastern meditative practices with&#xD;
      western psychological advances to improve stress-management and self-care. Participants learn&#xD;
      to generate less distress, engage more positively and fully in their lives and experiences,&#xD;
      and respond more adaptively to challenges instead of reacting in automatic and unhelpful&#xD;
      ways. Participants in MBI often describe the intervention as transformative. Professional&#xD;
      experience and new insights into MBTs suggest that these 'tradition' treatment programs can&#xD;
      be further abbreviated to develop a effective and accessible clinical intervention. This&#xD;
      abbreviated MBT has been developed, which if effective will curtail wait-times and increase&#xD;
      patient treatment annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONAL &amp; HYPOTHESIS/RESEARCH QUESTION Rational&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients face barriers to accessing psychotherapy, including long wait-times and/or protocols&#xD;
      that are too demanding for many patients. Traditional Mindfulness-Based Therapies (MBTs) are&#xD;
      highly studied and well-recognized treatment options to reduce anxiety and mood symptoms -&#xD;
      demonstrating repeated efficacy in clinical populations. However, the high demands of&#xD;
      clinical time and homework are a barrier to many patients. Further, longer clinical&#xD;
      interventions mean fewer patients being treated per hour of clinician's time, and therefore&#xD;
      longer wait-times. Clinical experience and new insights into MBTs suggest that these&#xD;
      'tradition' treatment programs can be further abbreviated to develop an effective and more&#xD;
      accessible therapy. If this Abbreviated MBT is demonstrated to be clinically effective, it&#xD;
      can reduce barriers to mental health care by reaching more patients in a more timely fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this study will be to evaluate a novel and potentially highly&#xD;
      effective strategy to reduce depressive / anxious symptoms and stress, while improve quality&#xD;
      of life and mental wellbeing among mood and anxiety outpatients referred to the&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Therapy Clinic at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Research Question The study hypothesis is that an abbreviated MBT for mood /&#xD;
      anxiety outpatient populations will show improvement in self-reported measures of clinical&#xD;
      primary (Depression, Anxiety) and secondary (well-being, stress, self-compassion) outcomes&#xD;
      and will be feasible for the population. Feasibility will be determined by patient program&#xD;
      adherence (70% of participants attend ≥75% of sessions) and effect size (moderate magnitude&#xD;
      of change in PHQ-9 / GAD-7), Cohen's d = ≥0.5). The effect size will provide a measure of how&#xD;
      practically and clinically significant the treatment effect is, by measuring change in&#xD;
      baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, 1/3/6 month and 1 year follow-up mean scores for the&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pilot study will explore the effects of an Abbreviated-MBT on symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in an outpatient clinical sample; if effective: a) this would be the&#xD;
      first known pilot study to consider and demonstrate efficacy of an Abbreviated-MBT in a&#xD;
      clinical outpatient population; b) this treatment could increase the volume of patients&#xD;
      treated by up to 3x, reduce wait-times by 2-3 fold, and reach a broader group of patients,&#xD;
      including those for whom the investment of time of traditional MBT is too prohibitive&#xD;
