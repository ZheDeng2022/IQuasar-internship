    <textblock>
      The study design of this research project involves orthodontic patients registered at the&#xD;
      Harvard School of Dental Medicine who are deemed eligible to undergo orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      and who have been provided with sufficient information to make informed consent to join the&#xD;
      sleep study. These patients will be provided with the Medibyte sleep monitor and instructed&#xD;
      on the proper manner in which it should be set up and worn for the one night study period.&#xD;
      This process will be carried out twice throughout the course of the study, once before any&#xD;
      orthodontic appliance has been cemented and once after the required amount of tooth movement&#xD;
      has been attained with the orthodontic appliance still in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The de-identified data from the Medibyte monitor will be downloaded using the Braebon&#xD;
      software and analyzed.&#xD;

      The study design of this research project involves recruiting orthodontic patients registered&#xD;
      at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine who are deemed eligible to undergo orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment and who have been provided with sufficient information to make informed consent to&#xD;
      join the sleep study. The participants will be provided with the Medibyte sleep monitor and&#xD;
      instructed on the proper manner in which it should be set up and worn for the one or two&#xD;
      night study period. The purpose of the Medibyte monitor is solely to provide a calibrated&#xD;
      value of AHI. The Medibyte monitor will not be utilized for investigations and/or treat,&#xD;
      cure, mitigate a medical condition. This process will be carried out twice throughout the&#xD;
      course of the study, once before any orthodontic appliance has been cemented and once after&#xD;
      the required amount of tooth movement has been attained with the orthodontic appliance still&#xD;
      in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The de-identified data from the Medibyte monitor will be downloaded using the Braebon&#xD;
      software and analyzed providing a baseline value and post orthodontic movement AHI value.&#xD;
      Additionally the patients arch width, length and other orthodontic measurements will also be&#xD;
      taken both from their 3-D dental models and also their 2-D lateral cephalogram x-ray all of&#xD;
      which are part of the routine orthodontic records (the x-rays will be taken regardless of the&#xD;
      patients participation in the study since they are a required component of the orthodontic&#xD;
      records taken at HSDM). The values obtained from the patients casts, lateral cephalogram and&#xD;
      Medibyte AHI values will be analyzed both pre-orthodontic appliance cementation and also post&#xD;
      tooth movement. The changes, if any, in the dental parameters as compared with the AHI values&#xD;
      will allow the investigation of the orthodontic effects of expanding the maxilla, moving the&#xD;
      front teeth either forwards or backwards which in effect cause changes to the airway and its&#xD;
      effect on AHI values during sleep. In addition to the measurements taken intra-orally,&#xD;
      surveys will also be undertaken to study any changes the patients may experience in their&#xD;
      sleep and quality of life. If the Medibyte shows a severe reading for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea, these patients will then be referred to a sleep specialist for further more conclusive&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
