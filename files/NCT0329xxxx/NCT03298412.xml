  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will estimate the MRD-negative response rate after treatment with blinatumomab in&#xD;
      subjects with high-risk DLBCL who are MRD-positive following aHSCT. The clinical hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the MRD-negative response rate will be greater than 10%. Achieving an MRD-negative&#xD;
      response rate of 30% would be of scientific and clinical interest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single arm estimation study in adult subjects&#xD;
      with high-risk DLBCL in complete remission. The study will consist of up to a 28-day&#xD;
      screening period, a run-in period of up to 24 months, a 12-week treatment period (8 weeks of&#xD;
      blinatumomab treatment followed by a 4-week treatment free period), a 30-day safety follow-up&#xD;
      visit after the last dose of blinatumomab, and a long-term follow-up period that begins after&#xD;
      the safety follow-up visit is completed until 1 year from the first dose of blinatumomab. The&#xD;
      study will enroll approximately 90 subjects in the screening period with biopsy proven,&#xD;
      high-risk DLBCL that are positron emission tomography-computer tomography (PET-CT) negative&#xD;
      90 days (± 30 days) post aHSCT. During the run-in period subjects will be followed by clinic&#xD;
      visits at regular interval for up to 24 months for monitoring of MRD status in plasma by a&#xD;
      next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay. It is estimated 30 subjects will be either&#xD;
      MRD-positive at screening or become MRD-positive during the 24-month run-in period. The&#xD;
      number of subjects enrolled may be altered in order to ensure that approximately 30 subjects&#xD;
      are assigned to treatment with blinatumomab. Enrollment may be stopped, once approximately 30&#xD;
      subjects have been assigned to treatment with blinatumomab.&#xD;

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate: Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>

    <description>PFS, calculated as the time from the date of first dose of blinatumomab until the date of diagnosis of relapse of lymphoma (by PET-CT, CT, clinical assessment or relapse biopsy, whichever was the preferred method), or date of death, whichever was earliest. Participants who were alive and who did not have progression or new anti-tumor treatment (excluding any stem cell transplantation) were to be censored at last date of tumor assessment.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate: Duration of MRD-Negative Status</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year from first dose of blinatumomab</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of MRD-negative status, assessed only in participants who achieve MRD-negative status after blinatumomab treatment, was defined as the time when a negative MRD result was first established until documented MRD-positive re-occurrence, disease progression or, death due to any cause. Participants without any of these events at the time of the analysis were to be censored at their last disease assessment date. MRD-negative status was assessed by PET-CT or CT.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The treatment duration for the participant who received blinatumomab was 57 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence. A serious AE is defined as an AE that is: fatal; life threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other medically important serious event. TEAEs are events with an onset after the administration of the first dose of blinatumomab treatment through 30 days after the end of blinatumomab treatment. Events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE): Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life-threatening), Grade 5 (death).</description>

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence. A serious AE is defined as an AE that is: fatal; life threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other medically important serious event. TEAEs are events with an onset after the administration of the first dose of blinatumomab treatment through 30 days after the end of blinatumomab treatment. Events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE): Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life-threatening), Grade 5 (death).</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
