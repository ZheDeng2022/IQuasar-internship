    <textblock>
      FORCE is a randomized home-based resistance training/strength training (RT) intervention&#xD;
      study for Stage II and III colon cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 180 newly diagnosed Stage II and III colon cancer patients from Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente of Northern California (KPNC), the Penn State Cancer Institute (PSCI), and the&#xD;
      Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The intervention will begin within the first weeks of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy and continue exercise through the completion of post-operative&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Specifically, the investigators will examine between group differences for RT&#xD;
      versus waitlist control for chemotherapy outcomes including dose delays, dose reductions,&#xD;
      early stoppage and Grade 3 and 4 toxicities. The investigators will also study changes in&#xD;
      muscle mass (MM) and changes in specific inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6 and TNF-RII) as&#xD;
      potential markers of change in response to RT. To determine effects of change of MM on&#xD;
      chemotherapy-specific drug clearance, the investigators will examine the impact body&#xD;
      composition changes on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 5-FU and oxaliplatin, two of the most&#xD;
      commonly used drugs for colon cancer.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized controlled trial of resistance training intervention in colon cancer patients receiving chemotherapy consists of two arms: an in-person and telephone-based intervention to promote home-based resistance training, and a wait-list, control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chemotherapy completion rates will be assessed as relative dose intensity for each agent and then average relative dose intensity (ARDI), which considers all chemotherapy agents in a regimen. We will examine differences in RDI for each chemotherapy agent and the ARDI across all agents between the RT group and the UC group.</description>

    <description>Moderate and severe chemotherapy-associated toxicities will be assessed via a NCI PRO-CTCAE questionnaire, which is a patient-reported outcome measure developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the resistance training (RT) group will receive an in-person and telephone-based intervention to promote home-based resistance training. The exercise intervention will begin by the 3rd adjuvant chemotherapy visit and continue exercise through the completion of post-operative chemotherapy. Participants will work with an exercise professional with expertise working with oncology patients.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Usual care group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants randomized to the usual care (U) group will be instructed to refer to their physician regarding what forms of exercise are safe for them, given their medical history. The U group will be told to continue whatever exercise program they have been undertaking up to enrolling in the study, but not to increase exercise or begin weight-lifting over the period of study participation.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Resistance training</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention goal is for study participants to exercise with progressively higher weights for resistance training to achieve a 1-kg increase in lean body mass by the end of the intervention. During an in-person visit on the same day as a chemotherapy infusion session, exercise professionals will teach participants a series of exercises to be completed at home twice weekly throughout the intervention. Participants will also receive protein powder, which they will be instructed to consume with meals twice a day. During subsequent infusion sessions, the exercise professional will meet in-person with participants to evaluate their ability to increase weights, and adjust exercises appropriately. In between visits, the exercise professional will check-in with participants by phone.</description>
