    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomised study assessing the technique of using indocyanine green as a&#xD;
      fluorescent dye to highlight the thoracic duct during oesophectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The thoracic duct is the largest vessel of the lymphatic system in the body. It transports&#xD;
      chyle (a liquid containing both lymph and emulsified fats) from most of the body, including&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract, into the left internal jugular vein. It is largely located in the&#xD;
      thorax and is at risk of injury during the thoracic part of an oesophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported incidence of thoracic duct injury during oesophagectomy is between 0.2 and&#xD;
      10.5%, although it may be under-reported in the literature. A review of prospective collected&#xD;
      complication data from 292 consecutive oesophagectomies performed in Oxford over a 5 year&#xD;
      period revealed a chyle leak rate of 9.9%. Chyle leak was associated in a doubling of median&#xD;
      length of post-operative stay from 8 to 16 days in these patients. Chylothorax has been&#xD;
      associated with a mortality of up to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the years, a number of attempts have been made to visualise chyle leakage following&#xD;
      thoracic duct injury including administration of enteral fat containing feed (e.g. double&#xD;
      cream), methylene blue and lymphoscintigraphy, but no studies have been published showing a&#xD;
      mechanism to aid thoracic duct identification at the index operation, and so prevent&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence is a technique which uses fluorescent dyes (fluorophores) that emit invisible&#xD;
      (near infra-red (NIR)) light when they are excited by light at a particular wavelength. In&#xD;
      order to use this technique, a fluorescence-enabled camera is required in order to shine&#xD;
      light at that particular wavelength on the fluorophore and to capture the light emitted. This&#xD;
      is then displayed on a screen for the surgeon to see.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent molecule that is approved by the FDA (Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) and the MHRA for use in humans. It is a widely used near infra-red dye for&#xD;
      numerous operations. Near infra-red guided lymphatic mapping with ICG has gained much&#xD;
      attention over recent years and its use has widely been published in breast and colorectal&#xD;
      surgery. ICG has also been successfully used to identify the thoracic duct in a number of&#xD;
      case reports in both adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG can be injected into the small bowel mesentery to aid identification of thoracic duct&#xD;
      injury at re-exploration. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using ICG fluorescence&#xD;
      to identify the thoracic duct during oesophagectomy, with the eventual aim of developing its&#xD;
      routine use to prevent thoracic duct injuries.&#xD;
