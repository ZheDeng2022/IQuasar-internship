    <textblock>
      Most patients with complex congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy from acquired heart&#xD;
      disease have reduced exercise capacity. Exercise capacity is associated with respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength and function. If structured respiratory muscle training positively influences&#xD;
      respiratory muscle function in patients with structural heart disease is not well known. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate whether regular singing lessons and breathing exercises&#xD;
      improve respiratory muscle strength in patients with congenital or acquired structural heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with complex congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy from acquired heart&#xD;
      disease have reduced exercise capacity (VO2 max). Furthermore, exercise capacity is&#xD;
      associated with respiratory muscle strength and function (maximal inspiratory (MIP) and&#xD;
      maximal respiratory (MEP) pressures. If structured respiratory muscle training positively&#xD;
      influences respiratory muscle function in patients with complex congenital heart disease or&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy from acquired heart disease is not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of a structured phonation and&#xD;
      respiratory training with regular singing lessons on respiratory muscle strength and function&#xD;
      (MIP and MEP), exercise capacity (VO2 max), NT-proBNP and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional, single-centre, randomized study. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      the heart failure and congenital heart disease clinic of the University hospital Basel.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to participate in a structured phonation and respiratory muscle&#xD;
      training for 12 weeks. The structured phonation and respiratory muscle training includes&#xD;
      weekly singing lessons in a choir, held by a professional instructor, with additional&#xD;
      instructions for daily respiratory muscle strength training at home. Respiratory muscle&#xD;
      function (MIP and MEP), exercise capacity (VO2max) and quality of life will be measured at&#xD;
      the beginning of the intervention and after 12 weeks of interventional training. In parallel,&#xD;
      respiratory muscle function, exercise capacity, NT-proBNP and quality of life will be&#xD;
      measured in a gender and age matched group of patients without performing the intervention&#xD;
      and in a healthy control group who co-participate the choir lessons and the respiratory&#xD;
      muscle training. Primary endpoint is the change of maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP)&#xD;
      between patients with and without a structured phonation and respiratory muscle training.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are changes of MEP, VO2max, NT-proBNP and quality of life between&#xD;
      patients with and without the intervention; changes of all measured variables between&#xD;
      patients and the healthy control group, and changes of all measured variables before and&#xD;
      after the intervention in patients. Inclusion criteria: Patients &gt;18 years with known&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy from acquired heart disease (ischemic or dilated) or complex forms of&#xD;
      congenital heart disease. Exclusion criteria: Acute coronary syndrome ≤6 months or heart&#xD;
      failure hospitalization ≤12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural singing lesions and respiratory muscle function training may improve respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure or&#xD;
      complex congenital heart disease. The intervention comes at low costs, can be applied by most&#xD;
      of the patients and is feasible even for disabled patients who are not able to participate in&#xD;
      regular exercise training. Furthermore, singing may improve respiratory muscle strength and&#xD;
      exercise capacity even in the healthy population.&#xD;
