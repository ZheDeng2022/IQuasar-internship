  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study to examine the effects of acute inflammation on cognition and&#xD;
      emotion in healthy participants using a between-subjects, randomized, double-blind design.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory response of the immune system is responsive to stress and it impacts brain&#xD;
      function. Animal studies have shown that inflammation appears to alter threat- and&#xD;
      reward-related brain activity. Accumulating evidence points to inflammatory proteins,&#xD;
      specifically cytokines, as key players in this relationship. Although cytokines are typically&#xD;
      too large to pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB), they can influence brain function&#xD;
      and structure by transmitting signals from peripheral systems to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of endotoxin within the polysaccharide form of Salmonella typhi&#xD;
      vaccination provides an ideal model for studying the causal effects of short-term&#xD;
      inflammation on thinking patterns (i.e., cognition) and emotions in the brain. Endotoxin is a&#xD;
      component of the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, which promotes the production of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-α) via toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) activation and nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of acute inflammation on brain functioning, 24 healthy participants&#xD;
      will be recruited. The investigators will will randomize participants to placebo or&#xD;
      inflammatory challenge using polysaccharide typhoid vaccine (i.e., endotoxin) and will use&#xD;
      validated behavioral tasks and questionnaires to assess threat and reward sensitivity. They&#xD;
      will assess chronic resting levels of inflammation as well as the inflammatory response to&#xD;
      Salmonella typhi vaccination.&#xD;
