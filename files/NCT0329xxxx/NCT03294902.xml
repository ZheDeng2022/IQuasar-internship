  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pedra Technologies' PedraTM device is a non-invasive, diagnostic device intended to&#xD;
      measure foot perfusion by assessing blood flow. The PedraTM device comprises a compact&#xD;
      instrument console connected to a sensor that is pasted onto the patient's foot during&#xD;
      perfusion assessment. Through skin contact, the device is able to monitor tissue perfusion at&#xD;
      depths of up to 7.5mm. The monitor console contains opto-electronic instrumentation including&#xD;
      coherent infrared light sources, photo detectors, and display/control electronics. The sensor&#xD;
      comprises passive fiber-optic conduits, which transfer infrared light from the console to the&#xD;
      patient, and relays scattered light from the patient back to the console. The intensity of&#xD;
      light emitted from the sensor is less than 3 mW, well within the safety envelope of Class I&#xD;
      laser systems and comparable (or lower than) other commercially available devices such as&#xD;
      laser Doppler systems. The sole point of contact with the patient is a layer of medical grade&#xD;
      adhesive tape, which is used to paste the flat sensor onto intact skin.&#xD;

    <description>This study is a prospective single-centre, device observational study designed to enroll up to 60 evaluable subjects at 1 investigational site in the United Kingdom. Eligible subjects, who meet the requirements for one of the 3 distinct subject groups: (1) Critical Limb Ischaemia group, (2) Peripheral artery disease with superficial femoral arterial (SFA) or popliteal artery disease and (3) PAD-free group. Subjects who meet study eligibility criteria will be enrolled consecutively until the total number of subjects is enrolled per each group as outlined in the protocol. All subjects at the investigational site will be enrolled in the presence of a member of the Sponsor or selected designee in order to assist with the device operation and to verify that all protocol assessments are completed appropriately at baseline.</description>
