  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population ages and medical progress is made, many elderly patients that previously&#xD;
      would not have been candidates for surgery are now undergoing operations. In this group of&#xD;
      older patients, brain dysfunction after anesthesia and surgery is well recognized and&#xD;
      categorized into two distinct clinical entities; Post-operative cognitive delirium (POD) and&#xD;
      post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is an acute and fluctuating deterioration in attention accompanied by either a&#xD;
      change in cognition or arousal and is often diagnosed by criteria established in the&#xD;
      Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Delirium can present as hypoactive (decreased alertness,&#xD;
      motor activity and anhedonia), as hyperactive (agitated and combative) or as mixed forms. Age&#xD;
      and the type of operation are the major risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a term used to describe subtle changes in&#xD;
      cognition, such as memory and executive function. The most commonly seen problems are memory&#xD;
      impairment and impaired performance on intellectual tasks. In severe cases, it can lead to&#xD;
      inability to perform daily living functions. It was previously found that the presence of&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction 3 months after non-cardiac surgery was associated with an increased&#xD;
      mortality. The mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment after anesthesia and surgery are&#xD;
      not yet fully clear. The risk factors are related to patient characteristics, type of&#xD;
      operation and anesthetic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its limitations over-anesthesia as monitored by BIS was at-least correlative with&#xD;
      POD. Therefore it is hopeful that an even more precise evaluation of the level of anesthesia&#xD;
      will improve POD prediction (and thereby prevention) even further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand the measure of depth of anesthesia by itself does not provide sufficient&#xD;
      prediction for POCD. In POCD a major role has been assigned to hippocampal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently demonstrated that temporary hippocampal interruptions are&#xD;
      manifested by interhemispheric desynchronization, which are recognized by our new algorithm,&#xD;
      which monitors electrophysiological markers of attention and of perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a unique algorithm for analyzing EEG based on the concept of&#xD;
      monitoring perception and attention and their interhemispheric synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this proof of concept study are: (i) to find-out whether interhemispheric&#xD;
      desynchronization of attentional processes is associated with POCD; (ii) to find out whether&#xD;
      the level of anesthesia, is linked primary to POD and secondary to POCD.&#xD;

      cognition, such as memory and executive function. The most commonly seen problems are memory&#xD;
      impairment and impaired performance on intellectual tasks. In severe cases, it can lead to&#xD;
      inability to perform daily living functions. The reported incidence figures for postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction vary depending on the group of patients studied, the definition of POCD&#xD;
      used, the tests used to establish the diagnosis and their statistical evaluation, the timing&#xD;
      of testing, and the choice of control group. The diagnosis of POCD relies on the use of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, including; visual verbal learning test, based on Rey's auditive&#xD;
      recall of words, the concept shifting test, based on the trail- making test from Halstead and&#xD;
      Reitan's neuropsychological test battery, the Stroop color word interference test , the&#xD;
      letter-digit coding, based on the symbol-digit substitution task from the Wechsler adult&#xD;
      intelligence scale and the four boxes test. In a large prospective multicenter cohort study,&#xD;
      it was found that the presence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after noncardiac surgery was&#xD;
      associated with an increased mortality. Furthermore, patients with cognitive decline at 1&#xD;
      week had an increased risk of leaving the labor market prematurely and a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      time receiving social transfer payments. The mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment after&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery are not yet fully clear. The risk factors for developing POCD are&#xD;
      related to patient characteristics, type of operation and anesthetic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, and renal insufficiency are all associated with&#xD;
      impaired brain performance. It is theoretically obvious that an adequate intraoperative&#xD;
      oxygen supply for all vital organs is essential if postoperative cerebral dysfunction is to&#xD;
      be avoided. Casai et al found that brain desaturation (rSO2 decrease &lt;75% of baseline)&#xD;
      occurred in 40% of elderly patients after noncardiac surgery, and the cerebral desaturation&#xD;
      was linked with a high incidence of POCD. A recent systematic review shows that reductions in&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) during cardiac surgery may indicate CPB cannula&#xD;
      malposition, particularly during aortic surgery. However, only weak evidence links low rSO2&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery to POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POCD is a well-recognized clinical phenomenon of multifactorial origin; emboli,&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, inflammation, and patient's preoperative cerebral dysfunction Meticulous&#xD;
      surgical and anesthesiological techniques are important for preventing complications and&#xD;
      keeping the risk of POCD to a minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG is an electrophysiological monitoring method used to record electrical activity of&#xD;
      the brain, including normal and abnormal activity. In recent years, numerous clinical studies&#xD;
      were performed to evaluate whether the use in intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) to&#xD;
      control the depth of anesthesia has any effect on POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it was confirmed that intraoperative neuro-monitoring for depth of anesthesia is&#xD;
      associated with a lower incidence of delirium. However it is unrelated to the incidence of&#xD;
      POCD. The most common available monitor for depth of anesthesia is the Bispectral index,&#xD;
      developed more than 20 years ago. The device's output is based on electroencephalographic&#xD;
      (EEG) signals from the frontal lobe (monitors brain activity) in combination with&#xD;
      electromyographic (EMG) waves (monitors muscle activity). The BIS produces a number ranging&#xD;
      from 0 -100, which matches the patient's level of consciousness (awake, sedated or&#xD;
      unconscious) under GA. There are two main problems with the BIS device: (1) It analyzes EEG&#xD;
      and EMG with no ability to differentiate the neuronal activity from the muscle activity.&#xD;
      Thus, when neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) are used, scores produced by the BIS are&#xD;
      influenced by the lack of muscle activity, and mistakenly indicate a state of unconsciousness&#xD;
      (lack of neuronal activity) even if no hypnotic medications were used, and (2) The BIS is&#xD;
      based solely on frontal electrodes and does not monitor posterior activity. Thus, anesthetic&#xD;
      medications with more posterior effect (such as ketamine) receive a false score by the BIS&#xD;
      device. Accordingly, the BIS system might be better used as a means of tracking specific&#xD;
      anesthetic medications and not as a universal means for monitoring unconsciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its limitations over-anesthesia as monitored by BIS was at-least correlative with POD&#xD;
      (but not with POCD). Therefore it is hopeful that an even more precise evaluation of the&#xD;
      level of anesthesia will improve POD prediction (and thereby prevention) even further. On the&#xD;
      other hand the measure of depth of anesthesia by itself does not provide sufficient&#xD;
      prediction for POCD. In POCD a major role has been assigned to hippocampal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently demonstrated that temporary hippocampal interruptions are&#xD;
      manifested by interhemispheric desynchronization, which are recognized by our new algorithm,&#xD;
      which monitors electrophysiological markers of attention and of perception. This algorithm&#xD;
      was based on a previous set of studies, which showed the ability to decompose the entire&#xD;
      multi-electrode EEG/ERP sample to a superposition of attention and perception processes,&#xD;
      spread in space (over the scalp) and time (hundreds of milliseconds). Our algorithm is unique&#xD;
      in the ability to extract the needed perceptual and attentional information indicating depth&#xD;
      of anesthesia and hemispheric damage (manifested by interhemispheric desynchronization) in&#xD;
      real time every 30 seconds and with a minimal electrodes setup, comprised of 6 electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this proof of concept study are: (i) to find-out whether interhemispheric&#xD;
      desynchronization of attentional processes is associated with POCD; (ii) to find out whether&#xD;
      the level of anesthesia, is linked primary to POD and secondary to POCD. For both purposes&#xD;
      the investigators use a novel EEG algorithm based on the concept of monitoring perception and&#xD;
      attention and their interhemispheric synchronization.&#xD;
