    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study to assess the PK of single 100 mg oral dose of&#xD;
      enasidenib (CC-90007) in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched&#xD;
      healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the subject's score&#xD;
      according to Pugh's Modification of Child's Classification of Severity of Liver Disease&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 4 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Approximately 6 to 8 male and female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment&#xD;
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male and female subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
           function will be enrolled in Group 2. Subjects in Group 2 will be matched to subjects in&#xD;
           Group 1 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 30 pounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Approximately 6 to 8 male and female subjects with severe hepatic impairment&#xD;
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male and female subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
           function will be enrolled in Group 4. Subjects in Group 4 will be matched to subjects in&#xD;
           Group 3 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 30 pounds). This study&#xD;
           employs a staged design as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 4 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory&#xD;
           safety and tolerability for up to 8 days after dosing, before subjects with severe&#xD;
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two subjects with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and&#xD;
           tolerability for up to 8 days after dosing, before the remaining subjects with severe&#xD;
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.&#xD;
