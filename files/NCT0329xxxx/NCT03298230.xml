  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease affects around 25% of the UK population aged over 55. Left&#xD;
      untreated it can lead to debilitating pain, gangrene, amputation and death. It most commonly&#xD;
      affects the lower limbs and in the earlier stages of the disease patients can present with a&#xD;
      symptom known as intermittent claudication; pain felt in the legs which stops the patient&#xD;
      from walking past a certain distance. Current National Institute for Healthcare and&#xD;
      Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend Supervised Exercise as first line treatment for&#xD;
      patients with peripheral arterial disease presenting with intermittent claudication.&#xD;
      Supervised exercise employs behaviour changing techniques which enable the patient to modify&#xD;
      their lifestyles, improving their claudication symptoms, quality of life and reducing their&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. Despite this treatment being significantly more cost-effective than&#xD;
      often employed complex endovascular management, most institutions don't offer such programmes&#xD;
      citing lack of resources and compliance from clinicians and patients alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a more cost-effective, resource-savvy solution in the form of&#xD;
      REmotely SuPervised ExerCise Training (RESPECT). This allows the patient to exercise in the&#xD;
      convenience of their own home, at a time of their choosing but still be supervised via&#xD;
      fitness tracker technology and an online fitness platform. This randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      will attempt to prove its' effectiveness in increasing claudication distance, improving&#xD;
      functional ability, decreasing cardiovascular risk and improving quality of life whilst being&#xD;
      more cost-effective than the currently recognised national first line treatment. This trial&#xD;
      has the potential to revolutionise the management of patients with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
