      Impact of percutaneous internal ring ligation during laparoscopic orchiopexy in decreasing&#xD;
      incidence of congenital hernia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryptorchidism is the most common genitourinary anomaly in male children. Its incidence can&#xD;
      reach 3% in full term neonates, rising to 30% in premature boys . The treatment of the crypt&#xD;
      orchid testicle is justified by the increased risk of infertility and malignancy, as well as&#xD;
      an associated inguinal hernia and the risk of trauma to the ectopic testicle against the&#xD;
      pubis. Furthermore, the psychological stigma of a missing testis for the patient, as well as&#xD;
      the parents' anxiety is also factors that justify this type of treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 20% of crypt orchid testicles are non palpable. The treatment of non-descended&#xD;
      testicles is mandatory due to the increased risk of infertility, present in up to 40% of the&#xD;
      patients, as compared to 6% of control groups, including malignancy, which reaches 20 times&#xD;
      that of normal adults .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of the crypt orchid testis before 2 years of age is recommended, treatment is&#xD;
      necessary not only for the risk of malignancy, but also for the satisfaction and improvement&#xD;
      in the quality of the patient's life and parentsÂ´ concern for their children's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to diagnosis, despite a sensitivity of 70-90% in the diagnosis of inguinal&#xD;
      testes, ultrasonography is not useful in intra-abdominal cases . Although presenting a better&#xD;
      quality, both computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance lack sufficient sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity to be considered as gold standard diagnostic tools . More recently, the&#xD;
      magnetic angioresonance was introduced with sensibility of 96% and specificity of 100%, but&#xD;
      it is still a new method, with high costs, also requiring general anesthesia in children .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to the treatment, the use of gonadotrophin for un descended testes presents a&#xD;
      success rate of definitive descent to the scrotum of 21 to 56%, with better results in&#xD;
      bilateral cases . Surgical treatment via an inguinal incision is the main treatment option&#xD;
      for palpable testicles, but can also be employed for the evaluation and treatment of&#xD;
      non-palpable testis. In this situation, however, surgical exploration can often require large&#xD;
      incisions and extensive dissections, especially in bilateral cases. This can be avoided using&#xD;
      laparoscopic evaluation, with a sensitivity and specificity reaching more than 90%&#xD;
