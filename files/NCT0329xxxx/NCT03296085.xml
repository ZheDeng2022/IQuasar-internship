  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Edema, commonly called swelling, is a common medical condition, with many causes. Clinicians&#xD;
      generally find edema by pressing against a patient's skin, usually on the feet or shins, and&#xD;
      observing how much dimpling there is in the skin. Most clinicians estimate the amount on a&#xD;
      scale of mild to severe, or perhaps state the amount as 1 to 4. There is little agreement&#xD;
      between observers, and it is hard to judge different clinicians' use of these scales. The&#xD;
      first part of this experiment will demonstrate this inconsistency. After clinicians are shown&#xD;
      a new technique for measuring edema, the second part of the study will show more accurate and&#xD;
      consistent measurements. This will help clinicians to measure edema better, and to&#xD;
      communicate their findings to other clinicians more effectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team will recruit as many clinicians who are conveniently available for the&#xD;
      study. Clinicians will include attending physicians from any specialty, residents, medical&#xD;
      students, physician assistants, physician assistant students, nurses, certified nurse&#xD;
      practitioners, and certified nurse practitioner students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients and clinicians have been recruited, the research team will maintain a list of&#xD;
      the patients and a grid of which clinicians are to examine which patients. Each clinician&#xD;
      will be given a data collection sheet, listing the patients' room numbers, and a grid for&#xD;
      recording results for each of the patient's affected limb(s). The first data collection sheet&#xD;
      (before instruction on the quantitative method) will just show a blank free text field so&#xD;
      that clinicians can record their results as they normally do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After instruction in the novel quantitative technique, the clinicians will receive another&#xD;
      data collection sheet now indicating the intent to have the clinicians record their findings&#xD;
      in millimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expectation is that a minimum of 6 examiners will determine the extent of edema on at&#xD;
      least 38 limbs. If possible, the research will continue until approximately 100 limbs have&#xD;
      been examined by a total of at least 10 to 20 clinicians.&#xD;
