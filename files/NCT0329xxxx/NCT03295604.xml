      Aim: In this ramdomised clinical trial (RCT), the aim was to compare clinical periodontal&#xD;
      data of subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) group and SCGT+enamel matrix derivatives&#xD;
      (EMD) group in terms of gained gingiva volume (GGV) and gained gingiva surface area (GGSA) by&#xD;
      scanners of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A total of 35 Miller class I-II gingival recession defects were&#xD;
      involved in this study (n=17 in SCTG group, n=18 in SCTG+EMD group). In addition to&#xD;
      periodontal clinical parameters, three dimensional (3D) images were recorded using CAD/CAM&#xD;
      system before the treatment, at the 1st month and at the 6th months after the treatment. The&#xD;
      images were superimposed using softwares and GGV, GGSA were calculated.&#xD;

      Study populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, totally 35 gingival recession (GR) defects in 35 patients, who applied with&#xD;
      complaints of poor aesthetic and/or root surface sensitivity. Following patients were&#xD;
      admitted to the study: individuals should have no systemic disease, should be non-smokers of&#xD;
      cigarette or tobacco products, not in a pregnancy, have not used any antibiotics or&#xD;
      medications with an impact on the immune system within last 6 months, have GR classified as&#xD;
      Miller class I or class II, have GR depth of ≥2mm , have no decay or restoration on the vital&#xD;
      teeth which will be operated, have no operation history with regard to GRs for related tooth&#xD;
      area. The materials and methods of this study were approved by the Non-Drug Clinical&#xD;
      Researches Ethics Committee of Yüzüncü Yıl University (B.30.2.YYU.0.01.00.00/32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In SCTG group 17 of GRs defects and in SCTG+EMD group 18 GRs defects were treated. While GRs&#xD;
      in SCTG group was treated by SCTG and CPF combination therapy, EMD (Emdogain, Straumann,&#xD;
      Basel, Switzerland) was additionally used in GR treatments of SCTG+EMD group. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized by complete randomization method (SPSS 15; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to assign&#xD;
      them into groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgical Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were informed about the potential causes of GRs. Causative habits of GR have been&#xD;
      eliminated. Baseline periodontal treatments of the patients were performed. Plaque index (PI)&#xD;
      , gingival index (GI) , probing pocket depth (PPD) (mm), clinical attachment level (CAL) (mm)&#xD;
      were recorded before periodontal treatment. We prepared patients with total PI scores less&#xD;
      than 15% for the surgical procedure (O'Leary et al 1972). Pre-treatment 3D soft tissue images&#xD;
      were taken by CEREC Omnicam (Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) from intra-oral&#xD;
      region. Recipient zone was prepared using the Langer method. SCTG was extracted ipsilaterally&#xD;
      with the operation site from the palatal region between distal of canine and mesial of 1st&#xD;
      molar tooth. Incision was performed in parallel with free gingival margin using Harris graft&#xD;
      knife (Harris Double Blade Graft Knife, H &amp; H Company, Ontario, CA, USA). Harvested graft was&#xD;
      implanted to recipient zone so that its periosteal side faces with root surface and overhangs&#xD;
      defect borders by 1mm. In order to remove the smear layer on the root surface of the teeth in&#xD;
      SCTG+EMD group, 24% EDTA (Prefgel, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) was applied for two minutes&#xD;
      onto the root surface and operation site was washed with normal saline in order to remove any&#xD;
      residual EDTA. EMD was applied to entire root surface compatible with manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D images and clinical parameter values were recorded during follow-up examinations at the&#xD;
      1st and the 6th month after the periodontal surgery. 3D images of soft tissue were taken&#xD;
      intraorally with CEREC Omnicam® device at the commencement of treatment as well as at the&#xD;
      post-operative 1st and 6th months . The measurements were recorded as in rst.img format which&#xD;
      is a file extension of CEREC system®. The operation site was cut out from the image which was&#xD;
      recorded at the 1st and at the 6th month. Images of each patient which were taken in three&#xD;
      different time points were overlapped on Mimics 10 software. GGV and GGSA measurements were&#xD;
      made on the overlapped images. the GGV and GGSA were calculated the difference in tissue as&#xD;
      obtained after overlapping the 3D images by the software. Changes at the 1st and the 6th&#xD;
      month after treatment were calculated with respect to pre-treatment images .&#xD;
