      The main objective of this prospective, controlled clinical study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the treatment effects of PowerScope2 and Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device in&#xD;
           patients with Class II divison1 malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the treatment effects of PowerScope2 and Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device with&#xD;
           the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis for this study is that Forsus and PowerScope2 are equally effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of ClassII div1 malocclusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Class II malocclusion is one of the most frequent problems in orthodontics ,as it affects one&#xD;
      third of patients seeking orthodontic treatment. McNamara reported mandibular retrusion as&#xD;
      the most common characteristic of Class II malocclusion rather than maxillary prognathism.&#xD;
      Functional orthopaedic appliances are widely used to treat Class II malocclusion in growing&#xD;
      patients .Contrary to removable appliances, fixed devices do not require patient&#xD;
      collaboration and can be worn in association with multibracket therepy, so that class II&#xD;
      malocclusion can be corrected in a single phase treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Most popular flexible devices are the Jasper Jumper, Eureka spring, and the Forsus device&#xD;
      (FRD)Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device [FRD]is a three piece (L pin module) or two-piece (EZ2&#xD;
      module) system, composed of a telescoping spring that attaches at upper first molar and a&#xD;
      push rod linked to lower archwire, distal to either the canine or first premolar bracket. The&#xD;
      FRD spring and rod create an equal and opposite force to maxillary and mandibular&#xD;
      dentition.1The clinical application of the FRD was described by Vogt in 2006.PowerScope is&#xD;
      one of the latest innovation in Class II correction developed by Dr. Andy Hayes. Inventors&#xD;
      claims the following advantages of powerscope over other functional appliances. It is&#xD;
      delivered as a one-size-fits-all appliance pre-assembled with attachment nuts for quick and&#xD;
      easy chairside application .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appliance is a wire-to-wire installation with attachments placed mesial to the first&#xD;
      molar in the maxillary arch and distal to the canine of the mandibular arch. Internal NiTi&#xD;
      spring mechanism delivers 260 gms of force for continous activation during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dental, skeletal and soft tissue short-term effects of comprehensive fixed appliance&#xD;
      treatment combined with ForsusTM in ClassII patients have been evaluated previously. However&#xD;
      no previous study compared the posttreatment effects of PowerScope2TM and ForsusTM.The&#xD;
      purpose of this controlled clinical study is to evaluate the treatment and posttreatment&#xD;
      effects induced by PowerScope2 in growing patients with ClassII malocclusion and to compare&#xD;
      it with Forsus(FRD) on CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the studies examined the changes of the upper airway through lateral&#xD;
      cephalometric radiography. This method limited the accuracy of airway measurement since the&#xD;
      two-dimensional (2D) images only allowed an anteroposterior dimension measurement in sagittal&#xD;
      plane, and failed to provide a full-scaled view of the upper airway. Therefore, 3D evaluation&#xD;
      of the upper airway in growing patients during fixed functional appliance treatment needs to&#xD;
      be established .Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an acceptable technique for 3D&#xD;
      volumetric depiction and morphological evaluation of the upper airway using a lower-radiation&#xD;
      method with a greater spatial resolution . It allows 3D registration of pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment data through identification of specific structures in the cranial base.&#xD;
      Therefore, the changes of the upper airway before and after mandibular advancement can be&#xD;
      precisely evaluated. As the patients involved in our research were underage, their normal&#xD;
      development may affect on the upper airway morphology during the treatment period. Thus, an&#xD;
      untreated control group is needed. In the present study, the control group was selected from&#xD;
      records of patients with the same diagnosis who just began orthodontic treatment, and matches&#xD;
      well with the post-treatment patients of fixed functional appliance group through age, sex&#xD;
      and development condition strategy, so that effects of fixed functional appliance on the&#xD;
      upper airway morphology can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS- Ours is a prospective, non-pharmacological, double blind, randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical study to compare the treatment effects of two different fixed functional&#xD;
      appliances, Forsus and PowerScope2. The present study will be conducted in the Department of&#xD;
      Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, PGIDS, Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health&#xD;
      Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical clearance- The study will be carried out after the institutional approval for use in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source of data:- The sample size consists of 63 subjects who were selected from the patients&#xD;
      attending regular OPD at the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics for&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET SAMPLE SIZE Nearly 21 subjects per group and 63 in total should be an ideal sample&#xD;
      size including 10% dropout for the proposed study to have a power of 90% and a standard error&#xD;
      of significance to be 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PATIENT AND AGREEMENT TO BE RANDOMISED A valid, informed written&#xD;
      consent of the patient or parent/ guardian and an agreement to be randomized was obtained&#xD;
      from the patient before registering the patient in this clinical study. Patient or parent/&#xD;
      guardian was informed about all the theoretical risks and benefits of the intervention under&#xD;
      test. Risks and hazards of radiation during CBCT were also explained to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main intervention in this clinical study is placement of 2 different fixed functional&#xD;
      appliances after initial levelling and alignment of dental arches. The study consists of 3&#xD;
      groups with equal allocation of subjects in each group-&#xD;
&#xD;
      G1- This group received Powerscope2 appliance bilaterally G2-This group received Forsus&#xD;
      bilaterally (as per size suitable for the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G3-The control group wiil be selected from patients with same diagnosis who just began&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment, and matches well with the post treatment patients of Powerscope2 and&#xD;
      Forsus through age, sex and development condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of subjects in intervention groups (patients meeting selection criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with 0.022 MBT preadjusted edgewise appliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maxillary and mandibular arches will be stabilized with the help of 0.019&quot; × 0.025&quot; stainless&#xD;
      steel wire, reverse torque will be introduced in the lower anterior segment and wires will be&#xD;
      cinched back distal to 2ndmolars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient were randomly allocated into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 PowerScope2 (G1) 2. Forsus (G2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment diagnostic records including lateral cephalogram were taken. CBCT was taken&#xD;
      before insertion and after removal of the fixed functional appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion of fixed functional appliance as per the group allocated. Regular follow up till&#xD;
      the completion of functional phase of treatment will be done. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      functional appliance phase till Class I molar relationship is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION &amp; ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT The subjects were randomly allocated by a sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelope method. The study subjects were blinded regarding intervention group.&#xD;
      Allocated appliance was inserted on the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND CBCT ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator recorded the patients' name, address and contact number. CBCT will be&#xD;
      recorded before placement of fixed functional appliance and immediately after its removal in&#xD;
      order to evaluate changes caused by the functional appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To check patient comfort, all patients were given a questionnaire to investigate the&#xD;
      patient's experiences with PowerScope2 and Forsus. The questionnaire was designed in English&#xD;
      and then verbally translated into the patients and parents native language at the&#xD;
      installation appointment though all the patients and their parents could read and understand&#xD;
      it in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prefunctional and postfunctional profile photographs of the treatment groups (G1 and G2)&#xD;
      patients and those of control will be presented to 5 orthodontists, 5 patients, 5 parents and&#xD;
      5 laypersons.The raters will assess changes in facial appearance on a visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT Data Acquisition The pre-treatment and post-treatment CBCT scans of two intervention&#xD;
      groups (G1 &amp; G2) and the CBCT of control group (G3) will be collected and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During CBCT scan, patients will be instructed to maintain an upright posture and natural head&#xD;
      position. The CBCT scans will be performed at rest position of the tongue (tongue in contact&#xD;
      with anterior palate without touching the anterior teeth) and maximum intercuspation. All of&#xD;
      the scans will be performed by the same researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION &amp; INTERPRETATION Data will be collected, properly arranged and a CONSORT flow&#xD;
      chart will be made to derive final sample size and calculate number of exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:-The data recorded will be processed by standard statistical analysis.&#xD;
