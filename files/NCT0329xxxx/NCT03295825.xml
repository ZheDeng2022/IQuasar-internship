      The primary objective of this study is to use heparin-binding protein (HBP) concentration to&#xD;
      indicate the presence, or outcome, of sepsis over 72 hours after ED admission. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to separately evaluate the performance of HBP to predict outcome&#xD;
      in patients with suspected infection over 12-24 hours after ED admission.&#xD;

      The purpose of this prospective, non-interventional, multi-centre clinical study is to assess&#xD;
      the clinical validity of the Heparin Binding Protein (HBP) assay for indicating the presence,&#xD;
      or outcome, of severe sepsis (including septic shock), over 72 hours, in patients with&#xD;
      suspected infection following emergency department admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is an increasingly common cause of morbidity and mortality, with approximately 150,000&#xD;
      people in Europe and 215,000 people in the US dying of severe sepsis each year. Deaths&#xD;
      attributable to sepsis continue to rise due to an increase in incidence of the disease, which&#xD;
      can be attributed to numerous factors including the aging population, the increased number of&#xD;
      immuno-compromised patients, the increased use of invasive surgery and the increased&#xD;
      incidence of microbial resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sepsis syndrome was first described in the 1992 publication by Bone et al detailing the&#xD;
      conclusions of the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference held in 1991, which first introduced the&#xD;
      Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) classification system. Systemic Inflammatory&#xD;
      Response Syndrome (SIRS) is considered to be present when patients have 2 or more of the&#xD;
      following clinical findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body temperature, &gt;38ºC or &lt;36ºC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  heart rate, &gt;90 beats per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory rate of &gt;20 breaths per minute or a PaCO2 of &lt;32mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  white cell count of &gt;12,000 cells per µL or &lt;4,000 per µL, or &gt;10% immature (band) forms&#xD;
           According to the suggested definitions, sepsis is defined as SIRS plus confirmed&#xD;
           infection, severe sepsis is defined as sepsis associated with organ dysfunction,&#xD;
           hypoperfusion, or hypotension and septic shock is defined as sepsis-induced hypotension,&#xD;
           persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of sepsis traditionally relies on identification of the above symptoms, as well as&#xD;
      culturing techniques to confirm and identify the infection. This method of diagnosis is,&#xD;
      however, far from ideal as it has been demonstrated that SIRS criteria are poorly predictive&#xD;
      of subsequent events in the sepsis cascade and that approximately one half of severe sepsis&#xD;
      cases are culture negative. In addition, the assay time for culture-based diagnosis is 24 to&#xD;
      48 hours, where it has been shown that diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock as early&#xD;
      as possible is important, as each hour of delay in effective antimicrobial administration is&#xD;
      associated with an average decrease in survival of 7.6%. Although the majority of severe&#xD;
      sepsis patients receive treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), it is estimated that up to&#xD;
      two thirds of those patients initially present to the emergency department (ED), and that&#xD;
      approximately 20% of patients with confirmed infection who present to the ED with&#xD;
      uncomplicated sepsis progress to severe sepsis or septic shock within 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This high incidence of early progression to severe sepsis and septic shock among patients&#xD;
      presenting to the ED highlights the time-sensitive nature of diagnosis, especially in&#xD;
      patients who initially do not appear critically ill. Therefore early intervention to prevent&#xD;
      subsequent or worsening clinical deterioration is key to the successful treatment of&#xD;
      patients. However, two major impediments to the effectiveness of sepsis treatment strategies&#xD;
      are a failure to recognise the early stages of the disease and underestimation of its&#xD;
      severity, as it is difficult to determine which of the patients with signs of infection on&#xD;
      initial evaluation have, or will develop, more serious illness. Several outcome prediction&#xD;
      models, including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV, the Simplified&#xD;
      Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) III, the Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), and the&#xD;
      Mortality Probability Model (MPM) III have therefore been developed for use in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Moreover patients admitted in the ED with at least two of three clinical signs&#xD;
      (hypotension, tachypnea, altered mental status) are highly possible to suffer from sepsis.&#xD;
      These three clinical signs are the qSOFA score. Data from the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group put&#xD;
      into question if the qSOFA score can predict sepsis in the ED with sensitivity that exceeds&#xD;
      65% (15, 16). There is, therefore, still an unmet need for a diagnostic tool that can&#xD;
      identify those patients at risk of developing more severe disease, and although a number of&#xD;
      laboratory measures or novel sepsis biomarkers have been proposed for clinical use, there is&#xD;
      currently no single accepted biomarker or combination of biomarkers for use in patients with&#xD;
      suspected sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent publication by Linder et al(17) has shown that measurement of heparin binding&#xD;
      protein (HBP), also known as azurocidin or CAP37, in febrile patients presenting to the ED&#xD;
      shows a close correlation between increased plasma HBP levels and the development of severe&#xD;
      sepsis with hypotension or shock. In this prospective study of 233 febrile adult patients&#xD;
      with suspected infection, 26 were diagnosed with severe sepsis with septic shock, 44 with&#xD;
      severe sepsis without septic shock, 100 with sepsis, 43 with infection without SIRS and 20&#xD;
      with SIRS without infection. Using a cut-off of 15ng/mL, HBP showed a sensitivity in&#xD;
      diagnosing severe sepsis (with or without septic shock) of 87.1%, a specificity of 95.1%, a&#xD;
      positive predictive value (PPV) of 88.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.5%,&#xD;
      which exceeded those values obtained for the other tested markers. Receiver-operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curves also demonstrated that HBP was the best predictor of severe&#xD;
      sepsis, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.95. It is therefore hypothesised that&#xD;
      HBP may be used for the early identification of patients at risk of developing severe sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock. In addition, it was observed that 20 of the patients with severe sepsis&#xD;
      were monitored with serial plasma sample collection during the course of the disease, and&#xD;
      that the 18 of these patients who survived had HBP levels that decreased rapidly when the&#xD;
      clinical signs improved and the blood pressures were normalised. It is therefore further&#xD;
      hypothesised that a decrease in HBP levels may be used to predict survival.&#xD;
