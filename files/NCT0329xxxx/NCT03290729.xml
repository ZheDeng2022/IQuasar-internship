  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a multicentric prospective clinical trial to assess the clinical,&#xD;
      biological and patient's perceived success of new wedge-shaped dental implants inserted in&#xD;
      narrow ridges.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the loss of dental elements, the bone crest undergoes a significant remodeling. Bone&#xD;
      resorption begins immediately after dental extraction with a 40-60% reduction in horizontal&#xD;
      and vertical direction of the alveolar ridge during the first 2 years. The most significant&#xD;
      bone loss after tooth extraction occurs within the first 3 months, although modeling and&#xD;
      remodeling of the alveoli have a great variability of time: bone structure and organization&#xD;
      may not be complete even 24 weeks after dental extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now known that crestal remodeling is closely related to the disappearance of the bundle&#xD;
      bone, which is more representative of the buccal appearance of the alveolus. Its&#xD;
      disappearance, especially in thin periodontal biotopes, can lead to significant recessions of&#xD;
      hard and soft tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, with a variable percentage, in many patients, crestal resorption continues over&#xD;
      time due to a combination of factors involved: anatomical, metabolic and mechanical. Among&#xD;
      these, the use of removable total or partial dentures can play an important role in&#xD;
      accelerating the resurfacing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these premises, it is common to find patients with atrophic crests when processing plans&#xD;
      that provide implant support prosthetic rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crestal bone thickness of at least 6 mm in the buco-lingual sense is considered sufficient&#xD;
      to safely place a plant with a diameter of 4 mm. But when the width is lower, a variety of&#xD;
      procedures and techniques have been proposed in literature that allow recreate the volumes&#xD;
      needed for implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Horizontal lifting techniques with bone blocks (autologous, alloplastic, xeno-graft), guided&#xD;
      bone regeneration, crest expansion technique have demonstrated a good long-term&#xD;
      predictability of the inserted devices. However, some negatives related to these techniques&#xD;
      need to be considered, such as increased morbidity for the patient, demand for advanced&#xD;
      surgical skills for the operator, increased treatment costs, and increased therapy times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of these observations, a new implant design has been proposed for specific use in&#xD;
      narrow ridges. Its wedge shape and press-fit insertion make it possible to position it with a&#xD;
      minimally invasive preparation of the implant site, performed with ultrasound technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the use of this implant could allow effective and minimally invasive treatment of&#xD;
      narrow edentulous crests up to 4 mm, with significant benefits to the patient in terms of&#xD;
      morbidity, treatment costs and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve clinical centers will treat patients with insertion of wedge-shaped implants in thin&#xD;
      crests with a specific surgical protocol and clinical outcomes will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen medical device will be the Rex Tissue Level implant System. For each implant&#xD;
      inserted, the clinical parameters will be recorded up to 5 years after insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, intermediate evaluations will be carried out at 1 year and 3 years after&#xD;
      installation.&#xD;
