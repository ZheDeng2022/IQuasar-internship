  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the patients' perspective, the most formidable part of the colonoscopy experience is the&#xD;
      process of bowel cleansing. A poorly tolerated bowel preparation regimen often leads to&#xD;
      incompletion of scheduled colonoscopies which in turn undermines the effectiveness of&#xD;
      colonoscopy, increases cost, and decreases patient satisfaction. The current standard bowel&#xD;
      preparation in the VA is of larger volume and less palatable than another commonly used bowel&#xD;
      preparation regimen. The investigators propose to compare these two commonly used bowel&#xD;
      preparations with respect to the overall completion rate of scheduled colonoscopies in a&#xD;
      real-world VA practice setting. The results of the study can be immediately applied to&#xD;
      maximize the effectiveness of colonoscopy and increase patient satisfaction in the VA.&#xD;

      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: by identifying a colonoscopy bowel preparation&#xD;
      regimen which is the most effective in real-world VA practice and can be immediately&#xD;
      implemented on a VA-wide scale, the proposed study will maximize the effectiveness of&#xD;
      colonoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) risk among Veterans, increase Veteran&#xD;
      satisfaction, and reduce VA healthcare cost. Background: CRC is a leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related death among Veterans. Colonoscopy can effectively reduce CRC incidence and&#xD;
      mortality. However, non-adherence to screening colonoscopy substantially undermines this&#xD;
      benefit. Existing evidence indicates that a disagreeable bowel preparation is a leading&#xD;
      barrier to completing a colonoscopy from the patients' perspective. The taste and the volume&#xD;
      of the bowel preparation determine patient tolerability and compliance to the preparation&#xD;
      instructions, which in turn affects the incompletion (e.g., cancellation/no-show/reschedule)&#xD;
      rate of scheduled colonoscopies as well as the effectiveness of the completed colonoscopies&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction. The two most commonly used preparations currently in the US are the&#xD;
      split-dose 4L polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the split-dose 2L MiraLAX/Gatorade preparations.&#xD;
      While a high-volume regimen may in theory be more effective than a lower volume one, it may&#xD;
      be associated with lower tolerability and adherence in real-world practice. Three small&#xD;
      trials have compared these two preparations. However, data from these explanatory trials&#xD;
      cannot inform policy decisions because they were conducted under artificial conditions,&#xD;
      restricted among narrow patient populations, and most importantly not designed to capture the&#xD;
      full impact of bowel preparation on the completion rate or effectiveness of colonoscopy. To&#xD;
      address this critical knowledge gap, the investigators are proposing a pragmatic trial to&#xD;
      determine the optimal split-dose bowel preparation in the general Veteran population.&#xD;
      Objectives: to compare the real-world effectiveness of the two most commonly used split-dose&#xD;
      colonoscopy bowel preparation regimens in the US (i.e., 4L PEG and 2L MiraLAX/Gatorade) with&#xD;
      respect to the completion rate of scheduled colonoscopies, adenoma detection rate and&#xD;
      secondarily preparation quality, cancellation/no-show rate and patient-oriented outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g., willingness to repeat the preparation).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt; 18 years of age, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  being scheduled for outpatient elective screening, surveillance or diagnostic&#xD;
             colonoscopies, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the provider ordering the colonoscopy giving permission to enroll the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  undergoing inpatient colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  those with contra-indications to receiving the standard 4L PEG-ELS colonoscopy bowel&#xD;
             preparation (e.g., allergy to PEG) will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The investigators are excluding inpatient colonoscopies because they account for&#xD;
                  a very small fraction of the total colonoscopies performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Also, inpatient colonoscopies are often performed for urgent reasons such that&#xD;
                  rapid bowel preparation procedures are followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, because the objective of inpatient colonoscopy is often not to look for&#xD;
             small polyps, the threshold for &quot;adequate&quot; bowel preparation quality might be&#xD;
             different from that for outpatient procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, for patients undergoing more than 1 colonoscopy during the study period,&#xD;
             only their first colonoscopy will be included in the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are undergoing a repeat colonoscopy for to a recent inadequate&#xD;
             colonoscopy examination with poor bowel preparation will be excluded.&#xD;
