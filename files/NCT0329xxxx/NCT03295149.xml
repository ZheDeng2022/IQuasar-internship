  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a respiratory disorder characterized by frequent&#xD;
      breathing cessations (apneas) or partial collapses (hypopneas) during sleep. SAHS is linked&#xD;
      with the most important causes of death in adults from industrialized countries. Metabolic&#xD;
      deregulation and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      stroke, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, could affect people having untreated&#xD;
      SAHS. The gold standard method for SAHS diagnosis is in-hospital, technician-attended&#xD;
      nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). Nevertheless, this methodology is labor-intensive,&#xD;
      time-consuming, and relatively unavailable, especially in low-resource settings. These&#xD;
      drawbacks have led to large waiting lists, which delay diagnosis and treatment and limits its&#xD;
      effectiveness as single diagnostic method for SAHS. Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse&#xD;
      rate (PR) from nocturnal pulse oximetry (NPO) provide relevant and essential information to&#xD;
      detect apneas. In addition, it is significantly less intrusive for patients and it can be&#xD;
      easily recorded at patients' home. In the same way, automated signal processing and pattern&#xD;
      recognition techniques have demonstrated to provide accurate tools able to detect and&#xD;
      effectively use this information. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that automated&#xD;
      pattern recognition of at-home NPO recordings could provide reliable and efficient tools able&#xD;
      to simplify the management of SAHS. The aim of this study is two-fold: 1) to prospectively&#xD;
      assess the reliability and effectiveness of at-home NPO in the context of adult SAHS; 2) to&#xD;
      design, optimize and extensively assess the diagnostic performance of automated NPO-based&#xD;
      screening tools for SAHS. In order to achieve these goals, both PSG and NPO recordings are&#xD;
      carried out ambulatory and simultaneously at patient's home. A portable polysomnograph&#xD;
      (Embletta MPR, Natus) is used for standard PSG at home, whereas a portable wrist-worn pulse&#xD;
      oximeter (WristOX2 3150, Nonin) is used for ambulatory NPO. In addition, conventional in-lab&#xD;
      PSG and attended pulse oximetry are also performed simultaneously in the hospital facilities.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are recruited from the specialized sleep outpatient facilities of the Río&#xD;
      Hortega University Hospital from Valladolid (Spain). All patients are referred from primary&#xD;
      care due to moderate-to-high clinical suspicion of suffering from sleep apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      syndrome (SAHS). The final population is randomly split into two independent datasets: 1)&#xD;
      training set (50%), which is used to design and build/train the screening algorithms; and 2)&#xD;
      the test set (remaining 50%), which is used to further assess performance using unseen data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Academy of Sleep Medicine rules are used to score respiratory events and to&#xD;
      obtain the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from ambulatory PSG at home, which is used to&#xD;
      definitively diagnose SAHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portable wrist-worn pulse oximeter (WristOX2 3150, Nonin) is used for at-home NPO. Portable&#xD;
      NPO is carried out simultaneously to ambulatory PSG (Embletta MPR, Natus) at patient's home.&#xD;
      In addition, attended portable in-lab NPO (WristOX2 3150, Nonin) and in-lab PSG (E-Series,&#xD;
      Compumedics) are performed simultaneously in the hospital in a different consecutive/previous&#xD;
      night for comparison purposes. Participants are randomly assigned to carry out unattended&#xD;
      sleep studies at home before or after in-hospital recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2 and PR from NPO are recorded simultaneously at a sampling rate of 1 Hz (1 sample every&#xD;
      second). All recordings are saved to separate files and processed offline. An automatic&#xD;
      signal pre-processing stage is carried out to remove artifacts due to patient movements&#xD;
      (signal loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signal processing methodology is divided into three automated stages: (i) feature&#xD;
      extraction, (ii) feature selection, and (iii) pattern recognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, NPO recordings are parameterized by means of a wide set of variables, which&#xD;
      previously demonstrated a high discriminative power in the context of SAHS detection. All&#xD;
      features are computed for each whole portable overnight recording. The following feature&#xD;
      subsets are composed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time domain statistics from SpO2 recordings. First to fourth-order statistical moments&#xD;
           in the time domain, i.e., arithmetic mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis, which&#xD;
           quantify central tendency, amount of dispersion, asymmetry, and peakedness,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time domain features from PR recordings: average, standard deviation, and root mean&#xD;
           square of standard deviation of the pulse-to-pulse interval time series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency domain statistics from SpO2 recordings. First to fourth-order statistical&#xD;
           moments, median frequency, and Shannon spectral entropy from the power spectral density&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency domain statistics from PR recordings. First to fourth-order statistical&#xD;
           moments, median frequency, and Shannon spectral entropy from the power spectral density&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional spectral measures from SpO2 recordings. Total signal power as well as peak&#xD;
           amplitude and relative power in the frequency range 0.014 - 0.033 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional spectral measures from PR recordings. Normalized power in the low (0.04 -&#xD;
           0.15 Hz) and in the high (0.15 - 0.40 Hz) frequency bands, as well as the low frequency&#xD;
           to high frequency ratio (sympathovagal balance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonlinear features from SpO2 recordings. Sample entropy, central tendency measure, and&#xD;
           Lempel - Ziv complexity, which measure irregularity, variability, and complexity of SpO2&#xD;
           recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonlinear features from PR recordings. Sample entropy, central tendency measure, and&#xD;
           Lempel - Ziv complexity, which measure irregularity, variability, and complexity of PR&#xD;
           recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the optimum feature subset composed of the most relevant as well as complementary&#xD;
      variables are composed. In order to achieve this goal, the following feature selection&#xD;
      methods are applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forward stepwise feature selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic algorithms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fast correlation-based filter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal-redundancy maximal-relevance criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the third stage corresponds to patter recognition. The aim of this stage is&#xD;
      two-fold: (i) to design and optimize binary classification-oriented models trained to discern&#xD;
      between SAHS negative and SAHS positive subjects using optimum features from NPO; (ii) to&#xD;
      design and optimize regression-oriented models trained to estimate the AHI using optimum&#xD;
      features from NPO. In order to achieve this goal, the following pattern recognition&#xD;
      algorithms are assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binary classification: logistic regression, artificial neural networks, Bayesian&#xD;
           networks, decision trees, ensemble learning (AdaBoost).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regression models: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, Bayesian&#xD;
           networks, ensemble learning (least squares boosting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These models are subsequently combined to optimize the following 2-stage screening protocol:&#xD;
      stage-1) true negative screening stage, which is aimed at detecting the maximum number of&#xD;
      non-SAHS subjects while minimizing the number of false negative patients (ideally 0% false&#xD;
      positive rate); stage-2) true positive screening stage, which is aimed at detecting (among&#xD;
      patients not identified as true negative in the first stage) the maximum number of true&#xD;
      positive patients while minimizing the number of false positive cases (ideally 0% false&#xD;
      positive rate). Both stages are complementary and they are implemented consecutively, such&#xD;
      that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients identified as true negative in the first stage are referred to the sleep&#xD;
           specialist to finally discard SAHS taken into account symptoms, comorbidities and past&#xD;
           clinical history. These patients are no longer derived to the sleep unit unless&#xD;
           requested by the sleep specialist due to persistent and/or additional symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients identified as true positive in the second stage are referred to the sleep&#xD;
           specialist to finally confirm SAHS and decide the most suitable treatment option. These&#xD;
           patients are no longer derived to the sleep unit unless requested by the sleep&#xD;
           specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-conclusive cases are finally derived to the sleep unit for a standard PSG in order&#xD;
           to confirm/discard SAHS.&#xD;
