    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if using an electrical stimulation machine to see&#xD;
      if it can help strengthen the muscles around the hip during the first three months post&#xD;
      pelvic fracture will help with the early stages of rehabilitation. Electrical stimulation is&#xD;
      a treatment machine that uses an electrical current to cause a single muscle or a group of&#xD;
      muscles to contract. This contraction helps strengthen injured muscles and helps with the&#xD;
      healing process. It can also help with pain relief by blocking pain signals from the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a pelvic fracture they are surgically fixed and will be advised not to put any weight&#xD;
      on the operated leg for 10 weeks. During this time hip muscles become very weak as they will&#xD;
      not be used as much as normal. Bed exercises can help keep muscle strength but this study&#xD;
      would like to try using electrical stimulation machines alongside bed exercises to see if it&#xD;
      can improve muscle strength even more. Electrical stimulation machines are already used by&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Electrical stimulation is a treatment machine that uses an electrical current&#xD;

&#xD;
      Participants will be put into one of two groups, both groups will be given an electrical&#xD;
      stimulation machine but one will be on a placebo setting. Participants will need to use the&#xD;
      machine twice a day along with their bed exercises and will need to fill in a diary when and&#xD;
      how many times the machine has been used for 10 weeks until their 12 week appointment with&#xD;
      the orthopaedic consultant. The participants weight bearing status will change and they will&#xD;
      be asked to perform a muscle strength test on both the operated and nonoperated leg. They&#xD;
      will also have their walking quality assessed. The results will compare both groups for&#xD;
      muscle strength and walking changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects who wish to enter the study will be fully screened and consented by the Chief&#xD;
      Investigator, or an appropriate delegate. The Royal London is the largest major trauma centre&#xD;
      in London and fixes more pelvic fractures than any other hospital. The orthopedic team will&#xD;
      surgically fix between two and six pelvic fractures per week which should meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Pelvic fractures are surgically fixed and then will be instructed to put no weight&#xD;
      through the operated limb for 10-12 weeks by the orthopedic consultant. The physiotherapist&#xD;
      will give the patient a bed exercise programme day one post operation as per standard&#xD;
      practice which consists of hip range of movement exercises and gentle strengthening exercises&#xD;
      for muscles around the hip and thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chief investigator will be part of the patient's normal healthcare team and will identify&#xD;
      eligible participants. The participants will be recruited one week post operation to give the&#xD;
      patient time to recover from their surgery but not allow for loss in muscle mass. The&#xD;
      research assistant will approach the participant 24 hours prior to this and explain the&#xD;
      demands of the study and what it will involve allowing the participant 24 hours to discuss&#xD;
      this with family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 24 hour period the chief investigator will also be present to answer any questions&#xD;
      about the study. The participant will be expected to provide written informed consent and&#xD;
      will be expected to sign the treatment contract which outlines the responsibilities of the&#xD;
      participant and the chief investigator. On discharge a six week follow up appointment in&#xD;
      fracture clinic will be arranged in which both the consultant and chief investigator will be&#xD;
      present to complete the EQ5D questionnaire and monitor compliance within the first six weeks&#xD;
      of the intervention. At 10 weeks the participant will have a further fracture clinic&#xD;
      appointment in which they are expected to bring back the machine and make a short journey to&#xD;
      the human performance laboratory and Queen Mary's University to complete their gait analysis&#xD;
      and strength testing along with a further EQ5D questionnaire, this will be the end of the&#xD;
      study and the participants are free to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple random sampling will be used with a free randomisation computer programme&#xD;
      (www.sealedenvelopes.co.uk). When the patient has consented to the study the chief&#xD;
      investigator will enter the participant unique study number into the website whilst the&#xD;
      participant can read the patient information sheet and treatment contract and it will&#xD;
      randomly allocate into treatment (NMES) or placebo (TENS) group. If a participant withdrew&#xD;
      from the study a new participant could not replace this participant but be randomly allocated&#xD;
      into a group as a new patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding/ Emergency unblinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent assessor will be blinded to participant allocation when testing at 10 weeks&#xD;
      for both the gait analysis and peak torque measurements. All participants will be blinded to&#xD;
      group allocation and will all be given identical machines on different settings. The&#xD;
      principle investigator will complete the randomisation procedure and will be aware of group&#xD;
      allocation for monitoring and safety purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment/intervention plan and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to the NMES group will be given an information booklet on NMES machines&#xD;
      and the principle researcher will explain and demonstrate how to use the machines. The Cefar&#xD;
      Compex three electrical stimulator will be used and demonstrates valid results from previous&#xD;
      studies (Billot et al 2010., Gondin et al 2005., and Maffiuletti et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are expected to use the NMES machine for half an hour and complete bed exercises&#xD;
      twice daily. They will be activating two of their muscles at the same time and will not be&#xD;
      expected to complete the bed exercises and NMES together. Patients should relax during the&#xD;
      NMES as completing both does not demonstrate better results, due to unsynchronised activation&#xD;
      of the NMES (Gregory &amp; Bickel, 2005). Using the machine once daily will allow for the&#xD;
      recovery of the muscle. A voluntary contraction would normally be 20-30Hz but due to the high&#xD;
      intensities of the NMES (35-75Hz) it can cause muscle fatigue (Maffiuletti, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use the muscle reinforcement rehabilitation protocol below which increases&#xD;
      from 4Hz to 85Hz allowing slow and fast twitch muscle fibre recruitment. This protocol is&#xD;
      used for participants who have had minimal loss of muscle bulk and starts with small currents&#xD;
      and slowly builds up as the patient becomes accustom to the sensation of the machine.&#xD;
      Patients are expected to increase the intensity, as higher intensity can increase activation&#xD;
      of more muscle fibres (Stevens-Lapsley et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional treatment/ interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo group will act as the control group. They will be expected to complete the same&#xD;
      regime as previously described above, however these machines will be on TENS setting&#xD;
      (80-100Hz) as even low Hz can trigger motor stimulation (Paillard 2008). This setting is&#xD;
      designed as a sensory stimulus therefore will have no effects on muscle strength however the&#xD;
      patient will feel a small twitch sensation. This setting is not painful and will have no&#xD;
      effect on muscle fatigue. The patient will not be expected to complete the bed exercises and&#xD;
      the TENS session together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experts within orthopedic rehabilitation concluded a 20% difference between operated and&#xD;
      non-operated post intervention would be of clinical relevance. A randomized feasibility study&#xD;
      was completed previously in which the results were used to calculate a power calculation for&#xD;
      this specific trial. The value of 0.25 represents the standard deviation achieved when&#xD;
      comparing the NMES and the placebo group in the previous study. The 0.2 is 20% calculated&#xD;
      into a ratio which is needed to achieve clinical relevance. This power calculation indicates&#xD;
      25 participants are needed for each group to achieve statistical significance 50 participants&#xD;
      in total. The orthopedic team will surgically fix between two and six pelvic fractures per&#xD;
      week which should meet the inclusion criteria. Dropout rates will be small as it is a six&#xD;
      week intervention. Patients will receive weekly phone calls and text reminders monitoring&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N= (1.96+0.84)2 x 2 x 0.252 0.22 = 25 per group (50 in total)&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.2/ 0.25 = the standard deviation achieved when comparing treatment to placebo in peak&#xD;
      torque differences&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.2 = is the ratio / 20% difference between the treatment and placebo group in abductors&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent experimental design using an independent test will be suitable to assess the&#xD;
      data for this study. Both the placebo and NMES group will have different interventions and&#xD;
      will therefore not be measured using a pre and post design. Due to the adequate sample size&#xD;
      it will be appropriate to use a parametric statistical test. A Paired T-test will be used to&#xD;
      analyse the data from the EQ5D questionnaire as they are taken at six and 12 weeks during the&#xD;
      intervention with the same participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Spearman's rank correlation test will be used to compare changes with compliance levels in&#xD;
      both bed exercises and NMES use in the NMES group and compared to the changes in peak torque&#xD;
      to assess the relationship between the two variables. The same will be completed between the&#xD;
      intensity level of the NMES and the changes in peak torque within the NMES group. Variables&#xD;
      can be seen in table format below:&#xD;
