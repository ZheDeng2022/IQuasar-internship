  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays Endocrowns are classified as conservative treatment modality for restoration of&#xD;
      Endodontically treated teeth in which pulp chamber is used as a retentive resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advancement in technology in the field of adhesive dentistry its use is increasing&#xD;
      day by day in clinical practice. Acid Etchable ceramics such as lithium Disilicate based&#xD;
      ceramics are the gold standard ceramic material used for Endocrowns. The Etchable property&#xD;
      and the translucent character of lithium Disilicate enhance strength and esthetic property.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new material CERASMART (Force Absorbing Flexible nano ceramic CAD/CAM block) contain high&#xD;
      density of ultrafine glass particles with 71 wt% filled nano-composite. It combines high&#xD;
      strength and unique aesthetics. full homogeneous and even distribution of nano ceramic&#xD;
      network lead to unique physical properties for cerasmart . Uniform scuttle (very short&#xD;
      inter-particle distance) of silanated and bonded particles is key to delivering CERASMART's™&#xD;
      with high strength and acceptable level of marginal adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, it can perfectly use in posterior, anterior, inlay, onlay, and implant restorations and&#xD;
      also enables minimum tooth reduction for more conservative restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awad et al (1) found that Cerasmart showed significantly higher flexural strength and modulus&#xD;
      of elasticity, with lower flexural modulus values compared to other groups. Also, result in&#xD;
      smoother margins compared with other types of ceramic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, present research will evaluate patient satisfaction, bonding properties and marginal&#xD;
      adaptation&#xD;

      This study will carried out on patients collected from the dental clinics in fixed&#xD;
      prosthodontics clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University&#xD;
&#xD;
      the visits will be designed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      .1st visit: (N.N) will call participants before tooth preparation procedure for X-ray&#xD;
      reviewing and pre-operative photographing using a Professional digital camera also;&#xD;
      Impression will be taken using the alginate impression material * for study cast analysis&#xD;
      with suitable stock tray** size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to sign consent form written in patient native language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd visit: (Tooth preparation) After performing adequate disinfection and sterilization&#xD;
      process for each instrument and tools will be used in this trial; the anesthetic solution&#xD;
      (Anesthetic solution: Septanest SP, 4%, Septodont, France.) will be injected using&#xD;
      infiltration technique. Then patients will be left from five to ten minutes then; the&#xD;
      operator will check with the subjective for anasthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full preparation will be carried out following the principles of Endocrown preparation with&#xD;
      deep chamfer finish line while 2 observers will select visually the appropriate shade. Final&#xD;
      vinylpolysiloxane impressions will be taken for each participant in each groupusing the&#xD;
      suitable tray size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After final setting impressions will be checked for accuracy using magnifying loops&#xD;
      (Magnifying loop: Univet optical technologies, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then protemp temporary endocrowns ) Temporary crown material: Structure, Voco, GMBH,&#xD;
      Germany.( will be cemented using eugenol free (Temporary cement: RelyX Temp, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impressions will be sent to the lab, poured with extra hard stone material. Then it will be&#xD;
      removed from the impression after complete setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endorowns for each patient will be fabricated using either lithium di-silicate material&#xD;
      (Emax) or Cerasmart blocks according to the random allocation of the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      3rd visit: Participants will be called again for final cementation. Temporary crown will be&#xD;
      removed and abutments will be cleaned of any residues using pumice slurry ) Pumice slurry:&#xD;
      DCL, Dental composite LTD, England.( applied with bristle brush and rubber cup under water&#xD;
      irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper isolation will be done before cementation then permanent dual cure resin cement&#xD;
      (Permanent cement: Bifix-QM, Voco Gmbh, Germany ) will be used for luting of permanent crowns&#xD;
      according to manufacturer instructions. Ask the patients to hold the crown under occlusal&#xD;
      compression until luting cement polymerization. 5 minutes later, excess cement will be&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring of different outcomes will start in this visit for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessment surveys (clinical evaluations) will done for both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be recalled after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. For each recall examination,&#xD;
      evaluator will performed the direct clinical evaluation using modified USPHS criteria for&#xD;
      margin integrity and gross fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual inspection will be used for gross fracture evaluation. Endorowns that intact and fully&#xD;
      retained will be rated 'Alfa', Endocrowns with partially retained with some portion of the&#xD;
      restoration still intact will be rated as 'Bravo'and endocrowns completely missing will be&#xD;
      rated as 'Charlie'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual inspection and explorer will be using for marginal integrity evaluation. Endocrowns&#xD;
      with no catch with The explorer and no visible crevice along the periphery of the restoration&#xD;
      will be rated as Alpha (A), Endocrowns with explorer catches with visible evidence of a&#xD;
      crevice, with and/or the base is not exposed, and the restoration is not mobile will be rated&#xD;
      as Bravo (B) and endocrowms with explorer penetrates and extended to the dento-enamel&#xD;
      junction will be rated as Charlie ©.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, questionnaires will be used to evaluate patients' satisfaction and potential&#xD;
      postoperative discomfort as the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are you satisfied with your endocrown appearance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are you satisfied with your endocrown shade?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do you feel your endocrown are poorly aligned?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do you feel your endocrown are protruding?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are you hiding your teeth while smiling?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence improvement session will be taking place in the initial visit. This session will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient will be informed about the study steps and maintain oral hygiene.&#xD;
           Subsequent sessions will occur at the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be trained for tooth brushing, flossing and instructed all oral&#xD;
           hygiene methods after each meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instruct the patients to record any abnormalities or mobility in endocrowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recall appointment will be performed every two months for aduration of one year to&#xD;
           stress on oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
