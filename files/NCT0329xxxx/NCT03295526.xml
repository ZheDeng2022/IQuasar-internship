&#xD;
      Study on selective pelvic lymphadenectomy for IB - IIA cervical cancer Researcher: Wu Xiaohua&#xD;
      Research Center: Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center The trial is expected to last for 3&#xD;
      years Test objectives： The primary goal：The overall therapeutic effect of patients with&#xD;
      selective lymphadenectomy was not inferior to patients with systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goal: Selective lymphadenectomy can reduce the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      postoperative lower limb lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed for prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials. The number of&#xD;
      subjects: 200 cases. Research groupings Selective pelvic lymphadenectomy group and The&#xD;
      control group was treated with systematic pelvic lymph node dissection group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up time: 3 years Sample size: 200 cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-poin:t three-year survival (overall survival, progression-free survival)&#xD;
      Secondary end point: lower limb lymph node lymphedema&#xD;

      Overall objective For cervical cancer patients with confirmed lymph node metastasis by&#xD;
      intraoperative frozen pathology, the overall treatment effect of radical hysterectomy and&#xD;
      selective enlarged lymph node dissection is not inferior to systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      and can reduce postoperative lower limb lymphedema incidence and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The purpose of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess whether the progression free survival of patients with selective enlarged&#xD;
           pelvic lymph node resection is better than patients with systematic pelvic lymph node&#xD;
           dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate differences of the incidence and severity of lymphedema between the two&#xD;
           group patients using Lymphedema Staging standards (Stage 0-3) according to the&quot;consensus&#xD;
           document&quot;of the International Society of Lymphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Preoperative evaluation LEEP, conization or biopsy Vagino-recto-abdominal examination +&#xD;
      Vaginal / vaginal colposcopy examination History of Medical, surgical and childbearing&#xD;
      Complications Physical condition Height and weight History of smoking Pregnancy test Chest&#xD;
      X-ray or chest CT or general PET/CT Abdominal CT or general PET/CT Pelvic MRI/CT or general&#xD;
      PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Protocol Patients with stage IB-IIa cervical cancer were randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups(Control group and Experimental group).Frozen pathological examination will be&#xD;
      performed during the operation, and patients with positive lymph node metastasis will undergo&#xD;
      radical hysterectomy and systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy or radical hysterectomy and&#xD;
      selective enlarged lymph node dissection according to the patient's group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Postoperative adjuvant therapy All patients with pelvic lymph node metastasis are required&#xD;
      to receive DDP based concurrent chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.Efficacy evaluation Overall survival (OS): The period from randomization to death for any&#xD;
      cause (for patients who have been loss to follow-up prior to death, the last follow-up time&#xD;
      is calculated as the time of death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression free survival (PFS): The duration from randomization to the earliest date of the&#xD;
      date of tumor progression or the date of death for any cause. If the above standards are not&#xD;
      met, the final evaluation date should be used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of lymphedema in lower extremities: Lymphedema Staging standards (Stage 0-3)&#xD;
      according to the&quot;consensus document&quot;of the International Society of Lymphology were used :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 0 Subclinical with possible clinical evolution Stage I Edema regressing with treatments&#xD;
      with positive pitting test Stage II Edema partially regressing with treatments with negative&#xD;
      pitting test Stage III Elephantiasis with cutaneous complications and recurrent infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Follow up The patients were followed up every 3 months for the first year, every 4 months&#xD;
      for the second year and every 6 months from the third year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to routine oncologic follow-up, the stage of patients̛ lower extremity lymphedema&#xD;
      should also be evaluated.&#xD;
