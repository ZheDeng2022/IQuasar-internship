  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) affects patients' quality of life in different dimensions. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is considered a priority to design and create specialized intervention programs in order&#xD;
      to prevent and decrease complications. The peer support program studies have shown to&#xD;
      Increase adherence to treatment and the proportion of patients with adequate long-term&#xD;
      metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits that these programs bring are the social and emotional support in the daily&#xD;
      management of the disease through shared experiences and communication in a continuous way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only a few peer support programs in Mexico, thus it is required to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of their implementation in our environment to promote empowerment and maintain&#xD;
      long-term lifestyle changes. The present study has the objective to enhance self-care&#xD;
      behaviors and health empowerment in patients with diabetes through peer support.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional model of attention has not been able to face the diabetes epidemic mainly&#xD;
      because it is treated like an acute disease instead of like a chronic condition. Given that&#xD;
      it requires a continuous and integrated management that cares for all the aspects of the&#xD;
      patient's disease, it is fundamental that the patients learn to live with diabetes, and to&#xD;
      manage it effectively to improve their life quality and reduce the risks of long term&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peer support programs include people who live with the same condition (patients,&#xD;
      relatives and friends) who have received training related to their treatment, becoming an&#xD;
      important social, emotional and practical support in the daily care of chronic diseases.They&#xD;
      become comfortable enough as to share their emotions and experiences with other patients with&#xD;
      their same condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that the patients with diabetes who commit to provide peer support to&#xD;
      others also improve their self-care and glycemic long-term control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meetings with group leaders consist discussions among the patients where they share&#xD;
      experiences and solutions to barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Center of Comprehensive Care for the Patient with Diabetes (CAIPaDi) was created with the&#xD;
      objective of investigating about new strategies to promote empowerment, self-efficacy and the&#xD;
      reach of metabolic control in order to prevent diabetes complications (protocol &quot;Validation&#xD;
      of an integrated attention model for the patient with type 2 diabetes&quot; reference number&#xD;
      1198). The inclusion criteria are: less than 5 years of diagnosis of diabetes, absence of&#xD;
      chronic complications, not smoking and having a relative to join them in all the sessions.&#xD;
      The program consists of 4 initial visits, one per month, and includes attention from 9&#xD;
      specialties: endocrinology, psychology, nutrition, ophthalmology, diabetes education,&#xD;
      odontology, physical activity, foot care and psychiatry. Upon conclusion of the fourth visit,&#xD;
      a counter-reference of each patient is sent to their corresponding particular physician. In&#xD;
      this report, each specialty explains in a detailed manner the strengths and opportunity areas&#xD;
      of the patient. Afterwards, the patient is given an appointment a year after concluding the&#xD;
      first phase of the program (visit 5) and a year after this visit (visit 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Identification of the &quot;group leaders&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be invited and asked to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent, afterwards they will attend 7 training sessions of 60 minutes each, the following&#xD;
      topics will be assessed in each of them:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reinforcement of the metabolic control goals and most common problems in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-care activities: detection and appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia, glucose&#xD;
           self-monitoring, foot care and actions on concomitant diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adherence to meal plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Structuration of activities to increase physical activity or diminish sedentarism and&#xD;
           measurement methods (steps per day, identification of exercise intensity levels)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Emotional aspects of diabetes (duel and motivation stages)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Adhesion to pharmacologic treatment (medications and insulin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will be arranged by a team researcher and will be structured in the following&#xD;
      way:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 minutes: reminder of activities and resolution of doubts from the previous session 50&#xD;
      minutes: new subject of each session&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient has completed the training, an objective structured clinical evaluation&#xD;
      will be performed. The patients who approve the evaluation will receive a group management&#xD;
      session where they will obtain the necessary skills to motivate and transmit information to&#xD;
      the rest of the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Integration of patient groups All the patients who finish the fourth visit in the&#xD;
      centre will be invited, those who accept will be randomized into participants or control&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will be formed by 2 group leaders and 5 patients. The minimum number of&#xD;
      participants per session will be 2 (one leader and one patient). Five sessions are projected,&#xD;
      one every 2 months, where the next topics will be reviewed in each of them:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of motivation and duel stages&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reinforcement of metabolic control goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-care activities:detection and appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia, glucose&#xD;
           self-monitoring, foot care and actions on concomitant diseases and insulin application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Enhancement of adhesion to simplified meal plan and recognition of portions&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Structuration of activities to boost physical activity and/or reduce sedentarism and how&#xD;
           to measure it (steps per day and identification of exercise intensity levels)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational messages and reminders will be created and sent by WhatsApp (cross-platform&#xD;
      instant messaging application) weekly to patients, controls and group leaders to strengthen&#xD;
      adhesion to integral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every session will be carried out in the facilities of the centre, where the leaders will&#xD;
      share their experiences with the rest of the group to reinforce self-care activities.&#xD;
