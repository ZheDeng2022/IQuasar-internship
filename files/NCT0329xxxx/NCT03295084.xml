    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral administration of&#xD;
      irinotecan in adult patients. Oral irinotecan will be administered as monotherapy in a dose&#xD;
      escalation trial to establish the Maximal Tolerated Dose. Totally 25 patients will be treated&#xD;
      with irinotecan tablets as mono-therapy. As an extension trial 12 patients will be treated&#xD;
      with oral irinotecan in combination with oral capecitabine&#xD;

      The study is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation single center study in patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors. The study will investigate safety, tolerability and Maximal Tolerated Dose as&#xD;
      primary end-points of an irinotecan tablet given as single agent or in combination with oral&#xD;
      capecitabine. Secondary end-points are pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3 patients will be treated on selected dose level with oral irinotecan in order to&#xD;
      identify Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD). Totally 12 subjects&#xD;
      will be treated at the MTD level. Patients will receive irinotecan tablets once daily in the&#xD;
      morning for 14 consecutive days within 3 week treatment cycles. As an extension trial totally&#xD;
      12 subjects will be treated with oral irinotecan in combination with oral capecitabine.&#xD;
      Patients treated in combination therapy will receive irinotecan tablets once daily in the&#xD;
      morning for 14 consecutive days in combination with capecitabine dosed twice daily for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days within 3 week treatment cycles.&#xD;
