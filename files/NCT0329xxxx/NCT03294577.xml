    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the percentage of patients with Duration of&#xD;
      Severe Neutropenia (DSN) =0 in patients treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) + pegfilgrastim versus Docetaxel,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) + combination plinabulin/pegfilgrastim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe neutropenia is an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) will be used as the chemotherapy in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized study, double-blind phase 3 trial. Approximately 222&#xD;
      patients are planned to be enrolled in Phase 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) will be used as the chemotherapy in this&#xD;
      study. These agents are among the most active and commonly used chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;
      employed for treating patients with breast carcinoma. In particular, TAC chemotherapy has&#xD;
      been used for the adjuvant treatment of HER2 negative early breast cancer patients with node&#xD;
      positive disease as well as for node negative breast cancer patients who have a high risk of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plinabulin is a novel small molecule that is being developed for the mitigation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Administered by IV infusion on the same day of&#xD;
      (approximately 1 hour after) chemotherapy (TAC), plinabulin will be given in a single dose&#xD;
      per cycle. Plinabulin is being studied to see if it is a convenient alternative to G-CSF,&#xD;
      pegfilgrastim, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, treatment will be double blinded, approximately 222 patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer are expected to be enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to one of the treatment&#xD;
      arms, with 111 patients enrolled in each arm, with the arm designation and planned&#xD;
      intervention as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: TAC + pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: TAC + pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg) + plinabulin (40 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles 1 to 4 will consist of TAC (or TC for Cycles 2 to 4) administered IV on Day 1 every 21&#xD;
      days. Patients will receive a single dose of plinabulin or placebo IV over 30 minutes (±5&#xD;
      minutes) in a double blinded manner, 30 minutes after the end of the TAC (or TC for Cycles 2&#xD;
      to 4) infusion. On Day 2 of each cycle (≥24 hours after completing chemotherapy), all&#xD;
      patients will receive a single dose of pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term safety follow-up through patients contacts by phone calls, letters or&#xD;
      electronic means; or medical records reviews will be conducted to all subjects approximately&#xD;
      every 6 months up to 5 years to monitor long term safety of plinabulin.&#xD;
