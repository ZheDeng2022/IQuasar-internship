    <textblock>
      This project is intended to develop an evidence-based peer group counseling program that&#xD;
      addresses depressive symptoms in men with physical disabilities. Expanding treatment options&#xD;
      for depressive symptoms in men with physical disabilities will improve their access to care.&#xD;
      The benefits of men with physical disabilities receiving effective treatment for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms include better health, independent living, and longer life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously the investigators developed, tested and disseminated a highly effective peer&#xD;
      counseling program to reduce depressive symptoms in women with physical disabilities (WPDs)&#xD;
      in partnership with Oregon Centers for Independent Living (CILs). WPDs with baseline Center&#xD;
      for Epidemiologic Depression (CES-D) scores &gt;16 demonstrated significant improvement in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms that were sustained over a three month follow-up period (ES partial&#xD;
      eta2=.10). The program is offered by two peers in 14 weekly 2.5 hour group sessions. Our&#xD;
      academic-disability community partnership created Healing Pathways using community-based&#xD;
      participatory research (CBPR) methods and the investigators have sustained our partnership&#xD;
      over 9 years. Healing Pathways is currently publicly funded and offered by four of the seven&#xD;
      CILs in Oregon. The success of Healing Pathways is a direct result of community investment in&#xD;
      and ownership of the program. This project intends to replicate this model to address&#xD;
      depression in men with physical disabilities (MPDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression is a common secondary condition in MPDs, occurring at rates between 37-64%.This is&#xD;
      2-6 times the rate of depression found in non-disabled men. MPDs who work in CILs or other&#xD;
      consumer-controlled non-profit agencies are uniquely situated to address depression in their&#xD;
      peer group. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandated the formation of CILs to maximize the&#xD;
      leadership, empowerment, independence, and productivity of people with disabilities and to&#xD;
      integrate them into mainstream society by providing four core independent living services.&#xD;
      The core services are: information and referral, independent living skills training, peer&#xD;
      counseling, and individual and systems advocacy. CILs are grounded in Independent Living (IL)&#xD;
      philosophy, promulgating inclusion across disability-types, de-medicalization and&#xD;
      de-institutionalization, and the belief that people with disabilities are the best experts on&#xD;
      their own health. There are 403 CILs across the nation, a largely untapped infrastructure&#xD;
      with great potential to augment health services for people with disabilities using a&#xD;
      peer-to-peer model. The sweeping nature of mental health reforms occurring in the span of a&#xD;
      lifetime has given rise to consumer-run peer programs and there is mounting evidence,&#xD;
      including randomized controlled trials, that they are efficacious in improving well-being and&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms. Many persons with chronic mental illness prefer peer programs, finding&#xD;
      them more relatable and empowering than traditional services. Although many MPDs may also&#xD;
      prefer the option of peer counseling compared to traditional psychotherapy, to our knowledge&#xD;
      there are no peer programs that address the co-occurrence of physical disability and&#xD;
      depression in men. The long-term goal of this program of research is to improve mental health&#xD;
      outcomes in people with physical disabilities by partnering with members of this community.&#xD;
      This approach recognizes disability communities as cultural entities, respects the values of&#xD;
      IL philosophy, and emphasizes the interconnection between mental and physical health. The&#xD;
      objective here, the investigators' next step in pursuit of that goal, is to develop and&#xD;
      pilot-test a peer program for MPDs with depression. Using a community-engaged, exploratory&#xD;
      sequential, mixed methods design, this study intends to achieve the following three specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt the Healing Pathways program to meet the needs of MPDs with depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the peer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimate the effect size of the peer program for depressive symptoms. The outcomes of&#xD;
           this study will collectively inform the development of a future randomized controlled&#xD;
           trial of a program designed to treat depressive symptoms in MPDs. Further, the proposed&#xD;
           study addresses several public health goals including Healthy People 2020 goal DH18 to&#xD;
           reduce the proportion of people with disabilities who report serious emotional&#xD;
           distress,24 and the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health goals 1-3, to&#xD;
           understand that mental health is essential to overall health, promote mental health&#xD;
           treatments that are consumer-driven, and eliminate disparities in mental health care.&#xD;
           Because bias against people with disabilities is common among health care providers,&#xD;
           education of future health researchers is also necessary to help meet these goals. As&#xD;
           part of the proposed project, nursing students will received a mentored experience to&#xD;
           support culturally appropriate research with members of the disability community.&#xD;
           Experiences will include didactic instruction, community immersion, and research&#xD;
           training. Development of a cadre of future researchers who have the knowledge,&#xD;
           abilities, and skills to advance the health of people with disabilities through&#xD;
           community partnerships is a goal of the project.&#xD;
