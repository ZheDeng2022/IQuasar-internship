      Phase II clinical trial on the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma (histologically confirmed WHO grade IV glioma), at&#xD;
      documented recurrence/progression following prior treatment with surgery, radiation therapy&#xD;
      and temozolomide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-grade gliomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by profound tumor&#xD;
      related neo-angiogenesis, and intracranial perilesional edema. Glioblastoma (WHO-grade IV&#xD;
      glioma) expresses high levels of VEGF and frequently carries an amplified gene copy numbers&#xD;
      of the VEGFR2, KIT and PDGFR or EGFR genes, key mediators of the process of cancer related&#xD;
      neo-angiogenesis. In patient diagnosed with recurrence/progression glioblastoma (recGB)&#xD;
      following prior therapy with surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide, cytotoxic salvage&#xD;
      therapies resulted in a best overall response rate of 5 to 10%, 6-month PFS rates of 9% to&#xD;
      21%, and a median OS of 25 to 30 weeks. No treatment option has demonstrated to improve the&#xD;
      survival expectancy of recGB patients in a randomized clinical trial. Bevacizumab treatment&#xD;
      has been registered by FDA based on objective tumor response rates and PFS results obtained&#xD;
      in uncontrolled phase II trials. There is currently no treatment registered by EMA for the&#xD;
      indication of recGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib, a VEGFR-specific small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Tki) has demonstrated&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity when evaluated as a mono-therapy and in combination with lomustine for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with recGB (EudraCT 2011-000900-16). Immunocytochemical profiling&#xD;
      of the peripheral blood of recurrent GBM patients treated with axitinib or axitinib plus&#xD;
      lomustine showed that axitinib treatment increases the number of naive CD8+ T cells and&#xD;
      central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was also a reduction of TIM3 expression and an&#xD;
      increased cytokine production in the patients treated with axitinib. Upon progression during&#xD;
      axitinib treatment patients displayed an increased immune suppression with an increased&#xD;
      number of Treg, an increased PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a reduced T cell&#xD;
      functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab (MSB00107; anti-PD-L1) is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;
      that has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in several tumor types. Expression of PD-L1 by&#xD;
      tumor cells has been correlated with a higher probability for respons to avelumab throughout&#xD;
      different tumor types. Glioblastoma has been reported to expresses the PD-L1 ligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical mouse models we demonstrated that axitinib reduces the immune suppressive&#xD;
      microenvironment through reduction of the suppressive capacity of monocytic MDSCs (both in&#xD;
      intra-cranial as well as subcutaneous tumors). Moreover, it also increased the number of&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating T cells. When we combined axitinib with active immunotherapy in the form&#xD;
      of CTLA4 blockade not only a supplementary reduction of the suppressive capacity of these&#xD;
      monocytic MDSCs was found, but also a reduction of the intratumoral granulocytic MDSCs and an&#xD;
      increased antigen-presenting function of intratumoral DCs (manuscript accepted for&#xD;
      publication in High-grade gliomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by&#xD;
      profound tumor related neo-angiogenesis, and intracranial perilesional edema. Glioblastoma&#xD;

      increased antigen-presenting function of intratumoral DCs (manuscript accepted for&#xD;
      publication in American Journal of Cancer Research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational for combining avelumab with for the treatment of recGB is based on the potential&#xD;
      of axitinib to normalize the glioblastoma associated neo-vasculature, counteracting the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive role of VEGF in the tumor microenvironment and controlling intracranial&#xD;
      edema. These features may result in a synergistic anti-tumor effect with the PD-L1 inhibitory&#xD;
      mAb avelumab. In addition, axitinib may reduce the inflammatory edema related to the&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect mediated by PD-L1 inhibition with avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recGBM often develop neurological symptoms related to perilesional edema.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are considered a standard of care for controlling intracranial edema in&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma. High dose corticosteroids however are known to be&#xD;
      immunosuppressive and are likely to counteract the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      therapy. Axitinib has the capacity to control recGBM associated edema of the brain. Out of&#xD;
      the 32 patients who were treated with corticosteroids at baseline in the AxiG trial (EudraCT&#xD;
      2011-000900-16) 17 could lower and 5 could stop their steroids during treatment with&#xD;
      axitinib. PFS was identical for patient with or without need for steroids at baseline in the&#xD;
      AxiG trial but OS was numerically superior for patients not in need for steroids at baseline.&#xD;

             phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,&#xD;
             St John's wort).&#xD;

         23. Pregnant female patients, breastfeeding female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease, uncontrolled asthma, and pneumonitis or psychiatric condition, including&#xD;
             recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
