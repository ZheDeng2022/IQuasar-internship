  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the majority of clinical trials on checkpoint inhibitors have tested these agents as&#xD;
      monotherapy, and the next logical step is to evaluate rational therapeutic associations. The&#xD;
      aim of the NiCOL study is to assess the safety of nivolumab in association with&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy and to gain initial insight into its efficacy in association with the&#xD;
      current standard of care, including chemoradiation.&#xD;
