      This study, &quot;Linking Infectious and Narcology Care - Part II (LINC-II),&quot; will implement and&#xD;
      evaluate a multi-faceted intervention (LINC-II), via a two-armed randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      among 240 HIV-infected PWID in St. Petersburg. LINC-II, comprised of pharmacological therapy&#xD;
      (i.e., rapid access to ART and receipt of naltrexone for opioid use disorder) and 12 months&#xD;
      of strengths-based case management, will assess HIV outcomes (e.g., HIV viral load&#xD;
      suppression), impact on care systems and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Russia and Eastern Europe continue to have one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics in the&#xD;
      world, with highest transmission risks among people who inject drugs (PWID) and their sexual&#xD;
      partners. While routine HIV testing within addiction treatment systems in Russia (i.e.,&#xD;
      narcology hospitals) is the norm, links between the narcology and HIV care systems are&#xD;
      limited and ineffective. In St. Petersburg 50-60% of PWID are HIV-infected, yet among this&#xD;
      population less than 10% are on antiretroviral therapy (ART). For Russia to make progress&#xD;
      toward the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets (i.e., 90% aware of HIV diagnosis, 90% of those diagnosed&#xD;
      on ART and 90% of those on ART with suppressed HIV viral load [HVL]), a bold new strategy is&#xD;
      required. The objective of this study, &quot;Linking Infectious and Narcology Care - Part II&#xD;
      (LINC-II),&quot; is to implement and evaluate, via a two-armed randomized controlled trial among&#xD;
      240 HIV-infected PWID, a multi-faceted intervention combining pharmacological therapy (i.e.,&#xD;
      rapid access to ART and receipt of naltrexone for opioid use disorder) and 12 months of&#xD;
      strengths-based case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that LINC-II will lead to marked progress toward the achievement of&#xD;
      the 90-90-90 HIV cascade of care targets among HIV-infected PWID, relative to current&#xD;
      standard of care, and that LINC-II will facilitate health system coordination of narcology&#xD;
      and HIV care. LINC-II aims to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of LINC-II on undetectable HVL&#xD;
      at 12 months (primary outcome), initiation of ART within 28 days of randomization, change in&#xD;
      CD4 count from baseline to 12 months, retention in HIV care (i.e., ≥ 1 visit to medical care&#xD;
      in 2 consecutive 6 month periods), and undetectable HVL at 6 months; 2) evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of LINC-II on coordinated care across the narcology and HIV health care systems, using mixed&#xD;
      methods data from health care providers, administrators, and patients; and 3) evaluate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention to inform policy makers on scaling up the LINC-II&#xD;
      approach both within Russia and other countries with HIV epidemics driven by injection drug&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group will receive the narcology hospital's standard of care, which is detoxification with or without stabilization. Prior to discharge, those identified as HIV-infected are given contact details for an HIV clinic, not an appointment. Upon discharge, patients are encouraged to receive outpatient narcology treatment, monthly, for 1 year. For this study, with regard to linkage to HIV medical care, patients will be given printed information about where to obtain HIV medical care and a resource card containing harm reduction information.</description>
