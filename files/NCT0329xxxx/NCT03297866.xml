  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistic Department, 10.5% of the Hong Kong population&#xD;
      who aged 15 years or above are daily smokers (Thematic Household Survey Report - Report No.&#xD;
      59, 2016). The smoking prevalence was estimated from a thematic household survey that has&#xD;
      been conducted every 2 or 3 years. Another population-based survey related to tobacco control&#xD;
      is the Tobacco Control Policy-related Survey conducted by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking&#xD;
      and Health and the University of Hong Kong. Both surveys were in a cross-sectional design and&#xD;
      no follow-up was done. A cohort study with follow-up data could provide more insights for the&#xD;
      causal relationship. However, most people are not willing to complete follow-up survey and&#xD;
      the response rate is often low (Mellahi, 2016). The low survey response rate could lead to&#xD;
      statistically bias in the research funding (Pit, 2014). Therefore, cohort surveys need to&#xD;
      provide attractive monetary incentive to the interviewee to increase the response rate (Pit,&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess and compare the 3-month response rate of a follow-up survey due to&#xD;
      different financial incentive schemes. The findings will be used for a feasibility assessment&#xD;
      of future cohort studies of evaluating tobacco control measures and public opinion, and&#xD;
      exploration of appropriate incentive scheme.&#xD;
