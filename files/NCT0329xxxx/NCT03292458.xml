  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a comprehensive approach of clinico-behavioral testing, neuroimaging and&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics, the researchers will examine the clinical effects of sodium oxybate and the&#xD;
      matched placebo on voice symptoms in spasmodic dysphonia and voice tremor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasmodic dysphonia (SD), or laryngeal dystonia, is a chronic debilitating condition that&#xD;
      selectively affects speech production due to involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles. SD&#xD;
      often extends beyond the impairment of vocal communication causing significant occupational&#xD;
      disability and life-long social isolation. SD becomes even more incapacitating when it is&#xD;
      associated with dystonic voice tremor (VT), which is present in about 1/3 of SD patients and&#xD;
      is characterized by the inability to sustain a vowel for more than a few seconds. Current&#xD;
      treatment of these disorders is limited to the temporary management of voice symptoms with&#xD;
      repeated injections of botulinum toxin into the laryngeal muscles. These injections, however,&#xD;
      are not fully effective in all SD patients and even less so in combined SD and VT cases.&#xD;
      There is, therefore, a critical need to identify alternative therapeutic options that&#xD;
      specifically target the pathophysiology of these disorders. On the other hand, the design and&#xD;
      the use of such novel therapeutic approaches will be largely unattainable if their central&#xD;
      mechanisms of action remain unknown. The objective of this study is to elucidate the primary&#xD;
      determinants of clinical response to a novel oral medication, sodium oxybate (Xyrem®), in&#xD;
      alcohol-responsive SD and VT patients. Using a comprehensive approach of clinico-behavioral&#xD;
      testing, neuroimaging and pharmacogenetics, we aim to determine the clinical response of SD&#xD;
      and VT symptoms to sodium oxybate and identify the primary markers of its clinical benefits.&#xD;
      This study will use a controlled experimental design that focuses on detailed&#xD;
      characterization of primary effects of a novel oral medication, sodium oxybate, for treatment&#xD;
      of SD and VT symptoms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with SD and combined SD and VT will have a clinically documented adductor or&#xD;
             abductor form of disorder, either with or without positive effects of alcohol on their&#xD;
             voice symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy controls will be healthy volunteers with a negative history of laryngeal,&#xD;
             neurological, or psychiatric problems (existing neuroimaging data will be used);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age from 21 to 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Native English speakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Right-handedness (based on Edinburgh Handedness Inventory).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are incapable of giving an informed consent will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant and breastfeeding women until a time when they are no longer pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding will be excluded from the study. All patients of childbearing potential&#xD;
             will be required to agree to use a reliable method of contraception prior to and&#xD;
             during the study. The method of contraception will be documented in the patient's&#xD;
             research chart. All women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test, which must be negative for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients with a past or present history of the following conditions will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Except for SD and dystonic VT, any neurological disorders, such as stroke,&#xD;
                  movement disorders, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury with loss of&#xD;
                  consciousness, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases,&#xD;
                  alcoholism, drug dependence. Patients with tremor affecting other body parts will&#xD;
                  be excluded from the study. All patients who have dystonic movements in the body&#xD;
                  regions other than the larynx will be excluded from the study. This will allow&#xD;
                  maintaining the homogenous patient population and evaluating central drug effects&#xD;
                  without confounding by the presence of other neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any psychiatric problems, such as schizophrenia, major and/or bipolar depression,&#xD;
                  obsessive-compulsive disorder, will be excluded to maintain the homogenous&#xD;
                  patient population and allow for the evaluation of central drug effect without&#xD;
                  confounding by the presence of psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Any laryngeal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis, paresis, carcinoma, chronic&#xD;
                  laryngitis, will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients with a known past or present history of grade 2 or higher hepatic and&#xD;
                  renal dysfunction according to the NCI criteria will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients with a known past or present history of moderate to severe congestive&#xD;
                  heart failure will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patients with a known past or present history of cognitive impairment and active&#xD;
                  suicidal ideations will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are not symptomatic due to treatment with botulinum toxin injections into&#xD;
             the laryngeal muscles will be excluded from the study until the time when they are&#xD;
             fully symptomatic. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin vary from&#xD;
             patient to patient, lasting on average 3-4 months. All patients will be evaluated to&#xD;
             ensure that they are fully symptomatic prior to the entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. To avoid the possibility of confounding effects of drugs acting upon the central&#xD;
             nervous system, all patients will be questioned about any prescribed or&#xD;
             over-the-counter medications as part of their initial intake screening. Those patients&#xD;
             who receive medication(s) affecting the central nervous system (except for sodium&#xD;
             oxybate) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients will be asked whether they have undergone any head and neck surgeries,&#xD;
             particularly any brain surgery and laryngeal surgeries, such as thyroplasty, laryngeal&#xD;
             denervation, and selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation. Because both&#xD;
             brain and laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to the brain structure and function&#xD;
             re-organization, all subjects with a history of brain and/or laryngeal surgery will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have tattoos, ferromagnetic objects in their bodies (e.g., implanted&#xD;
             stimulators, surgical clips, prosthesis, artificial heart valve, etc.) that are not&#xD;
             MRI comparable and/or cannot be removed for the purpose of MRI study participation&#xD;
             will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
