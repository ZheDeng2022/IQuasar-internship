  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zinc is a nutritionally essential trace element found in previous studies to reduce growth&#xD;
      retardation and improve immune function, which may also result in decreased incidence of&#xD;
      infectious diseases including malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)&#xD;
      patients are known to be susceptible to zinc deficiency and appear to benefit from zinc&#xD;
      supplementation. The proposed pilot research project aims to investigate the influence of&#xD;
      zinc supplementation on incidence of malaria infections, incidence of bacterial infections&#xD;
      and investigate the influence of zinc supplementation on morbidity in children with SCD in&#xD;
      western Kenya. The differences in incidence of morbidity and other secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      be compared between the zinc group and the control group.&#xD;

      Zinc is a nutritionally essential trace element found in previous studies to reduce growth&#xD;
      retardation and improve immune function, which may also result in decreased incidence of&#xD;
      infectious diseases including malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea. SCD patients are known to be&#xD;
      susceptible to zinc deficiency and appear to benefit from zinc supplementation. Despite these&#xD;
      findings, SCD patients in Kenya have not benefited from zinc supplementation programs due to&#xD;
      a lack of research and findings to inform policy in the East African-setting. The proposed&#xD;
      pilot research project aims to investigate the influence of zinc supplementation on incidence&#xD;
      of malaria infections in children with SCD; investigate the influence of zinc supplementation&#xD;
      on incidence of bacterial infections (e.g. S pneumoniae, H influenzae and non-typhi&#xD;
      Salmonella species) in children with SCD and investigate the influence of zinc&#xD;
      supplementation on morbidity in children with SCD in western Kenya. A 6 month randomized&#xD;
      controlled pilot trial involving children with SCD aged 6 months to less than 13 years, being&#xD;
      treated and followed up routinely at the KEMRI-site and other selected health facilities in&#xD;
      Western Kenya for SCD will be enrolled. The children will be randomized into two arms, with&#xD;
      the Intervention Group receiving the recommended Ministry of Health (MoH)/World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) standard care in addition to three times weekly zinc supplementation (10&#xD;
      mg) and the Control Group receiving standard MoH care alone over a six month period. At&#xD;
      baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months, clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum&#xD;
      zinc levels, malaria blood slides, anthropometric measurements and other indicated laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be conducted.The differences in incidence of morbidity and other secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be compared between the zinc group and the control group. The results are&#xD;
      expected to determine the scientific basis for a larger clinical trial to determine the need&#xD;
      for the addition of zinc supplement to the management of sickle cell disease.&#xD;
