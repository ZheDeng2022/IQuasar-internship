      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Smoke-free Teens Programme in&#xD;
      strengthening youth's knowledge and attitude on smoking and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To evaluate Smoke-free Teens' change in knowledge on smoking hazards, attitudes towards&#xD;
      smoking, tobacco control and smoking cessation, and practices for promoting smoking&#xD;
      prevention and cessation, ii. To evaluate the process and quality of smoke-free programmes&#xD;
      organized by the Smoke-free Teens in their schools/community, and iii. To measure the number&#xD;
      of people whom the Smoke-free Teens will deliver the smoke-free messages to.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants (thereafter named Smoke-free Teens) Youth between Form 1 and 4 or aged 14 to 18&#xD;
      will be nominated by secondary schools, youth centres and uniform groups to participate in&#xD;
      the Smoke-free Teens Programme .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcomes include the change in (1) knowledge on smoking hazards, (2)&#xD;
      attitudes towards smoking, tobacco control and smoking cessation, (3) practices for promoting&#xD;
      smoking prevention and cessation, and (4) the Smoke-free Teens' satisfaction on the training&#xD;
      camp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are (1) the number of people participated in the school- or&#xD;
      community-based smoke-free programmes organised by the Smoke-free Teens, and (2) the number&#xD;
      of smokers advised and referred to existing smoking cessation services by the Smoke-free&#xD;
      Teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Smoke-free teens will join a &quot;2-Day-1-Night&quot; training camp organized by the Hong Kong&#xD;
      Council of Smoking and Health(COSH) in July or August . The camp will cover a wide range of&#xD;
      indoor, outdoor, adventure-based, experiential learning activities. Besides, the teens will&#xD;
      be equipped with the knowledge on smoking hazards, tobacco control and smoking cessation. In&#xD;
      addition, the teens will be taught how to deliver a brief smoking cessation intervention&#xD;
      using the &quot;AWARD&quot; Model: 1) Ask about smoking, 2) Warn the smokers that at least half will be&#xD;
      killed by smoking, 3) Advise to quit (reduce) as soon as possible, 4) Refer to cessation&#xD;
      clinics or hotlines, and 5) Do it again until the smokers quit. By the end of the training&#xD;
      camp, the teens should be confident and competent in delivering the brief smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention to smokers. After the training camp, the teens will then break down into groups&#xD;
      to organize smoke-free programmes in their schools or in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey instrument A structured questionnaire designed by the smoking cessation team, School&#xD;
      of Nursing, the University of Hong Kong will be used to evaluate the training camp. The&#xD;
      questionnaire covers four areas, including (1) knowledge on smoking hazards, (2) attitudes&#xD;
      towards smoking, tobacco control and smoking cessation, (3) practices for promoting smoking&#xD;
      prevention and cessation, and (4) self-efficacy to deliver smoking cessation advices. The&#xD;
      items of the questionnaire have been adopted and modified from previous studies on smoking&#xD;
      cessation, with well-established psychometric properties. A process evaluation form will also&#xD;
      be developed by the smoking cessation team to assess how the teens satisfy with the training&#xD;
      camp, and to determine whether the content of the training camp meets the learning needs and&#xD;
      expectations of the teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the smoke-free programmes organized after the training camp, each group of the&#xD;
      Smoke-free Teens will be required to submit a written proposal to COSH. In addition, a final&#xD;
      report that contains the information about the number of people reached by the programmes,&#xD;
      publicity, and the process and outcomes of the programmes, will be submitted for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data collection will be conducted by COSH. All Smoke-free Teens will be&#xD;
      invited to respond to the structured questionnaire at baseline (T1), immediately after the&#xD;
      training camp (T2), and 3 (T3) and 6 months later (T4). In addition, they will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a process evaluation form immediately after the training camp (T2). Comments and&#xD;
      suggestions provided by the teens in the process evaluation form will be taken into account&#xD;
      for future improvement of the training camp. In addition, each group of teens will have to&#xD;
      submit the written proposal and final report regarding the smoke-free programme to COSH at 3&#xD;
      (T3) and 6 (T4) months, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS: Version 23; SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, Illinois, USA) for Windows will be employed to analyze the data. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to describe the demographic characteristics of the Smoke-free Teens.&#xD;
      Paired samples t-test and McNemar's test will be conducted to assess the change in knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and practices of the Smoke-free Teens regarding smoking, tobacco control and&#xD;
      smoking cessation before and after the training camp. To evaluate the smoke-free programmes&#xD;
      organized by the Smoke-free Teens after the training camp, descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      used to report the number of people reached by the programmes, publicity, and the process and&#xD;
      outcomes of the programmes.&#xD;
