  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The African-PREDICT study aims to (i) generate new knowledge on the early pathophysiology&#xD;
      accompanying hypertension development in black South Africans; and (ii) to identify early&#xD;
      novel markers or predictors for the development of hypertension and cardiovascular outcome.&#xD;
      By employing also in Africa the latest cutting-edge scientific technologies to measure single&#xD;
      and multiple biomarkers proven to predict hypertension and cardiovascular outcome (such as&#xD;
      multiplex analyses, proteomics and metabolomics), precision medicine may have the potential&#xD;
      to lead to novel strategies in preventing and treating hypertension in Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Problem Statement: Recent global analyses have indicated that the highest&#xD;
      blood pressures worldwide are recorded in black populations. The vulnerable cardiovascular&#xD;
      profile of Africans is believed to result from a combination of factors such as rapid&#xD;
      urbanisation, abnormal sodium handling, elevated vascular resistance and arterial stiffness.&#xD;
      The frequent underdiagnoses and ineffective treatment of hypertension in general but&#xD;
      especially in Africans, result in severe complications, such as stroke, heart and kidney&#xD;
      disease. Since diagnosis and treatment are generally unsuccessful in black populations -&#xD;
      especially in low and middle-income countries - prevention is key to curb the rapidly&#xD;
      increasing incidence of death and disability from cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      prediction in black populations worldwide is inadequate since we do not have a clear&#xD;
      understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the development of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Aim: In the &quot;African PRospective study on the Early Detection and Identification of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease and Hypertension&quot; (African-PREDICT) the investigators aim to identify&#xD;
      early markers or predictors for the development of cardiovascular disease in black South&#xD;
      Africans. Only by understanding the early pathophysiology of disease development, and by&#xD;
      identifying markers as potential screening indicators, predictors or targets for&#xD;
      intervention, will the investigators be able to implement successful prevention programes in&#xD;
      Africans at younger ages. The researchers therefore aim to track and monitor change in young,&#xD;
      normotensive black and white individuals (aged 20-30 years) over 10-20 years. To achieve this&#xD;
      the investigators will perform detailed cardiovascular and novel biomarker measurements, as&#xD;
      well as behavioural and biopsychosocial assessments every 4-5 years in order to identify and&#xD;
      understand early changes in cardiovascular function, and specific predictors contributing to&#xD;
      the development of hypertension and target organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and Measurements: In 2013 recruitment started, screening and assessment of 1200&#xD;
      normotensive and apparently healthy participants (black N=600 and white N=600) with equal sex&#xD;
      distribution. A wide range of basic and advanced measurements are taken within a Hypertension&#xD;
      Clinic to get a highly detailed profile of the participants at each visit. The following is&#xD;
      obtained: (1) relevant questionnaire data including medical history, lifestyle, social&#xD;
      status, traditional risk factors (age, gender, smoking, alcohol intake) and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires on dietary intake, personality and psychosocial profile; (2) Biological&#xD;
      samples for biomarker analyses (serum, plasma, spot urine and 24-hr urine) are taken and&#xD;
      preserved for the short and long-term at -80Â°C. A wide range of traditional and novel&#xD;
      biomarkers related to hypertension and cardiovascular disease (including amongst others,&#xD;
      lipid profile, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, vitamin D,&#xD;
      full blood count, sodium, potassium, creatinine, renin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, markers&#xD;
      of oxidative stress and nitric oxide bio-availability, cortisol, sex hormones, insulin,&#xD;
      C-peptide, leptin and other adipokines, angiogenic markers, the insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor-axis, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, Nt-proBNP, fibulin-1 and novel&#xD;
      markers not yet identified) will be assessed. These samples will also be analysed in an&#xD;
      attempt to identify bio-signatures in terms of the -omics sciences (genomic, metabolomic and&#xD;
      proteomic profiles) as predictors of cardiovascular deterioration; (3) anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, bio-electrical impedance measurement of body fat and lean mass, and 7-day&#xD;
      physical activitymonitoring; (4) A range of cardiovascular assessments: 24-hour blood&#xD;
      pressure, central arterial pressure, and cardiovascular stress reactivity tests with&#xD;
      continuous finger blood pressure; and (5) Assessments of early target organ damage including&#xD;
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, carotid intima-media thickness, ECG, echocardiography,&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity, and retinal microvascular calibre and dilation during provocation with a&#xD;
      light flicker test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timetable: The project was approved and is endorsed by the National and Provincial Department&#xD;
      of Health, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the North-West University in 2012&#xD;
      (NWU-00001-12-A1). Screening commenced in November 2012, and research participants started&#xD;
      entering the study from 6 February 2013. Baseline data collection was completed in December&#xD;
      2017. Follow-up assessments commenced in February 2018 and will continue until Dec 2022. The&#xD;
      Health Research Ethics Committee approved continuation of the study for 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Outcomes: This project will increase understanding of the complex mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the aetiology of early cardiovascular changes in relatively young individuals&#xD;
      from African and European ancestry, which will (1) improve ability to identify individuals at&#xD;
      risk before the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and (2) predict the development&#xD;
      of future hypertension and related CVD. Both outcomes will make it possible to develop better&#xD;
      individualised and population-based prevention of CVD contributing to better quality of life.&#xD;
      These results will not only be applicable to Sub-Saharan Africa but are expected to have a&#xD;
      broader impact with regards to white and black populations globally. Results are expected to&#xD;
      have significant scientific impact by means of publications in high-impact journals; and also&#xD;
      to translate directly into novel preventive healthcare policy and practices - translating&#xD;
      into preventive measures regarding the development of CVDs in clinics throughout South&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;
