  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative study using resected/ biopsied tumors samples collected from renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma patients who underwent surgical removal of lesions,&#xD;
      followed by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment targting programmed cell death 1 (PD1)&#xD;
      but developed new lesions later were also removed and stored in the biosample repository&#xD;
      (BSR). The histology and genomic analysis of the pre-treatment and metastatic samples from&#xD;
      the same patient would be used to find out the changes that may have lead to metastasis.&#xD;
      Also, metastatic samples from ICB naive patients would be collected and compared with those&#xD;
      from ICB treated patients to find out if the metastasis in treated patients was due to&#xD;
      development of reistance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients will include retrospectively identified patients with RCC or UC who&#xD;
             have received treatment with ICB and achieved clinical benefit but subsequently&#xD;
             developed a solitary new/progressive lesion that was removed surgically. Patients with&#xD;
             other tumor types who otherwise meet criteria may be included at a later time&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additionally, a group of patients with RCC who have undergone a metastasectomy but who&#xD;
             did not receive treatment with ICB will be identified. These patients may be&#xD;
             approached for study participation to serve as a comparator group&#xD;
