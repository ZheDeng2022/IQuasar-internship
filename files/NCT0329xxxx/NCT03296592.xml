  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been diagnosed with Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo an MRI using diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technology. The patients will&#xD;
      have this MRI preoperatively and at 24 months postop. The investigators believe that with&#xD;
      this imaging, biomarkers will be able to be seen to assist in prediction of long term&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with spinal cord compression. These patients will be compared to healthy&#xD;
      cohorts who will also undergo an MRI using the DBSI technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CSM is the most common form of spinal cord injury and is the leading cause of progressive&#xD;
      disability in patients over the age of 65. A major shortcoming limiting the clinical&#xD;
      management of CSM is the lack of quantifiable metrics to 1) base clinical decisions and 2)&#xD;
      predict potential for functional recovery following surgical intervention. DBSI MRI will&#xD;
      provide imaging biomarkers to more reliably predict a patient's clinical course, response to&#xD;
      therapy, and long-term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are diagnosed with CSM will have an MRI using the DBSI technology preoperatively&#xD;
      and at 24 months. Surgical patients will be assessed with the Neck Disability Index (NDI),&#xD;
      Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), hand grip dynamometer and Manual Muscle&#xD;
      Testing (MMT), the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA), and the Major&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (MDI), the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Nurick scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group of healthy volunteers will have an MRI using the DBSI technology when&#xD;
      enrolled and then again between 12-24 months later.&#xD;
