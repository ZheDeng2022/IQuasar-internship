    <textblock>
      The main objective is to reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in orthopedic&#xD;
      postoperative patients based on the potential benefit of using rivaroxaban as a monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is around efficacy and safety evaluation of using rivaroxaban as a monotherapy&#xD;
      prophylactic agent in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries taking into the account the&#xD;
      reliable selection of patients most benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answering questions about additional cost benefit from the perceptive of the cost-effective&#xD;
      analysis on extrapolating the results emerged to our university teaching hospital setting are&#xD;
      going to be evaluating as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a Today consensus that patients undergoing high-risk surgery should receive&#xD;
      prophylaxis against postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE). A good example of that could&#xD;
      be orthopedic surgeries which place patients at unnecessary increased risk of fatal pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism. For many years, pharmacotherapy options have been recommended by the American&#xD;
      College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) for postoperative thromboprophylaxis were&#xD;
      low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), fondaparinux, and warfarin. However, their limitations&#xD;
      have been repeatedly demonstrated in a huge number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its introduction, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are still common used in&#xD;
      practice as thromboprophylactic agent. But, they require subcutaneous administration which&#xD;
      making it challenging for use in settings other than the inpatient one. Despite the lower&#xD;
      incidence of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) induced heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      (HIT) compared with unfractionated heparins (UFH) in the postoperative setting, the risk of&#xD;
      LMWH induced HIT in patients treated for VTE still concerns many clinicians. In addition to&#xD;
      its subcutaneous administration, fondaparinux is contraindicated in severe renal impairment&#xD;
      patients (with creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 milliliter/minute) and those who have low body&#xD;
      weight (&lt;50 kg; venous thromboembolism prophylaxis only). While available orally, Vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonists (VKAs) like Warfarin have unpredictable pharmacologic effects requiring a wakeful&#xD;
      monitoring. Warfarin is also a remarkable source of food and drug interactions. As a result,&#xD;
      it is mandatory to search for novel drugs or at least to search for new indications of really&#xD;
      existing drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In July 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an orally administered&#xD;
      selective factor Xa inhibitor called Rivaroxaban for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) after total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgeries. According&#xD;
      to the Regulation of Coagulation in Orthopedic Surgery to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and&#xD;
      Pulmonary Embolism (RECORD) trials, rivaroxaban demonstrated superiority to enoxaparin in&#xD;
      reducing venous thromboembolism without significant increase of bleeding risk. Rivaroxaban is&#xD;
      recommended to be used at a fixed dose of 10 mg daily, with or without food, for 35 days&#xD;
      following THR or 12 days following TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee has recommended&#xD;
      approval of rivaroxaban, many questions have been raised on the Regulation of Coagulation in&#xD;
      Orthopedic Surgery to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism (RECORD) trials of&#xD;
      rivaroxaban. Some may argue that dosing was inconsistent with the recommendations. Others&#xD;
      went far to say that the duration of treatment was inconsistent and did vary with enoxaparin.&#xD;
      In other words, it was somewhat short.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the ORTHO-TEP registry on joint replacement arthroplasty (hip and knee) from&#xD;
      Dresden, Germany and XareltoÂ® in the Prophylaxis of Postsurgical Venous Thromboembolism after&#xD;
      Elective Major Orthopaedic Surgery of the Hip or Knee (XAMOS) study are in accordance with&#xD;
      the conclusion of Regulation of Coagulation in Major Orthopedic surgery reducing the Risk of&#xD;
      DVT and PE (RECORD) trials. A subset of countries that participated in XAMOS also included&#xD;
      patients undergoing fracture-related orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, very few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered to study side effects when&#xD;
      comparing substances, and even large RCTs may be too small to reveal rare side effects. It&#xD;
      seems difficult to compare safety data from trial to trial because there is no standardized&#xD;
      definition of bleeding. One prospective study collecting data from the electronic health&#xD;
      record at two institutions concluded that using of enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      prophylaxis following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was&#xD;
      associated with a lower rate of the primary outcome (any postoperative bleeding) compared&#xD;
      with the use of rivaroxaban in a similar cohort of patients. However, it was a retrospective&#xD;
      investigation with many limitations can be argued with regard to selection and change in&#xD;
      practice guideline during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, there is lack of literature data that define rivaroxaban as orthopedic postoperative&#xD;
      thromboprophylactic agent rather than well-known indications (hip and knee replacements). It&#xD;
      also is not plausible to accurately compare safety data with other injectable anticoagulants.&#xD;

    <description>Validated clinical prediction rule like Wells Clinical Model is recommended to estimate pretest probability of deep venous thrombosis. Duplex ultrasonography is the preferred test to diagnose deep-vein thrombosis (DVT).&#xD;
Symptoms and signs of DVT may include unilateral leg swelling, pain in the affected leg, calf tenderness in affected leg, increased leg warmth, erythema of affected leg, or a &quot;palpable cord&quot; may be felt in the affected leg.&#xD;
DVT is going to be assessed using Clinical assessment, D-dimer test, Duplex ultrasonography and Venography according to Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines and based on availability and clinical circumstances.</description>

    <description>The incidence of major bleeding beginning after the first dose of the study drug and up to 2 days after the last dose of the study drug (on-treatment period). Major bleeding is defined as bleeding that is fatal, occurs in a critical organ (e.g., retroperitoneal, intracranial, intraocular, and intraspinal bleeding), or requires reoperation or extra surgical-site bleeding that was clinically overt and is associated with a fall in the hemoglobin level of at least 2 g per deciliter or that requires transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or packed cells.</description>
