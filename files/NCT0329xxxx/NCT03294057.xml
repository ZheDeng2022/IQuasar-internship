  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study verifies efficacy of collaborative care with Smart Health Management Program&#xD;
      developed for patients with chronic illness. The aim of the study is to observe the changes&#xD;
      in clinical indicators, quality of life and health related behaviors when providing&#xD;
      self-management programs with ICT for chronic disease patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to demonstrate that chronic disease patients receiving collaborative care with&#xD;
      ICT-based self-management and educational program can improve clinical outcomes and overall&#xD;
      health status, including quality of life and health habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the economic burden, people with chronic disease experience various&#xD;
      psychosocial crises such as anxiety and depression, which causes the deterioration of overall&#xD;
      quality of life and increases social burden. The collaborative care management based Chronic&#xD;
      Care Model (CCM) have provided coaching by a medically supervised nurse, working with each&#xD;
      patient's physician. However, standard CCM have limitations in that they do not provide&#xD;
      self-management strategies of the patient in detail. Therefore, to improve the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the CCM model, it is required to propose a new approach to the utilization of IT-based&#xD;
      self-management program that is currently being developed to increase accessibility and&#xD;
      efficiency of health care service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes of this study are as follow: Improvement of depression in patients with&#xD;
      osteoporosis, chronic respiratory disease and chronic arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will respond a baseline questionnaire about depressive mood,&#xD;
      health habits, health behavior patterns and quality of life, diet, exercise, etc. After that,&#xD;
      participants will be allocated equally into three groups - the intervention group 1,&#xD;
      intervention group 2 and the control group. The intervention group 1 will receive S Healthing&#xD;
      and a tele- coaching program conducted 12 times (one time for one week), and more than 20&#xD;
      minutes each by a trained nurse. The intervention group 2 will receive S Healthing while the&#xD;
      control group will receive basic educational material on the disease. Coaching content&#xD;
      consists specifically of: 1) evaluation, 2) facing and accepting the health crisis, 3)&#xD;
      setting up new goals, 4) making decisions and plans, and 5) practice. &quot;S Healthing&quot; is based&#xD;
      ICT- program and includes educational contents and self-management program based on Smart&#xD;
      Management Strategy for Health (SMASH). The intervention group 1, 2 will conduct&#xD;
      self-management for 3 months through smart phone application and web program. Participants&#xD;
      will receive a questionnaire about the quality of life and health habits with the clinical&#xD;
      examination 3 months after baseline survey was conducted. The result from two questionnaires&#xD;
      (baseline, 3 months post-intervention) and clinical outcome of baseline and 3 months will be&#xD;
      compiled and be compared with others.&#xD;
