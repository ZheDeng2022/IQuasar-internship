  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anemia is common worldwide, ranging from 25% in knee arthroplasties to 60% in&#xD;
      colorectal malignancies. In Singapore, about a quarter (27%) of all patients have anaemia&#xD;
      prior to operation at a main tertiary center. Currently, the rate of preoperative anemia in&#xD;
      Singapore General Hospital (SGH) is 26.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an alarming public health issue as the negative impact of preoperative anemia on&#xD;
      post-surgical outcomes has been well documented and include increased rates of perioperative&#xD;
      blood transfusion, mortality, adverse cardiac and non-cardiac complications including&#xD;
      pulmonary complications, wound infections, systemic sepsis and venous thromboembolism, as&#xD;
      well as prolonged length of hospital stay and increased healthcare costs. These data suggest&#xD;
      that reducing preoperative anemia prior to major surgery is imperative to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and decrease healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study responds to an urgent need to optimize the current standard practice for managing&#xD;
      preoperative anemia. It is designed as a randomised, open-label, study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of intravenous iron compared to oral iron in patients with anemia undergoing major&#xD;
      surgery to reduce surgical complications. To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting such&#xD;
      trial in a larger scale, a pilot study with the same design will be conducted. The findings&#xD;
      of this pilot study will also inform the study design and sample size for the larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, the results will inform clinical practice guidelines, result in better patient&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes, reduce burden on the health care system, and change health-related&#xD;
      policy. For example, all forms of intravenous iron therapy are currently not subsidized by&#xD;
      the Singapore government which is in stark contrast with allogenic blood transfusion, which&#xD;
      is subsidised and readily available at a substantially reduced rate to patients. Hence, it&#xD;
      will cost the patients more out of pocket to be treated with intravenous iron than to have&#xD;
      allogenic blood transfusion. Incorporating a preoperative anemia correction protocol in the&#xD;
      current surgical pathway is a potential strategy to combat healthcare cost inflation and the&#xD;
      increasing demand for blood products.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preoperative anemia is common worldwide, ranging from 25% in knee arthroplasties to 60% in&#xD;
      colorectal malignancies. In Singapore, about a quarter (27%) of all patients have anaemia&#xD;
      prior to operation at a main tertiary center. Currently, the rate of preoperative anemia in&#xD;
      Singapore General Hospital (SGH) is 26.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an alarming public health issue as the negative impact of preoperative anemia on&#xD;
      post-surgical outcomes has been well documented and include increased rates of perioperative&#xD;
      blood transfusion, mortality, adverse cardiac and non-cardiac complications including&#xD;
      pulmonary complications, wound infections, systemic sepsis and venous thromboembolism, as&#xD;
      well as prolonged length of hospital stay and increased healthcare costs. These data suggest&#xD;
      that reducing preoperative anemia prior to major surgery is imperative to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and decrease healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study responds to an urgent need to optimize the current standard practice for managing&#xD;
      preoperative anemia. It is designed as an open-label, parallel design pilot randomised&#xD;
      control trial to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger scale study powered to&#xD;
      investigate reduction in complication rate. There will be two arms, intervention (IV FCM&#xD;
      15mg/kg, up to 1000 mg) and usual care (Ferrous fumarate 200mg twice daily). All participants&#xD;
      will be followed for three months from date of operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either preoperative FCM&#xD;
      (intervention) or oral iron (standard care). Participants are stratified to surgical type&#xD;
      (upper or lower intestinal surgeries) and surgical approach (laparoscopic or open). The&#xD;
      sample size was selected based on the observation that at least 12 participants per group&#xD;
      provide adequate measurement precision and power to detect associations. The study aims to&#xD;
      balance 15 participants per stratum to account for dropouts and loss to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained prior to enrolment in the study. Study data will be&#xD;
      entered into a secure data management system and retained for up to 6 years after the study&#xD;
      ends, as per institutional guideline. There will be no procedures recorded on electronic&#xD;
      media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing for FCM is based on the maximum dose of intravenous iron that can be safely given&#xD;
      in a reasonable time period. The selected dose for the study corresponds with the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommended IV FCM dose for iron repletion in iron deficiency anemia.&#xD;
      (Approved product label attached as annex). This dose of 15mg/kg or up to 1000 mg was also&#xD;
      the dose used in other similar trials, hence facilitating comparison of results across study&#xD;
      populations. As with the manufacturer's recommendation, the drug will be diluted in 250 ml&#xD;
      Normal Saline and given over 30 minutes with the patient closely observed for signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and for at least 30 minutes following each&#xD;
      injection. If contraindication to IV FCM develops, treatment will be stopped and usual care&#xD;
      commenced. Such reactions will be recorded and analyzed as an adverse event. The surgeon will&#xD;
      be informed of the patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing for oral iron would be as per current clinical protocol, which is ferrous fumarate&#xD;
      200mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of a single preoperative dose of IV FCM, compared to oral iron&#xD;
      therapy for treating iron deficiency anemia prior to major abdominal surgery, in reducing&#xD;
      perioperative blood transfusion requirement and 30-day incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications. Other secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of intravenous FCM compared with oral iron on change in&#xD;
           haemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of intravenous FCM compared with oral iron on length of hospital&#xD;
           stay and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of intravenous FCM compared with oral iron on health related&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate resource use and costs associated with the treatment with intravenous FCM&#xD;
           compared to oral iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of adverse events involves the PI submitting to the approving CIRB the completed&#xD;
      SAE Reporting Form within the stipulated timeframe. PI is responsible for informing the&#xD;
      institution representative (local SAE resulting in death), sponsor or regulatory bodies as&#xD;
      required and appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting timeline to CIRB:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAE that result in death, regardless of causality, should be reported immediately -&#xD;
           within 24 hours of the PI becoming aware of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local life-threatening (unexpected/ expected) SAE should be reported no later than 7&#xD;
           calendar days after the Investigator is aware of the event, followed by a complete&#xD;
           report within 8 additional calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local unexpected SAE that are related events, but not life-threatening, should be&#xD;
           reported no later than 15 calendar days after the investigator is aware of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An increase in the rate of occurrence of local expected SAE, which is judged to be&#xD;
           clinically important, should be reported within 15 calendar days after the PI is aware&#xD;
           of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local expected SAE should be reported annually (together with Study Status Report for&#xD;
           annual review).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local unexpected and unlikely related SAE that are not life-threatening should also be&#xD;
           reported annually (together with Study Status Report for annual review).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local unexpected AE that are related events should be reported at least annually&#xD;
           (together with Study Status Report for annual review).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-local unexpected SAE that are fatal or life threatening and&#xD;
           definitely/probably/possibly related should be reported not later than 30 calendar days&#xD;
           after the PI is aware of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported to HSA. All SAEs&#xD;
      will be reported to HSA according to the HSA Guidance for Industry &quot;Safety Reporting&#xD;
      Requirements for Clinical Drug Trials.&quot; The investigator is responsible for informing HSA no&#xD;
      later than 15 calendar days after first knowledge that the case qualifies for expedited&#xD;
      reporting. Follow-up information will be actively sought and submitted as it becomes&#xD;
      available. For fatal or life-threatening cases, HSA will be notified as soon as possible but&#xD;
      no later than 7 calendar days after first knowledge that a case qualifies, followed by a&#xD;
      complete report within 8 additional calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data and safety monitoring will be performed by the Principal Investigator and&#xD;
      Co-Investigators, and subjected to audit and monitoring of the practices by Division of&#xD;
      Research, SGH as well as CIRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following precautions are in place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants with known conditions that might compromise their safety during the&#xD;
           administration of the intervention are excluded (see exclusion criteria above)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline vitals such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rate are taken&#xD;
           before the commencement of infusion and after the end of infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient is monitored for 30 minutes after the end of IV FCM infusion for any signs&#xD;
           and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In case of any adverse reactions, participants will be promptly managed according to&#xD;
           standard clinical guidelines of adverse events / serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be monitored and reviewed by the PI or Co-investigators. Training will be given&#xD;
      to the research coordinator and entry of data from the case report forms for analysis will be&#xD;
      verified by a second person from the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered on paper, prior to being de-identified and entered electronically for&#xD;
      analysis. Existing perioperative surgical, ICU and hospital data will be used to capture&#xD;
      patient demographics, procedure urgency, intraoperative procedure and anaesthetic variables,&#xD;
      blood product utilisation, mechanical ventilation, delirium/coma, ICU and hospital LOS and&#xD;
      major adverse events. Local research staff will enter de-identified study data onto a&#xD;
      trial-specific electronic case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hard copy of research data will be kept in a locked cabinet within the staff-only area of&#xD;
      Preoperative Assessment Center, Block 3 Level 1, SGH. Soft copy of all data will be kept on a&#xD;
      password protected PC within the hospital's secure network, which is located in the same&#xD;
      staff-only area. All data will be de-identified. The participants will not have their NRIC&#xD;
      and names displayed in the data. Instead a code will be assigned to each participant to&#xD;
      protect the confidentiality of the research data. The key to the code will be kept in a&#xD;
      separate access controlled, staff-only office within the department of anesthesiology, SGH.&#xD;
      The PI will have access to the identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aim 1, the intervention would be deemed feasible if the following three objectives were&#xD;
      achieved:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 98.5% of subjects to receive study drug within 5 days of enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment of 30 participants within 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete follow-up in at least 90% of subjects For secondary aims, continuous outcomes,&#xD;
           mean differences and 95% CIs will be estimated using analysis of covariance. For binary&#xD;
           outcomes risk ratios and risk differences and their 95% CIs will be estimated using&#xD;
           binomial regression. For time-to-event outcomes and rates, hazard ratios will be&#xD;
           estimated using Cox proportional hazards or negative binomial regression models as&#xD;
           appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits and/or IRB&#xD;
      review and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data/document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be monitored and reviewed by the PI or Co-investigators. Training will be given&#xD;
      to the research coordinator and entry of data from the case report forms for analysis will be&#xD;
      verified by a second person from the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, the results will inform clinical practice guidelines, result in better patient&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes, reduce burden on the health care system, and change health-related&#xD;
      policy. For example, all forms of intravenous iron therapy are currently not subsidized by&#xD;
      the Singapore government which is in stark contrast with allogenic blood transfusion, which&#xD;
      is subsidised and readily available at a substantially reduced rate to participants. Hence,&#xD;
      it will cost the participants more out of pocket to be treated with intravenous iron than to&#xD;
      have allogenic blood transfusion. Incorporating a preoperative anemia correction protocol in&#xD;
      the current surgical pathway is a potential strategy to combat healthcare cost inflation and&#xD;
      the increasing demand for blood products.&#xD;
