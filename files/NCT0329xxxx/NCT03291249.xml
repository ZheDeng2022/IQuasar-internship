    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, four-arm, double-blind study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either a daily oral placebo solution or a daily oral dose of&#xD;
      0.5 mg, 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg Foralumab Solution for 30 consecutive days. Subjects will record&#xD;
      adverse events and daily administration of study medication in a subject diary. This will&#xD;
      serve as a measure of compliance and record of safety and tolerability. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up for 30 days following completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits performed on Days 14, 30 and 60 of the study, will monitor metabolic parameters&#xD;
      (body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference), serum lipid profiles, immunological markers&#xD;
      (c-reactive protein [CRP] and an array of cytokines), hepatic enzymes and functions&#xD;
      (13C-methacetin breath test [MBT]) and liver steatosis/fibrosis, which will be compared to&#xD;
      baseline levels (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of the treatment regimen will be determined by monitoring vital&#xD;
      signs, laboratory values, adverse events and physical findings throughout the study. In&#xD;
      addition, its efficacy will be established upon either reduced Day 30 serum alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels, reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or improved homeostasis model&#xD;
      assessment (HOMA) or HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores as compared to baseline (Day&#xD;
      1). In addition, to assess the efficacy of the tested Foralumab Solution regimen in improving&#xD;
      overall subject status, a battery of exploratory metabolic, immunologic and hepatic markers&#xD;
      will be evaluated on Days 30 and 60.&#xD;

      A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIa study for assessment of the safety&#xD;
      of Foralumab, an oral anti-CD3 antibody, in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, four-arm, double-blind study. Subjects will be&#xD;

      overall subject status, a battery of exploratory metabolic, immunologic and hepatic markers&#xD;
      will be evaluated on Days 30 and 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To assess the safety and tolerability of the tested Foralumab Solution regimen in&#xD;
      subjects with both T2DM and NASH/NAFLD Secondary: To assess the efficacy of the tested&#xD;
      Foralumab Solution regimen in improving serum ALT levels, HbA1c, HOMA or HOMA-IR scores in&#xD;
      subjects with both T2DM and NASH/NAFLD.&#xD;

      Exploratory: To assess the efficacy of the tested Foralumab Solution regimen in improving&#xD;
      overall subject status, as measured by a battery of metabolic, immunologic and hepatic&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 adult subjects (≥18 years) with T2DM and who meet the inclusion criteria for NASH or NAFLD&#xD;
      2a Up to 25 Foralumab (TZLS-0401) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against&#xD;
      the CD3-epsilon (or CD3ε) antigen expressed on the surface of a type of white blood cell&#xD;
      called T-cells, or T-lymphocytes. The Fc region of the antibody is mutated to reduce the&#xD;
      cytokine release syndrome associated with parenteral administration of anti CD3. When&#xD;
      administered orally, Foralumab is not absorbed and induces a signal at the level of the gut&#xD;
      immune system to promote regulatory T cells systemically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A once-daily oral dose of Foralumab solution (0.5, 2.5 or 5.0 mg) or placebo solution will be&#xD;
      taken in the morning on an empty stomach for 30 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will receive placebo solution for 30 days (n=12) Group B will receive 0.5 mg&#xD;
      Foralumab Solution daily for 30 days (n=12) Group C will receive 2.5 mg Foralumab Solution&#xD;
      daily for 30 days (n=12) Group D will receive 5.0 mg Foralumab Solution daily for 30 days&#xD;
      (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single 20 mg omeprazole pill will be concomitantly administered daily.&#xD;
