  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Warfarin remains the only oral anticoagulant effective in preventing stroke and valve thrombi&#xD;
      for patients having mechanical heart valves (MHVs). Within Edmonton, Alberta, our&#xD;
      pharmacist-directed and staffed Anticoagulation Clinic (AC) is referred all MHVs implanted,&#xD;
      and now has ~450 active patients. The AC mandate is to work with patients to ensure they have&#xD;
      a thorough understanding of their warfarin therapy and the factors that may impact its&#xD;
      control. In European countries patients are often taught to manage their own warfarin therapy&#xD;
      (=Patient Self-Management [PSM]) and achieve good warfarin control and outcomes. Despite&#xD;
      advocating for a patient-centred approach for healthcare delivery in Alberta, no established&#xD;
      programs (or funding models) exist to teach and provide ongoing support for PSM in North&#xD;
      America. The patient population (namely MHVs) served at our AC offers a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      implement PSM given they are already aware of their therapy and only require some extra&#xD;
      training and support to assume their own management. While it is anticipated that an increase&#xD;
      in pharmacist AC resources would be necessary to teach patients to self-manage, the&#xD;
      establishment of a PSM program has the potential to free up AC resources in the long-term,&#xD;
      allowing more patients to be managed with reducing waiting times for the AC. With&#xD;
      infrastructure in place, the AC could serve as a centre of excellence for PSM, accepting&#xD;
      referrals for this level of care from across the province. Given the patient-centred approach&#xD;
      to care delivery in Alberta, it remains prudent to assess patient acceptability to the PSM&#xD;
      approach to anticoagulation care delivery. As such, the primary objective of this randomized&#xD;
      pilot study is to assess the effect of PSM compared to AC care on quality of life. Our&#xD;
      results will inform a larger scale future trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      50 patients will receive a cover letter outlining their random selection for this study,&#xD;
      along with the patient information sheet and consent form (with a return addressed, postage&#xD;
      paid envelope). Patients will be encouraged to contact the AC and speak with the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (TB) regarding the research study, and all questions will be addressed. We will&#xD;
      continue this mailing process until a total of 50 patients have consented to study. PSM&#xD;
      within the context of this study may use either POC technology or standard venipuncture with&#xD;
      the patient accessing the laboratory for results. After receipt of consent, patients will be&#xD;
      required to pass a foundational exam (outlining the basics of anticoagulation therapy, most&#xD;
      of which should be simple review for the patients managed within our AC).4,10 Upon&#xD;
      successfully passing this multiple choice exam, patients will be randomized to AC care (with&#xD;
      no changes implemented) or to PSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSM Phase I: Preparatory Phase of Patient Training (~6weeks) During the initial preparatory&#xD;
      phase lasting 6 weeks + 2 weeks, the AC will create a patient specific warfarin dosing&#xD;
      nomogram, discuss the same with the patient and ensure clear understanding, while working&#xD;
      through various scenarios with the patient (Appendix 1). The AC will ensure the patient has&#xD;
      an established system to both retrieve INR results (via POC technology or standard&#xD;
      venipuncture) as well as to document the INR results, warfarin dosing, any pertinent&#xD;
      assessment factors, and next date to test the INR. The AC will empower the patient to be&#xD;
      proactive with coming up with warfarin dose changes during this preparatory phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSM Phase II: Patient Practical Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AC will enrol the patient into the PSM practical training phase (lasting 3 months + 1&#xD;
      month). At this time, the patient will retrieve their result and establish a future warfarin&#xD;
      dose and follow-up plan. This information will be transmitted to a single AC team member.&#xD;
      Contact with anotherdiscussed with an AC team member and the ultimate dosing decision will be&#xD;
      tracked to ascertain concordance of the patient's original plan to what was implemented&#xD;
      during the follow-up visit with the to perform standard AC teamcare and management will&#xD;
      occur, thereby enabling comparison of the patient's plan and the AC plan. During this phase,&#xD;
      the AC plan will be implemented. At the end of this phase, patients must pass a multiple&#xD;
      choice exam that provides practical cases targeting warfarin dose adjustment with next&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up visit, and will then be positioned into the PSM arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Self-Management During the PSM phase (6 months +/- 1 month), contact will occur with&#xD;
      the AC monthly to retrieve INR results and warfarin dose adjustments (information from the&#xD;
      patient-based charting system). Key points of contact between the patient and the AC will be&#xD;
      required, such as: INR results either &gt; 5.0 or 0.5 INR units below the lower limit of their&#xD;
      desired target INR range, initiation of interacting medications, illness, etc. Patients not&#xD;
      demonstrating the ability to self-manage their own warfarin therapy will be encouraged to&#xD;
      cross-over to AC care. At the end of 6 months, patient choice of AC care or PSM will be&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
