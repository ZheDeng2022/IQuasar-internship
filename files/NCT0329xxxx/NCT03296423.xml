    <textblock>
      One small recent trial in elderly volunteers showed that BCG vaccination can protect against&#xD;
      infectious complications, while several studies have demonstrated an increased capacity of&#xD;
      innate immune responses to react against pathogens. This process, also called trained&#xD;
      immunity, generates the hypothesis that BCG vaccination can prevent or delay new infections&#xD;
      in the elderly patients and is studied in the ACTIVATE trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an era of antimicrobial resistance, where the already existing antimicrobials are not&#xD;
      sufficient, the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of infections&#xD;
      is of great interest. This approach becomes more and more mandatory in our current era of the&#xD;
      financial crisis where bacterial infections by multidrug-resistant emerge and impose heavily&#xD;
      on the financial burden of the disease. These infections occur more frequently among elderly&#xD;
      patients leading to prolonged hospitalization where unfavorable outcome is not infrequent1.&#xD;
      Vaccination is the traditional approach of infection prevention. A classic example focusing&#xD;
      on the need to prevent morbid re-infection is vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine the&#xD;
      incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia is enormously increasing among the&#xD;
      elderly2. The principle of vaccination is to develop memory B-lymphocytes so that early and&#xD;
      adequate antibody titers are produced upon re-exposure to the same antigen. This is called&#xD;
      the memory function of the adaptive immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well before adaptive immunity develops proper recognition of a bacterial pathogen is done&#xD;
      through binding of well-preserved structures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns&#xD;
      (PAMPs) on pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system and mainly of&#xD;
      blood monocytes and tissue macrophages. Through a series of experiments in cell systems and&#xD;
      animals, it was found that exposure of macrophages to small amounts of PAMPs like the&#xD;
      β-glucan of Candida albicans and constituents of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may prevent death&#xD;
      upon re-exposure to lethal bacterial challenges like C.albicans and Staphylococcus aureus3-6.&#xD;
      Initial exposure to small amounts of PAMPs leads to epigenetic changes that induce the&#xD;
      capacity of macrophages and monocytes to produce high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) that clear efficiently&#xD;
      the pathogen3. This enhancement of the immune cells reaction after appropriate priming to&#xD;
      stimuli totally different from the initial ones is called trained immunity and it could be a&#xD;
      potential pathway of preventing serious infections without having severe adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept has also been tested in healthy volunteers that were vaccinated with placebo or&#xD;
      BCG (Baccillus Calmette Guérin) vaccine. These volunteers were injected 14 days latter a&#xD;
      tri-valent influenza A vaccine. Volunteers previous vaccinated by BCG developed significantly&#xD;
      greater titers against hemagglutinin A of the influenza A virus whereas their circulating&#xD;
      monocytes were more potent for the production of IFNγ7. Finally, a small study has recently&#xD;
      reported that BCG vaccination of the elderly may protect against infections8, but larger&#xD;
      studies are necessary to confirm these findings. This generates hopes that vaccination by BCG&#xD;
      may increase immune resistance and/or tolerance of elderly patients upon exposure to&#xD;
      bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This generates hopes that vaccination by BCG may increase immune tolerance of elderly&#xD;
      patients upon exposure to bacterial diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled approach if&#xD;
      vaccination of elderly patients with BCG vaccine may modulate their disease susceptibility&#xD;
      for bacterial diseases. This will be validated using both clinical and immunological&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
