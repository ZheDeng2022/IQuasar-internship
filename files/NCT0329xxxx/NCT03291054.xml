  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to assess the efficacy of combined IDO and PD-1 inhibition in a single&#xD;
      arm phase II trial of epacadostat and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced&#xD;
      imatinib-refractory GIST, using a primary endpoint of overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), the overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), the response rate and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combined&#xD;
      epacadostat and pembrolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesizes that treatment with epacadostat and pembrolizumab will increase&#xD;
      the response rate compared to what has been historically achieved with salvage tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While targeted therapy with imatinib has significantly improved survival for patients with&#xD;
      inoperable and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the majority will&#xD;
      eventually progress after a median of 20-26 months. Standard second-line treatment with&#xD;
      sunitinib has a response rate of 7%, and third-line treatment with regorafenib has a response&#xD;
      rate of only 5%. More effective treatments for imatinib-refractory GIST are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of combined IDO and PD-1 inhibition with epacadostat&#xD;
      (IDO inhibitor) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in patients with imatinib-refractory&#xD;
      GIST.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the overall response rate as defined as the best response using RECIST v1.1 criteria. A standard way to measure how well a cancer patient responds to treatment. It is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same, or get bigger. To use RECIST, there must be at least one tumor that can be measured on x-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans. The types of response a patient can have are a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), and stable disease (SD). Also called Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors.</description>

&#xD;
               -  The effects of pembrolizumab and epacadostat on the developing human fetus are&#xD;

             of prednisone) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any active or inactive autoimmune process (eg, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
             moderate or severe psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease) or who&#xD;

          -  Any history of serotonin syndrome (SS) after receiving 1 or more serotonergic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy or breast feeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because the teratogenicity of epacadostat and pembrolizumab are unknown. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab and/or epacadostat, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued in all female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccines (including, but not limited to: intranasal&#xD;
             influenza vaccine (FluMist), measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever,&#xD;

             study drug or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow capsules, or refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, an&#xD;
             external biliary shunt, or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate&#xD;
             absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, active liver disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             might confound the results of the study, or interfere with the subject's participation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or reaction to any component of either study drug formulation.&#xD;
