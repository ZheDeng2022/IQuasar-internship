  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase II trial of intravenous (IV) Pembrolizumab MK-3475 in subjects&#xD;
      older than 70 years with advanced Non-small cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) expressing Programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). 82 patients will be enrolled in this trial to examine the efficacy,&#xD;
      the impact on geriatric assessments, the quality of life and the self-reported outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive MK-3475 at a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) (Figure 1).&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated every 9 weeks (63 ± 7 days) with radiographic imaging to assess&#xD;
      response to treatment. QoL and Self-reported Health Questionnaires, as well as geriatric&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed at the same intervals. Investigators will make all&#xD;
      treatment-based decisions using immune-related Response Criteria (irRC). However, for&#xD;
      determination of overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS), the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be used. Adverse events will&#xD;
      be monitored throughout the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined&#xD;
      in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Treatment with&#xD;
      MK-3475 will continue until two years of therapy have been administered, documented disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further&#xD;
      administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject&#xD;
      withdraws consent, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or&#xD;
      administrative reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for a minimum of 30 days for&#xD;
      adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for up to 90 days after&#xD;
      the end of treatment unless the subject starts a new anticancer therapy between days 31 and&#xD;
      90). Subjects will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status, including initiating a&#xD;
      non-study cancer treatment and experiencing disease progression, until death, withdrawing&#xD;
      consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this trial will be dependent upon supplying tumor tissue from a newly&#xD;
      obtained formalin-fixed specimen from locations not radiated prior to biopsy. The specimen&#xD;
      will be evaluated at a central laboratory facility for expression status of Programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1(PD-L1) in a prospective manner. Only subjects whose tumors express Programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1(PD-L1) as determined by the central laboratory facility will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion in this study.&#xD;

             stage NSCLC, chemotherapy or radiation therapy as part of this previous treatment is&#xD;
             allowed, provided they have been completed more than three months ago. Patients who&#xD;
             received adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment or both for early stages will be eligible&#xD;
             for this trial. All adverse events related to these previous treatments must have&#xD;
             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has had any previous malignancy (except non melanoma skin cancer, and cancer in situ&#xD;
             of: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, breast), unless a complete&#xD;
             remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry and no additional therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate if they&#xD;

             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids at a dose over 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent, for at least 7 days prior&#xD;
             to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is&#xD;
             excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxin, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., Hepatitis C&#xD;
             Virus RNA [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
