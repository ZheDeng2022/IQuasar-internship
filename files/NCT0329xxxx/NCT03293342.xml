      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing a 3-5 intervention treatment with&#xD;
      dentist administered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( D-CBT) with a control treatment. The&#xD;
      control treatment is a &quot;treatment as usual&quot; concept using premedication with benzodiazepines&#xD;
      and a common sense approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be performed in a regular dental office. The dentist is working as a&#xD;
      regular dentist and is trained in the CBT Method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Dental fear is common in adults and has a prevalence of about 10-25%.&#xD;
      Approximately 2/3 of fearful patients manage to get through treatment, but with great&#xD;
      discomfort. The remaining 1/3 avoid dental visits and some of them qualify for the diagnosis&#xD;
      odontophobia (prevalence 1,4-7,1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrate reduced oral health in people with dental fear and odontophobia&#xD;
      compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental phobia often develops gradually and patients' dental health would often benefit from&#xD;
      treatment of dental anxiety before the manifestations of phobia; before dental health&#xD;
      deteriorate and avoidance of dental treatment has lasted too long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, it would be beneficial if dental anxiety were effectively treated in a dentist&#xD;
      general practice and thereby easily accessible. Thus there is a need for evidence based&#xD;
      treatment methods for this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological treatment of dental phobia is well documented in multidisciplinary treatment&#xD;
      programmes were psychologists and dentists work together. However, there is a lack of&#xD;
      psychologist resources and high cost of a treatment approach that requires 2 specialists.&#xD;
      This emphasises the need for treatment programs of dental anxiety within dentist's&#xD;
      competence. Dentists can, provided the right training, be successful in the utilisation of&#xD;
      psychological techniques for the treatment of anxiety. Willumsen et al developed and tested&#xD;
      dental anxiety treatment methods including the use of CBT interventions for use by dentists.&#xD;
      This RCT study showed good results at post treatment, also in a 5 year follow up. Two CBT&#xD;
      methods (applied relaxation and cognitive therapy) with contrasting principles (relaxation vs&#xD;
      activation) were tested against nitrous oxide sedation. All three treatment approaches showed&#xD;
      adequate effect but CBT interventions were superior in a longer time perspective. However,&#xD;
      the treatment methods were resource demanding; requiring 10 sessions of treatment. It would&#xD;
      therefore be beneficial to develop a shorter method of treatment that could be used by a&#xD;
      dentist in a general practice and also to test its use within the context of a regular dental&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication with benzodiazepines and a common sense approach including tell-show-do is the&#xD;
      recommended and most frequent used alternative in Norway when treating this group of patients&#xD;
      in general dental practice; Therefore the study is designed to compare the psychological&#xD;
      intervention with these treatment modalities to explore differences in effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a treatment programme with D-CBT have more reduction of dental fear&#xD;
      than traditional treatment with common sense/ premedication&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test D-CBT against a combined pharmacological common sense approach in a RCT study&#xD;
           performed in a general dental practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether demographical data, levels of dental fear, comorbidity, coping&#xD;
           strategies or dentist-patient relation can predict treatment outcome of D-CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To do a 1-year- and 3 year follow-up on the RCT-patients with assessment of levels of&#xD;
           dental fear in the patient, quality of life, oral quality of life and ability to receive&#xD;
           dental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods Design The study is a randomized controlled trial. Population Patients will be&#xD;
           recruited through written and oral information to local dentists and physicians,&#xD;
           advertising in local newspapers or referred from a waiting list at a local dental fear&#xD;
           clinic .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Criteria for inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Strong dental anxiety that affects the patients self-perceived ability to go&#xD;
                through dental treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age over 18&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Agreement to all the practical arrangements of the study Criteria for exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Substance abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Not being able to communicate fluently in Norwegian Sample size Sample size was&#xD;
                estimated with power (1-Betta) 0,8 og type error (alfa) 5%. From these criteria&#xD;
                sample size was calculated to 30 in each group. Drop out is expected to be about&#xD;
                15% giving 35 participants in each group and a total of 70 participants in the&#xD;
                RCT-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Location and operator The study will be performed in a general dental practice in&#xD;
           Mandal, a small town in the south of Norway. All patients will be treated by the same&#xD;
           dentist, an experienced private practitioner with an interest in treating dentally&#xD;
           anxious patients; MSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research psychologists and dentists experienced in treating patients with dental fear&#xD;
           have developed the dentist-based cognitive behaviour treatment method (D-CBT). D-CBT is&#xD;
           based on existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition an expert group consisting of clinical psychologists and dentists, all of&#xD;
           which are experienced in treating dental anxiety, have assessed the practical aspects of&#xD;
           implementing the method and manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A manual describes the intervention in detail. The method will be tested in 5 patients&#xD;
           in a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation procedure Patients are randomized in two groups by simple randomisation.&#xD;
           Lists will be constructed by statistical software and treatments will then be allocated&#xD;
           to patients in sequence using numbered opaque envelopes containing treatment&#xD;
           allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention group All patients in the D-CBT group will go through 3- 5&#xD;
           consultations with a duration of 60 minutes or 3 sessions of 90 minutes aimed at&#xD;
           treating their dental anxiety. The appointments will be spaced with a maximum of 2 weeks&#xD;
           to minimize the setback that will often occur between appointments (detailed description&#xD;
           in appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All sessions will be videotaped throughout the study. The control group The&#xD;
           non-intervention group will be offered premedication with midazolam during dental&#xD;
           treatment per standard procedures. Common sense principles as communication skills,&#xD;
           control and tell-show-do will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Similarities between the control and the intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Building a good relation with the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stop signal will be utilized&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explain and show what the dentist wants to do before doing treatment (tell-show-do)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The treatment should be as painless as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
           Differences between the control and the intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Midazolam/tell-show-do&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sedation is an alternative&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Minimalizing exposure to the patient (for example hiding instead of showing the&#xD;
                syringe while putting the anaesthetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Psycological intervention -characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Psychoeducation about anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exploration of the individual anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exposure to the frightening stimuli (no hiding, but actively showing in detail all&#xD;
                components of dental treatment, preferably utilizing a mirror while doing&#xD;
                treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Each patient receives a project number. A codebook between project number and&#xD;
           journal number is stored at the Specialist Center of Public Dental Health in South&#xD;
           Norway All data will be registered online using Nettskjema to collect data directly into&#xD;
           Services for sensitive data (TSD). The research data from each patient will only be&#xD;
           identified by the project number.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data will be stored and analysed using the TSD platform. TSD complies with the&#xD;
           directive of privacy and electronic communication in Norway. TSD is developed and&#xD;
           operated by the University of Oslos' centre for IT (USIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only MSH and the supervisors will be given access to the data in TSD. All video&#xD;
           recordings will be stored on encrypted memory sticks locked in a filing cabinet. The key&#xD;
           to the filing cabinet is kept in a key cabinet locked by a code. The code is known only&#xD;
           by the dentist (MSH) and the dental secretary (KL). The recordings will be stored up&#xD;
           until publication of articles and TW is responsible for deleting them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistics The current project uses a traditional experimental research design to assess&#xD;
           the research hypothesis. In order to compare differences between the 35 participants in&#xD;
           the two research conditions the data will be analysed with regression analysis. A 2x2&#xD;
           repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test if the experimental condition of five&#xD;
           sessions of D-CBT treatment is superior to the control condition of premedication and&#xD;
           gradual habituation. A factor analytic approach will be used to assess the level of&#xD;
           influence on the results by factors like: age; gender; social economic status and&#xD;
           substance abuse. The statistical analysis will be completed using the IBM SPSS&#xD;
           statistical software version 16.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measure of treatment quality and adherence All sessions will be videotaped throughout&#xD;
           the study. At least 20% of the tapes will be viewed by the supervisors to ensure&#xD;
           continued treatment quality and adherence to manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographics data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following demographics will be registered: Sex, age, Norwegian skills, civil status,&#xD;
           children, education, work status, self-assessment of health, self-assessment of oral&#xD;
           health and substance abuse. The patients register time since last regular appointment&#xD;
           with a dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Level of dental anxiety: Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) and Index of dental&#xD;
           anxiety and fear (IDAF-4C+). .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measures to identify factors that may influence treatment outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-traumatic stress disorder: Post-traumatic stress disorder-checklist (PCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Depression and anxiety: The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Oral examination and assessment of x-rays. Three. dentists separately record oral health&#xD;
           and treatment needs based on the radiographs (BWs and OPG). With access to the initial&#xD;
           clinical recordings, the diagnostic registrations will then be discussed among the three&#xD;
           dentists until a consensus is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oral Health: Decayed, missed or filled teeth (DMFT).Root-filled teeth. Remnants of roots&#xD;

           treatment,root fillings, bridges , dentures and extractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethics: The study is approved by the Regional Ethics. To make sure the quality of the&#xD;
           intervention meets adequate standards, the dentist will go through training by qualified&#xD;
           personnel before the study is initiated and there will be a continuous surveillance by&#xD;
           watching videotapes of the treatment to ensure that the quality will be upheld&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
