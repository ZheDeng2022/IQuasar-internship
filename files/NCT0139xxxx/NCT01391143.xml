  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MGA271 when given by intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion to patients with refractory cancer. The study will also evaluate how long MGA271&#xD;
      stays in the blood and how long it takes for it to leave the body, what is the highest dose&#xD;
      that can safely be given, and whether it may have an effect on tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 1, dose-escalation study will be&#xD;
      conducted to define the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), immunogenicity, and potential antitumor activity of MGA271 in patients with refractory&#xD;
      cancer that expresses B7-H3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial segments of the study, patients will be monitored for a minimum of four weeks&#xD;
      after administration of the final dose of MGA271. Study assessments will include adverse&#xD;
      event (AE) monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, PK analysis of serum MGA271,&#xD;
      determination of the serum concentration of soluble MGA271 and tumor markers, and an&#xD;
      assessment of potential anti-MGA271 antibody [human anti-human antibody (HAHA)] response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response assessments using Study Day 43 CT scans or MRI will be performed approximately&#xD;
      six weeks after the first MGA271 dose for each patient. Patients with evidence of clinical&#xD;
      benefit (partial or complete response or stable disease by RECIST or RANO Response criteria)&#xD;
      will be allowed to continue therapy at the same dose, or at a reduced dose if warranted by&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or significant AE in Cycle 1. Subsequent cycles which will begin&#xD;
      on Study Day 50 will consist of MGA271 administration on Study Days 1, 8, and 15 of each&#xD;
      28-day cycle, with tumor evaluation every other cycle. Responding patients may receive&#xD;
      continued antibody therapy until evidence of progression of disease is documented or the&#xD;
      patient experiences DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Expansion Segment of the study, patients will receive weekly, uninterrupted infusions&#xD;
      with an initial response assessment at 8 weeks. Tumor evaluation will be carried out by both&#xD;
      RECIST and immune-related response criteria (irRC).&#xD;

Patients treated in the Expansion Segment at the maximum administered dose will receive weekly, uninterrupted infusions of MGA271 in 8 week cycles for up to 12 cycles.</description>
