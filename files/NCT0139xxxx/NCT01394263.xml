      This trial was an open-label, randomized, parallel treatment, active-control multicenter&#xD;
      study in adult males with documented metastatic prostate cancer disease who were judged to be&#xD;
      candidates for hormone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 21 days prior to implant insertion, all prospective enrollees were entered into a&#xD;
      screening period to provide medical history, demographic information, physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations, 12-lead ECG, bone scan, chest x-ray, liver ultrasound, concomitant&#xD;
      medications and procedures, and a physician assessment including pain level and WHO&#xD;
      performance scale in order to assess eligibility for the study. Written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained before any procedures were undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once inclusion/exclusion criteria were met, baseline evaluations (physical assessment and&#xD;
      examination, vital signs and weight, clinical laboratory evaluations, concomitant medications&#xD;
      and procedures, adverse events, and a Quality of Life questionnaire) were obtained prior to&#xD;
      implant insertion on Day 1 [Visit 1]. All appropriately screened patients were to then&#xD;
      receive either histrelin acetate 50-mg or Zoladex 3-Month 10.8 mg implant based on 1:1&#xD;
      randomization at Day 1 [Visit 1]. Patients with implants were evaluated at Week 1 and 2&#xD;
      [Visits 2 and 3] post-insertion for testosterone and PSA concentrations, vital signs, adverse&#xD;
      events, and concomitant medications and procedures. The Zoladex implants were replaced at&#xD;
      Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 [Visits 6, 9, 12, and 15], while the histrelin acetate implants were&#xD;
      replaced at Week 52 (Visit 16), respectively. Patients were followed monthly from Weeks 4 to&#xD;
      60 [Visits 4 to 18] to evaluate testosterone and PSA concentrations, adverse events,&#xD;
      concomitant medications and procedures, disease progression, and urine and serum histrelin in&#xD;
      the renal/hepatic impairment subgroup. Periodic clinical and subjective assessments were&#xD;
      completed for all patients.&#xD;
