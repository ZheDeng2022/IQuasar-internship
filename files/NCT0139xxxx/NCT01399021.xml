    <textblock>
      There is no standard of care of management following parotidectomies. Most practitioners&#xD;
      however place a drain (usually a flat Davol closed suction drain/ Hemovac in the&#xD;
      investigators institutions) in the wound bed at the end of the procedure, which is usually&#xD;
      removed the day following the surgery, or when the drain output reaches a subjective number&#xD;
      (depending on surgeon preference). The investigators hypothesis is that there is no&#xD;
      difference in hematoma/bleeding or infection rate when post parotidectomy drains are removed&#xD;
      in the recovery area on the day of the surgery prior to discharge, compared to drains that&#xD;
      are kept in place for at least 1 day or until drainage is less than 50 cc/24 hrs. The&#xD;
      investigators would therefore like to undergo a randomized control clinical trial to assess&#xD;
      the rate of significant hematoma formation and infection, the need for readmission and length&#xD;
      of admission secondary to these complications when comparing 2 groups: one where drains are&#xD;
      removed prior to discharge from the recovery area and the other where the patients are&#xD;
      discharged with the drain and seen the next post operative day in the office. The drain&#xD;
      output will then be measured and the drain taken out.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parotidectomies involve the removal of all or a portion of the parotid gland off the facial&#xD;
      nerve in the case of superficial parotidectomies, and total removal of the gland in the case&#xD;
      of total parotidectomies. The most common indications for this procedure are for benign&#xD;
      neoplasms such as pleomorphic adenomas, oncocytomas and Warthin tumors, or for malignant&#xD;
      involvement of the gland such as metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Hematoma&#xD;
      formation or bleeding following parotidectomy is a less emphasized early complication of this&#xD;
      procedure, usually secondary to unrecognized incomplete hemostasis prior to incision closure.&#xD;
      Hematoma formation rate post parotidectomy has been reported to vary between 3.8% (Upton et&#xD;
      al.) and 6.1% (Laccourreye et al.). In case of bleeding or rapidly expanding hematomas, the&#xD;
      patient is usually brought back to the operating room for surgical drainage of the hematoma&#xD;
      and surgical control of any identified bleeding vessels (Myers et al). Small hematomas can&#xD;
      usually be managed expectantly. Wound infection following parotidectomy usually also ranges&#xD;
      around 3.8% (Upton et al.) to 5.4% (Henney et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There is no difference in hematoma/bleeding or infection rate when post&#xD;
      parotidectomy drains are removed in the recovery area on the day of the surgery prior to&#xD;
      discharge, compared to drains that are kept in place for at least 1 day or until drainage is&#xD;
      less than 50 cc/24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the literature has shown paucity of publication about this particular complication&#xD;
      and post operative preventative management. The current postoperative management following&#xD;
      parotidectomies is not evidence based, and is institution or surgeon dependent, ranging from&#xD;
      primary closure without a drain, to placement of a drain that is removed either on&#xD;
      post-operative day 1-14 (in hospital or in the community), and from no overnight stay to&#xD;
      patient hospitalization until the drain is removed. Patel et al. 2006 have published a review&#xD;
      of postoperative drainage following their parotidectomies, including primary closure without&#xD;
      drain, with drain, with absorbable hemostatic agents and with fibrin sealants. As mentioned&#xD;
      by these authors, suction drains do not prevent hematomas, but do help to remove drainage and&#xD;
      close dead space. In his paper, the average drain output on post operative day 1 was 27.1 ml,&#xD;
      but these authors do not address the optimal time for drain removal. The timing of removal of&#xD;
      neck drains following head and neck surgery was addressed by Harris T. et al, who found that&#xD;
      drains could be safely removed when the volume falls to 50 ml or less over a 24 hour period,&#xD;
      with only 9% of their patients developing seromas. Moreover, a retrospective review of the&#xD;
      timing of neck hematoma formation post carotid endarterectomy showed that 95% of their&#xD;
      patients experiencing neck hematomas or neurological deficits occurred within 8 hours&#xD;
      following surgery, indicating that same evening discharge was possible following this type of&#xD;
      surgery (Sheehan M.K et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In their prospective four armed randomized controlled trial investigating the use of&#xD;
      subcutaneous catheter drain and antibiotic irrigation of abdominal incision closures, Farnell&#xD;
      et al. have found no statistical difference in infection rate in wounds with lesser degree of&#xD;
      contamination (Type II and III) between groups without drains and with drains for 4 days.&#xD;
      Clean procedures (Type I wound) such as in parotidectomies should thus have similar infection&#xD;
      rates with very temporary drains compared to no drains. The optimal time for catheter removal&#xD;
      was however not addressed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary investigator has noted during his 30 years of practice as a Head and Neck surgeon&#xD;
      that significant hematoma formation or bleeding that would require surgical management&#xD;
      following parotidectomy is usually a very early complication that is often recognized within&#xD;
      the few hours following surgery due to the superficiality of the wound, when the patient is&#xD;
      in the postoperative area. It is our belief that removal of the drain in the post operative&#xD;
      area, just prior to the patient's discharge allows for the decreased risk for unrecognized&#xD;
      bleeding while and decreasing risks of nosocomial infections and patient colonization with&#xD;
      resistant bacterial strains, unnecessary prolonged discomfort to the patient in the form of&#xD;
      the drain, as well as unnecessary use of hospital resources such as the need for overnight&#xD;
      stay in the hospital. The average cost for one postsurgical hospital day for an out of&#xD;
      province resident at Vancouver General Hospital costs about C$3000 per day. We also believe&#xD;
      that wound infection rate would be equivalent if not less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical equipoise exists as there is still controversy about the timing of the drain&#xD;
      removal. Since no previous study has addressed the need or optimal timing of surgical drain&#xD;
      removal following parotidectomies, we would also like to undertake a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to address the hematoma and infection rate in post parotidectomy patients, depending on&#xD;
      whether a drain is removed in the recovery area, or the next post operative day. This would&#xD;
      follow a retrospective review study (H11-01433).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our prospective randomized controlled trial, we would like to assess the rate of hematoma&#xD;
      formation and infection, the need for readmission and length of admission secondary to these&#xD;
      complications when comparing 2 groups: one where drains are removed prior to discharge from&#xD;
      the recovery area and the other where the patients are discharged with the drain and seen the&#xD;
      next post operative day in the office. The drain output will then be measured and the drain&#xD;
      taken out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prospective randomized controlled trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion criteria: patients age ≥ 18 years old, competent, undertaking unilateral&#xD;
                or bilateral parotidectomies at Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver; St. Paul's&#xD;
                Hospital, Vancouver; or Surrey Memorial Hospital, Surrey, Eagle Ridge Hospital,&#xD;
                Port Moody.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exclusion criteria: patients on anticoagulation therapy, ASA ≥ 3 where a patient&#xD;
                would require post operative overnight admission secondary to his comorbidities,&#xD;
                immunosuppression such as concurrent radiation or chemotherapy or receiving high&#xD;
                dose corticosteroids, and concommitant infections requiring antibiotics, patients&#xD;
                who are having additional head and neck procedures at the time of the&#xD;
                parotidectomy, other than skin excision (eg. Modified neck dissection,&#xD;
                mandibulectomy, external auditory canal resection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be recruited and consent obtained (see below for details of consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consented patients will be randomly assigned a unique subject number, not derived&#xD;
           from personal identifiers, then randomly assigned to either of the 2 arm groups, through&#xD;
           the use of opaque envelopes that will be opened after skin closure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Drain placement and patient discharge with the drain. The patient will then be seen&#xD;
                the next postoperative day by the surgeon to have the drain output measured and the&#xD;
                drain taken out. In the very unlikely case that a drain output exceeds 50 cc/24&#xD;
                hrs, the patient will be asked to come back on the 3rd post operative day for drain&#xD;
                removal, when the output will likely be even less than 50cc/24 hrs (Harris, T et&#xD;
                al.).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Drain placement with removal prior to discharge on the same postoperative day from&#xD;
                the recovery area, irrespective of volume drained (volume will be measured).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Permutated blocks of 4, unbeknownst to the surgeon will be used to allow for equal&#xD;
           balance in sample size of the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be stratified on the basis of which hospital they had the surgery at.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients and surgeon will be blinded until the end of surgery. The outcome assessor&#xD;
           cannot be blinded to the different arms under this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If clinical judgment requires that a patient be admitted, or have the drain kept longer&#xD;
           than the assigned time, the patient will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes measured include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant Hematoma /Bleeding rate (primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for surgical reexploration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant Hematoma: Blood collection/Bleeding at the wound site that was diagnosed by&#xD;
           a doctor and that requires surgical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection: Record of positive pus culture if patient in hospital, record of abscess&#xD;
           diagnosed by a physician through clinical exam, imaging or during surgical drainage, or&#xD;
           spontaneous drainage of purulent material from wound incision with associated localized&#xD;
           pain. Wound erythema that spontaneously resolved will not be included in this outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospitalization: Number of nights patient stayed in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical reexploration: Patient is brought back to the OR for hemostasis or where wound&#xD;
           incision is opened and drained following hematoma or abscess formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outcomes will be measured by the outcome assessor at 30 days post operatively, where&#xD;
           outcomes will be determined by contacting the patients (by questionnaire, telephone&#xD;
           interview), regarding presence or absence of significant hematoma, infection, number of&#xD;
           nights spent in hospital and whether or not they had a surgical exploration, with the&#xD;
           definitions of these outcomes given to them. These outcomes will be confirmed via the&#xD;
           patient's chart review or with the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Details of consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Source of the contact information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the primary health care provider's file (the primary investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who will collect the contact information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator not acting as health care provider will obtain the list of patient's&#xD;
           name from the VGH ENT outpatient clinic after they are consented for parotidectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who will make the initial contact with the prospective subject and how and when will the&#xD;
           initial contact be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-coercive initial contact with the prospective participants will be undertaken&#xD;
           through numerous approaches: notices to invite prospective participants will be posted&#xD;
           in the clinic rooms, waiting rooms as well as the the secretary's office in the&#xD;
           outpatient VGH ENT Clinic. Interested prospective participants can either call the&#xD;
           investigator, who will mail the information package to their address or the secretary&#xD;
           (acting as study co-ordinator) who can hand them an information package.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secretary (acting as the study co-ordinator) will also hand a package to prospective&#xD;
           potential participants. The package will contain an introductory letter signed by the&#xD;
           Primary Investigator describing the background behind the study, justifications and aim&#xD;
           of the study as well as the methodology of the study and details on how to contact the&#xD;
           investigator. In the letter, they will also be notified that the investigator (not&#xD;
           involved in their primary care, along with her stated relationship to the VGH ENT clinic&#xD;
           and the Primary Investigator) will be contacting them within the next 1-2 weeks to give&#xD;
           more information about the study, answer any questions that they might have and see&#xD;
           whether they would be interested in participating in the study. They would also be&#xD;
           invited to call the Primary investigator/ health care provider if they have any&#xD;
           questions to which the person making initial contact cannot respond. Additionally, it&#xD;
           will be confirmed in writing that the patient's decision in participation will have no&#xD;
           impact on the patient's level of care. Also included in the package will be a consent&#xD;
           form for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On handing the package, the secretary/co-ordinator will tell the prospective participant&#xD;
           that their health care provider and his colleague are undertaking a study involving the&#xD;
           surgery they will be undergoing and that they are invited to learn more about the study&#xD;
           through the package. The co-ordinator will also let them know verbally that Primary&#xD;
           Investigator's colleague, who also works in the clinic, will be contacting them within&#xD;
           the next 1-2 weeks to discuss the project in more detail and see whether they would be&#xD;
           interested in the study (this will also be mentioned in writing in the introductory&#xD;
           letter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the investigator (not involved in the care of the patient) is in the clinic at the&#xD;
           time that the prospective participant is in the clinic, she will introduce herself to&#xD;
           the prospective participant and detail her relationship to the VGH ENT clinic and the&#xD;
           Primary Investigator, and hand the package to the patient, inviting them to go through&#xD;
           the details of the study and informing the patient that she will call them within the&#xD;
           following 2 weeks to discuss the study in more detail and to see whether they would be&#xD;
           interested in participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship of study team members to prospective participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prospective participants will be under the Primary Investigator's care; therefore,&#xD;
           the PI will not make the initial contact as detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The other investigator involved in the study (PGY2 ENT resident) will not be involved in&#xD;
           the care of the patient, nor is the secretary/acting as co-ordinator and therefore will&#xD;
           not create a coercive contact with the prospective participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consent form will be explained by the investigator not involved in the care of the&#xD;
           patient (but also working at the VGH ENT clinic), via the phone, within 1-2 weeks&#xD;
           following the prospective participants' receipt of the information package (that&#xD;
           includes the consent form), obtained at the time of their clinic visit or mailed to&#xD;
           them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consent will be obtained after the phone discussion about the study, when the&#xD;
           patient will be asked to sign the consent form included in their information package&#xD;
           during their clinic visit and mail the consent in a prepaid envelope. If the patients&#xD;
           decide to think about whether they want to participate, they will be invited to do so&#xD;
           and bring the consent form on the day of the surgery. The procedure will be undertaken&#xD;
           over the phone since no participant recruitment can take place at the time of the&#xD;
           patient visit to the clinic, and so as to minimize patient inconvenience in the form of&#xD;
           mobilization (unless prospective participants prefer to do so) for a face to face&#xD;
           discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the phone call, the patients will be given information concerning the background&#xD;
           behind this study, and justifications as well as the objectives for undertaking this&#xD;
           study. The patients will be advised that, were they to consent to participate in this&#xD;
           study, they would not know which arm they would be assigned to until after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients would be reassured that their decision in participating in the study would&#xD;
           not impact in their level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will be informed that were they to be randomized in arm #1, they would be given an&#xD;
           appointment time for the following day to meet one of the authors for drain output&#xD;
           measurement and drain removal. In the very unlikely event that the drain output is &gt;50&#xD;
           cc/24 hrs, another appointment for the post operative day 3 will be arranged for removal&#xD;
           and measurement of drain output.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They would also be informed that one of the authors of the study would contact them at&#xD;
           the 30 day mark to ask about whether they had any bleeding/significant hematoma,&#xD;
           infection and number of nights spent in hospital and whether or not they had a surgical&#xD;
           exploration, with the definitions of these outcomes given to them. They would also be&#xD;
           informed that the obtained information would be confirmed through their hospital and&#xD;
           medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time dedicated to discussion of study and prior to consent: 15 minutes unless patients&#xD;
           has additional questions; this will take place within 2 weeks of the receipt of the&#xD;
           information package.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum time needed to dedicate to the study if patient is randomized to the group where&#xD;
           the drain is removed the same post operative day: 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum time needed to dedicate to the study if patient is randomized to group where&#xD;
           drain is removed on the next post operative day: 15 minutes (excluding transportation&#xD;
           time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum time required for questionnaire filling/over the phone questionnaire (excluding&#xD;
           time required to post prepaid envelope): 5 minutes; this will be taking place 1 month&#xD;
           following the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential benefits to the subject that could arise from his or her participation in the&#xD;
           proposed research: Possible therapeutic benefits include more frequent follow- up visits&#xD;
           (and therefore patient reassurance) in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provisions made to break the code of a double-blind study in an emergency situation, and&#xD;
           indicate who has the code: There will be no need for provisions to unblind the patients&#xD;
           or surgeon as both arms will have drains placed in. The surgeons and patients will both&#xD;
           be unblinded at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All paper form study data including consent forms will be held in a locked filling&#xD;
           cabinet in the ENT Department at Vancouver General Hospital. Patients will be assigned a&#xD;
           random and unique number in a patient log, which will be kept in an appropriately&#xD;
           secured electronic form. Data collected are identified using the unique subject number&#xD;
           that has not been derived from any personal identifiers; i.e. the data collected is&#xD;
           already de-identified before being entered in the database. This file containing the&#xD;
           data collection is also password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provisions during the consenting process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No provision is possible during the consenting process as the consent will be discussed with&#xD;
      the patient on the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size &amp; Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      400 patients will be recruited to achieve a power of 0.8, taking into account that an&#xD;
      intention to treat analysis will be undertaken, where it is assumed that average rate of&#xD;
      hematoma formation post parotidectomy in the late drain removal group is 10% and 2.5% in&#xD;
      early drain removal group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 100th patient, an interim analysis will be undertaken, and if there is any&#xD;
           significant difference in hematoma or infection rate (p&lt;0.05), the study will be&#xD;
           stopped. Additional patients who would already be enrolled but have not been randomized&#xD;
           yet would be contacted by writing to be advised of the results of the study and of the&#xD;
           end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results will then be anonymously analyzed using a t-Test by a medical statistician.&#xD;
           The results of this study will be published in a medical journal. The data will be kept&#xD;
           for a minimum of five years following publication of the study results, following which&#xD;
           hard copies will be shredded and computer databases will be deleted.&#xD;
