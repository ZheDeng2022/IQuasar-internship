      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that carbidopa in daily doses of 450mg will enter the central&#xD;
      nervous system and partially inhibit AAAD, thereby reducing the decarboxylation of exogenous&#xD;
      levodopa to dopamine, and thereby blunt the therapeutic effects of levodopa in PD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see how low dose vs. high dose of the study drug, carbidopa&#xD;
      effect movement in subjects with Parkinson's disease. The low dose of the study drug is 75 mg&#xD;
      and the high dose is 450mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the investigators clinic when they are seen for treatment for&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. Subjects will also be recruited through flyers hung at OHSU and at the&#xD;
      VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take part in 2 screening visits one week apart to determine eligibility.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly chosen to start either high or low dose carbidopa and take it for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will be called 2, 4, and 6 or 7 days after this visit to ask how they are&#xD;
      doing after starting this dose of study drug. We will leave them a message if we cannot reach&#xD;
      them. If there are any problems, we will schedule them to come to the clinic within the next&#xD;
      2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have an outpatient visit 2 weeks after screening and a hospital admission 2&#xD;
      weeks after that. At the hospital, subjects will stay for 3 days. They will have blood drawn&#xD;
      and their Parkinson's disease assessed by a finger tapping exercise, timing their walking,&#xD;
      and looking at their uncontrolled movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will then receive the opposite dose of carbidopa for 4 weeks. Subjects will be&#xD;
      called 2, 4, and 6 or 7 days after this visit to ask how they are doing after starting this&#xD;
      dose of study drug. We will leave them a message if we cannot reach them. If there are any&#xD;
      problems, we will schedule them to come to the clinic within the next 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient visit and hospital admission will repeat again. At the end of the second&#xD;
      hospital admission, treatment on the study is over and subjects will go back to their&#xD;
      original Parkinson's disease medications. The study will end with a follow up phone call or&#xD;
      clinic visit 2 - 4 weeks after the final hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will fill out a daily diary that asks about their movement throughout the day for 3&#xD;
      days before they come to the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbidopa is used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa. This protocol is&#xD;
      using a high dose of 450mg of carbidopa. This study is also using IV levodopa, which is a&#xD;
      different route than is normally given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finger tapping rates will be compared between high and low dose study drug use to see if one&#xD;
      group has slower rates than the other.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive&#xD;
      motor symptoms of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The prevalence is estimated at&#xD;
      102-109/100,000 and increases with age. It is the second most common neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorder after Alzheimer's disease, and the annual cost in the US is estimated to be $14.3&#xD;
      billion dollars per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Parkinson's disease (PD) dopamine containing neurons in the substantia nigra are&#xD;
      selectively lost, which causes motor dysfunction. Dopamine levels may be increased by giving&#xD;
      oral levodopa, which improves motor function in PD. After oral administration, levodopa is&#xD;
      taken into the brain and converted into dopamine by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD)&#xD;
      enzyme in the striatum , resulting in improved dopaminergic neurotransmission. AAAD is found&#xD;
      in the peripheral tissues as well as in the brain, and prior to passage into the central&#xD;
      nervous system levodopa may be decarboxylated to dopamine in the small bowel and liver.&#xD;
      Peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine significantly reduces the amount of levodopa&#xD;
      that reaches the brain and therefore dopamine available for neurotransmission. The presence&#xD;
      of dopamine in the periphery also produces anorexia and nausea. Carbidopa is an AAAD&#xD;
      inhibitor that reduces the conversion of levodopa to dopamine. It is thought to not cross the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier and to affect only peripheral AAAD. This concept is of fundamental&#xD;
      importance in the current treatment of PD. Carbidopa potentiates levodopa so that a much&#xD;
      lower dose is effective. It also reduces anorexia and nausea, which often occur after giving&#xD;
      levodopa alone. For this reason, almost all levodopa is marketed as carbidopa/levodopa&#xD;
      tablets. This combination drug has become the standard of care for PD. As the disease&#xD;
      progresses, increasingly high amounts of the carbidopa/levodopa combination are given to&#xD;
      ensure adequate motor functioning, though the response to treatment becomes much less&#xD;
      predictable with frequent fluctuations in motor ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though conventional wisdom and older pharmacological studies suggest carbidopa does not&#xD;
      penetrate the blood-brain barrier, recent animal studies contradict this. This is very&#xD;
      important because if carbidopa entered the central nervous system in humans it could&#xD;
      significantly inhibit levodopa conversion into dopamine, and thus reduce its therapeutic&#xD;
      effects. A single large dose of carbidopa given to a normal rat, or a rat chemically lesioned&#xD;
      to mimic PD, resulted in carbidopa entrance into the central nervous system, and inhibition&#xD;
      of brain AAAD and conversion of levodopa to dopamine (1, 2). It is not known whether&#xD;
      prolonged use of high dose carbidopa worsens motor function over time in humans. A small&#xD;
      series of patients with PD and motor fluctuations that were switched from carbidopa/levodopa&#xD;
      to levodopa alone were reported to have improvement in motor features(3). Carbidopa is&#xD;
      typically given in a one to four ratio of carbidopa to levodopa in each pill, and chronic&#xD;
      high dosing of caribopa and levodopa is common in PD. If carbidopa penetrates into the&#xD;
      central nervous system in humans it could lead to decreased conversion of levodopa to&#xD;
      dopamine in the central nervous system, and decrease the therapeutic response to administered&#xD;
      levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized, double blind, controlled trial with crossover to explore two&#xD;
      mechanisms by which carbidopa may accumulate in the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If given in high doses over 4 weeks, carbidopa may slowly accumulate in the central nervous&#xD;
      system and impair dopamine synthesis and thereby motor function in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Compare motor response to 2 hour levodopa infusion after 4 weeks of high dose&#xD;
      carbidopa and after 4 weeks of low dose carbidopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks of high dose carbidopa, subjects may notice more &quot;off&quot; time than after 4 weeks&#xD;
      of low dose carbidopa. Changes in response to levodopa can be evaluated by a patient diary&#xD;
      and by the need to increase daily levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the clinical response to oral levodopa at the end of a 4 weeks treatment&#xD;
      with high dose carbidopa and with low dose carbidopa measured by an &quot;on/off&quot; diary and with&#xD;
      total daily levodopa dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternate reason for carbidopa to enter the central nervous system (CNS) is through a&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier that has become abnormal as a result of age and PD. In this case a single&#xD;
      large dose of carbidopa may enter the CNS and reduce the conversion of levodopa to dopamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: Compare the clinical response to 2 hour levodopa infusion administered with 25mg&#xD;
      carbidopa or 150mg carbidopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstrating that high doses of carbidopa diminishe the response to levodopa would alter&#xD;
      current practice, as clinicians presently are not concerned about the quantity of carbidopa&#xD;
      administered to patients with PD. As a result of this study, a significant insight into the&#xD;
      management of advanced PD will be gained. The overall goal is to better understand if use of&#xD;
      high dose carbidopa may paradoxically complicate treatment. A positive or negative finding&#xD;
      will have important therapeutic implications. This study has potential to fundamentally&#xD;
      change how we treat PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. 1 Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD is a common neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressive tremor, rigidity, and&#xD;
      bradykinesia. The risk for developing PD increases with age. The prevalence ranges from&#xD;
      102-109/100,000 in Western countries and incidence rate of 1.7 per 1000 person years(4, 5).&#xD;
      There is increased direct cost to the individual and a substantial indirect cost to the&#xD;
      family(6, 7). The overall estimated cost of PD in the US is $14.3 billion dollars&#xD;
      annually(8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though PD is associated with a variety of clinical features, patients typically present with&#xD;
      motor dysfunction. Motor signs are caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia&#xD;
      nigra. The mainstay of treatment for motor signs is correction of dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission by oral administration of levodopa, a precursor of dopamine. The risk of&#xD;
      death in PD is significantly reduced by the use of levodopa and responsiveness to levodopa&#xD;
      treatment is a strong predictor of survival(9, 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. 2. Pharmacology of Levodopa and Carbidopa Levodopa is taken up by the small bowel and&#xD;
      heavily metabolized by AAAD located in the intestinal mucosa, and to a lesser degree by the&#xD;
      liver. As a result of this first pass peripheral metabolism, the bioavailability of levodopa&#xD;
      in the serum after oral administration is approximately 30%(11) and peripheral metabolism of&#xD;
      levodopa continues after the first pass metabolism so that only a small amount of levodopa&#xD;
      enters the CNS if AAAD is not inhibited. Carbidopa is an AAAD inhibitor and can be given&#xD;
      along with levodopa to prevent the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, and&#xD;
      increase the overall bioavailability of levodopa by two to fourfold. Higher doses of&#xD;
      carbidopa produce higher plasma levels of levodopa. Carbidopa is also of clinical importance&#xD;
      since carbidopa reduces anorexia and nausea related to the effects of dopamine on the area&#xD;
      postrema which is effectively outside the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional clinical thinking assumes carbidopa does not penetrate the blood brain barrier,&#xD;
      and by this virtue will not interfere with central conversion of levodopa to dopamine (12).&#xD;
      The studies supporting this assumption rely on animal models and utilize single doses of&#xD;
      carbidopa (13)(14). Clinical dictum indicates a minimum of 75 milligrams of carbidopa be&#xD;
      given daily to produce reasonable inhibition of the AAAD. Aside from the primary effect of&#xD;
      inhibiting the decarboxylation of levodopa in the periphery and potentiating the effects of&#xD;
      levodopa, carbidopa has no demonstrated pharmacological effect. Since carbidopa is not&#xD;
      thought to penetrate the blood brain barrier it is considered a peripheral decarboxylase&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. 3. Carbidopa Acts Centrally to Prevent Formation of Dopamine Evidence from laboratory&#xD;
      studies has appeared in recent years suggesting carbidopa penetrates the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      to a greater extent than realized. One piece of evidence is based on single injection models&#xD;
      using microdialysate techniques for drug level measurement in normal rats (1). A single high&#xD;
      dose of carbidopa 50mg/kg may inhibit the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity in the&#xD;
      striatum of normal rats by 75% (2). Benserazide is a peripheral AAAD inhibitor similar to&#xD;
      carbidopa. Benserazide administration 50mg/kg prolongs the time to reach peak dopamine level&#xD;
      by 60 minutes centrally. Administration of benserazide 10mg/kg and 50mg/kg decreases striatal&#xD;
      AAAD activity in normal rats by 28% and 78% respectively, and in rats modeled to mimic PD&#xD;
      benserazide 10mg/kg and 50mg/kg decreases striatal AAAD activity 75% and 88%, respectively&#xD;
      (15). Even if a small percent of each dose of carbidopa enters the CNS, long-term use could&#xD;
      allow carbidopa to accumulate if clearance of carbidopa is not rapid. A small study suggests&#xD;
      that motor fluctuations improve in advanced PD when patients receive levodopa without an&#xD;
      aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (3). It was demonstrated in an earlier study with&#xD;
      an experimental formulation of extended release carbidopa/levodopa that some patients had&#xD;
      worse motor function with three times the dose of carbidopa/levodopa despite an adequate&#xD;
      plasma levodopa level (16). High dose carbidopa is typically used in advanced PD. When high&#xD;
      dose carbidopa is given chronically this may create a situation where carbidopa accumulates&#xD;
      in the central nervous system and could thereby worsen motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. 4. Alteration of the Blood Brain Barrier in PD May Be a Mechanism by Which Carbidopa&#xD;
      Inhibits Central AAAD Another consideration is that the blood brain barrier is altered in PD&#xD;
      and could allow entry of substances previously sequestered to the periphery (17). As PD&#xD;
      progresses patients receive larger doses of carbidopa along with levodopa in order to manage&#xD;
      motor fluctuations. Chronic levodopa administration often results in dyskinesias in these&#xD;
      circumstances. Histochemical evidence from animal models of levodopa induced dyskinesia&#xD;
      suggests there is dysfunction of the blood brain barrier. Signs of angiogenesis and serum&#xD;
      albumin leakage were two findings supporting vascular alteration in this model (18). Chronic&#xD;
      administration of MPTP to primates increases VEGF-expressing neurons and increases the number&#xD;
      of blood vessels in the substantia nigra pars comptacta (19). Similarly, in the&#xD;
      6-hydroxydopamine model of PD, primates had patchy loss of blood brain barrier in the same&#xD;
      regions associated with angiogenesis (20). In a small autopsy study humans with PD had&#xD;
      vascularity present in the substantia nigra pars compacta compared with controls (21). Blood&#xD;
      brain barrier alteration could lead to increased penetration of carbidopa from the periphery&#xD;
      over time in two different scenarios. Firstly, carbidopa clearing mechanisms and transport&#xD;
      pumps may be overwhelmed if small amounts accumulate over time. Secondly, the degree of&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier alteration may be so great that even a single large dose of carbidopa may&#xD;
      enter the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbidopa penetrates the blood brain barrier to a limited extent after a single injection in&#xD;
      normal rats. Since the blood brain barrier could be altered in PD there might be significant&#xD;
      inhibition of central AAAD. Either the effect of long-term multiple daily doses of carbidopa&#xD;
      or a single large dose of carbidopa could lead to a significant decrease in the amount of&#xD;
      available dopamine, thereby worsening the clinical features of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Preliminary Studies / Experience of the Investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has extensive experience in randomized controlled clinical trials and proof of&#xD;
      principle studies in PD. This includes a large number of levodopa infusion protocols similar&#xD;
      to that proposed for the current study. We have recently completed studies examining the dose&#xD;
      effect of apomorphine on motor fluctuations (Gunzler in press), clinical testing of&#xD;
      concomitantly dosed levodopa and methylphenidate (22), and evolution of response to levodopa&#xD;
      over the course of PD (23). We have conducted pilot studies involving both outpatient and&#xD;
      Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC formerly GCRC) admissions for both levodopa and&#xD;
      carbidopa (16, 24). Furthermore we have been involved in research on the basic pharmacology&#xD;
      and clinical effects of levodopa (25-35).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. 1. Overall Study Design This study will be a randomized, double-blind, \controlled,&#xD;
      crossover trial of four week outpatient treatment periods with levodopa and either carbidopa&#xD;
      450mg daily or carbidopa 75mg daily plus placebo (figure 1). Levodopa will be dosed&#xD;
      separately in individual capsules at doses and intervals that maximize motor function.&#xD;
      Subjects will be selected based on inclusionary and exclusionary criteria and randomized to&#xD;
      start in either high dose carbidopa group or low dose carbidopa group. After randomization&#xD;
      subjects will be given four weeks of outpatient treatment with levodopa and either high dose&#xD;
      carbidopa or low dose carbidopa plus placebo. After this four week treatment phase subjects&#xD;
      will be brought into the Clinical Translational Research Center at OHSU (CTRC) for a total of&#xD;
      three days. Included in this will be two days measuring objective motor function with&#xD;
      levodopa infusion along with a different dose of carbidopa on each of the two days. The&#xD;
      evening of admission to the CTRC subjects will turn in ratings of outpatient clinical state&#xD;
      collected in a structured diary. After this visit they will crossover and alternately receive&#xD;
      either high dose carbidopa or low dose of carbidopa for another four weeks. They will again&#xD;
      be brought into the CTRC for a second two day measurement of motor function with levodopa&#xD;
      infusion and a different dosing schedule of carbidopa on each of the two days. They will&#xD;
      again turn in ratings of outpatient clinical state collected in a structured diary. Both&#xD;
      subjects and investigators will remain blinded to the dose of carbidopa for both outpatient&#xD;
      phases and one of the two days of each inpatient phase of the study.&#xD;
