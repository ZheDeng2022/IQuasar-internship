  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of BKM120 that&#xD;
      can be given to patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia. The safety of BKM120 will also&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BKM120 is designed to block a protein that is important to the growth and division of cancer&#xD;
      cells, which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of BKM120 based on when you join this study. Up to 2 dose levels of BKM120 will be&#xD;
      tested. Up to six (6) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lower dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take BKM120 tablets by mouth with a large glass of water every day you are on this&#xD;
      study. You should take BKM120 about 1 hour after a light breakfast. You should take BKM120 at&#xD;
      about the same time each day. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for 2&#xD;
      hours after you take your BKM120 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should swallow the BKM120 tablets whole. The tablets must not be chewed, broken, or&#xD;
      crushed. If you vomit after taking BKM120, you should not take another tablet that day to&#xD;
      make up for that dose. If you forget to take BKM120 one morning, call your doctor and ask for&#xD;
      instructions. Do not take BKM120 after 6pm of the same day or take any extra doses to make up&#xD;
      for the missed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your study doctor feels it is needed or if you have side effects, BKM120 may be stopped&#xD;
      and then started again at a lower dose or may be stopped completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to record in a pill diary each dose you take. You will return the pill&#xD;
      diary, unused study drug, and pill containers to the clinic staff at the end of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this study, each study cycle will last 28 days. You will have study visits every other&#xD;
      week (Days 1 and 15) during the first 2 cycles of the study, and then once a month after&#xD;
      that. The following tests and procedures will be performed at all study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and about any side effects you may&#xD;
           be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood&#xD;
           sugar. ° You will need to fast for 8 hours before this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaires about your mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycle 1 and every 3 months after that, you will have a bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
      and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease. You may have additional bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirations collected while you are on study if the doctor thinks they are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 months, you will have a MUGA scan or an ECHO to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECGs and chest x-rays may be performed throughout the study to check your heart and lung&#xD;
      function if the doctor thinks they are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as 12 cycles if the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop taking BKM120, you will have an end-of-study visit. The following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be currently taking or have taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaires about your mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. The blood will&#xD;
           also be used to check your kidney and liver function and to check your blood sugar. You&#xD;
           will need to fast for 8 hours before this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a MUGA scan or an ECHO to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. BKM120 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 16 patients take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             such an inhibitor is in the best interest of the patient, extreme caution should be&#xD;
             taken with its concomitant use. Please refer to Table 4-6 for a list of prohibited&#xD;

             may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered&#xD;
             effective for this study. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             or urine pregnancy test ≤ 48 hours prior to initiating treatment.&#xD;
