  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center double-blind placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of canakinumab (trade name Ilaris®), a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that&#xD;
      neutralizes IL-1β, in patients with Schnitzler syndrome. Efficacy is assessed by physician's&#xD;
      global assessment (a combined clinical symptom score) and inflammation markers. Following a&#xD;
      baseline period of 1-4 weeks, patients will be randomized to receive single s.c. injections&#xD;
      of either 150 mg canakinumab or placebo (day 0). Treatment response will be assessed on day&#xD;
      7. Patients will then be eligible to enter the 16-week open-label phase and receive&#xD;
      canakinumab injections (150-300mg, dose depends on clinical response on day 7) upon relapse&#xD;
      of symptoms. Visits for investigator's assessments will be scheduled at 4-weekly intervals&#xD;
      following day 7. Overall a max. of 20 subjects with Schnitzler syndrome will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Amendment: After successful completion of the 16-week open-label phase patients will be&#xD;
           eligible to enter a one-year open-label extension of the study. During this part of the&#xD;
           study patients will be scheduled at bi-monthly intervals. Canakinumab dosing will be&#xD;
           performed upon relapse of symptoms comparable to the 16-week open-label phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Amendment: After successful completion of the 1-year open-label study extension patients&#xD;
           will be eligible to enter another 3-year open-label extension. Patients will be&#xD;
           scheduled at 3-month-intervals and Canakinumab dosing will be performed on an individual&#xD;
           basis with optimized dosing intervals to ensure a constant low disease activity.&#xD;
