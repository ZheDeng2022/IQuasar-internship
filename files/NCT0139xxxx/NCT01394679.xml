  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the images of the primary lesions of lung cancer&#xD;
      and any metastatic lesions seen from the investigational SPECT/CT 99mTC-EC-DG scans are the&#xD;
      same as the PET/CT 18F-FDG scans.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      1. To demonstrate that SPECT/CT (99mTc EC DG) is not inferior to PET/CT (18F FDG PET/CT)&#xD;
           for sensitivity or specificity measures when image interpretation of primary and&#xD;
           metastatic lesions are compared against a truth standard in patients with a high&#xD;
           likelihood of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To expand the patient safety experience using 99mTc EC DG.&#xD;

             cancer OR have clinical evidence and CT scan results consistent with a diagnosis of&#xD;
             lung cancer. Cytology results confirming lung cancer from a bronchoscope procedure&#xD;
             will also be acceptable. A copy of the actual report (biopsy/cytology or CT scan) must&#xD;
             be requested by the patient through a medical release form if not already done. The&#xD;
             copy must be available to the study doctor within 15 days of the PET imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient will not be receiving treatment for lung cancer (surgery, radiation,&#xD;
             and/or chemotherapy), or, if the patient has had lung cancer in the past, all previous&#xD;
             therapy was completed at least 3 months prior to being enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If a tissue diagnosis of the primary lesion was not done prior to enrollment, the&#xD;
             patient must agree to have a tissue diagnosis of the primary lesion within 15 days of&#xD;
             the PET/CT study but prior to initiation of therapy, independent of the PET/CT&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient must be referred for a PET/CT scan on the basis of clinical and&#xD;
             radiological (CT) evidence for a diagnosis of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient will have an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance rating&#xD;

          8. The patients will be males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal, naturally or surgically sterile, or who agree to use effective&#xD;
             contraceptive methods throughout the course of the study. Postmenopausal is defined as&#xD;
             at least 12 months natural spontaneous amenorrhea, or at least 6 weeks following&#xD;
             surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Double-barrier method (condom and diaphragm) with spermicide for at least 14 days&#xD;
                  prior to screening and through study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Stable hormonal contraceptive (oral, topical, vaginal or implanted/injected) for&#xD;

         12. The patient must be able to tolerate SPECT/CT and PET/CT imaging. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. lying in the same position without moving for approximately 45 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. able to tolerate a confined area (ie, not claustrophobic)&#xD;

         13. The patient must be able to fast and/or follow diet restrictions prior to SPECT/CT and&#xD;
             PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must fast for at least 6 hours prior to the injection for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The patient must be able to eat a high protein/low carbohydrate meal as the last meal&#xD;
             before SPECT/CT and PET/CT imaging. However, if the site has its own standard of care&#xD;
             requirements for fasting and/or diet restrictions for PET as an alternative to this&#xD;
             recommendation, the same fasting and/or diet restrictions used for PET imaging should&#xD;
             be applied for the SPECT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. The patient must be able to make the scheduled appointments within the designated time&#xD;
             windows (PET/CT imaging within 7 days of qualifying for the study, the second imaging&#xD;
             session with SPECT/CT imaging 1-15 days after the initial imaging visit, with at least&#xD;
             24 hours between PET/CT and SPECT/CT imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. The patient must have safety laboratory values that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, do not place the patient at undue risk if the patient were to&#xD;
             participate in the study. This includes (but is not limited to):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. alanine aminotransferase &lt; or = 2.5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. aspartate aminotransferase &lt; or = 2.5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. creatinine &lt; or = 2.5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. bilirubin &lt; or = 2.0 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The patient must be able to understand and provide signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum β-hCG pregnancy&#xD;
             test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinically significant safety concerns (laboratory, EKG, physical examination,&#xD;
             other) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the patient at undue risk&#xD;
             if the patient were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is undergoing any current treatment for cancer (radiation therapy,&#xD;
             surgery, or chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is diabetic with insulin dependence. (Patients who have known insulin&#xD;
             dependence for diabetes can be included in the study if the standard of care protocol&#xD;
             in place at the clinical site provides for the management of the patient's glucose&#xD;
             level sufficiently to allow the PET/CT imaging to be performed. The same glucose&#xD;
             management used for the PET/CT imaging should be applied to the SPECT/CT imaging&#xD;
             procedures. A waiver will be required to be completed by the clinical site and&#xD;
             approved by the sponsor or designee.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient's weight is above the SPECT/CT and PET/CT table weight limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to EC DG or FDG or similar compounds&#xD;
             including any of the inactive ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has a known or suspected pregnancy, lactation or planned pregnancy&#xD;
             (females and male partners).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has clinically significant mental illness (to be determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit or is participating in an ongoing clinical study. (This criterion can&#xD;
             be overruled by the Principal Investigator with appropriate documentation of the&#xD;
             reason for the exception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the ability&#xD;
             to provide informed consent or comply with study instructions, or that might confound&#xD;
             the interpretation of the study results or put the patient at undue risk.&#xD;
