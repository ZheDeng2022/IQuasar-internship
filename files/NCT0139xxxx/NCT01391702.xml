  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a woman requires a cesarean section after labour, anesthesia is usually provided by a&#xD;
      pre-existing epidural. Occasionally, the epidural does not work. The anesthesiologist then&#xD;
      may give a &quot;spinal anesthetic&quot;. The spinal space is identified by seeing cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) in the spinal needle. Rarely a spinal fails after a failed epidural as the fluid seen&#xD;
      is epidural space fluid, not CSF. This study plans to use a bedside glucose monitor to&#xD;
      measure glucose (sugar) in epidural fluid (compared to CSF) allowing the anesthesiologist to&#xD;
      know the spinal needle is in the correct space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a bedside glucose measurement device can accurately&#xD;
      quantitate the level of glucose within epidural space aspirate, and therefore could aid&#xD;
      differentiation between CSF and epidural fluid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It would be clinically useful to have a bedside test to confirm that the fluid obtained&#xD;
      during insertion of a spinal needle following a failed epidural is, in fact, CSF prior to the&#xD;
      injection of local anesthetic. This test also may decrease the probability of a failed spinal&#xD;
      following a failed epidural top up, and therefore avoid the risks of general anesthesia in&#xD;
      the parturient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a cesarean delivery is required following a trial of labour, an epidural catheter in&#xD;
      situ can be used to provide surgical anesthesia. A large volume (10-20 milliliters) of local&#xD;
      anesthetic is administered through the epidural catheter. This is aimed to produce a dense&#xD;
      nerve block up to T4 (nipple level), which is sufficient for lower abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occasionally, however, this technique does not provide adequate anesthesia for a surgical&#xD;
      intervention - termed a 'failed epidural top-up' - and this is estimated to occur up to 38%&#xD;
      of the time. Options following the failure of an epidural top-up are dependent on the urgency&#xD;
      of delivery, and include either a general anesthetic or an intrathecal injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetic (a 'spinal'). The preferred choice for both mother and baby, if time allows, is&#xD;
      normally considered to be a spinal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A spinal is performed by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space which is surrounded&#xD;
      by the epidural space. The subarachnoid space contains CSF, the spinal cord and exiting&#xD;
      nerves from the spinal cord. The anesthesiologist identifies the subarachnoid space by&#xD;
      obtaining CSF through the needle. Local anesthetic can then be injected directly into the&#xD;
      space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rarely, spinal anesthesia may fail when administered following a failed epidural, and there&#xD;
      are several theories as to why this may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible reason for spinal failure is that the large volume of local anesthetic, which is&#xD;
      injected down the epidural catheter for cesarean delivery anesthesia, can cause the&#xD;
      subarachnoid space to collapse, making it difficult to access with a needle and obtain CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another theory for failed spinal anesthesia involves misidentification of the clear fluid&#xD;
      that returns through the spinal needle. It is postulated that in these circumstances the&#xD;
      fluid seen is not CSF. It may be tissue fluid from the epidural space (transudate), local&#xD;
      anesthetic that was injected into the epidural space or a combination of the two. In these&#xD;
      cases, the needle is not in the subarachnoid space and, therefore, spinal anesthesia will&#xD;
      fail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical variations, such as a congenital arachnoid cyst, may also contribute to failed&#xD;
      spinals following failed epidural top ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various bedside tests have been described to confirm whether the fluid exiting the needle is&#xD;
      CSF, including analyzing the fluid's temperature, density, pH, glucose content and whether it&#xD;
      precipitated with thiopental (an alkaline solution). Whilst no single test has been&#xD;
      completely effective, measurement of glucose seems to be the best indicator. Glucose is&#xD;
      thought to be a good discriminator of the fluid obtained through a spinal because of the&#xD;
      different proportions of glucose in the clear fluids which could return through the spinal&#xD;
      needle. The level of glucose in the CSF is usually approximately 2/3 of plasma glucose&#xD;
      (approximately 2-4mmol/L). There should be minimal glucose in the fluid drawn from the&#xD;
      epidural space. However, a previous study has shown that a small amount of glucose may be&#xD;
      present in the epidural space from 30 minutes after epidural catheter insertion. Potential&#xD;
      sources of glucose in the epidural space may be blood, CSF or transudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, the presence of glucose was done using a simple reagent strip, which is rapid (2&#xD;
      minutes) and accurate (when compared to laboratory values and testing), however, it solely&#xD;
      detects either the presence or absence of glucose. As there may be a small amount of glucose&#xD;
      present in the epidural space, the use of reagent strips may not distinguish between epidural&#xD;
      fluid and CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A glucose meter gives an absolute value for glucose, which may be more useful. Even though&#xD;
      the epidural fluid may contain glucose, the absolute value would be significantly lower than&#xD;
      that seen for CSF glucose. The range for normal CSF glucose in the parturient was confirmed&#xD;
      using the bedside glucose meters in the Sweet CSF Study as 2-4 mmol/L. In this previous study&#xD;
      we compared the efficacy, accuracy and ease of use of three glucose meters that were used to&#xD;
      measure CSF glucose.1 The CSF glucose levels were compared to the results from the laboratory&#xD;
      measurement of glucose. This study took place January - November, 2010 at BC Women's Hospital&#xD;
      in Vancouver, British Columbia. The study established the feasibility of measuring CSF&#xD;
      glucose measured with the three glucose meters, and for two meters, verified commonly&#xD;
      accepted normal ranges in parturients having elective cesarean delivery under spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now that we have obtained these values, we aim to see if the glucose levels of epidural space&#xD;
      fluid (via an epidural catheter) differ from those of CSF using one of the previously tested&#xD;
      bedside monitors. We also aim to distinguish the level of glucose in the fluid that returns&#xD;
      through the needle if a spinal is done following a failed epidural.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labouring women admitted to BC Women's will be assessed for eligibility for the study. Women&#xD;
      who receive an epidural for labour analgesia will be approached by an investigator who will&#xD;
      explain the project and answer questions about the study. Written information regarding the&#xD;
      aims and practicalities of the study will be given to women. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained following the decision to proceed to cesarean delivery. Women will only be&#xD;
      approached for consent to participate if there is time before their surgery. The study will&#xD;
      not delay the surgery or interfere with routine standards of care.&#xD;
