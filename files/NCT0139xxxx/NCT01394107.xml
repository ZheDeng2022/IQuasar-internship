      The project aims to clarify the effect of the thromboprophylactic LMWH dose on coagulation in&#xD;
      pregnant women just before birth, at the period of maximal physiological hypercoagulable&#xD;
      state and with high risk of thromboembolism, the most common cause of maternal mortality in&#xD;
      developed countries. Although LMWH are now routinely administered as prevention of&#xD;
      thromboembolism, their effect on coagulation in pregnant women was not yet studied. The doses&#xD;
      of LMWH in pregnancy are only derived in terms of coagulation from totally different groups&#xD;
      of patients (surgical, orthopedic). We therefore will map the effect of thromboprophylactic&#xD;
      LMWH dose on coagulation in pregnant women using recently available methods, especially a&#xD;
      complex examination of coagulation within 24 h after LMWH application using&#xD;
      thrombelastography, including examination with heparinase, and monitoring the effect of LMWH&#xD;
      by measuring antiXa and TGT (thrombin generation time) activity. Based on these results we&#xD;
      will also evaluate the possible influence of LMWH prophylaxis on the risk of spinal haematoma&#xD;
      during neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery/Caesarean section. On the basis of our&#xD;
      pilot results we can presume the current dosage of LMWH in pregnant women is inadequate and&#xD;
      that it would be appropriate to adjust presently used dosage. At the same time we want to&#xD;
      prove that the standard LMWH thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women does not increase the risk&#xD;
      of spinal haematoma during neuraxial blockade. In both situations the targeted outcome is to&#xD;
      increase the safety of pregnant women.&#xD;

      AIMS OF THE PROJECT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to map the effect of the thromboprophylactic dose of LMWH on&#xD;
      coagulation of women at the end of pregnancy, using recently available methods and laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and simultaneously to evaluate the possible influence of LMWH on incidence of spinal&#xD;
      hematoma. The methodology is based primarily on a complex examination of coagulation by&#xD;
      thrombelastography (TEG), including comparative tests with heparinase, and on the monitoring&#xD;
      effect of LMWH by measuring thrombin generation time (TGT) and levels of AntiXa. At the same&#xD;
      time and, in cooperation with the Thrombotic Centre, standard and special laboratory&#xD;
      hematology tests will be performed (INR, APTT, TT, fibrinogen, AT III, D-dimer, protein S,&#xD;
      protein C, APC resistance, PFA, F VII, F VIII, PFA 100, TAT micro, vWf, APA, t-PA, PAI-1,&#xD;
      blood count) together with genetic tests for FV Leiden and prothrombin II mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume that with hypercoagulation and other influencing factors in pregnancy, the effect&#xD;
      of LMWH on coagulation, compared to the population of non-pregnant women, will be&#xD;
      significantly lower. Thus significantly lower will be also the effect of TED prophylaxis. For&#xD;
      the same reason we assume that the current thromboprophylactic dosage of LMWH could not&#xD;
      affect coagulation of pregnant women enough to increase the risk of spinal hematoma with&#xD;
      neuraxial analgesia/anaesthesia administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aims: To map the coagulation effect of standard prophylactic dose of LMWH in pregnant&#xD;
      women at the end of pregnancy. Based on these results, to evaluate the possible prophylactic&#xD;
      effect of LMWH on TED prevention in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women and to evaluate&#xD;
      the possible influence of LMWH on the potential risk of spinal hematoma development during&#xD;
      neuraxial blockade in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims: To propose a change of the thromboprophylactic regimen in pregnancy. To&#xD;
      suggest a change of the recommended time interval between LMWH application and administration&#xD;
      of neuraxial blockade in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND RESEARCH SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective, monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size and type of study group: a total of 50 pregnant women with physiological ongoing&#xD;
      pregnancy and undergoing planned caesarean section, without known coagulation disorders, will&#xD;
      be included in to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: pregnant women undergoing planned caesarean section, 39th-40th week of&#xD;
      pregnancy, age 18-40 years, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: disapproval or non-cooperation of the mother, allergy to LMWH,&#xD;
      coagulation disorders or the risk of, anticoagulant therapy in the last 3 months, signs of&#xD;
      infection, history of cancer, signs of thrombosis or a history of thrombosis, the ongoing&#xD;
      non-physiological pregnancy, significant obesity, or other severe comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria: development of obstetric complications in the mother or foetus during&#xD;
      the study following, finding of prothrombotic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: 50 healthy women in fertility age (18-40 years) undergoing elective surgery&#xD;
      for other than oncology or inflammatory indication, without known risk factors for&#xD;
      coagulation disorders, not using hormonal contraception, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LMWH applications: a standard thromboprophylactic dose of LMWH (4000 IU of enoxaparin&#xD;
      subcutaneously) will be given to pregnant woman/patient in control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of coagulation: To evaluate coagulation changes after administration of LMWH dose&#xD;
      we will perform thrombelastographic examination (TEG; Haemascope Corp., USA.) of venous blood&#xD;
      (including examination with heparinase) and specific laboratory tests to measure the effect&#xD;
      of LMWH activity - antiXa and TGT (thrombin generation time). Coagulation system will be also&#xD;
      be examined by other available laboratory tests (INR, APTT, TT, fibrinogen, AT III, D-dimer,&#xD;
      protein S, protein C, APC resistance, PFA, F VII, F VIII, PFA 100, TAT micro, vWf, APA, t-PA,&#xD;
      PAI-1, blood count) including genetic testing for FV Leiden and prothrombin II mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of coagulation takes place in four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basal level - before LMWH application&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The maximum effect of LMWH - 4 hours after application&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low efficiency of LMWH - 8 hours after application&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Control level of LMWH effectiveness - 24 hours after application&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samplings for laboratory testing will be performed in the same way as a sample for TEG&#xD;
      examination - venous blood will be in planned times taken by one-time blood draw to prevent&#xD;
      premature coagulation activation and dilution of the sample. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      according to standard guidelines (for coagulation tests and TEG in a test tubes with sodium&#xD;
      citrate) - and subsequently processed in Central haematology laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For TEG examination 1 ml of whole blood will be activated by 1% celite and then 360 μl of&#xD;
      sample (340 μl blood + 20 μl CaCl2) will be analyzed in a standard cuvette and 360 μl of&#xD;
      sample (340 μl blood + 20 μl CaCl2) in the cuvette with heparinase. Following parameters will&#xD;
      be recorded: time r, time K, angle alpha, maximum amplitude MA and LY30 as a factor of&#xD;
      fibrinolysis. From the measured values coagulation index (CI) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, obstetric and clinical data - age, height, weight, BMI, gestational age,&#xD;
      previous pregnancy, associated medical conditions. Standard pre-operative assessment and&#xD;
      pharmacological history. Fluid intake and output during the surveillance. Any bleeding and /&#xD;
      or thromboembolic complications from beginning of the study to the end of hospitalization&#xD;
      after Cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PROCESSING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored at electronic database with safety back up. Statistical analysis will&#xD;
      be performed in cooperation with Biomedical Statistics Dept. of the Institute of Biophysics&#xD;
      and Informatics, Charles University in Prague, 1st Faculty of Medicine. Based on preliminary&#xD;
      analysis the overall number of subjects was determined as 50 in both study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA EVALUATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on study results the relationship between the potential risk of spinal hematoma and the&#xD;
      LMWH application will be evaluated by the Expert Committee for Obstetric Anaesthesia of the&#xD;
      Czech Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (ČCSARIM). The conclusions and&#xD;
      the resulting recommendations will be submitted to the Executive Committee of ČSARIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME SCHEDULE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the feasibility test and pilot study we consider as real inclusion 3 patients into&#xD;
      the study per month. This number is based on the number of anticipated elective caesarean&#xD;
      operations and the possibility of recruiting appropriate subjects satisfying all the&#xD;
      criteria, and also on organizational difficulties when samples at study hour 8 and 24 will be&#xD;
      taken at the place of subject's residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st year - creating a study database, patient recruitment, inclusion of 15 pregnant women&#xD;
           + 15 controls; samples processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd year - recruiting patients, inclusion of 25 pregnant women + 15 controls, processing&#xD;
           and analysis of samples, evaluation and presentation of preliminary study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd year - recruiting patients, inclusion 10 pregnant women + 20 controls, processing and&#xD;
           analysis of samples. The evaluation of all study data, statistical evaluation,&#xD;
           presentation and publication the final results.&#xD;

&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND PROJECT IMPORTANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected project outcome is the detailed evaluation of the influence of LMWH on&#xD;
      coagulation in pregnant women and suggested modification of dosing schemes for&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis before Caesarean operation, which would better reflect physiological&#xD;
      hypercoagulation in pregnancy. Due to improved TED prophylaxis the main long-term outcome&#xD;
      then should be the reduction of maternal mortality in connection to thromboembolic diseases.&#xD;
      At the same time we want to prove that the current dosage of LMWH in pregnant women cannot&#xD;
      increase the risk of epidural hematoma during neuraxial blockades and we would recommend&#xD;
      changes of time relationships between administration of LMWH and neuraxial blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COOPERATION ON THE PROJECT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be performed in cooperation between the Dept. of Anaesthesiology and&#xD;
      Intensive Care, Thrombotic Centre of Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory&#xD;
      Diagnostics and Dept. of Gynaecology and Obstetrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between the risk of spinal hematoma and the LMWH applications will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the Expert Committee for Obstetric Anaesthesia and Executive Committee of the&#xD;
      Czech Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, no studies have been published dealing with the influence of thromboprophylactic LMWH&#xD;
      dose on coagulation in pregnant women. The only study, showing a reduced effect of LMWH&#xD;
      during pregnancy, was only evaluating its effect on antiXa activity. Our project differs in&#xD;
      complexity and range of other available methods used such as thrombin generation time and&#xD;
      especially thrombelastography. Thus our project also builds on the results of previous grant&#xD;
      project IGA No. NR8157 &quot;The use of thrombelastography in evaluating coagulation in women with&#xD;
      physiologically and pathologically ongoing pregnancy, during birth and beyond&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED PROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT The project aims to clarify the&#xD;
      effect of LMWH on coagulation in pregnant women just before birth, at a period of maximal&#xD;
      physiological hypercoagulable state and with high risk of thromboembolism, the most common&#xD;
      cause of maternal mortality in developed countries. Although LMWH are now routinely&#xD;
      administered as prevention of thromboembolism in all women undergoing Caesarean operation,&#xD;
      their effect on coagulation in pregnant women was not yet studied. Research of&#xD;
      haemocoagulation in pregnant women worldwide is rather difficult, so the results of such a&#xD;
      project are highly awaited and are then a great opportunity to present Czech research on&#xD;
      European and World forums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main expected benefit of this project will be the evaluation of the adequacy of current&#xD;
      LMWH thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women (which is recently only derived from surgical&#xD;
      patients). The next important study outcome will be the evaluation of possible influence of&#xD;
      the LMWH thromboprophylaxis on risk of spinal hematoma in connection to neuraxial&#xD;
      anaesthesiology techniques in pregnant women. In both situations the targeted outcome is to&#xD;
      change present recommendations to increase the safety of pregnant women undergoing Caesarean&#xD;
      operation. Just in Czechia this issue affects about 30 000 women/year.&#xD;
