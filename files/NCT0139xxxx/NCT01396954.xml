      Glucose metabolism disorders (GMD) can be present in an overt and a subclinical way. They&#xD;
      have negative impact in survival of patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). Their prevalence has&#xD;
      not been determined in compensated cirrhotic patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overt Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is observed in 21 to 40% of patients with liver cirrhosis (LC).&#xD;
      There are two ways in which DM is related to LC: firstly, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),&#xD;
      which has a genetic component and is often associated with metabolic syndrome (obesity,&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension), causes chronic liver disease (steatosis,&#xD;
      steatohepatitis, and LC Secondly, LC may cause impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and DM.&#xD;
      During the initial stages of LC these metabolic disorders are subclinical as can only be&#xD;
      detected by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). As liver disease progresses, DM becomes&#xD;
      clinically evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus secondary to LC is known as &quot;hepatogenous diabetes&quot; (HD). Although it has&#xD;
      been accepted that the LC is a diabetogenic condition, HD is not recognized by the American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association and the WHO. Cirrhosis caused by alcohol, HCV, and hemochromatosis are&#xD;
      more frequently associated to HD than other etiologies . It has been observed that HCV core&#xD;
      protein induces insulin resistance (IR), steatosis, and DM regardless of body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI). Patients with chronic alcoholism often have chronic pancreatic damage resulting in DM&#xD;
      . In short, T2DM and HD have different etiology, but they seem to have similar&#xD;
      pathophysiologic mechanisms for liver function deterioration. They increase the risk of&#xD;
      complications and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the incidence of obesity has increased alarmingly in the world, particularly&#xD;
      in the Western countries . In Mexico, overweight and obesity, which are suffered by about 70%&#xD;
      of the adult population are a serious public health problem,. This figure puts this country&#xD;
      in second place in the world, behind only the United States of America. The incidence of T2DM&#xD;
      and metabolic syndrome has increased rapidly in our country . They have became the most&#xD;
      common causes of cryptogenic cirrhosis in Mexico. Many published studies, which have reviewed&#xD;
      the prevalence of DM in cirrhotic patients, do not make a distinction between T2DM and HD;&#xD;
      additionally, subclinical glucose metabolism disorders (GMD) are not routinely identified, so&#xD;
      the magnitude of the problem has been underestimated. On the other hand, the clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical features of cirrhotic patients with different GMD are not known at present. The&#xD;
      clinical distinction of GMD may be useful for prognosis and therapeutic purposes. Based on&#xD;
      the aforementioned, the objectives of the present study were: a) To establish the prevalence&#xD;
      of clinical and subclinical forms of GMD (T2DM, HD, IGT) in a cohort of patients with&#xD;
      compensated LC of diverse etiology; and b) To determine the clinical and biochemical&#xD;
      characteristics of patient with these different GMD and to find whether there are significant&#xD;
      differences among them..&#xD;
