      The aims of the study are: 1)to assess pre and post-operative Quality of Life (QOL) as&#xD;
      measured by the Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test(SNOT)-20 questionnaire and 2)determine the&#xD;
      significance of response shift on treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study. The investigators will recruit patients who are within a&#xD;
      6 month post-functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) timeframe and completed a&#xD;
      pre-operative SNOT-20. The investigators will ask subjects to complete two more SNOT-20 forms&#xD;
      and a Transition Quality of Life (QOL) scale. The SNOT-20 forms will be labelled &quot;pre&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;post&quot; operative. The &quot;pre&quot; should be completed based on subject's memory of their condition&#xD;
      prior to surgery and &quot;post&quot; based on how they feel now.&#xD;

      Introduction The most common goal of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is to improve&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL). Changes in QOL or treatment effect can be measured using validated&#xD;
      instruments completed by patients. One's perception of QOL is often a dynamic experience and&#xD;
      has been shown to be affected by current medical and emotional state. This phenomenon is&#xD;
      known as response shift in QOL research and can be measured by using the Then-test. This test&#xD;
      asks patients to complete the same pre-operative survey of their symptoms during the&#xD;
      post-operative period. This test aims to characterize any changes in one's perception of the&#xD;
      pre-operative condition. The aim of this study is to assess the significance of response&#xD;
      shift on sinus surgery outcomes measured using the sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-20), a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire used to assess the severity of symptoms related to chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This was a prospective cohort study approved by the University of Washington IRB. We&#xD;
      approached all patients who underwent FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis from 2010-2012 who&#xD;
      completed a pre-operative SNOT-20. We aimed to recruit 30 patients. Patients were mailed 2&#xD;
      SNOT-20 forms and a transition QOL scale at least 6 months after surgery. Patients were&#xD;
      instructed to complete 1 SNOT-20 according to their pre-operative symptoms (then-test) and&#xD;
      the other according to their post-operative symptoms. The difference between the pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative SNOT-20 was calculated which represents the treatment effect, while the&#xD;
      difference between the pre-operative SNOT-20 and then-test represents the response shift. A&#xD;
      student t-test was used to compare these differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results A total of 32 complete responses were obtained. Using a 0 to 5 SNOT-20 scale, the&#xD;
      average treatment effect was -0.96 (p=0.00) and the average response shift was +0.42&#xD;
      (p=0.01). The negative treatment effect signifies an improvement in QOL. The positive&#xD;
      response shift signifies that on average, patients thought they were even more symptomatic&#xD;
      prior to surgery. The actual treatment effect is the sum of treatment effect and response&#xD;
      shift which was -1.38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Response shift exists and can be quantified in FESS outcomes. The actual treatment&#xD;
      effect was more profound when taking into account response shift, therefore future studies&#xD;
      should account for this often unmeasured, potential change in QOL.&#xD;
