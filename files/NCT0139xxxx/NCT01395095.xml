      The objective is to investigate whether in acute coronary syndrome patients the cardiac risk&#xD;
      profile will improve with 2 new extended cardiac rehabilitation interventions and if these&#xD;
      patients maintain healthier life style habits and a more active life style compared to&#xD;
      patients randomized to standard cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Throughout the western world, healthy life style management is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly important. Therefore, secondary prevention with an emphasis on lifestyle&#xD;
      adjustments should be the cornerstone of modern cardiac rehabilitation (CR). This study may&#xD;
      demonstrate the benefits of extended CR with respect to achieving optimal long term secondary&#xD;
      prevention goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective is to investigate whether in acute coronary syndrome patients the&#xD;
      cardiac risk profile will improve with 2 new extended cardiac rehabilitation interventions&#xD;
      (OPTICARE and COACH) and if these patients maintain healthier life style habits and a more&#xD;
      active life style compared to patients randomized to standard CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The proposed trial is a singlecenter, multi-disciplinary randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with a 18-month follow-up. In total 900 patients will be randomized into 3 arms:(1)&#xD;
      Standard CR according to the Dutch guidelines; (2) OPTICARE intervention: standard CR and&#xD;
      participation in multifactorial lifestyle sessions during rehabilitation and additional&#xD;
      sessions at 4, 6 and 12 months and a personalized program to promote an active lifestyle; (3)&#xD;
      COACH intervention: standard CR according to the Dutch guidelines followed by 5 telephone&#xD;
      delivered coaching sessions starting at 6 weeks intervals (up to 6 months). The enrollment&#xD;
      period will be 24 months, the intervention period is 12 months and the duration of the&#xD;
      follow-up will be another 6 months. Assessments will take place at 4 time points: at&#xD;
      baseline, 12 weeks after inclusion (end standard CR), at 12 and at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients referred for standard CR will be included to participate in this&#xD;
      trial. ACS patients treated with primary or elective PCI or CABG, with a stable medical&#xD;
      condition and providing written informed consent are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: OPTICARE intervention: Standard CR and obligation to participate in&#xD;
      multifactorial lifestyle and risk factor sessions (medical information, dietary advises, risk&#xD;
      factors and emotional advises). Individual sessions and a personalized home-based program to&#xD;
      promote an active life style upon instruction of a physiotherapist and physical activity&#xD;
      counsellor during and after completion of rehabilitation. If applicable, patients will&#xD;
      participate in smoking cessation, dietary and stress management programs. Additional&#xD;
      supervised multifactorial lifestyle and risk management training sessions of each 2 hours are&#xD;
      provided at 4, 6 and 12 months. COACH intervention: standard CR according to the Dutch&#xD;
      guidelines followed by 5 telephone based coaching sessions starting at 6 weeks intervals up&#xD;
      to 6 months. The coaching sessions include assertiveness training, goal setting and&#xD;
      reassessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main objective is to investigate whether in patients&#xD;
      randomized to extended CR (OPTICARE or COACH) cardiac risk profile will be improved, if these&#xD;
      patients maintain healthier life style habits and do achieve an increase in daily activity&#xD;
      level compared to patients randomized to standard CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) of the OPTICARE study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction The proposed trial is a single center, multi-disciplinary open-label randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. Between October 2011 and August 2014 922 patients were randomized into 3&#xD;
      arms:(1) Standard CR according to the Dutch guidelines (Opticare-Basic) (n=308); (2) OPTICARE&#xD;
      intervention: standard CR with the addition of a personalized program to promote an active&#xD;
      lifestyle. Besides, additional sessions were offered at 4, 6 and 12 months to improve&#xD;
      long-term adherence to lifestyle changes. (Opticare-Capri) (n=310); (3) Heart COACH&#xD;
      intervention: standard CR according to the Dutch guidelines followed by 5-6 telephone&#xD;
      delivered coaching sessions starting one after finishing standard CR at 6 weeks intervals up&#xD;
      to 12 months (Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach) (n=304). The intervention period is 12 months and&#xD;
      the duration of the follow-up will be another 6 months. Assessments will take place at 4 time&#xD;
      points: at baseline, 12 weeks after inclusion (end standard CR), at 12 and at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current status The study will be finished in January 2016. During September 2015 and January&#xD;
      2016 the data are checked and cleaned. In February 2016 the database will be closed and the&#xD;
      statistical analyses can start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan for Cardiology Primary end point and sample size Primary end point&#xD;
      is the SCORE risk function measured at 18 months post randomization (Conroy RM et al, Eur HJ&#xD;
      2003; 24:987-1003). This score estimates 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease. The&#xD;
      SCORE risk function includes age, gender, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and&#xD;
      smoking behaviour. The RESPONSE trial (Jorstadt HT, Heart 2013; 99:1421-1430) studied the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a nurse-coordinated outpatient risk management program in cardiac patients.&#xD;
      That strategy was associated with a 17 % reduction in SCORE Risk function as compared with&#xD;
      standard care. Based on these data, and taking into account the more intensive interventions&#xD;
      that we will perform, we expect in both the OPTICARE-CAPRI and in the OPTICARECOACH arm at&#xD;
      least a 20 % reduction in the SCORE Risk Score at 1.5 years: from 5.40 to 4.32 points with an&#xD;
      estimated standard deviation (SD) of 4.5. With 274 patients in each treatment arm, the study&#xD;
      has 80 % power (beta-error=0.02) to detect this difference with an alpha-error of 0.05&#xD;
      (2-sided test). We will enroll a total 300 patients in each treatment arm, taking into&#xD;
      account a 10 % drop-out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.B. In all analyses Opticare-Capri will be compared with Opticare-Basic and Opticare-Heart&#xD;
      Coach with Opticare-Basic. The sample size computation was such that Opticare-Capri will not&#xD;
      be compared with Opticare-Heart Coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis: intention-to-treat In total, three analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      investigate the consistency of the different analyses and to investigate whether differences&#xD;
      between the methods can be explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although according to the protocol, no comparisons will be made on cardiac events, these&#xD;
      events (mortality, myocardial infarctions, coronary revascularizations and rehospitalizations&#xD;
      for cardiac reasons) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be investigated: is the RISC score normally distributed? If necessary, a (ln-)&#xD;
      transfrmation will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis 1 (main analysis): SCORE risk function score at 18 months Opticare-Capri vs&#xD;
      Opticare-Basic (student's t-test) and the same for Opticare-Capri vs Opticare-Basic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyse 2:Mixed models will be used. These models takes into account missing data that is&#xD;
      missing at random (Twisk, 2004). This analysis will include all patients with at least one&#xD;
      measurement. All 4 time points will be included in these models (repeated measurements). At&#xD;
      this way we can optimally analyze changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyse 3: Delta score 18 months vs baseline. All patients with a score at baseline and at 18&#xD;
      months will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses: per protocol Patients have to attend at least 75% of the rehabilitation&#xD;
      sessions to be included in the per protocol analysis, this means 18 training sessions.&#xD;
      Besides, patients included in the Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach have to complete at least 3 out&#xD;
      of 5 telephonic coaching sessions. Patients in the OPTICARE-Capri arm were invited to 3&#xD;
      active lifestyle intervention sessions and 3 multifactorial lifestyle and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factor group intervention sessions. Only those Opticare patients who attended at least 4 of&#xD;
      the 6 possible group sessions, will be included in this per-protocol analysis. It will be&#xD;
      evaluated whether these results coincide with the intention-to-treat results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same analyses as described under the intention-to-treat analyses will be performed for&#xD;
      the per protocol analysis and results will be compared to results of the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intention-to-treat and in the per protocol analyses also the individual risks factors&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and smoking behaviour will be analyzed separately&#xD;
      as dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imputation No imputation will be performed on the end point parameters If necessary, multiple&#xD;
      imputation on missing data of the baseline characteristics will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan for Rehabilitation Medicine Primary end point Primary end point is&#xD;
      daily amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured by Actigraph&#xD;
      (Bluetooth ® Smart wGT3X-BT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Expected amount of minutes in (moderate-intensity) daily activity at 18 months&#xD;
      post randomization Opticare-Basic program: 16 minutes/day (SD 13) Based on amount of minutes&#xD;
      at start of rehabilitation(Ref. Oliveira and Stevenson et al) Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach: 25&#xD;
      minutes/day (SD 20) Based on amount of minutes at completion of standard CR (Ref. Stevenson&#xD;
      et al), it is expected that patients in Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach reach (?) this level of&#xD;
      activity Opticare-Capri: 32 minutes/day (SD 23) It is expected that patients in&#xD;
      Opticare-Capri reach the recommended level of physical activity. At 2 year follow-up,&#xD;
      Oliveira et al found that patients were active for a mean of 63.7 minutes at the end of a&#xD;
      counselling session, long term effects are unknown. SD is based on highest SD measured by&#xD;
      Oliveira.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 202 patients in each treatment arm, the study has a power of 80% (beta-error=0.02) to&#xD;
      detect this difference with an alpha-error of 0.05, taking into account the ANOVA Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction (2-sided test) Taking into account missing values, failure of measurement system&#xD;
      and drop outs (20%), a total of 245 patients in each treatment arm will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: per protocol Patients that dropped out of the study or CR program did not visit the&#xD;
      center anymore, making it impossible to install the Actigraph device. Therefore, by design a&#xD;
      mix of the intention-to-treat-analysis identical and a per-protocol analysis will be applied.&#xD;
      In the CONSORT diagram this design will be explained in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per-protocol analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be investigated: is MVPA normally distributed? If needed, a (ln-) transformation will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis 1: MVPA at 18 months Opticare-Capri vs Opticare COACH vs Opticare-Basic (ANOVA) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis 2: Mixed models. These models takes into account missing data that is missing at&#xD;
      random (Twisk, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis will include all patients with at least one measurements. All 4 time points&#xD;
      will be included in these models (repeated measurements). In this way we can optimally&#xD;
      analyze changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis 3: Delta minutes of MVPA 18 months vs baseline. All patients with a valid&#xD;
      measurement at baseline and at 18 months will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.B. In the analyses also the minutes of sedentary behavior and the distribution of MVPA and&#xD;
      sedentary behavior will be analyzed separately,&#xD;
