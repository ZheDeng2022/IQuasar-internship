  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best dose of radiation to be given with bevacizumab is currently unknown. This study will&#xD;
      use higher doses of radiation with bevacizumab than have been used before. This study will&#xD;
      test the safety of radiation given at different doses with bevacizumab to find out what&#xD;
      effects, good and/or bad, it has on the patient and the malignant glioma or related brain&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment: (until treatment failure): bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV once every two weeks on days 1 (+/- 3 days) and 15 (+/- 3 days) of every cycle (Cycle defined as 28 days). On day 28 (or up to 2 days before) of cycles 1 and 2 (and for every other cycle thereafter) patients will undergo a physical and radiological re-evaluation (MRI). Patients will begin stereotactic radiotherapy beginning anywhere from day 7 to day 10 of cycle 2 with escalating fraction sizes (interpatient - there is no intrapatient escalation). Assessment of response will be performed following cycles 1 and 2 then following every two cycles.</description>

             Glioblastoma, Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO),&#xD;
             Anaplastic oligo-astrocytoma (AOA) also called anaplastic mixed gliomas, Malignant&#xD;
             glioma NOS (not otherwise specified). Patients will be eligible if the original&#xD;
             histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a high grade&#xD;
             (malignant) glioma is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed low grade (WHO grade II) gliomas (such as low grade&#xD;
             astrocytoma, low grade oligodendroglioma, low grade oligo-astrocytoma (mixed gliomas),&#xD;

             transformation but histologic confirmation of high grade (malignant) transformation&#xD;
             would not be otherwise undertaken for routine clinical care. Inclusion of patients in&#xD;

             limit may be eligible and any question should be directed to a Radiation Oncology&#xD;
             Investigator and the MSK PI. (The MRI must be performed on a steroid dosage that has&#xD;
             been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. Patients on no steroids are eligible.&#xD;
