      In this observational study the effect of selenium supplementation on the postoperative&#xD;
      inflammatory response and clinical course should be examined in (approximately 100) adult&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective heart surgery combined with extracorporeal circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selenium is one of the essential trace elements with a variety of important immunological and&#xD;
      antioxidant properties. The pathophysiological relevance of different selenium-dependent&#xD;
      reactions has already been demonstrated in human and in animal experiments. It is essential&#xD;
      for the enzymatic functions of selenium-containing proteins such as the glutathione&#xD;
      peroxidase, which in turn affects the leukotriene, thromboxane and prostacyclin metabolism.&#xD;
      In addition, selenium has a significant influence on various liver enzymes, therefore&#xD;
      selenium deficiency leads to oxidative or chemically induced liver damage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart Surgery on the heart-lung machine involves, inter alia, by ischemia and reperfusion,&#xD;
      the release of reactive oxygen radicals and nitrogen oxide (NO), which damage DNA after&#xD;
      reaction with peroxynitrite, and Lipid-/Endothelmembrane Protein. The formation and&#xD;
      consumption of peroxynitrite can be reduced by intake of sodium selenite and the subsequent&#xD;
      formation of selenoprotein P. Since there is no storage for selenium, but the synthesis of&#xD;
      selenium-dependent enzymes is regulated by selenium resorption, the supplementation of&#xD;
      selenium is a potentially useful application in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anaesthesia and before connecting to the heart-lung machine the patients&#xD;
      get applied 2000μg sodium selenite (Selenase® T pro injection) intravenously (as a bolus&#xD;
      infusion over 30 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, they get infused 1000μg sodium-selenite on each ICU-treatment day (also about 30&#xD;
      minutes). In addition, various blood values are recorded daily (including selenium levels)&#xD;
      within the routine blood samples. As the collection of these parameters is necessary anyway,&#xD;
      it constitutes no additional burden on the patient. Shortly before the transfer to general&#xD;
      ward there will be a final clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of selenium level of 170μg per liter whole blood the employee of the laboratory&#xD;
      immediately informs the investigator by fax and requests a new blood sample for control&#xD;
      purposes (reference value for selenium in whole blood according to product information&#xD;
      100-144µg/ l). As long as the selenium level of the second sample is not higher than 230μg&#xD;
      selenium per liter whole blood, there are no further precautions necessary according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations. In case of selenium level above 230μg /l, the investigator&#xD;
      will be informed by fax without delay and the donation of investigational product will be&#xD;
      interrupted immediately. If a patient shows clinical signs of selenium toxicity (garlic-like&#xD;
      breath odor, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) it occurs an immediate termination of&#xD;
      the selenium dose, initiating symptomatic counteractive measures and further control samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples are taken by vascular catheters, which are already set for surgery or for&#xD;
      intensive care treatment, independent of the observational study.&#xD;
