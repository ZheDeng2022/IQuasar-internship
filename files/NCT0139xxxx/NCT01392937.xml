    <textblock>
      A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety and acceptability of the Sauflon&#xD;
      Multipurpose Solution when used with four different silicone hydrogel contact lens brands and&#xD;
      one conventional hydrogel control lens was conducted over a period of two months, with a&#xD;
      control group using Ciba Vision Aquify Multi- Purpose Solution. The study was conducted at&#xD;
      six investigator sites and a total of 257 subjects were enrolled. The results of this study&#xD;
      showed the safety, acceptability and substantial equivalence of the Sauflon Multipurpose&#xD;
      Solution to the predicate device for its intended use.&#xD;

      1.1 Study characteristics This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the All-in-One&#xD;
      Light multipurpose care regimen (Sauflon Pharmaceuticals Limited) by comparison with the&#xD;
      Aquify care regimen(Ciba Vision Inc.). Each subject used one of five different lens brands:&#xD;
      Air Optix Aqua(Ciba Vision Inc.), PureVision (Bausch + Lomb Inc.), Biofinity (CooperVision&#xD;
      Inc.), Acuvue Advance and Acuvue 2 (both Johnson &amp; Johnson).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key study features were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two months duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Six investigator sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Daily wear soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses, replaced on a two-weekly basis: Air Optix&#xD;
           Aqua, PureVision, Biofinity, Acuvue Advance and Acuvue 2; with one of two care regimens:&#xD;
           All-in-One Light and Aquify.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A total of 257 subjects were enrolled, and 256 subjects accounting for 512 eyes were&#xD;
           dispensed lenses. This group was randomized into 173 test subjects (346 eyes) and 83&#xD;
           control subjects (166 eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Of the 173 test subjects, 163 (94.2%) completed two months of use. Of the 83 control&#xD;
           subjects, 73 (88.0%) completed two months of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. No eyes remained active at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. There were no adverse reactions. 1.2 Study period The study was conducted over two&#xD;
           months of wear. Subjects were examined initially, and at three follow-up visits after&#xD;
           two weeks, one month and two months. Study visits commenced on March 29, 2010 and were&#xD;
           completed on March 11, 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Demographics Six investigator sites dispensed 173 test subjects (346 eyes) who used&#xD;
      All-in-One Light as their care regimen during the work. Also dispensed were 83 control&#xD;
      subjects (166 eyes)who used Aquify as their care regimen during the work. All recruited&#xD;
      subjects were existing contact lenses wearers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 173 test subjects, 163 (94.2%) completed two months of use and ten (5.8%) were&#xD;
      discontinued. Of the 83 control subjects, 73 (88.0%) completed two months of use and ten&#xD;
      (12.2%) were discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled control group was made up of 51 females (61%) and 32 males (39%) with an age&#xD;
      range from 18 to 67 years (mean 36.7 years). The enrolled test group was composed of 117&#xD;
      females (67%) and 57 males (33%) with an age range from 18 to 65 years (mean 34.1 years). One&#xD;
      subject (female, age 45 years) was enrolled and assigned to the test group but was not&#xD;
      dispensed lenses.&#xD;
