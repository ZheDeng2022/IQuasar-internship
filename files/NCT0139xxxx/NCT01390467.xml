      Paracetamol impact on cognitive processes has been until recently little studied in&#xD;
      literature that presents conflicting results. Some authors do not describe any cognitive&#xD;
      performance change (Bradley and Nicholson, 1987) but more recent studies (Ishida et al.,&#xD;
      2007) report an interesting performance improvement in therapeutic doses of paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This improved performance would use the serotonergic pathway that is involved in the&#xD;
      analgesic mechanism of paracetamol as the investigators demonstrated in our laboratory on&#xD;
      previous work (Pickering et al. 2006, 2008). However, non-therapeutic dose, instead, showed a&#xD;
      deterioration of memory processes in animals which may be link to implication of&#xD;
      Cyclooxygenases COX-2. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated (Sharifzadeh et al. 2005;&#xD;
      Teather et al., 2005) that anti COX-2 (such as Celebrex) cause in animal a deleterious effect&#xD;
      on memory, while an anti COX1 and 2 (as indomethacin) or an anti COX1 (as piroxicam) lead to&#xD;
      no change. A dose-effect relationship is therefore suggested on animals. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      recent study in healthy volunteers showed that paracetamol acts not only on pain but also on&#xD;
      pain / stress in society in everyday life (&quot; social pain &quot;) (deWall et al., 2010). By fMRI,&#xD;
      these psychologists have shown that the reduction of &quot;social&quot; pain is associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in neuronal activity in brain regions that are involved in social processes but also&#xD;
      those who are involved in pain processes (anterior cingulate cortex , anterior insula etc..).&#xD;
      They also showed that paracetamol known for its painkillers properties may reduce the painful&#xD;
      feelings of rejection or shelved in everyday life. The cognitive-emotional impact of&#xD;
      paracetamol is even more interesting that the investigators now know that its metabolism&#xD;
      could involve cannabinoids receptors, particularly CB1 in hippocampus and association cortex&#xD;
      involved themselves in cognitive phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSERM U766 team to which the investigators belong has proposed the following sequence from&#xD;
      preclinical : 1) metabolism of acetaminophen in analgesic metabolite AM404 via FAAH enzyme,&#xD;
      2) AM404 acts indirectly on CB1 receptors, 3) strengthening of bulbo spinal descending&#xD;
      pathways by the endocannabinoid system, 4) involvement of serotonergic receptors pain&#xD;
      suppressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol follows a pilot that the investigators completed (HOP clinicaltrial.gov&#xD;
      NCT01053650, unpublished results yet) where the investigators studied the impact of 2g of&#xD;
      paracetamol in healthy volunteers. The investigators showed a memory improvement, but with no&#xD;
      placebo group, it has not been possible to conclude a significant impact of oral paracetamol.&#xD;
      Thus, this protocol will allow us to better understand if paracetamol can affect some&#xD;
      cognitive processes, particularly vigilance, memory and decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will build a biological collection to assess the&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic profile of subjects and, in a secondary objective, correlate it to cognitive&#xD;
      characteristics of subjects.&#xD;
