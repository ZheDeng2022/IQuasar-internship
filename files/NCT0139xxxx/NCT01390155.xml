    <textblock>
      Esophageal electrocardiography (eECG) has important advantages compared to standard ECG&#xD;
      recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease leading to myocardial ischemia is very common and has potentially&#xD;
      severe consequences for patients. To date, the investigators don't know the influence of&#xD;
      ischemia on the eECG. The goal of the present study is to assess ischemic changes of the eECG&#xD;
      induced by balloon occlusion of coronary arteries in patients undergoing coronary&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rhythm disorders frequently occur in the general population and potentially have&#xD;
      serious consequences. Atrial fibrillation, the most common atrial arrhythmia, can lead to&#xD;
      intracardiac blood clot formation an subsequent embolisation. Esophageal electrocardiography&#xD;
      (eECG) provides detailed information about the electrical activity of the atria. Due to the&#xD;
      good signal quality, eECG is a promising technique for rhythm monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing rhythm monitoring may also show signs of other cardiac diseases,&#xD;
      particularly coronary artery disease (CAD) due to its high prevalence. It is therefore&#xD;
      mandatory to define the ischemic changes in the esophageal ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CAD atherosclerotic processes narrow the lumen of coronary arteries and may cause&#xD;
      exercise-induced ischemia (stable CAD). More importantly, there is also the risk of plaque&#xD;
      rupture and subsequent blood clot formation. This cascade can lead to total occlusion of the&#xD;
      coronary vessel and myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiography is used to determine the severity of coronary artery stenosis. This&#xD;
      simple approach turned out to be useful in clinical routine. However, presence or absence of&#xD;
      coronary collaterals is one of the reasons why coronary angiography alone may fail to define&#xD;
      the clinical relevance of CAD. Collateral vessels as natural bypasses can grow and act as&#xD;
      &quot;backup&quot; blood supply of the myocardial area at risk and can therefore reduce infarct size.&#xD;
      The coronary wedge-pressure method is recognized as the scientific and clinical gold&#xD;
      standard. Collateralization is an important confounder which also can &quot;mask&quot; ischemic changes&#xD;
      on the ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surface ECG of an important portion of patients undergoing arrhythmia screening also&#xD;
      shows signs of myocardial ischemia due to CAD or left ventricular hypertrophy. As with the&#xD;
      surface ECG, it is conceivable that ischemic changes occur in the eECG. The characterization&#xD;
      of ischemia related changes in eECG is crucial in order to guarantee the proper&#xD;
      classification of eECG events. To date, the characterization of such changes is not adequate&#xD;
      in order to allow the reliable clinical interpretation of eECG changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize changes in the esophageal ECG induced by myocardial ischemia due to&#xD;
           short-time coronary occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the influence of coronary collateral vessels on these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for elective coronary angiography will be randomized to four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients undergoing temporary myocardial ischemia produced by a one-minute balloon&#xD;
           occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients undergoing temporary myocardial ischemia produced by a one-minute balloon&#xD;
           occlusion of the proximal left circumflex artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients undergoing temporary myocardial ischemia produced by a one-minute balloon&#xD;
           occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients undergoing temporary ischemia produced by a one-minute occlusion of the target&#xD;
           vessel (the vessel which shows a significant stenosis and accordingly requires a&#xD;
           therapeutical intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the occlusion, collateral flow indexes will be calculated. Simultaneously, surface&#xD;
      ECG, esophageal ECG and intracoronary ECG will be registered.&#xD;
