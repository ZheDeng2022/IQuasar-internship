  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate objective is to test the hypothesis that an 'accelerated titration' protocol for&#xD;
      labour augmentation with oxytocin reduces the risk of caesarean births relative to a 'gradual&#xD;
      titration' protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this pilot feasibility are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of a large multi-centre randomized control trial comparing the&#xD;
           two above oxytocin protocols (accelerated titration versus gradual titration for&#xD;
           correction of dystocia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. More specifically, to identify potential challenges in the study implementation,&#xD;
           particularly with respect to patient recruitment, randomization, blinding, and&#xD;
           compliance/adherence to the labour management guidelines and study protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To obtain preliminary data on the acceptability of the accelerated oxytocin titration&#xD;
           protocol among obstetrical providers and participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a steady increase in the rate of Caesarean births in Canada and worldwide.&#xD;
      Almost half of all primary caesarean sections are performed for labour dystocia - when labour&#xD;
      is abnormally slow or when there is no further progression in cervical dilatation. When&#xD;
      dystocia occurs, oxytocin is used to increase the frequency and intensity of uterine&#xD;
      contractions, with the goal of achieving full cervical dilatation and a vaginal birth. The&#xD;
      actual dose required to produce a clinical response (progressive cervical dilatation) varies&#xD;
      greatly from patient to patient. There is a wide range of oxytocin regimens currently in use.&#xD;
      They may be broadly categorized as being of two types: 1) those involving a gradual titration&#xD;
      of oxytocin dose (or 'low dose') and 2) those with accelerated oxytocin titration (also&#xD;
      called 'high dose').&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the frequently used terms 'low dose' and 'high dose' are to a certain extent&#xD;
      misnomers. Both protocols titrate oxytocin dose to achieve the desired 'physiological&#xD;
      frequency' of uterine contractions (usually 4 to 5 contractions in a 10 minute interval) that&#xD;
      are normally sufficient to result in progressive labour. Thus, the target dose should,&#xD;
      theoretically, be identical and independent of the rate of increase of oxytocin. These&#xD;
      protocols differ mainly in the rate at which the desired physiologic response is achieved.&#xD;
      While most patients achieve a response to stimulation at oxytocin concentrations between 4&#xD;
      and 10 mU per minute, a proportion of nulliparae require higher doses of oxytocin.&#xD;
      Accelerated titration protocols are also frequently associated with a higher maximum&#xD;
      concentration of oxytocin. While, most Canadian birthing centres currently follow a 'gradual&#xD;
      titration' or 'low dose' protocol, there is evidence that 'accelerated titration' or 'high&#xD;
      dose' protocols may be more effective in correcting dystocia and in preventing caesarean&#xD;
      section. It is postulated that by more rapidly progressing to the required therapeutic dose,&#xD;
      cervical dilatation is achieved more rapidly, the likelihood of a spontaneous vaginal birth&#xD;
      is increased, and the risk of occurrence of complications resulting from prolonged labour&#xD;
      (such as infection and maternal fatigue) is reduced.&#xD;
