      To determine the effects of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volumes and severity of psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms in a population of psychosis patients compared to healthy age/gender matched&#xD;
      volunteers. Psychosis patients often suffer from a number of cognitive difficulties,&#xD;
      including poor memory function, poor problem-solving capacity and difficulties with attention&#xD;
      and concentration. These problems are not well addressed by current clinical treatments.&#xD;
      Evidence from aging research strongly suggests that increased cardiovascular fitness may&#xD;
      provide numerous cognitive benefits by promoting brain growth, particularly in the frontal&#xD;
      lobes and the hippocampi. The current study will measure the effects of aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      brain volumes in a population of chronic psychosis patients to determine if 1) hippocampal&#xD;
      volumes increase in response to exercise and 2) if parallel improvements in cognitive&#xD;
      functioning occur.&#xD;

      This is a 12-week, randomized trial with two parallel groups. Throughout the trial, subjects&#xD;
      will be treated on their prescribed dose of medication. Once informed consent is obtained,&#xD;
      subjects and healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to either an aerobic or a&#xD;
      resistance exercise program (N = 24 per diagnostic group in each of two exercise conditions).&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive their antipsychotics and other prescribed medications.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteer data will be used to establish normal exercise-induced neuroplasticity in a&#xD;
      non-psychiatric, non-medicated population. All training will be conducted at the Riverview&#xD;
      Hospital fitness facilities and at dedicated exercise training facilities at the University&#xD;
      of British Columbia. All exercise sessions will be monitored by trained research assistants&#xD;
      (RAs) under the guidance of the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology-Certified Exercise&#xD;
      Physiologists (CSEP-CEPs). The RAs will receive pre-study exercise training from the&#xD;
      CSEP-CEPs. During the course of the study, the training intensity will be changed according&#xD;
      to the individual participant's response and needs via the CSEP-CEPs and RAs.&#xD;

    <measure>Increase hippocampal volume with aerobic training in schizophrenic and healthy volunteers.</measure>
    <time_frame>Base-line, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hippocampal volumes will be measured from structural MRI scans. T1-weighted 3D SPGR (spoiled gradient recalled) and high-resilution T2- weighted structural images will be obtained for the purposes of volumetric assessment of the hippocampi and the whole brain</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increases in hippocampal volumes will be positively associated with improvements in working memory performance in schizophrenia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 8 and 12.</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), will be used to assess memory function. Multiple versions of the HVLT exist (12) so practice effects will be minimized. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF), in which subjects are asked to reproduce a complex line drawing from memory, will be used to assess attention and working memory.</description>
