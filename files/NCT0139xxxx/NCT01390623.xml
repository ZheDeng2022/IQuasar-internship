  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract community infections are one of very frequent reason consultation and&#xD;
      prescription. Urinary tract represents the second site of bacterial community infection after&#xD;
      the respiratory system. The management of the acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis was simply&#xD;
      codified in the past recommendations of the French Agency for Safety Health Products&#xD;
      (AFSSAPS) in 2008. Treatment is based on two main families of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones&#xD;
      with 7 days treatment and 3rd generation cephalosporins with 10 to 14 days treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of a short treatment with ceftriaxone intra venous relayed by cefixime orally&#xD;
      provides a simplified treatment for patients, a reduced use of fluoroquinolones and a&#xD;
      probable decrease in correlation with the emergence of fluoroquinolones resistance, and&#xD;
      finally, a decrease in the cost of treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis.&#xD;

      Patients will be included by investigators or coinvestigateurs, the day of consultation in&#xD;
      the emergency adult department in Clermont-Ferrand city.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis is established in the emergency&#xD;
      department based on the clinical, laboratory and imaging criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, biological and radiological data will gathered during this consultation :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical data: flank pain, fever, urinary symptoms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological data: urine dipstick (BU No. 1), cytobacteriological urinary (ECBU No. 1),&#xD;
           blood prélèvements (Blood count, creatinine, CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imagery: renal and bladder ultrasound. During the next consultations in the emergency&#xD;
           department, respectively on day 3 (J3) of treatment and on day 9 (J9), urine tests&#xD;
           (urinary dipsticks [BU No. 2 and No. 3] and cytobacteriological urinary [ECBU No. 2 and&#xD;
           No. 3] will be realised. The clinical and biological management of patient will be&#xD;
           performed by the same department to ensure a better comparability of biological results&#xD;
           and a centralized real-time clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up will end with a phone call on day 37 (J37), and the rate of clinical&#xD;
      relapses and / or biological occurred between day 9 and day 37.&#xD;
