      The primary study objective is to evaluate recurrence/metastasis free survival at 12 months&#xD;
      with postoperative adjuvant treatment incorporating gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by chemoradiation with gemcitabine followed by maintenance chemotherapy with&#xD;

    <description>The study consists of three phases; Induction chemotherapy phase:Starting 4~8 weeks after R0 resection of pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine: 1200mg/㎡ (Day 1, 8), cisplatin 60mg/㎡ (Day 1) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles. Chemoradiotherapy phase: Starting 1-2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy (within 5 weeks after D1 of 2nd cycle of induction chemotherapy), no later than 16 weeks after operation. Gemcitabine 300mg/㎡ weekly for 5 weeks throughout RT period. Radiotherapy: 50.4Gy at 1.8Gy/Fx, for 28 Fx (Field reduction at 45Gy) for 5.5 pweeks. Maintenance chemotherapy phase: Within 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotheray, no later than 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy Gemcitabine: 1200mg/㎡ (Day 1, 8) every 3 weeks, for 4 cycles</description>
