      Objectives of Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this clinical trial is to show the efficacy of fluorescence&#xD;
      lymphangiography with indocyanine green (ICG) for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering the high diagnostic accuracy and less vulnerable staging and therapy procedures,&#xD;
      SLNB has rapidly become the state of the art diagnostic for axillary staging in early breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior surgery, the so called sentinel lymph nodes are detected, harvested and&#xD;
      histopathologically examined. The histopathologic status of the sentinel node thereby&#xD;
      accurately reflects the status of the remaining axillary nodes. The sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy allows minimizing risks and burdens for patients who very likely have no metastasis in&#xD;
      the axillary lymph nodes sparing the ALND and reducing the risk of surgery and postoperative&#xD;
      lymph oedema for instance. Contrarily to former procedure where an axillary lymph node&#xD;
      dissection (ALND) was done each time, an ALND now only follows if the detected sentinel lymph&#xD;
      node is metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routinely sentinel lymph nodes are mapped using radiocolloid tracers such as technetium,&#xD;
      sometimes combined with a blue dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the infrastructure for a radioactive tracing is complex and not available easily:&#xD;
      special techniques and equipment for the manufacturing of the radiocolloid as well as&#xD;
      training in the use with radioisotopes are needed. For example, the application of&#xD;
      radioactive markers needs a ready access to a nuclear medicine department, a pre-operative&#xD;
      visit and an effective coordination between the involved disciplinesis. As these&#xD;
      radioisotopes are formed by specialised, rare industry facilities availability is heavenly&#xD;
      dependend and lack of radioisotopes with shortages in diagnostic procedures has already been&#xD;
      reported. Furthermore radiocolloid mapping is associated with radioactive exposure of the&#xD;
      concerned patients and health workers and imposes problems with surgical waste disposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel methods for detecting sentinel lymph nodes which waive the pre-operative injection of&#xD;
      the radioactive marker are currently investigated. One of these new methods is the&#xD;
      application of a fluorescence marker for SLN detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial a novel method for detecting the sentinel lymph node using indocyanine&#xD;
      green, a fluorescent molecule shall by investigated.&#xD;
