      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A special brain circuit is important for helping us keeping an eye open for things that are&#xD;
      going on around us, even when we are not directly paying attention to them. This circuit&#xD;
      seems to work differently in people with schizophrenia than in other people, which may&#xD;
      explain specific deficits with broad monitoring observed in people with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Researchers want to compare brain function in people with schizophrenia and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers to find out more about how these brain circuits work and affect attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the brain performs broad visual monitoring in people with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 to 55 years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with physical and psychological exams. They will have a&#xD;
           medical history. Tests for drug and alcohol use will also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two study visits. The first is a training visit and the second is&#xD;
           a scanning visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the training visit, participants will practice computer-based tests of focus, memory,&#xD;
           and concentration. They will also answer questions about mood, psychiatric symptoms, and&#xD;
           smoking habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the scanning visit, participants will perform the computer-based tasks that they&#xD;
           practiced at the training visit. They will have magnetic resonance imaging while they&#xD;
           perform these tasks.&#xD;

      Objective: To test a neural circuit explanation for a visuospatial attention abnormality seen&#xD;
      in schizophrenia. Specifically, the aim is to test whether broad monitoring deficits may be&#xD;
      based on a disruption of the so-called sentinel function of the default network. Because the&#xD;
      default network is modulated by nicotinic compounds, such finding would implicate a possible&#xD;
      remediation strategy.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 24 people with schizophrenia, 24 matched healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A group comparison of attention task performance and associated brain activity as&#xD;
      measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Measures of attention task performance (reaction time, accuracy), BOLD&#xD;
      signal within regions of the default network, degree of temporal association of BOLD signal&#xD;
      with trial-by-trial reaction time.&#xD;
