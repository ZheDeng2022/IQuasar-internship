  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in the treatment of patients with resected NSCLC, disease recurrence&#xD;
      and mortality related to lung cancer are common among patients with early stage non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore novel approaches are necessary to improve the outcome for&#xD;
      early stage NSCLC. The preclinical studies conducted with vaccine based approaches provide&#xD;
      the rationale to evaluate this as an adjunct to surgery for patients with early stage NSCLC.&#xD;
      Administration of the vaccine before surgery will also allow for the evaluation of the tumor&#xD;
      specimen for immunological responses to the vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the currently proposed study, patients will receive the first dose of the vaccine&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks prior to surgery. The second dose will be administered about 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      following surgery. A booster dose of the vaccine will be given 6 months after the 2nd&#xD;
      vaccine. The tumor tissue and serum will be studied for immunological responses following&#xD;
      therapy with the vaccine. Patients are allowed to receive adjuvant chemotherapy if indicated.&#xD;
      The choice of the chemotherapy regimen will be at the discretion of the treating physician,&#xD;
      preferably 3-4 cycles of platinum combination regimen. The vaccine should be administered at&#xD;
      least 2 weeks before chemotherapy is initiated.&#xD;
