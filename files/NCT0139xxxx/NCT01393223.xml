  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses of LP08&#xD;
      compared to placebo. Hypothesis: Safety of the LP-08 therapy will not be significantly&#xD;
      different from the placebo group. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: A matched-pair data analysis&#xD;
      design will be employed, i.e. the measured outcomes will be subjects' improvements in&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative measures of the disease condition being assessed prior to and&#xD;
      after LP-08 instillations at four and eight weeks follow-up visits&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study&#xD;
      including male and female subjects with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS)&#xD;
      as determined by a physician using the current diagnostic criteria for IC/BPS. A total of 36&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at up to five (5) study sites in the U.S. Enrollment is expected to&#xD;
      be completed within one year of initiating the study. The study is comprised of two parts.&#xD;
      The first part of the study is a dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of LP-08 at 20 mg and 80 mg doses as&#xD;
      compared with placebo. The second part of the study is an Open Label Extension study of the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of LP-08 80 mg. Subjects randomized to the placebo control&#xD;
      group must have completed the randomized portion study, including the eight week follow-up&#xD;
      period, to be eligible for the Open Label Extension.&#xD;
