      This Phase I/II trial is to prove the efficacy and safety of AAV2-hAADC to treat patients&#xD;
      with AADC deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) is an enzyme responsible for the final step in the&#xD;
      synthesis of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. AADC deficiency is a rare genetic&#xD;
      disorder. Taiwanese carry a high prevalence of AADC deficiency due to the founder mutation&#xD;
      IVS6+4 A&gt;T, and patients usually die before the age 5-6 years due to severe motor&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2 (AAV2) driven human AADC (hAADC)&#xD;
      has been tested in both animal models and Phase I clinical trials of Parkinson disease. We&#xD;
      have done a compassionate treatment of 8 patients with AADC deficiency by AAV2-hAADC and&#xD;
      demonstrated a result that among the treated patients, 4 could stand with support, 3 could&#xD;
      sit with support, and there was no virus-associated toxicity. The longest follow up has&#xD;
      exceeded 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to prove the safety and efficacy of AAV2-hAADC treatment for patients with&#xD;
      Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. With a confirmed diagnosis of AADC, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis to show&#xD;
             reduced levels of neurotransmitter metabolites, HVA and 5-HIAA, and higher L-Dopa,&#xD;
             together with more than one mutation within AADC gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Classical clinical characteristics of AADC deficiency, such as oculogyric crises,&#xD;
             hypotonia and developmental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The sick child has to be over 2 years old or a head circumference big enough for&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participating patients must cooperate completely for all evaluations and examinations&#xD;
             before, during and after the whole trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Parents or guardians must sign to agree on this informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant brain structure abnormality&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with any health or neurological doubts that may increase the risk of surgery&#xD;
             cannot join this trial. PI has the right to evaluate the feasibility of subjects for&#xD;
             this trial based on his/her health condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Since high-level neutralizing antibodies may disturb the therapeutic effect of gene&#xD;
             therapy, patients with anti-AAV2 neutralizing antibody titer over 1,200 folds or an&#xD;
             ELISA OD over 1 cannot be enrolled into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects enrolled in this clinical trial cannot take any medications that may affect&#xD;
             this trial.&#xD;
