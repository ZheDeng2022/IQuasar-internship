      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sickle cell disease often causes crises, with episodes of pain. Many people with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease also have pain between crises. Inflammation is an important part of sickle cell&#xD;
      pain. It may be related to levels of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a gas in the body that&#xD;
      helps relax blood vessels and may be related to the pain from sickle cell disease.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study the relationship between blood levels of nitric oxide and pain in&#xD;
      people with sickle cell disease. Researchers also want to study how certain genes express&#xD;
      themselves related to sickle cell pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect blood samples and other genetic expression information to study sickle cell pain&#xD;
      and its relation to nitric oxide levels in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires a screening visit and four study visits scheduled 1 week apart. Each&#xD;
           visit will last about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will&#xD;
           complete questionnaires about pain levels (if any). They will also provide blood samples&#xD;
           for genetic and other testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a breath test to see how much nitric oxide they exhale. They will&#xD;
           also have a test of their ability to detect small changes in temperature and touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a diary to record daily pain levels and pain medicines taken.&#xD;
           They will write down what they eat to track foods that contain nitrates (such as meats&#xD;
           like ham and bacon and vegetables like beets and spinach).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each of the four study visit, participants will bring the pain diary, provide blood&#xD;
           samples, and have breath nitric oxide tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a systemic disorder whose proximate cause is a mutation in the&#xD;
      beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. Although it is characterized by differing degrees and&#xD;
      patterns of clinical manifestations, its major features include severe episodes of pain. The&#xD;
      sickle cell pain crisis is one of the most typical characteristics of this disease and pain&#xD;
      associated with crisis is reported to be more intense than other types of clinical pain by&#xD;
      those with sickle cell disease and displays both nociceptive and neuropathic qualities. Pain&#xD;
      in sickle cell disease is more widely experienced and poorly managed than previously&#xD;
      considered. In one community sample, more than 50 percent of the patients reported&#xD;
      experiencing pain on more than half the days of the study period. Painful crisis consist of&#xD;
      pain experienced in different areas of the body, typically in the extremities, back, abdomen&#xD;
      and chest and some studies suggest that patients experience prodromal or pre-crisis phases of&#xD;
      their pain, some of which last up to 24 hours before developing the typical features of a&#xD;
      pain crisis. The nature of pain experience in patients with sickle cell disease is not well&#xD;
      documented nor are the mechanisms of sickle cell pain well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The first objective of the study is to characterize genetic expression data of&#xD;
      sickle cell disease and matched controls at weekly time points over a 4 week period. The&#xD;
      second objective is to measure levels of exhaled Nitric Oxide (eNO) and other biomarkers in&#xD;
      sickle cell patients and in matched controls over the same time points. The third objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate experimental pain perception in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: By stratifying patients by pain level, this study will recruit sickle cell&#xD;
      patients with a range of symptom severity (N=45) and sex-, race-, ethnicity and age-matched&#xD;
      controls (N=45) without sickle cell trait from the NIH Patient Recruitment and Referral&#xD;
      Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, exploratory study of steady state and acute pain phase in&#xD;
      sickle cell patients. Participants will undergo evaluations (eNO and blood collection) during&#xD;
      weekly clinic visits and keep a pain diary for 4 weeks after the first visit. All&#xD;
      participants will also undergo one session of quantitative sensory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of the biochemical and&#xD;
      molecular genetic mechanisms associated with sickle cell pain by characterizing the&#xD;
      transcriptome of sickle cell disease during steady state and pain phases. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that analysis of the transcriptome will result in a panel of biomarkers that correlate with&#xD;
      the severity level of pain and perhaps signal the onset of a painful episode. The successful&#xD;
      elucidation of these relationships may identify novel targets for intervention leading to&#xD;
      attenuation of sickle cell pain, improved treatment and less impact on quality of life and&#xD;
      functional status.&#xD;
