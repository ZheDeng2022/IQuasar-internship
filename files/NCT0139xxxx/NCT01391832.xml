  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective will be to determine if adding repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      prior to Cognitive Processing Therapy significantly enhances recovery from hyperarousal&#xD;
      symptoms in individuals with combat related post traumatic stress disorder and improves&#xD;
      clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have assembled a multimodal human performance laboratory including 64&#xD;
      channel EEG and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation system. These resources combined&#xD;
      with the neuroimaging capabilities of the Advanced Imaging Research Center (AIRC) at UT&#xD;
      Southwestern and skilled Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) practitioners will be used in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves approximately 19 visits. Treatment is once a week for 12 weeks followed by&#xD;
      a 1 month, 3 month and 6 month follow-up appointments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will first screen participants between the ages of 18 and 60 years for symptoms of PTSD as&#xD;
      determined by subjective reporting. We will also screen for healthy control participants to&#xD;
      participate in comparison assessment phases of the study. After meeting pre-screen criteria,&#xD;
      a more extensive screening to determine the eligibility of each subject will be performed.&#xD;
      This will be followed by an EEG. The EEG system measures event-related potentials (ERPs),&#xD;
      which explain certain cognitive processes based on changes in the amplitude and timing of&#xD;
      electrical changes recorded from the surface of the scalp. We will use an ERP task that&#xD;
      includes combat-threatening stimuli as the novel oddball probe to assess P300 response. The&#xD;
      amplitude of the P300 (positive amplitude recorded 300 milliseconds after stimulus onset) is&#xD;
      used to differentiate between hypo-, normo-, and hyper-arousability. Identifying those with&#xD;
      hyperarousal on P300 response on ERP allows for identification of PTSD patients with&#xD;
      subjective and objective measures of hyperarousal. The participants will then be scheduled&#xD;
      for a neuroimaging session. During neuroimaging, participants will have structural and&#xD;
      functional brain scans acquired, including a functional MRI scan using the same&#xD;
      threatening/nonthreatening stimuli, thus providing another objective measure of hyperarousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then have active or sham 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) administered to the right frontal lobe as well as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)&#xD;
      once per week for twelve weeks (total 12 rTMS-CPT sessions). Studies have shown that rTMS&#xD;
      applied externally to the forehead in the region of the dorsal lateral forehead will safely,&#xD;
      reversibly, and painlessly down-modulate the frontal lobe on the side of the head to which it&#xD;
      is applied. Our preliminary studies have shown that application of frontal rTMS can reduce&#xD;
      the response to threatening stimuli temporarily and this can optimize the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the CPT. Following the 12 sessions of rTMS-CPT, the EEG and neuroimaging will be repeated to&#xD;
      test for changes in brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the study involves approximately 19 visits. Treatment is once a week for 12 weeks&#xD;
      followed by a 1 month, 3 month and 6 month follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first 2-3 visits involve an informed consent, a baseline assessment, EEG and&#xD;
           neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 4-15 are the rTMS/CPT sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 16 is a 1 month follow-up, post-treatment assessment and EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 17 is a post-treatment neuroimaging visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 18 is the 3 month follow up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 19 is the 6 month follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure of treatment efficacy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be change in the Clinician Administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CAPS) Total Severity Score (i.e., summed across frequency and intensity ratings for the 17 PTSD assessment items) from baseline at 1-month post-treatment. CAPS Total Severity Score ranges from 0 to 136. Difference scores were calculated as the outcome score minus the baseline score, with negative scores indicating a reduction in symptom severity from baseline (i.e., a positive treatment outcome), and differences between treatment groups in change scores were evaluated using t-tests.</description>

    <description>For the active rTMS with CPT group, the rTMS coil will be placed over the right prefrontal scalp region with the MagStim Rapid Stimulator set to the active mode. After motor threshold determination, the stimulator coil is positioned over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - DLPFC (Brodmann Area 9/46). The right frontal rTMS will safely, reversibly, and temporarily down modulate the right frontal lobe. The conducting coil is placed over the scalp while electrical current pulses pass through the coil. This alternating current turned on and off rapidly produces magnetic pulses (1.5-2.0 Tesla strength) that last for 100 - 300 microseconds. The time-varying magnetic pulses induce an electrical field that will result in current flow in neural tissue, thereby activating or deactivating cortex subjacent to the coil.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Follow-up in Clinician Administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale Total Severity Score</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure of treatment efficacy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be change in the Clinician Administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CAPS) Total Severity Score (i.e., summed across frequency and intensity ratings for the 17 PTSD assessment items) from baseline at 1-month post-treatment. CAPS Total Severity Score ranges from 0 to 136. Difference scores were calculated as the outcome score minus the baseline score, with negative scores indicating a reduction in symptom severity from baseline (i.e., a positive treatment outcome), and differences between treatment groups in change scores were evaluated using t-tests.</description>

Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT): CPT is a 12 session evidenced based, trauma-focused treatment for PTSD. CPT is a cognitive therapy based on information processing theory and includes components which help the client to (a) access memory of the traumatic event, (b) identify and experience her or his emotions until they have been extinguished, and (c) identify and challenge beliefs about the event itself, about self and the world which have been altered.</description>

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS): For the sham rTMS with CPT group, the rTMS coil will be placed over the right prefrontal scalp region with the MagStim Rapid Stimulator set to the sham mode so that all conditions are similar to the active delivery mode except that transcranial magnetic stimulation is not administered to the scalp and does not down modulate the right frontal lobe.&#xD;
