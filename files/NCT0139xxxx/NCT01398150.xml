  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether consuming a beverage made with cranberry&#xD;
      polyphenols and proanthocyanidins is effective in modifying immune function by enhancing&#xD;
      immune cell proliferation, cytokine production, and antioxidant capacity. If immune cell&#xD;
      proliferation is improved, the subjects are expected to have fewer cold and flu symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the Treatment (cranberry beverage) group or the&#xD;
      Placebo group and each will be instructed to consume the test beverages twice a day for 70&#xD;
      days. The beverage is not commercially prepared juice, but is a beverage prepared with an&#xD;
      extract of cranberry that contains polyphenols and proanthocyanidins. Blood is taken at&#xD;
      baseline, and day 70. Subjects are given a diary to keep a record of their cold and flu&#xD;
      symptoms. Serum is used to determine the antioxidant activity by the ORAC method. Peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells are isolated from the blood draw and used fresh, cultured for 24&#xD;
      hours or cultured for 10 days. Freshly isolated cells will be used to determine αβ-T, γδ-T, B&#xD;
      and NK cell numbers and then cultured in autologous serum for 10 days to determine how well&#xD;
      they proliferate. The supernatant of 24 hour cultures will be used for cytokine&#xD;
      determination. If cells have been primed by the beverage made with cranberry compounds, the&#xD;
      investigators expect the cells to proliferate to a greater extent and have modified cytokine&#xD;
      production compared to placebo. If the beverage made with cranberry compounds enhances the&#xD;
      proliferation of one or more of these cell types (αβ-T, γδ T, B or NK cell), then it is&#xD;
      possible that there will be fewer cold and flu symptoms in the group consuming the cranberry&#xD;
      beverage. Incidence of illness is not expected to change, only the severity of the illness.&#xD;
