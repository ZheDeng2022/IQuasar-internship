  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the cause of considerable deaths, and&#xD;
      exacerbations (flare up of symptoms) are a major cause of hospital admission in the UK.&#xD;
      Bacterial infections play an important role in the development of COPD, however, there is&#xD;
      little information available about the use of long term antibiotics in the treatment of this&#xD;
      disease. Therefore the purpose of this study is to identify the best antibiotic regime for&#xD;
      treating patients with COPD who have persistent bacterial infection in their lung. We will&#xD;
      test a variety of approaches including both older and newer regimes prescribed either on a&#xD;
      daily basis at a lower dose or in &quot;pulsed&quot; courses (for example, every other day or five days&#xD;
      every month). The three antibiotics tested in this study are: moxifloxacin, azithromycin and&#xD;
      doxycycline. This is a 13 weeks study conducted at the Royal Free Hospital, London. It is&#xD;
      expected that approximately 200 patients will be selected for this study. The information we&#xD;
      get from this study may help us to treat future patients with COPD better.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 14 week study in which 200 patients with COPD will be selected for this study from&#xD;
      GP practices up to a 15 mile radius from the Royal Free Hospital to participate in this&#xD;
      study. The 3 antibiotic regimes (plus a placebo group) will be used in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin: an oral dose of 400 mg once daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azithromycin: an oral dose of 250 mg once daily three times a week (every other day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxycycline: an oral dose of 100 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo will be given as one table once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study recruitment and enrollment will take place through the Primary Care Research Network&#xD;
      (PCRN). Potentially eligible participants aged ≥ 45 will be identified from GP practices up&#xD;
      to a 15 mile radius from the RFH. Potential eligible patients will be contacted by letter&#xD;
      with an accompanying patient information sheet (PIS) describing the study in detail and&#xD;
      inviting the patient to attend a hospital visit and enroll. If patients have not responded to&#xD;
      the invitation letter, this will be followed by a reminder letter approximately 2 weeks&#xD;
      later. Non responders to the reminder letter will be followed up by a final telephone call.&#xD;
      Patients expressing an interest in participation will be offered a screening appointment at&#xD;
      the Royal Free Hospital. Patients will be asked to visit the hospital 3 times and will be&#xD;
      contacted twice by telephone during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening Visit (V1), the following will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be discussed again with the patient during this visit and if he/she agree&#xD;
           to participate, they will be asked to sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical history of the patient will be taken. This will include smoking history,&#xD;
           antibiotic Hypersensitivity, as well as patient concomitant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A full physical examination will be performed and height and weight of patients will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A lung function test (spirometry assessment) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will be collected in order to perform routine haematology/blood chemistry&#xD;
           and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sputum sample will be taken and analysed to determine number of bacteria in the lung&#xD;
           and to screen for Tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A urine pregnancy test will be carried out on females of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to complete two sets of questionnaires; &quot;St. George's respiratory&#xD;
           questionnaire&quot; (SGRQ) which includes simple questions about the patients COPD condition&#xD;
           and how it affects their life; the second an EQ5D questionnaire which includes simple&#xD;
           questions relating to the general quality of their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be given daily diary cards and asked to record their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECG will be performed on all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are eligible for the trial, they will be randomised to one of the following&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin: an oral dose of 400 mg once daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks for a&#xD;
      total duration of 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azithromycin: an oral dose of 250 mg once daily three times a week (every other day) for a&#xD;
      total duration of 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxycycline: an oral dose of 100 mg once daily, for a total duration of 13 weeks Placebo: an&#xD;
      oral daily dose of one capsule, for a total duration of 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-blind trial. Patients will be blinded to treatment; the investigator will be&#xD;
      unblinded. Microbiologists will also be blind to treatment allocation when assessing sputum&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomisation of eligible patients, patients will be asked to return to the&#xD;
      hospital for a second visit (within 1 week) to collect their medication from the research&#xD;
      fellow who will instruct the patient to start taking the medication within 3 days. At this&#xD;
      visit, the research team will check if patients are happy filling in their diary cards and&#xD;
      will be happy to answer any questions they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In week 5 and week 9 of treatment, each patient will be contacted by telephone to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor progress and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remind patients to take medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage patients to contact the GP/investigator if symptoms worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of any adverse effects/serious adverse effects (AE/SAE) or an&#xD;
           exacerbation will be checked and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remind patients to fill in their daily diary cards&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit (at week 14):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to return to the hospital and the following assessments will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of AE/SAE or exacerbations will be checked and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A spirometry assessment to test their lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diary cards will be collected by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SGRQ and EQ5D questionnaires will be completed at this visit by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sputum sample will be taken from the patients to determine bacterial number in their&#xD;
           lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unused study medication and packaging will be collected from the patient.&#xD;
