  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare oxygen saturation of blood samples collected from the&#xD;
      superior vena cava, the right atrium, and the pulmonary artery. A secondary target was to&#xD;
      assess whether positioning the tip of central venous catheters in the right atrium causes&#xD;
      more arrhythmias than positioning it in the superior vena cava.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out in patients that undergo central venous and pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheterization for surgical coronary revascularization. In the interventional group (atrium,&#xD;
      A), the tip of the central venous catheter (CVC) is placed in the right atrium; in the&#xD;
      control group (control, C), the tip is placed in the superior vena cava. In both groups, CVC&#xD;
      position is confirmed with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). At fixed times during&#xD;
      surgery and in the following 72 hours, heparinized blood samples are collected from the&#xD;
      proximal and distal CVC lumens and from the distal lumen of the pulmonary catheter (PC) and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation is measured by an oximeter. Besides, mechanical and electrical&#xD;
      complications potentially influenced by CVC position are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary aim of the study will be achieved by performing the following analysis on&#xD;
           values from CVC proximal and distal lumens:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. a Bland Altman analysis between proximal and distal oxygen saturation in group A,&#xD;
                in order to evaluate if the two measures are equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. a comparison of the difference between proximal and distal oxygen saturation in&#xD;
                groups A and C in order to rule out random errors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. differences in oxygen saturation between proximal or distal CVC and distal PC will&#xD;
                be compared in order to evaluate whether distal saturation is more indicative of&#xD;
                mixed venous saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. differences between proximal and distal oxygen saturation will be correlated with&#xD;
                cardiac index and PCWP to investigate if low cardiac output and hypovolemia&#xD;
                increase differences&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The secondary aim of the study will be achieved by comparing the incidence of cardiac&#xD;
           arrhythmias in groups A and C&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a prospective, randomized, open-label study. Forty consecutive patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery requiring the placement of a central venous catheter and of a&#xD;
      Swan-Ganz catheter, and then admitted to Cardiac Surgery ICU of &quot;A.Gemelli&quot; University&#xD;
      Hospital will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized to two groups: A group,&#xD;
      in which the catheter tip will be positioned in right atrium, and C (control) group, in which&#xD;
      the catheter tip will be positioned in the superior vena cava, at the junction with the&#xD;
      atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrow catheters (3 lumen, 8,5 Fr, 20 cm long) will be used. Catheters will be placed in right&#xD;
      internal jugular or subclavian vein with Seldinger technique. In group A, the catheter will&#xD;
      be advanced for its entire length unless arrhythmias develop; in group C the catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted for 15 cm. Catheter position will be controlled by transesophageal echocardiography&#xD;
      and/or by chest radiography. In order to avoid risk of damage to the atrial wall, ECG and&#xD;
      central venous pressure will be monitored during the entire observation period, and the&#xD;
      catheter will be repositioned, withdrawing it, in presence of extrasystoles or other&#xD;
      arrhythmias potentially triggered by contact between the catheter tip and the heart wall, in&#xD;
      case of flattening of the curve of the central venous pressure (caused by contact with the&#xD;
      atrial wall) or in presence of a ventricular type of curve (migration of the catheter in the&#xD;
      right ventricle through the tricuspid valve). The catheter tip will be removed or&#xD;
      repositioned in superior vena cava at the time of mobilization of the patient or of his&#xD;
      transfer to another unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of arterial blood from an arterial line, one of mixed venous blood from the&#xD;
      pulmonary catheter and two samples from the CVC, one from the distal lumen and a proximal&#xD;
      lumen, will be taken at different times: time 1, at CVC placement; time 2, after sternotomy;&#xD;
      time 3, after after discontinuation of CBP; time 4, at admission to ICU; time 5, 6,7 8,&#xD;
      respectively 6, 18, 30 and 42 hours after the end of surgery. Samples volume of 1 mL will be&#xD;
      collected in heparinized syringes and immediately analyzed by a stat analyzer (Stat Profile&#xD;
      Critical Care Xpress by Nova Biomedical) with integrated on-board CO-Oximetry, allowing&#xD;
      direct measurement of oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The values of pH, pO2, pCO2 and saturation of venous samples will be compared and the&#xD;
      difference will be analyzed by Bland-Altman method. The observed difference will also be&#xD;
      correlated with indexes of tissue perfusion (arterial base excess, arterial plasma lactate)&#xD;
      and with the presence and dose of vasoactive drugs infusion.&#xD;
