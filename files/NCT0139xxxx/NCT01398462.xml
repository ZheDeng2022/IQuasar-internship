  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CWP232291 blocks proliferation of cancer cells via activation of caspases. Active caspase&#xD;
      have been shown to target beta-catenin, the hallmark of canonical Wnt signaling, for&#xD;
      degradation through caspase-directed cleavage. CWP232291 targets beta-catenin for degradation&#xD;
      and thereby inhibits the expression of cell cycle and anti-apoptotic genes such as cyclin D1&#xD;
      and survivin.&#xD;

             therapy, or primary (PMF), post-polycythemia vera (PPMF) or post-essential&#xD;
             thrombocythemia (PTMF) MF by WHO classification, are high-risk category by the Dynamic&#xD;
