      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an&#xD;
      experimental workflow that may result in a faster way to plan and deliver radiation for the&#xD;
      treatment of pain caused by metastatic bone tumors (tumors that originally came from another&#xD;
      organ and have spread to bones causing pain) or multiple myeloma (a type of cancer that&#xD;
      begins in white blood cells that produce antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care radiation treatment planning and delivery takes 2 to 3 weeks&#xD;
      from start to finish. The investigators have developed an experimental workflow: a radiation&#xD;
      treatment planning and delivery workflow called &quot;STAT RT&quot; (STAT means &quot;right away&quot;, and RT&#xD;
      means radiation therapy). This experimental workflow may shorten the time it takes to plan&#xD;
      and treat painful bone metastases to 1 week or less. All steps in this process will be&#xD;
      performed within the current standard of care but in a shorter time frame to allow treatment&#xD;
      to start sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate effectiveness by requesting patients to complete pain and&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires before and after treatment. The investigators will also be&#xD;
      collecting additional information from their treatments that will help us make future&#xD;
      workflows even more efficient.&#xD;

      Background: Osseous metastatic disease causes significant pain, decreased functioning, and&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. Progressive bone destruction can lead to pathologic fractures or&#xD;
      spinal cord compression leading to orthopedic surgery, paralysis, and/or patients becoming&#xD;
      bedridden. Opioids can alleviate pain but have neurologic and gastrointestinal side effects&#xD;
      that further decrease quality of life. Radiation therapy can effectively reduce pain and&#xD;
      opioid use and prevent further bone destruction, however, its use is limited because the&#xD;
      current workflow frequently requires one week for planning and two weeks for delivery.&#xD;
      Additionally, typical palliative radiation plans for osseous metastases lack conformality of&#xD;
      dose to the tumor volume, and therefore, result in radiation-induced toxicity to large&#xD;
      volumes of adjacent normal tissue. Recent software and hardware advancements provide the&#xD;
      opportunity to revolutionize the palliative treatment of osseous metastases. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to investigate a novel TomoTherapy-based workflow, called STAT RT,&#xD;
      which includes same day CT simulation, treatment planning, and quality assurance measurements&#xD;
      coupled with highly conformal treatment delivery for patients with osseous metastases in a&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The overall goal of this STAT RT proposal is to develop a more rapid, convenient,&#xD;
      and effective palliative radiation approach for patients with osseous metastases that is less&#xD;
      toxic and less expensive than current treatment regimens. The investigators have already&#xD;
      optimized the conformality of TomoTherapy-based radiation doses for osseous metastases, and&#xD;
      the investigators have developed a STAT RT workflow that condenses standard of care&#xD;
      simulation, planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery into 5-6 hours. Additional&#xD;
      optimization and integration of new radiation therapy computing processes will allow for real&#xD;
      time simulation, planning, and delivery via a novel Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow that&#xD;
      will ultimately require only 30 minutes. In this study the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the current STAT RT workflow, and the investigators will investigate&#xD;
      techniques for further optimization that will be needed to create a 30 minute Scan-Plan-Treat&#xD;
      STAT RT workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Specific Aim/ Hypothesis: The investigators will quantify the time for pain relief,&#xD;
      amount of pain relief, opioid use reduction, functional scores, quality of life, and&#xD;
      satisfaction of patients treated with STAT RT for osseous metastases. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that these patients will have rapid and significant pain relief, improved quality&#xD;
      of life, and high patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Specific Aim/ Hypothesis: The investigators will optimize the integration of&#xD;
      commercially available and in-development software to develop the Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT&#xD;
      workflow. Specifically, the investigators will A) optimize rigid and deformable&#xD;
      co-registration of pre-contoured diagnostic image sets to MVCT simulation scans and compare&#xD;
      the accuracy to the same pre-contoured diagnostic image sets co-registered to kilovoltage CT&#xD;
      (kVCT) simulation images and then kVCT simulation to MVCT scan co-registration, B) optimize&#xD;
      CT-detector-based exit dose measurement algorithms for quality assurance and compare to&#xD;
      standard of care phantom-based quality assurance, C) optimize the accuracy of an in-house&#xD;
      real time infrared tracking system for intrafractional patient position monitoring to ensure&#xD;
      accurate patient treatment. The investigators hypothesize that these new components will&#xD;
      provide effective and efficient methods for treatment planning, quality assurance, and&#xD;
      patient position monitoring that can be used in a future 30 minute Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT&#xD;
      workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The investigators will recruit 30 cancer patients with 1-3 painful osseous&#xD;
      metastatic lesions (target sites) who are candidates for palliative radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Patients will receive 1-5 fractions of 5-8 Gray (Gy) (minimum biologic effective dose of 25&#xD;
      Gy) of conformal radiation therapy delivered to the target sites via the Helical TomoTherapy&#xD;
      system using the STAT RT workflow. Data will be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      our novel image co-registration techniques, CT-detector-based exit dose calculations, and&#xD;
      infrared patient position monitoring. These novel techniques for image co-registration,&#xD;
      radiation dose calculations, and patient position monitoring will not alter or replace&#xD;
      standard of care techniques. Using validated surveys the investigators will record patient&#xD;
      pain, analgesic use, function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction prior to treatment&#xD;
      and at 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after therapy.&#xD;
      Radiation-induced treatment related toxicities will be captured during treatment and at the&#xD;
      above time points.&#xD;
