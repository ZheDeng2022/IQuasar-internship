      Participants 60 Patients seeking treatment at the Obesity Unit of the Medica Sur Hospital in&#xD;
      MÃ©xico City, Mexico. Informed consent to participate will be aleatory assigned to a three&#xD;
      different conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures In the initial interview, prospective participants will be provided with detailed&#xD;
      information about the study and the treatments. All patients included in the study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the one (N=20) of the three treatment conditions described below, all&#xD;
      conducted on an inpatient basis. The duration for all treatments will be 6 weeks and will be&#xD;
      administered by two chartered clinical psychologists and one chartered psychotherapist under&#xD;
      the supervision of a senior chartered psychotherapist. The three therapists will be balanced&#xD;
      among the three conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nutritional groups In this condition (NT) the participants (N=20) subjects enter only 5&#xD;
           weekly nutritional groups held by dieticians based on the LEARN manual (Brownell, 1985),&#xD;
           whose goal will be to provide practical guidelines for the self-monitoring of eating and&#xD;
           lessons on nutrition (e.g stressing gradual weight loss with the caloric restriction&#xD;
           achieved largely by reductions in fat intake), plus a low-calorie diet (1,200 kcal/day)&#xD;
           and physical training (30 min of walking two times a week as a minimum).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive-Behavioral therapy CBT group (N=20) will be based on the same treatment&#xD;
           proposed in the first condition plus 15 additional sessions over 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therapists will follow a detailed manual that outlined the content of each session. This&#xD;
           manual was based on the cognitive-behavioral treatment approach described by Cooper and&#xD;
           colleagues (Cooper &amp; Fairburn, 2002; Cooper et al., 2003). It was developed during a&#xD;
           year of intensive pilot work and adapted to the in-patient setting. Patients will be&#xD;
           taught to self-monitor their food intake and eating patterns and thoughts, as well as&#xD;
           the circumstances and environment surrounding eating (e.g. whether eating alone or with&#xD;
           others, speed of eating, and place of eating). Patients will also be taught to identify&#xD;
           problems in eating, mood, and thinking patterns and to gradually develop alternative&#xD;
           patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In particular, after the first week the patients will enter 5 weekly group sessions&#xD;
           aimed at addressing weight and primary goals, and 10 biweekly individual sessions aimed&#xD;
           at establishing and maintaining weight loss, addressing barriers to weight loss,&#xD;
           increasing activity, addressing body image concerns and supporting weight maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Experiential Cognitive therapy Experiential CT group (N=4) involved the same treatment&#xD;
           proposed in the first condition plus 15 additional sessions over 4/6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the sessions we will use the &quot;20/20/20 rule&quot;. During the first 20 minutes, the therapist&#xD;
      focus on getting a clear understanding of the patient's current concerns, level of general&#xD;
      functioning, and the experiences related to food. This part of the session tends to be&#xD;
      characterized by patients doing most of the talking, although therapist guides with questions&#xD;
      and reflection to get a sense of the patient's current status. The second 20 minutes is&#xD;
      devoted to the virtual reality experience. During this part of the session the patient enters&#xD;
      the virtual environment and faces a specific critical situation (Kitchen, Supermarket, Pub,&#xD;
      Restaurant, Gymnasium, etc.). Here the patient is helped in developing specific strategies&#xD;
      for avoiding and/or coping with it. In the final 20 minutes the therapist explores the&#xD;
      patient's understanding of what happened in VR and the specific reactions - emotional and&#xD;
      behavioral - to the different situations experienced. If needed, some new strategies for&#xD;
      coping with the VR situations are presented and discussed. To support the empowerment&#xD;
      process, the therapists follow the Socratic style: they use a series of questions, related to&#xD;
      the contents of the virtual environment, to help clients synthesize information and reach&#xD;
      conclusions on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with informed consent, assessments will be obtained before treatment, at&#xD;
      posttreatment, 3 and 6 months after the treatment conclusion.&#xD;

      In the initial interview, prospective participants will be provided with detailed information&#xD;
      about the study and the treatments. All patients included in the study will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the waiting-list group and to the one of the three treatment conditions described&#xD;
      below, all conducted on an inpatient basis. The duration for all treatments will be 6 weeks&#xD;
      and will bw administered by two chartered clinical psychologists and one chartered&#xD;
      psychotherapist under the supervision of a senior chartered psychotherapist. The three&#xD;
      therapists will bw balanced among the three conditions. In accordance with informed consent,&#xD;
      assessments will be obtained before treatment, at posttreatment, 3 and 6 months follow up&#xD;
      after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Nutritional groups In this condition (NT) the subjects enter only 5 weekly nutritional&#xD;
      groups held by dieticians based on the LEARN manual (Brownell, 1985), whose goal will be to&#xD;
      provide practical guidelines for the self-monitoring of eating and lessons on nutrition (e.g&#xD;
      stressing gradual weight loss with the caloric restriction achieved largely by reductions in&#xD;
      fat intake), plus a low-calorie diet (1,200 kcal/day) and physical training (30 min of&#xD;
      walking two times a week as a minimum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Cognitive-Behavioral therapy CBT will be based on the same treatment proposed in the first&#xD;
      condition plus 15 additional sessions over 6 weeks. Therapists will follow a detailed manual&#xD;
      that outlined the content of each session. This manual was based on the cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      treatment approach described by Cooper and colleagues (Cooper &amp; Fairburn, 2002; Cooper et&#xD;
      al., 2003). It was developed during a year of intensive pilot work and adapted to the&#xD;
      in-patient setting. Patients will be taught to self-monitor their food intake and eating&#xD;
      patterns and thoughts, as well as the circumstances and environment surrounding eating (e.g.&#xD;
      whether eating alone or with others, speed of eating, and place of eating). Patients will&#xD;
      also be taught to identify problems in eating, mood, and thinking patterns and to gradually&#xD;
      develop alternative patterns. In particular, after the first week the patients will enter 5&#xD;
      weekly group sessions aimed at addressing weight and primary goals, and 10 biweekly&#xD;
      individual sessions aimed at establishing and maintaining weight loss, addressing barriers to&#xD;
      weight loss, increasing activity, addressing body image concerns and supporting weight&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Experiential Cognitive therapy In particular, after the first week the patients entered 5&#xD;
      weekly group sessions aimed at improving motivation to change and assertiveness, and 10&#xD;
      biweekly virtual reality sessions. For the VR sessions, the NeuroVR 1.5 software will be&#xD;
      used. NeuroVR is an enhanced version of the original Virtual Reality for Body Image&#xD;
      Modification (VEBIM) immersive virtual environment, previously used in different preliminary&#xD;
      studies on non-clinical subjects (Riva, 1997a, 1998b). Is composed of 14 virtual&#xD;
      environments, used by the therapist within a 60-minute session with the patient. The&#xD;
      environments present critical situations related to the maintaining/relapse mechanisms (Home,&#xD;
      Supermarket, Pub, Restaurant, Swimming Pool, Beach, Gymnasium) and two body image comparison&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the NeuroVR Editor, the psychological stimuli/stressors appropriate for any given&#xD;
      scenario can be chosen from a rich database of 2D and 3D objects, and easily placed into the&#xD;
      pre-designed virtual scenario by using an icon-based interface (no programming skills are&#xD;
      required). In addition to static objects, the NeuroVR Editor allows both to add audio object&#xD;
      and to overlay on the 3D scene video composited with a transparent alpha channel.The editing&#xD;
      of the scene is performed in real time, and effects of changes can be checked from different&#xD;
      views (frontal, lateral and top).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The edited scene is then visualized and experienced using the NeuroVR Player. Through the VR&#xD;
      experience, the patients practice both eating/emotional/relational management and general&#xD;
      decision-making and problem-solving skills. By directly practicing these skills within the VR&#xD;
      environment, the patient is helped in developing specific strategies for avoiding and/or&#xD;
      coping with these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 sessions are used to assess and modify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the expectations and emotions related to food and weight: This is done both by&#xD;
           integrating different cognitive-behavioral methods: Countering, Alternative&#xD;
           Interpretation, Label Shifting, Deactivating the Illness Belief&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the strategies used to cope with difficult interpersonal and potential maintenance&#xD;
           situations: This is done both by using the Temptation Exposure with Response Prevention&#xD;
           (Riva, 1998c; D. G. Schlundt &amp; Johnson, 1990) - and by working on these three empowering&#xD;
           dimensions (Menon, 1999): perceived control, perceived competence and goal&#xD;
           internalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the body experience of the subject. To do this the virtual environment integrates the&#xD;
           therapeutic methods used by Butter &amp; Cash (1987) and Wooley &amp; Wooley (1985). In&#xD;
           particular in VREDIM we used the virtual environment in the same way as guided imagery&#xD;
           (Leuner, 1969) is used in the cognitive and visual/motorial approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure of the sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session of Virtual Reality is divided into four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychologist's office is the first virtual experience. It represents the start and the&#xD;
      end of each session, and it has the important function to outline boundaries of the session&#xD;
      in virtual reality. It is a neutral and reassuring place which allows continuity in the&#xD;
      phases of the individual session: face to face, virtual reality and face to face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the psychologist's office there are the following objects: a writing-desk with two&#xD;
      comfortable chairs, a bookshelf and complements of furnishings that make the environment more&#xD;
      comfortable and hospitable (pictures, carpets, lamps, green plants, etc.). The safe place is&#xD;
      the virtual experience for the relaxation that is used at the end of each session and, if&#xD;
      needed, during the session of virtual reality. It is an empty park in which the patient can&#xD;
      relax and recover from any emotional experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the psychologist's office and the safe place the patient experiences one or more&#xD;
      specific virtual experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with informed consent, assessments will be obtained before treatment, at&#xD;
      posttreatment, 3 and 6 months after the treatment conclusion.&#xD;

    <description>Is a relatively short-term, integrated, patient oriented approach that focuses on individual discovery (Riva, Bacchetta, Baruffi, Rinaldi, &amp; Molinari, 1998, 1999; Riva et al., 2000). It shares with the cognitive-behavioral approach proposed by Cooper and colleagues the use of a combination of cognitive and behavioral procedures to help the patient identify and change the maintaining mechanisms (Cooper et al., 2003). However, it considers morbid obesity as a peculiar form of addiction. So, as in the cognitive-behavioral treatment of addictions (Carroll et al., 1994) the two main goals are the functional analysis of the maintaining mechanisms and the required skill training (relapse prevention).</description>
