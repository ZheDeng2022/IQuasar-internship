  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the anti-anginal and anti-ischemic effect of k-channel opener,&#xD;
      nicorandil in patients of chronic stable angina.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used for the diagnosis and risk&#xD;
      assessment of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Also, MPI lends&#xD;
      itself to monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions such as anti-ischemic&#xD;
      medications, gene therapy, and various percutaneous and surgical revascularization&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of nitrates, potassium channel activators, calcium-channel blockers, and&#xD;
      beta-blockers on myocardial perfusion imaging are likely attributable to changes in&#xD;
      myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio. The major anti-ischemic&#xD;
      effect of BBs is a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption both at rest and during stress.&#xD;
      Beta-blockers decrease myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and myocardial contractility. They also prolong diastole, therefore increasing&#xD;
      coronary perfusion time. The effect of chronic atenolol use on dipyridamole SPECT MPI was&#xD;
      assessed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study that showed no difference in the&#xD;
      perfusion defect size and severity between placebo and atenolol for the group as a whole,&#xD;
      although one-third of patients had larger defects on atenolol than placebo. Bridges et al.,&#xD;
      1992 (56)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicorandil, a potassium channel activator, when given for 3 weeks exhibited significant&#xD;
      improvement in myocardial perfusion in both MI and angina patients, on exercise thallium&#xD;
      scan. Yamazaki et al., 1993 (69).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atenolol as shown in the cross over study does not affect myocardial perfusion significantly&#xD;
      and hence combination therapy with nicorandil will help us to determine a significant benefit&#xD;
      of nicorandil on MP. Results will be analyzed from base line in the same arm and the&#xD;
      difference will be further compared with control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines suggest beta blockers as first line of therapy. To assess the anti ischemic&#xD;
      effects of nicorandil, combination therapy with atenolol will be compared with atenolol&#xD;
      alone. Since atenolol effect on MP is insignificant an added advantage of nicorandil can be&#xD;
      evaluated in comparative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to assess the anti ischemic effect of nicorandil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to compare the anti ischemic effect over 4 weeks period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in perfusion will be evaluated in each arm at week 4 and comparison between the two&#xD;
      study arms will be made to document the anti ischemic effects of nicorandil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy variables of the study are the difference of the following endpoints from&#xD;
      the baseline at week 4 and comparison between control and study arm using Ex- SPECT MPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy variables of the study are the difference of the following endpoints from&#xD;
      the baseline and comparison between control and study arm using ETT Bruce Protocol at week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the anti anginal effect and safety of&#xD;
      Nicorandil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, randomized controlled pilot study. Sponsor of this study is Ferozsons&#xD;
      Labs. Ltd. All participating patients must sign a written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients with proven CAD having at least one reversible or partially reversible&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion defects on MPI SPECT - Tc-99m and functional class I &amp; II of CSA, and&#xD;
      laboratory values within predefined safety limits will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chief exclusion criteria include presence of only fixed perfusion defects, CSA functional&#xD;
      class III and IV and prior revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 patients will be enrolled in the study, 20 patients in each arm). Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive beta blocker in combination with nicorandil&#xD;
      (experiment arm) or beta blocker (control arm) for four weeks until unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicorandil dose will be titrated from 10mg bd for 7days to 20mg bd for next 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Concurrent therapy for angina attacks will be allowed to be used with study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have treadmill exercise using Bruce protocol. At peak exercise, 10-15 mCi&#xD;
      of technetium - 99m tetrofosmin is injected and patient will exercise an additional 1 to 2&#xD;
      minutes.. Stress SPECT images will be acquired beginning 15 to 45 minutes after the&#xD;
      completion of treadmill stress. At rest 30 mCi of technetium-99m tetrofosmin will be injected&#xD;
      and SPECT images will be acquired using same protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study monitoring at the centre will be provided by the sponsor&#xD;
