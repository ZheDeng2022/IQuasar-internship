    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show the safety and efficacy of the SeQuent® Please (Drug Eluting&#xD;
      Balloon or DEB) vs. commonly used Drug Eluting Stents in the treatment of small vessel&#xD;
      disease and side branches by pressure wire guided percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, prospective, multi-center, efficacy study with a DES control&#xD;
      group assessing the 6-month loss in FFR in patients treated with the &quot;matrix coated&#xD;
      paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon catheter&quot; SeQuent® Please and commonly used DES for small&#xD;
      vessel de novo and side branch lesions. 100 patients will be studied in total with two&#xD;
      equivalent treatment groups DEB &amp; DES of 50 patients each.&#xD;
