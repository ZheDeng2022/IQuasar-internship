      The study's primary objective is to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on pain and&#xD;
      plasma interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and substance P in patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives: evaluate the clinical manifestations, and plasma concentration of&#xD;
      lidocaine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a painful syndrome characterized by chronic diffuse pain and involvement of&#xD;
      multiple muscles and soft tissues 1. The pain is very common, with prevalence around 2% in&#xD;
      the adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fibromyalgia, there is an increase of both somatic and visceral nociception, and&#xD;
      dysfunction of central nervous.system According to the American College of Rheumathology&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are widespread pain and the presence of 11 of 18 typical&#xD;
      tender points 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor criteria in the inclusion of patients for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, such as pain&#xD;
      that changes with physical activity, sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      paresthesia, cramps, sensation of swelling 4. Several co-morbidities may be associated with&#xD;
      pain such as migraine, myofascial pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symmetry of these conditions shows that fibromyalgia is associated with central&#xD;
      sensitization 5. The pathophysiological mechanisms of fibromyalgia are related to changes in&#xD;
      neurotransmitters 6,7,8. Cytokines may be involved in modulation of symptoms such as&#xD;
      hyperalgesia, fatigue and depression, and maintenance of sympathetic pain 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ] The substance P ( SP ) levels are increased in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia compared to control groups 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressants are the most widely used drugs for its treatment. The drug most commonly used&#xD;
      is amitriptyline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other drugs (muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, tramadol) are also employed. Physical&#xD;
      activity is essential to control the symptoms. Physical measures, psychotherapy, occupational&#xD;
      therapy are other treatments, but the effectiveness is variable 14.15. Sometimes a&#xD;
      combination of drugs and techniques are needed to obtain satisfactory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion of local anesthetic is given intravenously for fibromyalgia when oral medication&#xD;
      does not produce the proper effect. It promotes sympathetic blockade, vasodilation,&#xD;
      anesthesia of the nerve endings in the vascular endothelium, stabilization of membrane and&#xD;
      breaks the vicious circle that keeps pain 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthetics are membrane-stabilizing and prevent the generation of ectopic impulses in&#xD;
      lower concentrations than those needed to block the normal driving. The dose used by&#xD;
      different authors ranged from 1 to 5 mg / kg, administered in 30-60 minutes 17-24. Side&#xD;
      effects of lidocaine are: sedation, vertigo, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine in neuropathic pain is well established 26.&#xD;
      Despite evidence of analgesic effect, there is controversy in conditions without nerve&#xD;
      injury. It may be that the selectivity of the effect for non-neuropathic and neuropathic pain&#xD;
      is relative and depends on the plasma concentration reached25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the use of systemic lidocaine in fibromyalgia, there are no well-controlled studies, and&#xD;
      to assess changes of cytokines and substance P, which stimulated this research.&#xD;
