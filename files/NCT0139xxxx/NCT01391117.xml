  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine in genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-infected&#xD;
      participants, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the&#xD;
      body, how it is distributed within the body and removed from the body over time) and&#xD;
      antiviral activity of repeated doses of TMC649128 given as monotherapy and given in&#xD;
      combination with pegylated interferon + ribavirin. We assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (how the study medication affects the body) (PK/PD)&#xD;
      relationship for antiviral activity, active metabolite and safety of TMC649128 and its&#xD;
      metabolites. We determine the short term safety and tolerability of the co-administration of&#xD;
      TMC649128 and pegylated interferon + ribavirin during multiple dosing for 14 days in&#xD;
      treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected participants. We explore the effect of pegylated&#xD;
      interferon + ribavirin on the pharmacokinetics of TMC649128 during the multiple dosing for 14&#xD;
      days in treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected participants. We also assess in a preliminary&#xD;
      way the short term antiviral effect of the combination of TMC649128 with pegylated interferon&#xD;
      + ribavirin during a 14-day dosing period in treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMC649128 is a nucleoside inhibitor (NI) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase in development&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. Treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected&#xD;
      participants are participants who have never received (pegylated) interferon ([Peg]IFN),&#xD;
      ribavirin (RBV) or any other approved or investigational treatment for chronic HCV infection.&#xD;
      Treatment-experienced genotype 1 HCV-infected participants are defined as previous&#xD;
      non-responder and relapse subjects to previous treatment regimens (IFN/RBV or PegIFN/RBV),&#xD;
      who have never received a HCV polymerase inhibitor and HCV protease inhibitor treatment was&#xD;
      stopped since at least one year. This study is a Phase Ib, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in genotype 1 HCV-infected participants to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of repeated doses of TMC649128 given as&#xD;
      monotherapy and given in combination with pegylated interferon + ribavirin. This trial&#xD;
      consists of 2 phases. In the first phase TMC649128 will be given as monotherapy during 10&#xD;
      days at different doses and dosing regimens. In the second phase TMC649128 will be&#xD;
      administered at one selected dose regimen in combination with PegIFN a-2a/RBV for 14 days.;&#xD;
      All dosages of TMC649128 or placebo are given orally under fed conditions.; The monotherapy&#xD;
      phase includes 3 panels (panel 1-3) and the combination therapy phase includes 1 panel (panel&#xD;
      4). In panel 1, subjects are randomly assigned to receive TMC649128 at 1000 mg q24h (every&#xD;
      24h) (n=8) or placebo (n=2) q24h on Days 1-10. In panel 2 subjects are randomized into Arm 1&#xD;
      and Arm 2 and within each arm, subjects are randomly assigned to receive TMC649128 or placebo&#xD;
      as follows: In arm 1 volunteers receive TMC649128 at a selected dose (n=8) or placebo (n=2)&#xD;
      q12h on Days 1-10. In arm 2 volunteers receive TMC649128 at a selected dose (n=8) or placebo&#xD;
      (n=2) q24h on Days 1-10. Panel 3: TMC649128 at a selected dose (n=8) or placebo (n=2) q12h&#xD;
      (every 12h) OR q24h on Days 1-10 where the assignment is determined by randomization; Panel 4&#xD;
      volunteers are randomized into Arm 1 and Arm 2. In panel 4, arm 1, 10 volunteers receive&#xD;
      placebo (q12h OR q24h, dosing regimen matched to Arm 2 of Panel 4) + PegIFN a-2a/RBV on Days&#xD;
      1-14. In Panel 4, arm 2, 10 volunteers receive TMC649128 at a selected dose (q12h OR q24h) +&#xD;
      PegIFN a-2a/RBV on Days 1-14.; The actual dose of Panel 1 is derived from data obtained from&#xD;
      the currently ongoing MC649128HPC1001 trial. The actual dose in Panel 2 will depend on the&#xD;
      results of Panel 1 (total daily dose of TMC649128 administered in both arms of Panel 2 will&#xD;
      be the same. The dose of TMC649128 of the q24h regimen in Arm 2 will be higher than the q24h&#xD;
      dose administered in Panel 1 [1000 mg q24h]). The actual doses and dose regimens in Panels 3&#xD;
      and 4 will depend on the results of Panels 1 and 2 (data review meetings). Selection of doses&#xD;
      and dose regimens in Panels 2, 3 and 4 will also depend on the data obtained from trial&#xD;
      TMC649128HPC1001. Dosing will stay within the exposure limits. The intended doses for Panels&#xD;
      2 and 3 are 2000 mg or 3000 mg q12h or q24h, but may be adapted based on previous clinical&#xD;
      data. If needed and based on the outcome of the Panel 1 results, subjects in Panel 3 may&#xD;
      eventually receive a lower dose than in Panel 1. See detailed study description.&#xD;
