    <textblock>
      Today's hospitals need innovative solutions to help patients transition from our care to&#xD;
      self-management at home. The vast majority of the patients seen in Dodd Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital and associated clinics leave our care with persistent and life-altering challenges -&#xD;
      behavioral, cognitive, emotional and/or physical. The period of time immediately following&#xD;
      discharge is an under-addressed stage within the continuum of care. The investigators are&#xD;
      researching solutions to help patients in this transition to self-care and believe that&#xD;
      multiplayer gaming paradigms may be a promising innovation to facilitate this transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that Dr. Jane McGonigal's SuperBetter, and positive play games like&#xD;
      it, are promising novel interventions that could make a positive difference in the ability of&#xD;
      our patients to successfully transition to self care after discharge from therapeutic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will evaluate feasibility of use of such a game by mild to&#xD;
      moderate brain injured individuals and to record pilot data to help us plan a clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness follow up study. Our goal is to finish this study with an intervention tailored&#xD;
      for use within the clinical continuum of care and sufficient pilot data to prepare for a&#xD;
      randomized clinical control trial of this intervention.&#xD;

      Today's hospitals need innovative solutions to help patients transition from our care to&#xD;
      self-management at home. The vast majority of the patients seen in Dodd Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital and associated clinics leave our care with persistent and life-altering challenges -&#xD;
      behavioral, cognitive, emotional and/or physical. The period of time immediately following&#xD;
      discharge is an under-addressed stage within the continuum of care. The investigators are&#xD;
      researching solutions to help patients in this transition to self-care and believe that&#xD;
      multiplayer gaming paradigms may be a promising innovation to facilitate this transition for&#xD;
      several reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Games can bring the power of social networks and alternate reality to bear on the real&#xD;
           world work of post-injury self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Games can use a digital platform, enabling quantification of performance in ways that&#xD;
           could provide clinically-relevant documentation for post-discharge follow up efforts&#xD;
           including tele-rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Today's youth are gamers. The investigators aim to tailor our rehabilitative approaches&#xD;
           to leverage the existing ability of our youth in this paradigm. In addition, Dr. Jane&#xD;
           McGonigal reports in her book, Reality is Broken, that within another decade the&#xD;
           majority of the world's population will likely be gamers. The investigators aim to&#xD;
           anticipate this shift and be ready for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Affordable games have the potential to be cost-effective aids and improvements over&#xD;
           standard medical care protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the promise of games to facilitate transitions from hospital care to self care, no&#xD;
      clinical studies have been done to establish best practices for applying gaming for&#xD;
      rehabilitative purposes within the specific window of time in which discharge from standard&#xD;
      care happens. While some commercially available games exist for those interested in health&#xD;
      self-improvement, through companies such as That Game Company, Nintendo, Xbox, only the&#xD;
      Nintendo Wii system has undergone clinical testing to demonstrate feasibility of use within&#xD;
      the hospital-based model of patient care. Without more such evidence, the investigators are&#xD;
      unable to confidently offer such novel interventions for our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new game, SuperBetter (SuperBetter, LLC, Sausilito, CA), has been developed to employ both&#xD;
      social networking and alternate reality theory to achieve rehabilitative goals. SuperBetter&#xD;
      is most similar to Facebook or Twitter in that users, or &quot;gamers&quot;, create an account, invite&#xD;
      others to be within their network, and post short status update messages. There are two major&#xD;
      differences between SuperBetter and Twitter or Facebook, however. One difference is that this&#xD;
      rehabilitation game will not offer a public option. The only people who can see a user's&#xD;
      posts and status updates will have been specifically invited by that gamer; people outside&#xD;
      the invited network will have no ability to &quot;friend&quot; a gamer, meaning there is no way to&#xD;
      request to become part of a user's network - you must be invited by the account holder. The&#xD;
      second difference is that SuperBetter assigns points to a gamer for attaining health goals&#xD;
      such as: remembering to take medications each day; avoiding circumstances that exacerbate&#xD;
      symptoms; checking in with someone within your trusted network (i.e. reaching out to your&#xD;
      loved ones for support). Points are also assigned for &quot;epic wins&quot; which are defined by the&#xD;
      patient and amount to things he or she cannot do today but want to be able to do tomorrow;&#xD;
      this includes short term wins like hanging out with friends/loved ones or long term wins like&#xD;
      getting back to playing sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that McGonigal's SuperBetter, and positive play games like it, are&#xD;
      promising novel interventions that could make a positive difference in the ability of our&#xD;
      patients to successfully transition to self care after discharge from therapeutic care. The&#xD;
      investigators are conducting Phase I clinical testing (feasibility) to determine whether such&#xD;
      a rehabilitation game is appropriate for use with: mild traumatic brain injured children and&#xD;
      teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will evaluate feasibility of use of such a game by mild&#xD;
      traumatic brain injured individuals and to record pilot data to help us plan a clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness follow up study. Our goal is to finish this study with an intervention tailored&#xD;
      for use within the clinical continuum of care and sufficient pilot data to prepare for a&#xD;
      randomized clinical control trial of this intervention.&#xD;

          <title>Number of participants with Sports Concussion Assessment Tool-3 (SCAT-3)Symptoms Score &gt; 1</title>
          <description>The SCAT-3 is patient-reported outcome measure. Participants rate the severity level at which they are experiencing 22-items, that represent specific concussion symptoms. Severity per item ranges from 0 (none) to 6 (severe) at time of ecological momentary assessment. Scores are summed such that 0 corresponds to no symptoms, while 132 corresponds to severe incidence of all 22 items (i.e., worst presentation imaginable). Inclusion criteria for enrollment = a score of greater than 1.</description>
