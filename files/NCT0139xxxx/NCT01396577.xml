        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male or female subjects, age 18 to 55 years old, inclusive, at Screening&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are taking any prescribed or over-the-counter drug or herbal remedies in&#xD;

             greater than 2 weeks]) with the exception of acetaminophen (up to 4 g/day), which is&#xD;
             allowed up to 12 hours prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have taken St John's Wort or other dietary aids known to induce CYP3A4&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who have taken any inhibitor of CYP450 within 2 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing (e.g., grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruit-containing beverages, apple or&#xD;
             Seville orange products)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have received any experimental drug within the 12 weeks leading up to the&#xD;
             start of study drug treatment or who are currently enrolled in another clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol abuse within the 6 months prior&#xD;
             to Screening or who have a positive urine drug test or breath alcohol test at&#xD;
             Screening or Baseline, or who are unwilling to abstain from consumption of alcohol&#xD;
             throughout the periods of in-patient confinement&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who consume more than 5 caffeinated beverages per day (e.g., 5 cups of tea,&#xD;
             coffee or cans of cola) or who are unwilling to abstain from consumption of&#xD;
             caffeine-containing food and beverages throughout the periods of in-patient&#xD;
             confinement&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who smoke more than 5 cigarettes (or equivalent amount of tobacco) per day or&#xD;
             who are unwilling to abstain from the use of nicotine-containing products throughout&#xD;
             the period of in-patient confinement&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who have a history of drug abuse or dependence or have a positive result from&#xD;
             a urine drug screening test&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of child-bearing potential who do not agree to use 2 methods of adequate&#xD;
             contraception (e.g., intrauterine device, barrier methods with spermicide) throughout&#xD;
             the study and for 30 days after study drug administration&#xD;
