      This study involves collaboration between McLean Hospital, Geriatric Medicine at the&#xD;
      Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) and other sites within the Partners and Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School network. The investigators plan to recruit individuals 55 to 89 years old with&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression. Someone with &quot;treatment resistant&quot; depression for this study&#xD;
      may be someone who still has sad or low feelings and thoughts even though he/she is taking an&#xD;
      antidepressant medication for at least 8 weeks to help relieve his/her depression. During the&#xD;
      study, subjects will gradually add memantine hydrochloride in dosages up to 20 mg/day for 8&#xD;
      weeks to their standard antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are doing this research study to help answer 3 questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do older adults with treatment resistant Major Depression have lower levels of a&#xD;
           chemical in the brain called NAAG than older adults without Major Depression?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do older adults with naturally low NAAG levels do better on memantine hydrochloride&#xD;
           treatment than older adults with higher amounts of this chemical on memantine&#xD;
           hydrochloride treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do older adults with treatment resistant depression have more problems with memory and&#xD;
           concentration than older adults without depression?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are also interested in looking at electrical and neuronal activity of the&#xD;
      brain, spiritual beliefs, and fatigue in relationship to depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Older individuals with treatment resistant Major Depression will have lower levels of&#xD;
           NAAG compared with age-matched older control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Older adults with treatment resistant depression and low NAAG levels will do better on&#xD;
           treatment with memantine hydrochloride than older adults on memantine with higher NAAG&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Older adults with depression will do better on tests of attention and executive&#xD;
           functioning after treatment with memantine hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Healthy controls will do better on tests of attention and executive functioning than&#xD;
           older adults with depression.&#xD;

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll up to 20 subjects with major depression, ages 55-89, and up to 20 healthy&#xD;
      control subjects, ages 55-89 matched with depression group for age, sex, and ethnicity. We&#xD;
      require 10 subjects in each group to have completed the study protocol with clinical and MRI&#xD;
      scan data suitable for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups will be recruited from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) geriatric medicine group practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mount Auburn Outpatient programs and affiliates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Outpatient programs and affiliates&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  McLean Hospital Geriatric Psychiatry Research Program's research studies, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who have completed participation in treatment or non-treatment studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who are actively participating in non-treatment research studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      One site (McLean Hospital) is engaged in this protocol. CHA and other sites only refer&#xD;
      subjects to McLean and do not consent subjects or complete any study protocol procedures.&#xD;
      Subjects must meet all selection criteria in order to participate in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete a brief pre-screening interview over the phone or in person in&#xD;
      order to assess their preliminary eligibility for study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing consent, all study subjects will follow the same screening period (with the&#xD;
      exceptions for control subjects mentioned below). Screening procedures include a clinical&#xD;
      diagnostic interview, medical monitoring, physical exam, collecting information regarding&#xD;
      prior and concomitant medication and adverse events, blood draw, vital signs, height, and&#xD;
      weight, demographic and clinical history information, as well as assessments of daily&#xD;
      functioning, mood, anxiety, and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 / Baseline (Week 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression subjects will return to the office after the completion of screening procedures&#xD;
      (within 14 days of signing consent) to complete baseline procedures which include assessments&#xD;
      of daily functioning, fatigue, mood, anxiety, medical monitoring, psychiatric interview,&#xD;
      concomitant medications, adverse events, vitals, 3T scan, EEG with resting state and Flanker&#xD;
      Task procedures (prior to receiving study medication), spirituality questionnaire, and urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test (if applicable). Neuropsychological tests will also be completed at this&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No changes in psychotropic drugs will be allowed for depression subjects during this the&#xD;
      screening period before study drug is administered. The subjects with depression will be&#xD;
      administered (before leaving the office) memantine HCl 5 mg tablets. All depression subjects&#xD;
      will start at a dose of 5 mg once per day in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Week 1) and Visit 4 (Week 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of Visit 2, the subject will return to the office for 2 visits in 2&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. A psychiatric interview, review concomitant medications and AEs (if any),&#xD;
      mood and anxiety scales, monitoring of medication tolerability and compliance, vital sign&#xD;
      collection will be completed at these visits. Study medication will be dispensed and&#xD;
      depression subjects will be instructed according to the dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 (Week 4) and 6 (Week 6):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing Visit 4, subjects will return to the office 2 weeks later for Visit 5 (Week&#xD;
      4) and then 2 weeks after that for Visit 6 (Week 6). The same visit procedures will be&#xD;
      completed at these visits as Visits 3 and 4, except the subject will not meet with the study&#xD;
      psychiatrist at Visit 6 (Week 6). Subjects may complete Visit 6 in person or over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7 (Week 8) Final Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 8 weeks on study medication, the subject will return to the office for the&#xD;
      final study visit. This visit will complete the same procedures as Visits 3 through 6 with&#xD;
      the addition of another 3T scan (with a negative urine pregnancy test, if applicable), EEG&#xD;
      (with resting state and Flanker Task) and neuropsychological tests. Participants will also&#xD;
      repeat spirituality and fatigue questionnaires with assistance from study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to return all study medication for the final visit. At this time&#xD;
      subjects will have the option of staying on the medication or tapering off study medication&#xD;
      and being referred to the McLean Hospital Geriatric Outpatient Clinic for follow up or to an&#xD;
      appropriate physician of their choice. We will share information regarding study&#xD;
      participation and results with the subjects' primary care physician and/or other entities&#xD;
      only if the subject has completed an &quot;Authorization for Release of Medical Records&quot; form. If&#xD;
      the subjects chose to discontinue treatment with memantine HCl, the psychiatrist (BPF) will&#xD;
      instruct subjects how to safely taper off study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Subject Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening, control subjects will return to the office for 3 visits. Unlike the&#xD;
      depression group, the control group will NOT receive the study drug memantine HCl. Control&#xD;
      subjects are not scheduled to meet with the study psychiatrist at the Baseline Week 0 and&#xD;
      Week 8 visits and complete blood draw and one of the neuropsychological tests during&#xD;
      participation. Other than the exceptions previously mentioned, control subjects will follow&#xD;
      the same protocol as the depression subjects for the screening period, Baseline (Week 0), and&#xD;
      Week 8 Visit. Study staff will monitor adverse events (if any occur), use of concomitant&#xD;
      medication (if any), and subject safety throughout study participation. Vital signs will also&#xD;
      be collected at every visit. Mood measures, spirituality and fatigue questionnaires, and&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests identical to those administered to the depression group will be&#xD;
      completed during the Week 8 final visit. Controls will also complete the same 3T MRI scanning&#xD;
      protocol as depression subjects. Controls also have the opportunity to participate in EEG&#xD;
      acquisition at baseline and study endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to contact enrolled subjects after the last subject completes the study per protocol&#xD;
      and the data has been analyzed. This follow-up correspondence will consist of at least 3&#xD;
      attempts to contact subjects' by phone and 1 certified letter sharing our research findings&#xD;
      with subjects.&#xD;
