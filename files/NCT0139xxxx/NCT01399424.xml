      The active ingredient of this Shigella sonnei O-SP-core conjugate vaccine is a&#xD;
      saccharide-protein conjugate composed of a fragment of S. sonnei LPS. The saccharide&#xD;
      component consists of an average of 3.5 repeat units of the O-SP plus the core region of the&#xD;
      LPS (O-SPC). The O-SPC is covalently bound to the non-toxic recombinant diphtheria toxin&#xD;
      mutant (rDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this phase of the study is to determine if this vaccine is safe and can&#xD;
      induce IgG antibody type-specific immunity to shigellosis in adults. The overall objective is&#xD;
      to determine if this vaccine can elicit higher levels of IgG antibody than the previous&#xD;
      experimental vaccines made with the full length O-SP, shown to be &gt; 70% efficacious in&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 3 year old children. Higher levels of IgG anti O-SP are expected to&#xD;
      induce type specific immunity to shigellosis in younger children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty 18-49 years-old healthy adults will be recruited in Israel. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      vaccinated on a random basis with one i.m. injection of 10 or 25 ug of the investigational&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine. Local and systemic reactions will be observed at 30 minutes, and the&#xD;
      volunteers will be instructed to take their temperature and examine the injection site for&#xD;
      redness and swelling and fill out a questionnaire at 6, hours and daily for 7 days after&#xD;
      vaccination. The volunteers will visit the clinic at 24 or 48 hours following the injection&#xD;
      and any time they request it. The study will commence with 5 volunteers injected with the&#xD;
      10ug dose to be followed, if no severe adverse reactions occur, by 5 volunteers injected with&#xD;
      the 25ug dose. If a severe adverse reaction occurs on 1 of the 5 volunteers in either group,&#xD;
      5 more will be injected with that dose. If there are no severe adverse reactions the study&#xD;
      will proceed. If there is one more severe reaction the study will be halted and re-evaluated&#xD;
      by the IRB and the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine-induced antibodies will be measured at 1 and 6 months after immunization, and&#xD;
      compared to those elicited by our previous S. sonnei conjugate vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a body of evidence that a critical level of serum IgG antibody to the O-specific&#xD;
      polysaccharide domain of LPS confers type-specific immunity to S. sonnei as well as to other&#xD;
      Shigella:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Shigellosis is rarely observed in infants up to the age of 4-6 months. The most obvious&#xD;
           explanation for this is that maternally-derived serum IgG provides this immunity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is an age-related development of IgG anti-LPS antibodies that, in many instances,&#xD;
           is not induced by the homologous bacteria but by non-pathogenic cross-reacting enteric&#xD;
           bacteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The highest incidence, morbidity, and mortality occur during 6 months to 6 years of age&#xD;
           when the maternally-derived serum anti-O-SP has waned and the naturally-derived&#xD;
           antibodies have not yet appeared;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. One injection of a S. sonnei-rEPA conjugate showed significant protection against&#xD;
           shigellosis in Israeli Defense Force soldiers. Vaccinees who developed shigellosis&#xD;
           showed significantly lower serum IgG responses to the homologous LPS than those did&#xD;
           not.The high antibody level induced by the conjugate vaccine indicates the positive&#xD;
           correlation between the serum IgG anti-LPS levels and immunity to S. sonnei infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Following Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies that showed safety and age-related immunogenicity,&#xD;
           a double-blinded randomized and vaccine-controlled Phase 3 evaluation of S. sonnei and&#xD;
           S. flexneri type 2a O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) protein conjugates was conducted&#xD;
           among 1-4 year-olds in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For recipients of the S. sonnei conjugate 71.1% efficacy was shown among 3-4 year-old&#xD;
      recipients, no efficacy was shown for recipients of S. flexneri 2a. There was no&#xD;
      statistically significant efficacy for either vaccine in the 1-3 year-olds. Levels of serum&#xD;
      IgG anti-O-SP were elevated according to the vaccine the children received but G.M. levels&#xD;
      declined rapidly several months after the last injection. Our interpretation is that the&#xD;
      age-related efficacy of the Shigella conjugates was due to the conjugate-induced O-SP&#xD;
      antibody levels. Accordingly, we have developed a method to increase the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      the conjugates to approach the antibody levels of Israeli soldiers shown to be protected by&#xD;
      our S. sonnei O-SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-molecular-mass O-SP-core (O-SPC) fragments were isolated from S. sonnei LPS, and bound by&#xD;
      their reducing ends to the carrier protein. The O-SPC conjugates used oxime linkages between&#xD;
      the terminal Kdo residues at the reducing ends of the S. sonnei saccharides and aminooxy&#xD;
      linkers bound to the carrier. The coupling reaction was carried out at a neutral pH and room&#xD;
      temperature. The carrier protein was a non-toxic recombinant diphtheria toxin mutant. IgG&#xD;
      antibody levels induced in young outbred mice by this new S. sonnei O-SPC conjugate were&#xD;
      significantly higher then those elicited by the O-SP conjugates.&#xD;
