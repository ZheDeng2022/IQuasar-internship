    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most commonly performed operations in general&#xD;
      surgery and is considered the standard of care for cholecystectomy for benign biliary&#xD;
      disease. The laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy, when compared to open surgery, is&#xD;
      associated with less postoperative pain, quicker recovery time and an improved cosmetic&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most commonly, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed using a 10-12mm port in the&#xD;
      umbilicus with 3 additional ports consisting of either three 5mm ports, or a combination of&#xD;
      two 5mm ports and one 10mm port. A new technique called minilaparoscopic (also referred to as&#xD;
      needlescopic) surgery has recently emerged. Minilaparoscopic surgery replaces 5mm trocars&#xD;
      with smaller 3mm trocars. Surgery using these smaller trocars is hypothesized to further&#xD;
      reduce postoperative pain and recovery time as well as improve cosmetic results following&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery. Our goal is to compare these outcomes in a randomized trial comparing&#xD;
      conventional to minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;

      Background Since its introduction in the late 1980's, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has&#xD;
      quickly become the standard of care in surgery for benign disease of the gallbladder. When&#xD;
      compared to open surgery, laparoscopic surgery is associated with decreased post-operative&#xD;
      pain. Recovery time and return to usual activity are also significantly shorter following the&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedure. Cholecystectomy in the era of laparoscopic surgery has become an&#xD;
      out-patient procedure. Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery eliminates a large surgical scar and&#xD;
      provides patients an improved cosmetic result .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic technology has evolved rapidly over the last 20 years. The quality of&#xD;
      instruments, and especially of optics, has greatly improved since the first laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomies were performed. A significant trend in the development of new technologies&#xD;
      has been the move toward smaller instruments and cameras. Where 10mm cameras were standard in&#xD;
      the early years of laparoscopy, 5mm cameras now offer excellent optical quality and permit&#xD;
      the use of fewer 10mm trocars. In this movement toward increasingly less invasive techniques,&#xD;
      minilaparoscopic surgery has emerged. Minilaparoscopic surgery (also called needlescopic&#xD;
      surgery) involves the use of smaller trocars and instruments, typically 3mm in size. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that smaller trocars cause less tissue damage and therefore result in improved&#xD;
      post-operative pain and recovery, while offering the additional benefit of improved cosmesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have found minilaparoscopic surgery to be safe, with complication rates no&#xD;
      greater than those of conventional laparoscopic technique. In some studies, minilaparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy has been associated with slightly increased operative time. Previous studies&#xD;
      have also noted higher conversion rates (a change in the planned operative technique to&#xD;
      another technique), however this conversion is typically from minilaparoscopy to conventional&#xD;
      laparoscopy; the rate of conversion from minilaparoscopy to an open procedure is no higher&#xD;
      than with conventional laparoscopy. However a recent meta-analysis performed by Thakur et al.&#xD;
      (1) found that while some studies have shown these trends toward longer operative times and&#xD;
      increased conversion rates, the overall evidence for this is weak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a number of previous studies have attempted evaluate the benefits that patients derive&#xD;
      from minilaparoscopic surgery, including post-operative pain and recovery time, many of these&#xD;
      studies have been flawed by methodological concerns. Thakur et al showed in their&#xD;
      meta-analysis that minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy was associated with improved cosmesis at&#xD;
      one month as well as reduced post-operative pain and faster recovery time. These benefits&#xD;
      however were estimated to be minimal based on the available evidence. Unclear reporting of&#xD;
      trials and flawed study design, specifically the lack of &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis, make&#xD;
      the interpretation of available data difficult and the meta-analysis concluded that &quot;the&#xD;
      evidence for using minicholecystecomy is unclear.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      More high quality evidence is needed for the surgical community to determine the utility and&#xD;
      benefits of minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy. It is our hope that through a rigorous&#xD;
      methodological design we can add to the available literature and determine if&#xD;
      minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy is a valuable technique that will benefit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Minilaparoscopic surgery will reduce postoperative pain and recovery time, as well&#xD;
      as improve cosmetic results in patients undergoing cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial comparing minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy to standard laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy will be performed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if minilaparoscopic surgery is associated with decreased postoperative pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if minilaparoscopic surgery results is associated with quicker recovery and&#xD;
           return to usual activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if minilaparoscopic surgery is associated with in an improved cosmetic result&#xD;

    <description>Post-operative pain will be assessed during the first week post-operatively using a diary that will be provided to patients. In this diary, patients will score their pain daily using a visual analog scale (0=no pain and 10=severe pain) and record use of pain medications for the first seven days post-operatively. Patients will again be asked to score their pain using the visual analog scale at the regularly scheduled follow-up visit three weeks post-op.</description>
