  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal forearm fractures comprise approximately 5% of all fractures, with olecranon&#xD;
      fractures accounting for almost 20% of thes fractures. There is limited conclusive evidence&#xD;
      regarding the optimal treatment and outcome of these fractures within the elderly population&#xD;
      with one case series in the literature describing 13 patients. Our trial includes all&#xD;
      patients equal to or over the age of 75yrs presenting to the Edinburgh and Fife Orthopaedic&#xD;
      Trauma Units with an isolated olecranon fracture. Patients who consent to enrol in the trial&#xD;
      will be randomised to operative fixation using one of two treatment methods. Patients in the&#xD;
      nonoperative group will be place in a sling for two weeks and then allowed to mobilise under&#xD;
      supervised physiotherapy as per normal protocol. For those patients in the operative group,&#xD;
      tension band wire of plate fixation will be employed depending on the choice of their&#xD;
      supervising consultant. Patients will be evaluated over a one year period following their&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with undisplaced olecranon fractures can be treated non-operatively. The aims of&#xD;
      treatment in displaced olecranon fractures are the restoration of function and stability to&#xD;
      the elbow joint4. The technique employed should allow preservation and reconstruction of the&#xD;
      articular surface with minimal associated complications. Tension-band wiring (TBW) is the&#xD;
      most recognised and commonly used fixation method, although plate fixation and intramedullary&#xD;
      screw fixation are noted alternatives. Potential problems with the TBW technique are wound&#xD;
      breakdown, infection, prominent metalwork, malunion and non-union. Furthermore, plate&#xD;
      fixation is considered to be superior in distal/comminuted/oblique fractures and&#xD;
      fracture-dislocations, with superior fracture reduction and fixation results, as well as a&#xD;
      lower rate of re-operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above described fixation techniques can be employed in elderly people, although&#xD;
      difficulties associated with fixation in osteoporotic bone, wound breakdown and other&#xD;
      complications is reported. In these patients, fracture excision with advancement of the&#xD;
      triceps is a viable option if fixation is deemed inappropriate. However, there is limited&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that non-operative treatment of displaced olecranon fractures in these&#xD;
      elderly patients may provide adequate functional results. In a case series of 13 patients&#xD;
      (mean age 81.8 years, &gt;5 mm fracture displacement) treated non-operatively for a displaced&#xD;
      olecranon fracture, outcome scores were excellent in 11 patients and poor in one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim To determine if any difference exists in outcome (primary measure - DASH score)&#xD;
      after one year between non-operative management AND operative treatment for olecranon&#xD;
      fractures in patients 75yrs or older (≥75yrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This trial involves identifying patients over the age of 75yrs (≥75yrs)&#xD;
      presenting to the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Trauma Unit and Fife Orthopaedic Trauma Unit with an&#xD;
      isolated olecranon fracture. Patients who consent to enrol in the trial will be randomised to&#xD;
      one of two recognised treatment techniques - non-operative management in a collar and cuff&#xD;
      for two weeks OR operative management using tension band wire fixation or plate fixation. The&#xD;
      trial will commence once ethical approval is granted by the Lothian Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analysis was/will be performed by Dr Rob Elton. Prior to the study a power&#xD;
      analysis determined the number of patients required in each trial. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be the DASH score, a continuous variable that follows a normal (Gaussian-shaped)&#xD;
      distribution. This study is designed to determine a clinically relevant mean difference of 10&#xD;
      points between the two cohorts at one year after enrolment. A power analysis indicated that a&#xD;
      total sample size of 50 (25 in each group) subjects will provide 80% statistical power to&#xD;
      detect significant differences (0.05) in DASH scores, assuming an effect size of 0.8 (mean&#xD;
      difference of 10 points, standard deviation of 12 points) using an unpaired t-test. To&#xD;
      account for a possible loss to follow-up of up to 25%, we anticipate enrolling 35 subjects in&#xD;
      each cohort for a total sample size of 70 subjects. A p value of &lt; 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients presenting to the units with a fracture of the olecranon that satisfy the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in our study. Vulnerable populations will&#xD;
      not be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualified member of the on-call team will introduce the study to the patient and initiate&#xD;
      informed consent. If the patient agrees, a research fellow (Trauma and Orthopaedic StR3&#xD;
      level), not involved with the patient's care will review the study protocol in detail and&#xD;
      address any questions the patient may have. If the patient is willing to participate, the&#xD;
      research fellow will complete the informed consent with the patient. Patients will be given a&#xD;
      copy of the consent form, and be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they&#xD;
      can withdraw at any time during the study without detriment to their normal care in any way.&#xD;
      Patients may take as long as they like to consider participation, provided that they still&#xD;
      meet all the eligibility criteria documented above. Patients that are willing to participate&#xD;
      in this study will get the same care of their fracture as patients that decide not to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On enrolment, a data collection form will be started with demographic and injury-related&#xD;
      information collected. Patients will be randomised (performed by Dr Rob Elton using closed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes) into one of the two groups (non-operative or operative). Patients in the&#xD;
      non-operative group will be placed in a collar and cuff for two weeks and allowed to mobilise&#xD;
      under supervised physiotherapy as per normal protocol. Patients in this group can be placed&#xD;
      in cast (~60 degrees of flexion) if pain is too severe. For those patients in the operative&#xD;
      group, tension band wire of plate fixation will be employed depending on the choice of their&#xD;
      supervising consultant. Following surgery, the post-operative assessment and course will be&#xD;
      as per normal protocol for patients who are not in this study. Patients in the operative&#xD;
      group will be immobilised depending on fracture fixation during surgery and the decision will&#xD;
      be made by the treating surgeon. Physiotherapy will be arranged when required&#xD;
&#xD;
      All follow-up assessment will take place during follow-up visits initially with the treating&#xD;
      consultant surgeon's team and a dedicated member of the research team. Radiographs and other&#xD;
      diagnostic studies will be obtained at the discretion of the treating surgeon and will not&#xD;
      differ from routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessment will be collected over a one year period (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months and one year). Routine follow-up in our institution for patients who have sustained an&#xD;
      olecranon fracture that is managed operatively involves outpatient clinic reviews with&#xD;
      radiographs at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, three months and six months. Therefore, one additional visit&#xD;
      at 1 year is required for this study with no additional radiographs. Radiographs will only be&#xD;
      performed at one year on clinical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit physical examination, treatment, complications and re-operation (e.g. hardware&#xD;
      removal), for each patient will be recorded. A member of the research team, blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment method by sticking plaster over the entry position, will undertake functional&#xD;
      testing and assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By statistically analysing the outcome scores in the two groups, I aim to better determine&#xD;
      the optimal management of this fracture in this age group. Using univariate analysis and&#xD;
      multivariate regression analysis I will determine significant (p&lt;0.05) predictors of outcome&#xD;
      in relation to functional outcome score (DASH at one year).&#xD;
