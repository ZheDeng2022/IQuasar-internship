  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of hospitalization in premature infants&#xD;
      worldwide. Severity rates are particularly high in developing countries. Numerous viruses can&#xD;
      cause severe disease, but the most frequent agent of hospitalization is respiratory syncytial&#xD;
      virus (RSV). In a recent study in Argentina, 58% of RSV infected VLBW infants required&#xD;
      hospitalization and 19% required mechanical ventilation. One every twenty infected infants&#xD;
      died. Unlike industrialized nations, VLBW infants in developing countries often lack access&#xD;
      to prophylaxis against RSV with a commercially available monoclonal antibody (palivizumab).&#xD;
      No vaccine or preventive intervention is available against any respiratory virus for infants&#xD;
      younger than 6 months of age in developing countries and the public sector of most&#xD;
      middle-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protective role of breastfeeding against respiratory infections in developing countries&#xD;
      is well established. But while similar beneficial effects have been described for premature&#xD;
      infants, the dropout rate for breastfeeding in families exposed to the uncertainties and&#xD;
      stress of the early months of life in the neonatal intensive care unit is very high. The&#xD;
      World Health Organization recommends the use of Human Milk Donor Banks to feed infants that&#xD;
      cannot be breastfed by their own mothers. These banks are established with the purpose of&#xD;
      collecting, screening, processing (including pasteurizing), testing and distributing donated&#xD;
      human milk. The potential benefit of donated milk against acute disease elicited by RSV is&#xD;
      unknown. The investigators propose to study the role of supplemental donated human milk in&#xD;
      the prevention of hospitalizations caused by RSV in non-breastfeeding premature infants.&#xD;
      Since the investigators expect the benefits of breast milk to extend beyond protection&#xD;
      against RSV, the effect of human milk against respiratory infections elicited by other&#xD;
      viruses will also be evaluated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  VLBW preterm neonates (birth weight &lt;1,500 g at birth; gestational age &lt;37 weeks) born&#xD;
             alive at any of the two participating maternity hospitals integrating our network in&#xD;
             Argentina will be enrolled in the study after signature of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  VLBW infants older than one month of age (e.g.: transferred from another institution),&#xD;
             or formula fed for over ten days, or with congenital heart disease, congenital&#xD;
             anomalies of the respiratory tract (i.e.: tracheoesophageal fistula, pulmonary&#xD;
             hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia), immune suppression, severe malformations affecting&#xD;
             breathing (i.e. anencephaly) as well as infants who die prior to completion of the&#xD;
             first questionnaire, or living more than 40 km away from the Hospital will be excluded&#xD;
