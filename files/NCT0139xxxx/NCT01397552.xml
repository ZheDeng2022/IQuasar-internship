    <textblock>
      Comparison of Dexamethasone versus Depo Medrol when used in lumbar epidural injections will&#xD;
      be conducted on subjects that have not had previous injections or have not had an injection&#xD;
      in the last 12 months. Subjects must be receiving one level injection and not had prior&#xD;
      surgery at that level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central Epidural Steroid Injections (ESI) and Selective Nerve Root Blocks (SNRB) are often&#xD;
      used for the non-surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniations and lumbar radiculitis&#xD;
      (radiating pain). Numerous authors have reported on their value in treating patients with&#xD;
      radicular pain with the possibility of delaying or even obviating the need for surgery in&#xD;
      well-selected patients.. There are two well-performed clinical studies in the peer-reviewed&#xD;
      medical literature that specifically examined the crossover rates to surgery for patients who&#xD;
      received either ESI or SNRB. In a prospective study, Buttermann et al. found a crossover rate&#xD;
      to surgery for patients with symptomatic disc herniations treated with ESI of 54% (27/50) .&#xD;
      In a separate prospective study, Riew et al. followed patients after selective nerve root&#xD;
      blocks and found that similarly 53% (29/55) of their patients had avoided surgery after a&#xD;
      selective nerve root block during their initial follow-up of 13-28 months. In a later study&#xD;
      that followed that same population, 76% (16/21) of those patients who had avoided surgery at&#xD;
      one year still avoided surgery at a minimum of five year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural steroid injections are a common treatment option for patients with disc herniations&#xD;
      and radiating leg pain. They have been used for low back problems since 1922 and are still an&#xD;
      integral part of the non-surgical management of a variety of spine related problems. The goal&#xD;
      of the injection is reduction in pain, increased quality of life and increased function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most practitioners will agree that, while the effects of the injection tend to be&#xD;
      temporary-providing relief from pain for one week up to one year-an epidural can be very&#xD;
      beneficial for a patient during an acute episode of back and/or leg pain. Importantly, an&#xD;
      injection can provide sufficient pain relief to allow a patient to progress with a&#xD;
      rehabilitative stretching and exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many previous studies on epidural injections did not include use of fluoroscopy or xray to&#xD;
      verify proper placement of the medication despite the fact that fluoroscopic guidance is&#xD;
      routinely used today. Additionally, many studies do not classify patients according to&#xD;
      diagnosis and tend to &quot;lump&quot; different types, sources of pain together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly used steroid preparations include betamethasone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone and&#xD;
      methylprednisolone. Unfortunately, there is no consensus regarding the most effective&#xD;
      medication, dose, volume or frequency used for ESIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigator-initiated study is being conducted to compare the effects of epidural&#xD;
      injections on low back pain when using either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone&#xD;
      (Depo-Medrol). The physicians listed would like to compare these two medications to assess if&#xD;
      one is more effective than the other. Both medications are FDA approved and are not&#xD;
      experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is the only nonparticulate corticosteroid, has a rapid onset that acts as an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depo-Medrol is a synthetic steroid (cortisone) medication which also acts as an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory when physicians administer an epidural for relief of low back pain.&#xD;
