  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, more than 5 million patients in the US experience postoperative nausea and/or&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV) and in the ambulatory setting post-discharge nausea and/or vomiting (PDNV) is&#xD;
      the most common cause for unanticipated hospital re-admissions. Similarly, millions of&#xD;
      patients suffer from chemotherapy induced nausea and/or vomiting (CINV), and one out of five&#xD;
      patients discontinues chemotherapy for this reason. Thus, the control of nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      remains a major health concern for the investigators society. The investigatorsoverall goal&#xD;
      is to further the understanding of nausea and vomiting and optimize antiemetic selection in&#xD;
      order to facilitate individualized patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, current antiemetics reduce the incidence of nausea by only about one third. As&#xD;
      a result, antiemetics are often combined, exposing patients to adverse events and drug&#xD;
      interactions without evidence for the most effective combination. Moreover, it remains&#xD;
      unclear why such a large amount of inter-individual variability exists in antiemetic&#xD;
      responsiveness. 5HT3, NK1, and GABA receptors are targets for some of the most commonly&#xD;
      prescribed anti-emetics. Furthermore, these receptors have many known genetic polymorphisms,&#xD;
      including several linked to incidence of nausea and vomiting. Thus pharmacogenomic variation&#xD;
      may in part explain interindividual differences in treatment responses and will be tested in&#xD;
      this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leveraging the established infrastructure of the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science&#xD;
      Institute, and the support of 6 patient recruitment sites, the investigators will enroll 1280&#xD;
      high risk patients to three oral interventions with distinct mechanisms of action for nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting. Investigating nausea and vomiting in ambulatory surgical patients is an&#xD;
      excellent model for this trial owing to a high incidence, short observational period, and the&#xD;
      ability to standardize and control potentially confounding variables. In this proposal, 100%&#xD;
      of patients will receive a single intraoperative dose of 4 mg ondansetron, which is similar&#xD;
      to the 80% of patients who receive prophylaxis in common practice. Using a factorial design,&#xD;
      these patients will be randomized to receive one out of eight possible combinations of the&#xD;
      three interventions (ondansetron, aprepitant, lorazepam) versus placebo (ond+aprep+lora,&#xD;
      ond+aprep, ond+lora, aprep+lora, ond, aprep, lora, or placebo). Thus, in this proposal 87.5%&#xD;
      (7 out of 8 patients) will have antiemetic coverage for the postdischarge period, which is&#xD;
      considerably higher than in common practice, where only 4% of patients have antiemetic&#xD;
      coverage after discharge. The primary endpoint will be the prevention of nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      within 48 hours after ambulatory surgery. The advantage of the factorial trial design is its&#xD;
      high efficiency to systematically investigate multiple interventions while allowing us to&#xD;
      test for potential interactions. It is also an ideal format for the simultaneous assessment&#xD;
      of pharmacogenomic interactions of antiemetics in this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the investigators will collect DNA samples and take advantage of the unique&#xD;
      opportunity to investigate the effects of variation in candidate receptor genes in the&#xD;
      context of the three treatment interventions for PDNV. This approach may in part explain&#xD;
      inter-individual differences in drug efficacy and allow for future screening of at-risk&#xD;
      patients. Specifically, the investigators will be assessing single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) of targeted receptors for the antiemetics tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine efficacy of three interventions for the prevention of PDNV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: Each intervention reduces the incidence of PDNV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Efficacy of all interventions is independent so that efficacy of a&#xD;
      combination can be derived from the efficacy of the individual interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if drug response for anti-emetics is dependent upon genetic variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Efficacy of ondansetron, aprepitant and lorazepam to reduce PDNV differs with&#xD;
      5HT3, NK1, and GABA receptor gene variation, respectively.&#xD;
