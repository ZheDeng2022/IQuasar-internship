  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad the combination of two&#xD;
      medications, everolimus and bevacizumab, has on kidney cancer. In this clinical trial we are&#xD;
      now testing these medications in combination. We think that both together might work better&#xD;
      that either drug alone. Importantly, both of these drugs together have been tested in&#xD;
      patients with a different type of kidney cancer and patients tolerated the combination well.&#xD;

    <description>This is a single-institution, single-arm phase II trial of everolimus in combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced non-clear cell RCC, who have not received prior VEGF-.or mTOR-targeted therapy. A separate cohort of patients with non-clear cell RCC with papillary features will be enrolled in order to gather information regarding the efficacy given the rarity of these entities.</description>

    <description>Cycle length will be defined as 28 days. Treatment will include everolimus 10mg, self administered orally once daily on a continuous schedule (days 1-28), and bevacizumab 10mg/kg, administered intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, major toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for any reason. Dose modification will be permitted based on toxicity. Patients that come off study before 6 months before documented progression/death will be treated as events for the 6 month PFS endpoint.</description>

             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior&#xD;
             to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status&#xD;

             potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study&#xD;
