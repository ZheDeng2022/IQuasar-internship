      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor is a protein found on some brain cells. It may play a&#xD;
      role in obesity or some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Imaging studies like&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) can show where CB1 receptors are located. A new&#xD;
      radioactive chemical, 11C-SD5024, may be able to show these receptors more clearly than&#xD;
      previous radioactive chemicals. Better images of CB1 receptors in the brain may help improve&#xD;
      our understanding of obesity and psychiatric disorders. This information may lead to better&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test how well a new radioactive chemical, 11C-SD5024, is taken up by the brain during&#xD;
      imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age who are able to have positron emission&#xD;
      tomography scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in one of three groups for the study. Each group will receive&#xD;
           11C-SD5024 and have a different set of imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and PET scan of the brain.&#xD;
           They will also have blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will have a whole-body PET scan, as well as blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 will have an MRI scan of the brain, followed by two PET scans of the brain. They&#xD;
           will also have blood and urine tests. The two PET scans can happen on the same day or on&#xD;
           two different days.&#xD;

      The cannabinoid type 1 (CB(1)) receptor is one of the most abundant G protein-coupled&#xD;
      receptors in the brain (Matsuda et al 1990). It is found on glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and&#xD;
      gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synaptic terminals and mediates the effects of&#xD;
      endocannabinoids (ECs), which suppresses the release of neurotransmitters. The CB(1) receptor&#xD;
      is a target for drug therapy, including the use of a CB(1) receptor antagonist as an appetite&#xD;
      suppressant. Our laboratory recently developed a promising positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      ligand for the CB(1) receptor: [(11)C]SD5024 (Donohue et al 2008a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies from our laboratory used two PET ligands to image CB(1) receptors&#xD;
      (11)C-MePPEP and (18)F-FMPEP-d(2) (Yasuno et al 2008; Donohue et al 2008b) and found that the&#xD;
      latter provides more accurate and precise measurement. We also found that clearance of&#xD;
      (11)C-MePPEP from brain was too slow for (11)C-labeling (Terry et al 2010). Although we are&#xD;
      currently using [(18)F]FMPEP-d(2) , the major disadvantage of the current radioligand is that&#xD;
      it washes out slowly from the brain, and accurate quantitation requires relatively fast&#xD;
      washout. If [(11)C]SD5024 is amenable to quantitation in human subjects, then it may prove to&#xD;
      be a useful ligand for studying potential pathophysiological changes of this receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is (1) to perform brain imaging using [(11)C]SD5024 in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers to characterize brain uptake and distribution; (2) to perform whole body PET&#xD;
      studies in healthy volunteers in order to estimate radiation absorbed doses for&#xD;
      [(11)C]SD5024; and (3) to perform brain test-retest studies in healthy volunteers to further&#xD;
      examine how precise measurements of receptor binding are, and to determine optimal parameters&#xD;
      for future experiments using [(11)C]SD5024.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful development of a PET radioligand to image CB1 receptors has the potential to&#xD;
      significantly impact our understanding and clinical management of neuropsychiatric (eg,&#xD;
      schizophrenia) (Eggan et al 2008) and metabolic (eg, obesity) (Gazzerro et al 2007)&#xD;
      disorders. Future experiments would include studies of relevant neuropsychiatric disorders.&#xD;
