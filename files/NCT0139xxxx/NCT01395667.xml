    <textblock>
      In this phase I trial neoadjuvant CCRT combining IMRT with three escalated dose levels (45&#xD;
      Gy, 50 Gy, and 55 Gy in 25 fractions) and BV-fluorouracil/ leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)&#xD;
      regimens is planned for 15 locally advanced rectal cancer patients. The primary goal is to&#xD;
      define the maximally tolerated dose of radiotherapy and the treatment related acute toxicity,&#xD;
      and to demonstrate that preoperative highly conformal IMRT and concurrent BV-chemotherapy&#xD;
      will lead to acceptable acute gastrointestinal morbidity. The secondary goal is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that this treatment modality will elicit a comparable or improved rate of T stage&#xD;
      downstaging and complete response pathologically.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer has been one of the leading cancers in Taiwan and other countries in the world.&#xD;
      Preoperative neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the well accepted and widely&#xD;
      used modality for locally advanced rectal cancer, to improve the local control, reduce the&#xD;
      treatment related toxicity, and to increase the anal preservation rate. Intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (IMRT), the most common advanced technique in recent 10 years, has been&#xD;
      proven effective in dose escalation, treatment target conformity, and normal tissue sparing.&#xD;
      The ongoing trials on rectal cancer increasingly adopt IMRT as the treatment technique.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (BV), the developed drug targeting on vascular endothelial growth factor, has&#xD;
      been proven for its effective use in metastatic colorectal cancer. Besides, BV has showed its&#xD;
      good radiosensitizing effects in the evolving neoadjuvant CCRT trials using traditional&#xD;
      big-field pelvis radiotherapy on rectal cancer, the ongoing brain tumor trials, and the basic&#xD;
      researches. Neoadjuvant CCRT using the combination of IMRT and BV may have the dual&#xD;
      advantages of reduced treatment toxicity by technique and increased pathological response by&#xD;
      radiosensitization for the possible improved outcomes. In this phase I trial neoadjuvant CCRT&#xD;
      with combined IMRT with three escalated dose levels (45 Gy, 50 Gy, and 55 Gy in 25 fractions)&#xD;
      and BV-fluorouracil/ leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) regimens is planned for 15 locally&#xD;
      advanced rectal cancer patients. The primary goal is to define the maximally tolerated dose&#xD;
      of radiotherapy and the treatment related acute toxicity, and demonstrate that preoperative&#xD;
      highly conformal IMRT and concurrent BV-chemotherapy will lead to acceptable acute&#xD;
      gastrointestinal morbidity. The secondary goal is to demonstrate that this treatment modality&#xD;
      will elicit a comparable or improved rate of T stage downstaging and complete response&#xD;
      pathologically.&#xD;

             flexible endoscopy&#xD;
