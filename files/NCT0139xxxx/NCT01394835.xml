  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis obliterable syndrome (BOS) is the most common cause of death in long-term&#xD;
      survivors after lung transplantation and refractory to most interventions. Many risk factor&#xD;
      for BOS were identified in previous studies such as acute cellular rejection, lymphocytic&#xD;
      bronchiolitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and non-CMV respiratory infections, injury to the&#xD;
      allograft or airways, Primary graft dysfunction, HLA mismatching, and organizing pneumonia.&#xD;
      (Belperio JA. et al.). Neutrophils and their released products may be involved in the&#xD;
      development of BOS. Neutrophilia was repeatedly observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid&#xD;
      of patients after lung transplantation. In addition, infiltration of neutrophils into the&#xD;
      bronchial epithelium has been detected in patients with higher degrees of active airway&#xD;
      damage. Neutrophils are capable of causing severe damage to the lung tissue by releasing&#xD;
      toxic proteases and reactive oxygen species if not counterbalanced by the antiprotease/&#xD;
      antioxidant screen of the lung. Based on this background, a causal relationship between&#xD;
      neutrophilia and the development of BOS has been proposed. (Hirsch J. et al.) Detection of&#xD;
      unopposed Neutrophile elastase (NE) activity in BAL appears to correlate with poor outcome&#xD;
      due to refractory BOS. Unopposed NE in these subjects may not only serve as a marker of&#xD;
      evolving graft dysfunction but also participate in damaging the airways of the allograft and&#xD;
      inhibit adequate bacterial clearance. Prevention of neutrophil sequestration or inhibition of&#xD;
      NE may prevent or attenuate airway damage and improve bacterial clearance mechanisms. (Nutley&#xD;
      D et al.) These data demonstrate the importance of neutrophils and unopposed NE in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of BOS and call for new approach to prevent or modulate BOS targeting this&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAT is the main inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the lower airways and patients with AAT&#xD;
      deficiency have low concentrations of the protein in this region of the lung. This explains&#xD;
      the proteinase/antiproteinase theory of the development of emphysema in deficient patients in&#xD;
      which the amount of elastase released in the lung exceeds the amount of AAT. The net result&#xD;
      is persistence of elastase activity leading to lung destruction and the pathological changes&#xD;
      of emphysema. (Abusriwil H. et al.) The administration of the AAT is to address&#xD;
      proteinase/antiproteinase imbalance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of AAT will help to prevent further destruction of the lung architecture and&#xD;
      reduce the inflammatory dysregulation that causes pulmonary dysfunction. It is expected that&#xD;
      by attacking a specific and previously untreated key component part of the pathophysiological&#xD;
      cycle of BOS, AAT therapy would decrease the prevalence of BOS in lung transplant recipients&#xD;
      and prolong life expectancy of these patients.&#xD;
