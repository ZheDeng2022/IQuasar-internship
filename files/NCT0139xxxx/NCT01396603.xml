  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a new imaging technology, termed optical frequency domain imaging&#xD;
      (OFDI) for detecting and diagnosing pulmonary malignancy in the central airways.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and high mortality rate associated with lung squamous cell carcinoma and the&#xD;
      lack of any widely accepted screening and surveillance tools, highlights the need for new&#xD;
      imaging paradigms that will ultimately lead to a reduction in patient mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial carcinoma-in-situ will progress to invasive cancer in over 40% of individuals, and&#xD;
      although the progression occurs over a long period of time, the majority of carcinomas are&#xD;
      detected in the later stages of disease development, offering patients only a slim chance of&#xD;
      cure. Although significant effort in the development of screening paradigms for the detection&#xD;
      of lung cancer in the central airways have been made, to date there is still no widely&#xD;
      accepted and validated approach. Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is a recent&#xD;
      derivative of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OFDI can be used to conduct volumetric&#xD;
      microscopy of the airways at a resolution comparable with architectural histopathology. The&#xD;
      long term goal of this study is to use OFDI to screen the airways with the hope of detecting&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma at an early more curable stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care bronchoscopy preparation and procedures will be followed including moderate&#xD;
      sedation, pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring as per department protocol. A&#xD;
      combination of currently approved bronchoscopy techniques including standard white light&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, autofluorescence bronchoscopy, and narrow band imaging will be used to assess&#xD;
      the airways. Bronchial regions of interest (ROI) suspected to be premalignant or malignant,&#xD;
      will be imaged using the OFDI system and catheter prior to biopsy acquisition. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that a minimum of 3 OFDI-biopsy correlated pairs from each study participant will&#xD;
      be obtained. An additional OFDI and biopsy will be obtained from a normal ROI. It is expected&#xD;
      that the experimental procedure will add less than 10 minutes to the total length of the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy procedure, but a stopping rule will be instituted to ensure that the&#xD;
      experimental procedure does not exceed 20 minutes.&#xD;
