    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia as confirmed by&#xD;
             fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for BCR/ABL translocation and/or standard&#xD;
             cytogenetics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have received prior hydroxyurea but may not be currently being&#xD;
             treated with hydroxyurea at the time of study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have received prior TKI therapy, however must be on a stable dose of&#xD;
             their current TKI for at least one month prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must demonstrate evidence of persistent disease either by&#xD;
             cytogenetics/FISH or by PCR for BCR/ABL in the peripheral blood or bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years in age. Because little dosing or adverse event data&#xD;
             are currently available on the use of Arsenic in participants &lt;18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;100K&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oxygen saturation &gt; 95% on room air&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Arsenic on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy test; in&#xD;
             addition, agreement to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) must be documented for both women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must demonstrate the ability to understand the investigational nature of&#xD;
             this study and must sign a written informed consent document in accordance with&#xD;
             institutional and federal guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or&#xD;
             arrhythmia within the last three months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mean QTc&gt; 450 ms at time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of potassium wasting diuretics during study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not be taking drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of&#xD;
             causing Torsades de Pointes. The following must be discontinued at least 7 days prior&#xD;
             to enrollment to be eligible: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone,&#xD;
             sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, erythromycins, clarithromycin, chlorpromazine,&#xD;
             haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide, cisapride, bepridil, droperidol,&#xD;
             methadone, chloroquine, domperidone, halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine,&#xD;
             sparfloxacin, lidoflazine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism and have a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
             index (see Appendix A) are allowed but must be used with caution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent and or uncontrolled psychiatric or medical condition which may interfere&#xD;
             with the study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the risk of Arsenic to a&#xD;
             developing fetus is unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Arsenic,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with TKI therapy and Arsenic. In&#xD;
             addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated&#xD;
             with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
