      LCH115397 was a phase 2a, open label, multicenter study testing 125 mg (starting dose) daily&#xD;
      oral GSK2110183 in adult and adolescent patients with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of the study were efficacy (at 3 and 6 months) and safety. For the purpose&#xD;
      of efficacy analysis, patients were stratified into two groups: treatment-naïve (Stratum 1)&#xD;
      and refractory or reactivation disease (Stratum 2). Adolescent participation was limited to&#xD;
      patients with refractory or reactivation disease (Stratum 2).&#xD;

                  brain lesions or pituitary infiltration provided that disease is evaluable for&#xD;
                  treatment response. Patients with isolated pulmonary disease should have recent&#xD;
                  onset (within 3 years) or demonstrate evidence of active disease on PET or other&#xD;
                  functional imaging. If isolated pulmonary disease without radiographic lesion,&#xD;
                  then pulmonary function testing must demonstrate vital capacity &lt;80% predicted,&#xD;
                  FEV1 &lt;80% predicted or DLCO, &lt;70% predicted, and condition is evaluable for&#xD;
                  treatment response and could not be explained through a diagnosis of asthma.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  SS-LCH with multifocal bone or skin disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MS-LCH with or without involvement of 'risk organs'&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Archival tumor available for central confirmation of LCH and biomarker analysis or&#xD;
             willingness to undergo biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If 18 years or older, performance status score of 0, 1, and 2 according to the Eastern&#xD;
             Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. If age &gt;=12 and &lt;18, performance status score&#xD;
             of &gt;50 according to the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must have had a prior&#xD;
             vasectomy or agree to use adequate contraception from the time of the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug until three months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant)&#xD;
                  defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or&#xD;
                  hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
                  [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating&#xD;
                  hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L) is&#xD;
                  confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal&#xD;
                  status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods&#xD;
                  defined in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four&#xD;
                  weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this&#xD;
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their&#xD;
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use&#xD;
                  of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test during the screening&#xD;
                  period, and agrees to use adequate contraception from screening until four weeks&#xD;
                  after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate organ-systems function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within 28 days (or 42 days for prior&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to the first dose of study drug. Corticosteroids&#xD;
             may be administered up to seven days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited potential&#xD;
             for delayed toxicity (in the medical opinion of the investigator) are permitted, if&#xD;
             administered at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of an investigational anti-cancer drug within 28 days or five half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of GSK2110183.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current use of a prohibited medication or requires any of these medications during&#xD;
             treatment with GSK2110183.&#xD;

             gastrointestinal ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any major surgery within the last four weeks (excluding diagnostic biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unresolved toxicity (except alopecia) &gt;= Grade 2 from previous therapy, except where&#xD;
             the Investigator considers that the ongoing toxicity will not introduce additional&#xD;
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Fasting serum glucose &gt;126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L), or for known diabetic patients with&#xD;
             stable disease, fasting serum glucose &gt;250 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) and Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Current use of oral corticosteroids, with the exception of stress dose hydrocortisone&#xD;
             (20 mg BID). Inhaled steroids permitted if patient is currently on a stable&#xD;
             dose/regimen. Topical steroids are permitted; however, they should not be used as&#xD;
             concurrent treatment for LCH skin disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any serious or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other condition&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Evidence of LCH-related neurodegenerative disease if patient has CNS SS-LCH, however,&#xD;
             subjects with CNS SS-LCH who were previously treated for CNS involvement, and are&#xD;
             currently asymptomatic without anti-epileptic medications or steroids for at least two&#xD;
             months are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated&#xD;
             respiratory, hepatic, renal, or cardiac disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known infection with HIV, HBV or HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. QTc interval &gt;= 470 msecs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable&#xD;
             angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within the past six&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Other associated conditions which in the opinion of the investigator could&#xD;
             significantly impair the ability to evaluate the impact of treatment on the clinical&#xD;
             course of the disease.&#xD;
