  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an important health problem of modern civilization. In Western societies, almost&#xD;
      half of the adult population has problems with an increased body weight. Products containing&#xD;
      nutritional fiber has been used by humans for thousands of years. However, beta-glucan as&#xD;
      biologically active compound, present in these products, has been identified relatively&#xD;
      lately. This substance is a polymer of glucose and is present in two forms: 1,3D-1,6D and&#xD;
      1,3D-1,4D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water-insoluble beta-glucan (1,3D-1,6D) has immunomodulatory properties. The aim of the study&#xD;
      was the assessment of the influence of beta-glucan 1,3D-1,6D added to the low-calorie diet on&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and the expression of selected proinflammatory cytokines in adipose&#xD;
      tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in obese humans with normal glucose&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group consisted of 40 subjects with marked overweight or obesity (body mass index,&#xD;
      BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2), without serious concomitant diseases not taking drugs affecting glucose or&#xD;
      lipid metabolism, nonsmokers. Only volunteers, who gave written informed consent, after&#xD;
      receiving a full information about the aim and the design of the study, were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, after subjects' qualification to the project and before the&#xD;
      dietary intervention, the investigators performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropometric measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBMC isolation before and after the clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue before the clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  isolation of mRNA from PBMC and adipose tissue. Then, the expression of the selected&#xD;
           genes with the Real Time PCR was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the initial visit, participants received detailed instructions about low-calorie&#xD;
           diet, with the aim of reduction of 5-7% of body weight and the examples of menu for 14&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, participants were randomly assigned to a group receiving or not beta-glucan&#xD;
      preparation, as a addition to the low-calorie diet. Each group consisted of 20 subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to a group receiving beta-glucan, received the preparation (BETA GLUCAN&#xD;
      1,3-1,6 Laboratoria Natury 500mg) together with the detailed instruction of its usage. This&#xD;
      preparation is used as a non-prescription diet supplement, and the dose of 500 mg daily is&#xD;
      indicated by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 weeks of low-calorie diet, without or with beta-glucan, all the examinations&#xD;
      performed at the beginning of the study were repeated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is an important health problem of modern civilization. In Western societies, almost&#xD;
      half of the adult population has problems with an increased body weight. In Europe, obesity&#xD;
      occurs in 10-20% males and 15-25% females. In Poland, obesity is present in about 20% of&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Products containing nutritional fiber has been used by humans for thousands of years.&#xD;
      However, beta-glucan as biologically active compound, present in these products, has been&#xD;
      identified relatively lately. This substance is a polymer of glucose and is present in two&#xD;
      forms: 1,3D-1,6D and 1,3D-1,4D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water-insoluble beta-glucan (1,3D-1,6D) has immunomodulatory properties. It stimulates host&#xD;
      defense against viral, bacterial and parasitical infections through binding with the specific&#xD;
      receptors located on the immune system cells surface in many animal models. There are data&#xD;
      that beta-glucan 1,3D-1,6D affects both innate and acquired immune response also in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was the assessment of the influence of beta-glucan 1,3D-1,6D added to&#xD;
      the low-calorie diet on insulin sensitivity and the expression of selected proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines in adipose tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in obese humans&#xD;
      with normal glucose tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group consisted of 40 subjects with marked overweight or obesity (body mass index,&#xD;
      BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2), without serious concomitant diseases not taking drugs affecting glucose or&#xD;
      lipid metabolism, nonsmokers. Only volunteers, who gave written informed consent, after&#xD;
      receiving a full information about the aim and the design of the study by the research&#xD;
      personnel were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, after subjects' qualification to the project and before the&#xD;
      dietary intervention, the investigators assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropometric measurements: BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), full physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition with Tanita TBF-511 Body Fat Analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  glucose tolerance with the oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  insulin sensitivity with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before and after the clamp, additional 6 ml of blood was collected, and PBMC isolation&#xD;
           was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before the clamp, a biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  isolation of mRNA from PBMC and adipose tissue was performed. Then, the expression of&#xD;
           the selected genes with the Real Time PCR In adipose tissue was measured measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  additionally, serum concentrations of ghrelin, peptide Y-Y3-36, citruline and intestinal&#xD;
           fatty acid-binding protein was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial visit, participants received detailed instructions about low-calorie diet,&#xD;
      with the aim of reduction of 5-7% of body weight and the examples of menu for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, participants were randomly assigned to a group receiving or not beta-glucan&#xD;
      preparation, as a addition to the low-calorie diet. Each group consisted of 20 subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to a group receiving beta-glucan, received the preparation (BETA GLUCAN&#xD;
      1,3-1,6 Laboratoria Natury 500mg) together with the detailed instruction of its usage. This&#xD;
      preparation is used as a non-prescription diet supplement, and the dose of 500 mg daily is&#xD;
      indicated by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the compliance to the dietary indications and analysis of body composition was&#xD;
      performed every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 weeks of low-calorie diet, without or with beta-glucan, all the examinations&#xD;
      performed at the beginning of the study were repeated.&#xD;
