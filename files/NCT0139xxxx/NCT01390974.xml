      To demonstrate that a strategy of fast genetic testing performed in outpatient clinic allows&#xD;
      to select adequately one of the 2 antiplatelet treatments approved in the same indication&#xD;
      (ACS with PCI - prasugrel 10mg MD or clopidogrel 75mg MD). Patients will reach similar levels&#xD;
      of platelet inhibition with the 2 different thienopyridines suggesting optimal risk/benefit&#xD;
      ratio in most patients with individualized therapy.&#xD;

      Rationale: There are thresholds of on-treatment platelet reactivity that appear to expose&#xD;
      patients either to a risk of thrombotic events (high on-treatment platelet reactivity) or to&#xD;
      a risk of bleeding events (low on-treatment platelet reactivity). Clopidogrel is an oral&#xD;
      platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor that requires metabolic activation catalyzed by several&#xD;
      Cytochromes P450 (CYP) isoforms. The loss-of-function polymorphism 2C19*2, carried by 30% of&#xD;
      individuals, is associated with high-on-treatment platelet reactivity (low level of P2Y12&#xD;
      inhibition) and a higher risk of stent thrombosis in patients exposed to clopidogrel (OR=3.45&#xD;
      (2.14-5.57)). The gain-of-function polymorphism 2C19*17 is associated with low-on-treatment&#xD;
      platelet reactivity (high level of P2Y12 inhibition) with a higher risk of TIMI major&#xD;
      bleeding (OR=1.85 (1.19 -2.86). Prasugrel is a new thienopyridine drug with improved ischemic&#xD;
      outcomes compared with clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing PCI but the&#xD;
      drug was also associated with more bleeding complications. Prasugrel is a more potent&#xD;
      irreversible P2Y12inhibitor than clopidogrel, but it also requires a metabolic conversion&#xD;
      that is less or not affected by CYP2C19 variants, unlike clopidogrel. The recent&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic literature suggests that individualized treatment (choice between clopidogrel&#xD;
      or prasugrel which both are possible in this indication) based on the genetic information&#xD;
      rapidly obtained, is possible. This would improve the risk/benefit of therapy. Both common&#xD;
      gain- and loss-of function CYP2C19 alleles can be combined to identify two metabolizers&#xD;
      status: rapid metabolizer (ultra fast or UF: *17/*17, 5% of all comers and normal&#xD;
      metabolizers or NM : *1/*1 et *1/*17, 50% of all comers) at potential higher risk of bleeding&#xD;
      and slow metabolizer (Intermediate Metabolizers or IM, *1/*2 and *2/*17, 40% of all comers&#xD;
      and Poor Metabolizers or PM, *2/*2, 5% of all comers) at potential higher risk of thrombosis.&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis (&quot;genetic hypothesis&quot;) : the proportion of rapid metabolizers treated with&#xD;
      a 75mg clopidogrel MD within the optimal range of P2Y12 inhibition at 30 days, (defined as a&#xD;
      threshold of 220 AU·min up to 350 AU·min of ADP-induced platelet aggregation measured by the&#xD;
      Multiple Electrode platelet Aggregometry - Multiplate analyzer, DYNABYTE, Munich, Germany or&#xD;
      a % inhibition between 30% up to 80% using the VerifyNowTMP2Y12 platform), is non inferior to&#xD;
      the proportion of slow metabolizers treated with prasugrel 10mg MD.Secondary hypothesis&#xD;
      (&quot;functional hypothesis&quot;): At 30 days, patients outside the pre-specified target of P2Y12&#xD;
      inhibition level will be adjusted (prasugrel 10mg or clopidogrel 75mg). The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that PFT on top of genetic testing will improve the number of patients reaching the&#xD;
      prespecified optimal target of P2Y12 inhibition. Thus, the proportion of slow metabolizers&#xD;
      within the target at D45 is non inferior to that of rapid metabolizer as determined by the&#xD;
      POC PFT. Objectives: To demonstrate that a strategy of fast genetic testing performed in&#xD;
      outpatient clinic allows to select adequately one of the 2 antiplatelet treatments approved&#xD;
      in the same indication (ACS with PCI - prasugrel 10mg MD or clopidogrel 75mg MD). Patients&#xD;
      will reach similar levels of platelet inhibition with the 2 different thienopyridines&#xD;
      suggesting optimal risk/benefit ratio in most patients with individualized therapy. Study&#xD;
      population: ACS patients who recently underwent stent PCI, who are stable and eligible for&#xD;
      prasugrel or clopidogrel therapy.Study design: Prospective,multicenter study. Genetic&#xD;
      metabolizer status will be determined using the VerigeneTM (Nanosphere technology) platform&#xD;
      during outpatient follow-up visit. Thienopyridine treatment at enrolment will not affect&#xD;
      eligibility. Rapid metabolizers (UF and NM) will be treated by 75mg clopidogrel MD while slow&#xD;
      metabolizers (IM and PM) will be allocated to prasugrel 10mg MD. A first evaluation of&#xD;
      platelet reactivity will be performed one month after to allow the comparison of the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who are within the optimal prespecified window of P2Y12 inhibition&#xD;
      (primary hypothesis). The investigators will evaluate the hypothesis that a treatment&#xD;
      adjustment based on the results obtained by this pharmacodynamic evaluation will improve the&#xD;
      rate of success. In this second phase, patients with a level of P2Y12 inhibition &gt;80%&#xD;
      (&lt;220AU.min) or &lt;30% (&gt;350 AU.min) will be switched to 75mg clopidogrel MD and or to&#xD;
      prasugrel 10mg MD, respectively. A second evaluation of the level of platelet reactivity will&#xD;
      be performed at day 45 to allow the comparison of proportions of patients within the&#xD;
      prespecified optimal window of P2Y12 inhibition between rapid and slow metabolizer genotypes.&#xD;
      Duration of inclusion: 12 months Duration of participation of the patient: 60 days Primary&#xD;
      endpoint: Proportion of patient who are within the optimal prespecified window of P2Y12&#xD;
      inhibition at 30 days defined as a threshold of 220 AU·min up to 350 AU·min of ADP-induced&#xD;
      platelet aggregation measured by the Multiple Electrode platelet Aggregometry - Multiplate&#xD;
      analyzer, DYNABYTE, Munich, Germany or a % inhibition between 30% up to 80% using the&#xD;
      VerifyNowTMP2Y12 platform.Number of patients: The investigators have estimated the proportion&#xD;
      of prasugrel-treated patients within the prespecified target of P2Y12 inhibition to be 75%.&#xD;
      The investigators have formulated the hypothesis that 80% of rapid metabolizers on&#xD;
      clopidogrel 75mg MD will stand in the optimal prespecified window of P2Y12 inhibition and the&#xD;
      investigators wish to demonstrate that this proportion is not inferior to that of&#xD;
      prasugrel-treated patients. Considering a power of 80%, an alpha-risk error of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin of -10%, a sample size of 122 patients per group are required.&#xD;
      Expected results: The GAMMA study will provide answers to a major challenge that is whether&#xD;
      rapid genetic information on 2C19 genotype can help in reaching the optimal target of IPA&#xD;
      using 2 different thienopyridine, that have different sensitivity to the CYP2C19 variants.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The non inferiority will be considered as demonstrated (according to&#xD;
      the consent risk) if the non inferiority margin of the 95% confidence interval of the&#xD;
      difference in percentages is superior to the non inferiority margin (ICH Statistical&#xD;
      Procedures). The non-inferiority margin has been established at -10% according to clinical&#xD;
      considerations based on an acceptable maximal lost of efficacy.&#xD;
