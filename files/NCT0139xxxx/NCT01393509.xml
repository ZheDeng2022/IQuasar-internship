      NOTE: This study is now recruiting only patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN).&#xD;
      Dose escalation has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug, called PU-H71 for the first time in humans,&#xD;
      to find out what effects, good or bad, this new drug has on the patient and the cancer at&#xD;
      different dose levels. PU-H71 blocks a protein called Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 is&#xD;
      found in both normal and cancer cells, but may be more important in cancer cells. Attacking&#xD;
      Hsp90 can stop the function of certain proteins that are needed for cancer cells to survive.&#xD;
      The diseases that are part of this study may be especially sensitive to attacking Hsp90, and&#xD;
      the investigators have seen signs of disease control in patients with MPN. This study is&#xD;
      currently enrolling a cohort expansion for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).&#xD;

    <description>PU-H71 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour two times a week on a 2 week on and 1 week off (Q21 day) schedule with a starting dose of 10 mg/m2.

The same schedule of administration will be used for all patients in this Phase I trial, and a MCRM (modified continual reassessment method)design will be employed. The MPN expansion may explore different dosing schedules.</description>
