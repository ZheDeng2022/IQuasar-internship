  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many pregnant women experience stress, fatigue, and poor sleep quality that may influence&#xD;
      infant outcomes such as prematurity and low birthweight through immunologic pathway of&#xD;
      biomarkers (serum cytokines and c-reactive protein). In contrast, TaiChi exercise, one kind&#xD;
      of physical activity, can increase pulmonary and immune functions and reduce stress may&#xD;
      therefore prevent pregnancy complications and further prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes;&#xD;
      however, its effects has not been explored in studies. Therefore, this study aims to&#xD;
      investigate relationships between prenatal stress, fatigue, sleep quality, biomarkers, and&#xD;
      infant outcomes; modified a TaiChi exercise program suitable for pregnant women; and test the&#xD;
      effects of the exercise on reducing stress and fatigue, promote sleep quality, modulate&#xD;
      biomarkers, and prevent adverse infant outcomes. Infant outcomes in the study will be&#xD;
      measured with gestational age and birthweight. The study is a three-stage longitudinal&#xD;
      interventional design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first-stage, patterns of prenatal stress, fatigue, and sleep quality will be&#xD;
      investigated by surveying 300 pregnant women who are over 23 weeks of gestation and screen&#xD;
      for pregnant women with fatigue and poor sleep quality. In the second-stage, experts in&#xD;
      obstetrics and TaiChi will be invited to modify a TaiChi exercise program. Thirty women who&#xD;
      experience fatigue and poor sleep quality will be invited to practice the modified TaiChi&#xD;
      exercise. Comments from those participants on the program will be used to refine the program&#xD;
      and a DVD will be made. After the program is well-designed and recorded, participants&#xD;
      recruited for the third-stage study will be randomly assigned to TaiChi or comparison group.&#xD;
      They will be asked to complete questionnaires and give blood samples for biomarker tests when&#xD;
      they are at 27-29, 31-33, and 35-37 weeks of gestation; in labor; and at 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum. In addition to practice the exercise at home, participants in the TaiChi group&#xD;
      will practice TaiChi in groups every month. In contrast, comparison group will be asked to&#xD;
      keep on their usual daily activities, no other interventions will be introduced. Phone calls&#xD;
      or postcard will be made or sent routinely to participants to ensure their long-term&#xD;
      participation. Questionnaires used for the study include 10-item Perceived Stress Scale,&#xD;
      Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, Pearson correlation, and generalized estimating equations will be applied to&#xD;
      understand predictive effects of maternal stress, fatigue, sleep quality, and biomarkers on&#xD;
      infant outcomes; and effects of modified TaiChi exercise on maternal stress, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      quality, biomarkers, and infant outcomes. In addition to develop a modified TaiChi exercise&#xD;
      program suitable for pregnant women, the study anticipates that maternal stress, fatigue, and&#xD;
      poor sleep quality can predict infant outcomes through immunologic pathway, and the modified&#xD;
      TaiChi exercise can reduce maternal stress and fatigue, improve sleep quality, modulate&#xD;
      biomarkers, and hence prevent adverse infant outcomes.&#xD;
