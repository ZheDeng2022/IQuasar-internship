    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use data from the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device&#xD;
      and your Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) levels to determine the best times to test blood&#xD;
      glucose levels using SMBG.&#xD;

      The investigators propose to employ CGM technology in subjects using insulin sensitizers,&#xD;
      incretin mimetics and potentiators, insulin secretagogues and insulin to identify the minimum&#xD;
      episodic data set that closely mimics CGM data. Specifically, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      employ blinded CGM for 2 weeks to capture the diurnal glucose patterns of individuals on&#xD;
      different therapeutic regimens. The investigators propose to examine these data to determine&#xD;
      whether a specific pattern of SMBG testing derived from these data would provide the same&#xD;
      information (e.g., detection of hypoglycemia, measures of glycemic exposure, variability and&#xD;
      stability) not possible by relying solely on current SMBG testing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for this study the investigators developed a matrix using data collected from&#xD;
      previous studies. The matrix summarizes the amount of CGM data the investigators currently&#xD;
      possess and indicates where the investigators lack sufficient data to produce SMBG testing&#xD;
      schedules based on CGM data. It was determined that 6 cases were needed for each therapy&#xD;
      group. An underlying question is whether after the investigators fill this matrix the&#xD;
      investigators can discover a common testing pattern for SMBG that would provide sufficient&#xD;
      information to uncover the myriad perturbations in glucose patterns that characterize type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. To assure that the investigators are collecting adequate monitoring data, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to use Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) analysis of blinded CGM data.&#xD;
      This novel approach will enable us to answer the question as to the optimum time and number&#xD;
      of SMBG tests sufficient to guide clinical decisions.&#xD;
