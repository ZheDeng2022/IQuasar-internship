  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib is a new cancer drug that works by limiting the growth of new blood vessels in&#xD;
      tumours. About half of patients who take pazopanib develop high blood pressure&#xD;
      (hypertension). This side effect can make patients have to reduce or stop their cancer&#xD;
      treatment, and can cause other health problems. The aim of this study is to find out exactly&#xD;
      how the drug causes high blood pressure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, up to 52 patients with different cancer types will take pazopanib tablets for&#xD;
      12 weeks. They will visit the clinic every 1-2 weeks during treatment, and for a final safety&#xD;
      check 4 weeks after stopping the drug (10 visits over 18 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, we will do a heart tracing, and check the patient's blood pressure and blood&#xD;
      and urine chemicals (to check their health, and see if levels of these chemicals change).&#xD;
      Patients will check their blood pressure at home every other day. They will also wear a blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor for 24 hours on 3 occasions (during normal daily activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have 1 or 2 CT scans and 3 MRI scans during the study. On three occasions, a&#xD;
      variety of specialised tests will measure how the patient's blood vessels are working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may choose to continue taking the drug after the 12 weeks of treatment, if their&#xD;
      doctor feels it is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding how pazopanib causes high blood pressure will help us to advise doctors how to&#xD;
      treat the high blood pressure effectively, so that patients can continue to take their cancer&#xD;
      treatment safely. This research might also lead to the development of new cancer drugs in&#xD;
      future, which do not cause this serious side effect.&#xD;
