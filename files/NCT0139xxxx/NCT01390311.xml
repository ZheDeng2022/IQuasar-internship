  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the effects and safety of adding azacitidine (5-AzaC) to the&#xD;
      standard of care (Soc) for patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after being treated with donor stem cell transplant. SoC&#xD;
      includes giving an infusion of the donor's white blood cells (donor lymphocyte infusion or&#xD;
      DLI) to boost the anticancer effects of the transplant. Giving 5-AzaC after DLI may alter the&#xD;
      function of T-cells resulting in reduced incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) while&#xD;
      maintaining the anticancer effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 5-AzaC (azacitidine) when given after&#xD;
      chemotherapy and DLI in patients with AML/MDS who relapse after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of Grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) in first 100 days&#xD;
           after DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rates of complete remission (CR), partial remission, (PR) and complete&#xD;
           remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and overall response rate (CR+ CRi +&#xD;
           PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall survival 100 days after DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of increasing dose of 5-AzaC on frequency and absolute number&#xD;
           of resting regulatory T-cells (rTregs) and activated Tregs (aTregs) at baseline, 7 days,&#xD;
           14 days, 21 days, and ~60 days after first dose of 5-AzaC.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        PATIENT Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a diagnosis of AML/MDS based on 2008 World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
             classification of myeloid malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have laboratory, histologic, or cytogenetic evidence of disease relapse after&#xD;
             allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and require salvage therapy&#xD;
             followed by DLI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have original donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have life expectancy &gt;= 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be â‰¥ 18 years old. Azacitidine is not approved by the FDA for use in children&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have laboratory results indicating:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 3 X the upper&#xD;
                  limit of institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed&#xD;
             consent prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of 5-AzaC on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because category D agents as well as other&#xD;
             therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             childbearing age must have a negative serum pregnancy test (Beta [B]-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin) within 72 hours prior to initiating therapy and be willing to not become&#xD;
             pregnant by using effective contraception while undergoing treatment and for at least&#xD;
             3 months afterwards; azacitidine is a pregnancy category D drug and could be harmful&#xD;
             to or cause loss of a fetus; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men must be willing not to father a new child while receiving therapy; they must use&#xD;
             an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months&#xD;
             following the last dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this&#xD;
             trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        DONOR Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be the original donor for the allogeneic bone marrow transplant patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have signed the standard informed consent form; if sufficient cryopreserved cells&#xD;
             remain from a previous donation, no additional donation or consent is required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be eligible according to Washington University &quot;Guidelines for Eligibility of&#xD;
             Normal Donors&quot; or per National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) standards if unrelated&#xD;
             donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this&#xD;
             trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENT Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have Grade III-IV GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have an advanced malignant hepatic tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not receive anti-thymocyte globulin, campath (alemtuzumab) or daclizumab within 4&#xD;
             weeks of DLI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not receive any other forms of chemotherapy after cell infusion during the&#xD;
             treatment protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be receiving any other investigational agents within 14 days of first dose of&#xD;
             study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because azacitidine is a Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with azacitidine,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with azacitidine; these&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to azacitidine or other agents used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy; these patients are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with azacitidine; in addition, these patients are at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy;&#xD;
             appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        DONOR Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have any underlying conditions which would contra-indicate apheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be pregnant&#xD;
