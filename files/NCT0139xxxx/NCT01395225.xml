  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the bladder is removed for bladder cancer, pelvic lymph nodes (LN) are also removed.&#xD;
      While the anatomic extent of this LN dissection is critical, the investigators often use the&#xD;
      number of LN removed as a measure of the extent, which in turn is essential for determining&#xD;
      the patient's further treatment and prognosis. The LN count, however, is also dependent on&#xD;
      the pathologist's processing of the LN tissue, and the standards for this processing are&#xD;
      poorly defined. The goal of this study is to establish a standardized method for processing&#xD;
      and analyzing lymph node specimens. The investigators hypothesize that if an organic solvent&#xD;
      is used to remove excess fat from the lymph nodes that the investigators will discover more&#xD;
      clinically significant nodes in a more reproducible fashion when compared to the current&#xD;
      method.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to compare the clinical significance of the use of a fat emulsifying&#xD;
      protocol versus the current standard in the processing of lymph node specimens following&#xD;
      radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a fat-emulsifying protocol in the processing of&#xD;
      lymph nodes harvested at the time of radical cystectomy will increase the proportion of&#xD;
      patients found to have lymph node metastases when compared to the current standard technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mainstay of management of muscle invasive bladder cancer is radical cystectomy with&#xD;
      pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Despite optimal multimodal therapy, approximately half&#xD;
      of patients with invasive bladder cancer die of their disease. Efforts to improve patient&#xD;
      outcome have focussed on two principle factors: the delivery of pre-operative chemotherapy&#xD;
      and the adequacy of PLND. While a PLND is ultimately defined by its anatomic extent, a&#xD;
      popular surrogate measure of extent is the number of lymph nodes removed. Beyond assessing&#xD;
      the adequacy of the PLND in the sense of quality of care, the accurate determination of lymph&#xD;
      node involvement is essential for the correct staging of the patient, which is used to guide&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy and determine patient prognosis. The processing and analysis of the lymph&#xD;
      node specimens is therefore critical in multiple ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current convention at Vancouver General Hospital for specimen handling involves the&#xD;
      dissection of the nodal specimen by a laboratory technologist in the pathology lab. Only&#xD;
      palpable nodes are processed for sectioning and the remaining fat tissue is discarded. The&#xD;
      nodal count is determined by the pathologist when reviewing the slides based on a combination&#xD;
      of the macroscopic and microscopic examination. This process is highly subjective, depends on&#xD;
      the diligence of the technologist's dissection, and limits the final examination to palpable&#xD;
      nodes. In the fat emulsifying technique, all fat is dissolved so that the pathologist can&#xD;
      visualize and process all nodes. The investigators believe that this may provide for a more&#xD;
      standardized and reproducible method in processing lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized and reproducible method for processing lymph nodes is a prerequisite to any&#xD;
      use of lymph node counts as a measure of the quality of the PLND. And, it is necessary to&#xD;
      allow the comparison of results between centers. Furthermore, standardized methodology is&#xD;
      essential to ensure adequate sampling of lymph nodes for clinical staging and&#xD;
      prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a prospective trial to compare our current protocol for&#xD;
      processing pelvic lymph nodes from radical cystectomy with PLND to a fat-emulsifying&#xD;
      protocol. The investigators aim to answer three questions with this trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. While the fat-emulsifying technique will almost certainly identify more nodes than the&#xD;
      current technique of manual dissection, and will likely identify more nodal metastases, the&#xD;
      aim of this study is to determine whether a more careful analysis will find a greater&#xD;
      proportion of patients to have lymph node metastases. This will translate into better staging&#xD;
      and prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. The current technique likely misses particularly small lymph nodes that are not easily&#xD;
      palpated. The investigators hypothesize that there is no threshold lymph node size below&#xD;
      which the risk of metastasis is negligible, and that identification of these smaller nodes is&#xD;
      therefore clinically meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. The investigators hypothesize that a fat-emulsifying protocol will remove much of the&#xD;
      variability due to human element of manual dissection by the prosector. While the&#xD;
      investigators will not test this hypothesis directly, the investigators believe the&#xD;
      methodology and photographic documentation of the results will reflect a degree of&#xD;
      objectivity in this methodology that is not seen with other techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this research proposal is to develop a standardized and reproducible&#xD;
      technique that can be used everywhere in order to enhance the care of our patients with&#xD;
      invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who undergo radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection at Vancouver&#xD;
      General Hospital (VGH) will be invited to participate in this prospective study. Patients&#xD;
      with clinical stage T1-4,N0,M0 bladder cancer will be invited to participate in the study and&#xD;
      will be enrolled after informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of lymph node dissection will be defined as either conventional (up to bifurcation&#xD;
      of common iliac artery) or extended (at least up to the aortic bifurcation) and will be&#xD;
      determined by the surgeon on a case-by-case basis. Dissection of the pre-sacral lymph nodes&#xD;
      is also up to the surgeon. Objective documentation of the extent of node dissection will be&#xD;
      assured by intra-operative photography in every case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologic processing of PLND specimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each specimen will be analyzed by both conventional means and by a fat-emulsifying protocol.&#xD;
      The current convention at Vancouver General Hospital for specimen handling is described&#xD;
      above. In this study the pathologist will count the number of nodes dissected by the&#xD;
      prosector according to this current protocol. The tissue remaining after removal of the&#xD;
      grossly palpable lymph nodes will be submitted for processing by the fat-emulsifying&#xD;
      protocol, which is identical to the LNRS (&quot;lymph node removing solution&quot;) protocol defined by&#xD;
      Koren et al. This consists of placement of the entire specimen in a specialized solution for&#xD;
      12 hours. The solution is a mixture of 95% ethanol, diethyl ether, glacial acetic acid and&#xD;
      buffered formalin in a ratio by volume of 6.5:2:0.5:1 Specimens so treated will be&#xD;
      photographed for objective documentation of the nodal count. The additional nodes are then&#xD;
      embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 2 mm intervals, and stained with eosin and hematoxylin.&#xD;
      The total number of nodes, their size and presence of metastasis will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, clinical and pathological information will be recorded prospectively.&#xD;
      Demographic variables analyzed will include: age, sex, weight, height and race. Clinical&#xD;
      variables will include: date of cancer diagnosis, clinical and pathologic stage at diagnosis&#xD;
      and at time of surgery (TNM staging), date of radical cystectomy, history of intravesical&#xD;
      chemotherapy, other medical co-morbidities and prior abdominal surgeries, extent of lymph&#xD;
      node dissection, and complications during the procedure. Pathological variables will be&#xD;
      recorded for the findings on both the conventional and fat-emulsifying protocols. The number,&#xD;
      size and presence of metastasis for each node found will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients found to have lymph nodes metastases&#xD;
      on pathologic examination. Specifically, the difference in proportion of specimens found to&#xD;
      contain nodal metastases using the fat-emulsifying protocol compared to the conventional&#xD;
      lymph node processing will be analyzed. Secondary outcome measures will be: the total number&#xD;
      of lymph nodes and the total number of lymph node metastases counted by both techniques and&#xD;
      the relationship between the size of lymph node and the presence of metastatic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in the identification of nodal metastases by 15% (fat-emulsifying compared to&#xD;
      conventional processing) will be considered clinically significant. The current rate of node&#xD;
      positivity at the time of radical cystectomy with PLND at VGH is 28%, so that an increase to&#xD;
      43% would be deemed clinically relevant. To detect this difference with a power (1-β) of 80%&#xD;
      and an α error of 10%, 125 patients will need be enrolled in each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS software. The independent samples t-test will be used to&#xD;
      compare the results from the lymph node analysis when processed by conventional means versus&#xD;
      the same nodes processed using the fat-emulsifying protocol (p&lt;0.5). The relationship of size&#xD;
      to presence of metastatic disease will be done by linear regression model (p&lt;0.5). A&#xD;
      significant difference between the groups will be defined as p&lt;0.05. A biostatistician&#xD;
      (Robert Bell) at the Vancouver Prostate Centre will assist with data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have the opportunity with simple and inexpensive technical processing&#xD;
      measures to enhance an integral component of our clinical risk stratification in patients&#xD;
      with invasive bladder cancer. The investigators can establish a solid foundation in pelvic&#xD;
      lymph node counting upon which clinical concepts of lymph node yield and density can be&#xD;
      validated. The investigators expect to demonstrate that the fat-emulsifying protocol is easy&#xD;
      to adopt, reproducible and suitable for widespread use. It has the potential to impact every&#xD;
      patient undergoing radical cystectomy with PLND.&#xD;
