  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed project is designed to collect data and specimens from patients/subjects&#xD;
      presenting to the University of Michigan with a disease affecting the pancreas (or specific&#xD;
      control populations). This protocol is focused on collecting data, blood samples, and tissue&#xD;
      on subjects with pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cysts,&#xD;
      pancreatitis, diabetic controls, jaundice/biliary obstruction controls, and otherwise healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are collecting up to 50 mls of blood for research purposes only. Plasma, serum and buffy&#xD;
      coat are collected and stored according to strict SOPs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The recently funded GI SPORE, here at the University of Michigan, is focused on pancreatic&#xD;
      and colon diseases. This protocol is focused on collecting data, blood samples, and tissue on&#xD;
      subjects with pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cysts,&#xD;
      pancreatitis, diabetic controls, jaundice/biliary obstruction controls, and otherwise healthy&#xD;
      controls. A SPORE is an NCI-funded, Specialized Program in Research Excellence, with specific&#xD;
      requirements. Those requirements include 4 projects with a clinical and a basic science Co-PI&#xD;
      and several COREs, including a biospecimen core. Each project that has a human subjects&#xD;
      component will require a separate protocol and IRB submission when those projects are to&#xD;
      begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific populations we are recruiting are determined by the aims of project 2 and by the&#xD;
      need to create a repository as part of the biospecimen core (please see the grant for details&#xD;
      on the aims of these 2 projects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specially designed database is being built for this study to handle the data aspects. Our&#xD;
      collaborators at Dartmouth College have significant experience in managing data as they have&#xD;
      been our partners for our work in the EDRN (PI Brenner). Case report forms and other data&#xD;
      collection tools have been developed and are being used to populate the database. All of the&#xD;
      actual data will be completely deidentified per HIPAA regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to model the data and specimen collection on the model used by our work with the&#xD;
      NCI-EDRN. This includes a customized database, the use of kits with pre-labled, bar-coded&#xD;
      aliquots, and standardized data collection forms (CRFs).&#xD;
