        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, aged 18-65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reliable history of rhinoconjunctivitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis plus controlled&#xD;
             asthma on exposure to ragweed allergen for at least 2 years and required symptomatic&#xD;
             treatment for at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test (SPT) to Ambrosia artemisiifolia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) against Ambrosia artemisiifolia &gt;0.35 kU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin test to any confounding, co-existing seasonal allergens likely to be&#xD;
             present during the Pre-season baseline and ragweed pollen periods (grasses,&#xD;
             miscellaneous weeds, fall trees) and who have received medication for these&#xD;
             confounding seasonal allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical records of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or asthma due to an&#xD;
             allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed (moulds, dust mites, cockroaches,&#xD;
             and animal dander) and have received medication for these perennial allergies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of severe drug allergy, severe angioedema or anaphylactic&#xD;
             reaction to food or previous SPT for any allergen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of any significant disease or disorder (e.g., cardiovascular,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, immunopathological,&#xD;
             musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic, malignant, psychiatric, major physical&#xD;
             impairment) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may influence the subject's&#xD;
             ability to participate in this study.&#xD;
