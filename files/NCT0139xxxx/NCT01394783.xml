  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year thousands of neonates born in North America need extensive resuscitation which&#xD;
      often includes endotracheal intubation (ETI). In these situations, Pediatricians assume the&#xD;
      role of Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) providers and are responsible of the ETI&#xD;
      procedure. They acquire this skill during residency training in the Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (NICU) and the delivery room. Difficulties in performing neonatal ETI lie in the small&#xD;
      size of the mouth and airway of the neonate, and their particular anatomy of the larynx. This&#xD;
      limited visibility represents a challenge even for the experienced clinician. Recently, a new&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope (VL) technique has been introduced to the adult and pediatric medical&#xD;
      fields as described respectively by Kaplan et al. and Weiss et al. In 2009, Vanderhal et al.&#xD;
      reported a preliminary experience in the newborn population. Video assisted intubation could&#xD;
      be a method of choice in teaching neonatal ETI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is no human study comparing the VL to the classic&#xD;
      laryngoscope (CL) for acquiring the skill of neonatal ETI in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess if the videolaryngoscope is superior to the classic laryngoscope in acquiring&#xD;
           the neonatal endotracheal intubation skill in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess if once the skill is acquired with the videolaryngoscope this experience is&#xD;
           transferable to the use of the classic laryngoscope by showing a persistent difference&#xD;
           in success rate in favor of the videolaryngoscope group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, use of the videolaryngoscope will increase success&#xD;
           rate of endotracheal intubation by 20% compared to the classic laryngoscope. Later,&#xD;
           acquired experience from the videolaryngoscope will be transferable to the use of the&#xD;
           classic laryngoscope by showing a persistent difference in success rate of 20% in favor&#xD;
           of the videolaryngoscope group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary hypothesis We expect that the videolaryngoscope will decrease time to&#xD;
           intubation, and decrease rate of esophageal and right bronchial main stem intubations.&#xD;
           It will also improve teaching of endotracheal intubations to pediatric residents by&#xD;
           helping supervisors recognize problems related to intubation and by improving residents'&#xD;
           level of confidence in performing the skill.&#xD;

      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator will approach all pediatric residents to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Parents of children will be approached by the principal investigator or the clinical research&#xD;
      coordinator either antenatal or on admission to the NICU in the case of an eventual need for&#xD;
      the infant of ETI. If the consent is made antenatally, we will insure that it is done by a&#xD;
      different physician than the one performing the antenatal consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training to ETI&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our centre, residents learn neonatal ETI in the simulation centre at CHU Ste-Justine as&#xD;
      first year residents when they are taught the NRP at the end of June every year, one week&#xD;
      before starting residency training. The procedure is explained and demonstrated on a&#xD;
      mannequin (Laerdal Neonatal Intubation Trainer) using the CL by a neonatologist and then&#xD;
      residents practice on the same mannequin a couple of times (3-5). Further training is done in&#xD;
      the clinical setting on real patients in an opportunistic manner. In both situations, they&#xD;
      are supervised by a neonatologist or a senior subspecialty resident who will guide, coach and&#xD;
      give them constructive feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents who consent to the study will be trained to the use of the VL before randomization.&#xD;
      This teaching session will be done similarly to the one described above. The procedure will&#xD;
      be explained and demonstrated on a mannequin (Laerdal Neonatal Intubation Trainer) by the&#xD;
      principal investigator using the VL and then residents will be offered to practice handling&#xD;
      the VL and practice ETI on the same mannequin a couple of times (3-5). They will be&#xD;
      supervised by the principal investigator who will guide, coach and give them constructive&#xD;
      feedback. This process is to insure that residents depart with the same level of comfort (or&#xD;
      discomfort) as the CL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETI procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our unit, there are about two to three residents on service at a time. When a patient&#xD;
      needs to be intubated priority goes to the resident who is in charge of that patient. In the&#xD;
      case where the physician in charge is the neonatologist, the subspecialty resident or the&#xD;
      nurse practitioner than a draw is done to decide which resident will proceed to the ETI. The&#xD;
      pediatric resident is the first person to attempt an ETI and he is allowed three attempts. If&#xD;
      he fails, the subspecialty resident, the respiratory therapist or the neonatologist proceed&#xD;
      with the ETI. In the case of an urgent ETI (respiratory or cardiovascular instability,&#xD;
      resuscitation, cardiovascular arrest, etc.) or complications during attempts by the resident,&#xD;
      the senior physician (subspecialty resident or neonatologist) will proceed with the ETI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each ETI procedure, there is a resident, a neonatologist or a subspecialty resident, a&#xD;
      nurse and a respiratory therapist. For the study, we will have a second respiratory therapist&#xD;
      to assess our primary and secondary outcomes (using a stopwatch) and to collect the necessary&#xD;
      data. About six respiratory therapists will be trained for this role, two per 8 hour shift.&#xD;
      Monitoring of the child is done using a non invasive arterial blood pressure, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and a pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices used for the study will be the CL using Miller blades (size 0 and 1), and the&#xD;
      C-MAC VL (blades size 0 and 1) developed by Karl Storz Endoscopy. The VL will be used to&#xD;
      proceed to ETI indirectly with the use of the video monitor for guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication for ETI consists of a bolus of atropine 20 mcg/kg IV, fentanyl 2-5 mcg/kg&#xD;
      diluted in 1 cc total of normal saline and given IV over 3 to 5 minutes, followed by a bolus&#xD;
      of 2 mg/kg of IV succinylcholine. Facemask ventilation and preoxygenation is done before and&#xD;
      between every attempt. After ETI, confirmation is done by auscultation and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      detector, and a chest x-ray is performed to assess position of the tip of the endotracheal&#xD;
      tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intubation is a success if the endotracheal tube is placed in the trachea under the&#xD;
           vocal cords It is defined according to usual clinical norms: change in color of the&#xD;
           carbon dioxide detector, vapor in the endotracheal tube, thoracic expansion, assessment&#xD;
           of bilateral lung air entry, absence of air entry in the stomach by auscultation, and&#xD;
           improvement of patient's clinical parameters: heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to intubation is defined as the time from insertion of the laryngoscope blade in&#xD;
           the patients' mouth until it is pulled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Esophageal intubation is diagnosed when there is absence of clinical signs of a&#xD;
           successful endotracheal intubation and possibly air entry in the stomach by&#xD;
           auscultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Right bronchial main stem intubation is diagnosed on chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A trial is counted as an attempt if there has been insertion of the laryngoscope blade&#xD;
           in the patient's mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for each intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient: gestational age at birth, birth weight, sex of infant, post natal age, current&#xD;
           weight, required inspired fraction of oxygen, number of ventilated days and number of&#xD;
           previous intubations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intubator: training level, past training experience in pediatrics or neonatology, number&#xD;
           of completed rotations in neonatology, and number of neonatal intubations tried,&#xD;
           succeeded and failed in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intubation: date (later categorized into weekday and week-end), time (later categorized&#xD;
           into day (8h-17h), evening (17h-00h) and night (00h-8h)), indication of intubation, semi&#xD;
           urgent or elective intubation, number of attempts, length of each attempt, intubator for&#xD;
           each attempt, final position of the tip of the endotracheal tube (including right&#xD;
           bronchial main stem intubation), reason for failed intubation (including esophageal&#xD;
           intubation), naso or orotracheal intubation, premedication used including doses and&#xD;
           supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A survey will be distributed to the resident and the supervisor after each ETI event.&#xD;
           The survey will assess the residents' level of confidence in attempting the ETI and will&#xD;
           ask the supervisor the level of easiness in recognizing problems with laryngoscopy,&#xD;
           endotracheal tube insertion and placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, randomization will be done by distributing sealed envelopes and will be&#xD;
      stratified according to the year of residency training. Residents will initially be&#xD;
      randomized to intubate either with the videolaryngoscope (experimental group) or the&#xD;
      classical laryngoscope (control group). In a second phase, all students will use the CL for&#xD;
      ETI. Each resident is expected to perform at least five and a maximum of ten ETI per method.&#xD;
      When a resident has reached ten ETI with the VL, he will change to the CL method. We are&#xD;
      planning to obtain 100 ETI in each four groups for a total of 400 ETI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of data analysis and sample size estimates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the CL, the residents in our centre obtained a success rate of ETI of 55% (unpublished&#xD;
      data). Assuming an increase of 20% of the success rate to 75% in the experimental group (VL),&#xD;
      with an α level of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%, we need 89 ETI per group. In the&#xD;
      second phase, to show a 20% higher success rate in the experimental group (75%) than in the&#xD;
      control group (55%) with the same statistical conditions, we need 89 more ETI per group for a&#xD;
      total of 356 ETI. In the study, we plan to obtain 100 ETI per group for a total of 400 ETI.&#xD;
      In our centre there are approximately 500 ETI a year. Of these, 20% (100) are done in the&#xD;
      delivery room and another 20% (100) are done by the subspecialty resident, neonatologist or&#xD;
      respiratory therapist because of urgency or difficulty of intubation. Considering a rate of&#xD;
      patient recruitment of 60-75%, the study should be completed in 2 years.&#xD;
