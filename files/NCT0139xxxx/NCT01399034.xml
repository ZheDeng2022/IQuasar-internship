  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is (1) to identify changes in gene expression and DNA&#xD;
      methylation status in subjects who exhibit advanced chronic periodontal inflammation and (2)&#xD;
      to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) and the interactive pathways associated with obesity as a&#xD;
      modifier of periodontal infection pathogenesis.&#xD;

      Aim 1. To determine whether diseased periodontal tissues biopsied from patients with&#xD;
      periodontal disease will have altered DNA methylation patterns of selected genes as compared&#xD;
      to the DNA methylation status biopsies obtained from adjacent, non-diseased periodontal&#xD;
      sites, as well as periodontal biopsy samples obtained from non-diseased, healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine the role of tissue DNA Methylation on mRNA expression:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2a. To determine whether alterations in tissue mRNA expression (as determined by&#xD;
           quantitative PCR) are associated with an aberrant DNA methylation status of respective&#xD;
           gene promoter CpG islands in tissue biopsy samples obtained from diseased and&#xD;
           non-diseased tissues from patients with periodontal disease and from non-diseased&#xD;
           healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2b. By performing laser capture microdissection of biopsy samples from diseased patients&#xD;
           [(epithelium, connective tissue and inflammatory infiltrate)] we seek to determine&#xD;
           cellular patterns of mRNA expression and DNA methylation of targeted genes comparing&#xD;
           inflamed to non-inflamed sites within diseased patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2c. We will perform in vitro studies to analyze whether gingival fibroblasts from&#xD;
           patients with periodontal disease will show a differential methylation pattern and&#xD;
           whether these cells will display a differential inflammatory response when compared to&#xD;
           control fibroblasts isolated from healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. The aim of this pilot investigation was to determine if miRNA expression differed in&#xD;
      the presence or absence of obesity, comparing gingival biopsies obtained from patients with&#xD;
      or without periodontal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3a. To determine whether diseased periodontal tissues biopsied from patients with&#xD;
           periodontal disease will influence the level of miRNA expression as compared to the&#xD;
           biopsies obtained from non-diseased, healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3b. To determine whether BMI [nonobese subjects BMI &lt;30kg/m2, obese subjects &gt;30kg/m2]&#xD;
           will influence the level of miRNA expression in biopsies from diseased periodontal&#xD;
           tissues as compared to periodontal biopsy samples obtained from non-diseased, healthy&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival samples, gingival crevicular fluid, saliva and plaque samples will be collected and&#xD;
      a periodontal examination will be performed. The periodontal assessment will record pocket&#xD;
      depth, clinical attachment level and percent bleeding on probing. Blood pressure, height and&#xD;
      weight (Body Mass Index assessment) will be obtained on participants as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue gene expression by quantitative PCR and DNA methylation sequence analysis, proteomic&#xD;
      analyses of gingival crevicular fluid, Differential Methylation Hybridization and, microRNA&#xD;
      expression profile by Human miRNA Microarray and Real-time PCR quantification will all be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

        Faculty Practice at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry and if needed from&#xD;
        the general population. Subjects must present with either chronic periodontitis or&#xD;
