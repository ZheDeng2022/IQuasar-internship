      The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (COPD) Study aims to characterize the pulmonary vascular changes and their biology in early&#xD;
      COPD using imaging, gene expression profiling and peripheral cellular measures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the US&#xD;
      and will soon replace stroke as the third leading cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation of promising biological hypotheses of COPD pathogenesis to human populations that&#xD;
      may lead to new therapies is urgently needed. The vascular hypothesis of COPD was articulated&#xD;
      almost 50 years ago. Bench research on endothelial dysfunction in COPD is evolving rapidly&#xD;
      and has shown that acrolein in cigarette smoke causes endothelial apoptosis and endothelial&#xD;
      apoptosis is directly implicated in COPD pathogenesis. Clinical studies on endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and vascular changes in COPD are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a longitudinal study of smokers nested among the MESA-Lung (AAAA7791)&#xD;
      and EMphysema and Cancer Action Project (EMCAP) Studies (AAAA6484), which together provide a&#xD;
      well-defined cohort of 4,617 participants with prior spirometry and CT measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (MESA COPD&#xD;
      Study) has two main scientific purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. characterize the pulmonary vascular changes in COPD and their biology, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. propose novel pathways for new therapies in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MESA COPD is a longitudinal study of smokers nested within the MESA-Lung and EMCAP cohorts of&#xD;
      360 participants (160 cases with mild, 60 cases with moderate and 40 cases with severe COPD&#xD;
      and 100 controls) who will be phenotyped with magnetic resonance (MR) pulmonary angiography,&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing, full-lung CT scans, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor&#xD;
      (VEGF), cell assays and gene expression profiling. MESA COPD Study will contribute improving&#xD;
      the knowledge of early changes in COPD that may lead to novel disease-modifying medical&#xD;
      therapies and preventative strategies.&#xD;

      Blood will be stored at Columbia and at University of Vermont, identified only by study ID&#xD;
      and following standard procedures. It will be accessible only to study investigators and, if&#xD;
      the participant approves, outside investigators following MESA/NIH protocols and with IRB&#xD;
      approval. Blood will be kept indefinitely.&#xD;

        Approximately Study Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        MESA COPD will recruit approximately 360 participants from EMCAP at Columbia, and from MESA&#xD;
        at Columbia; JH University; North Western University; and University of California.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases will be defined according to the current American Thoracic Society/European&#xD;
        Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) definition of COPD of a post-bronchodilator capacity&#xD;
        (FEV1/FVC) ratio &lt; 0.70 and classified as mild, moderate and severe as post-bronchodilator&#xD;
        FEV1 of 80-100% predicted, 50-80% predicted and &lt; 50% predicted, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls will be defined in the above sampling frame as those with normal lung function&#xD;
        (pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &gt;= 0.70, and no restrictive ventilatory defect.&#xD;
