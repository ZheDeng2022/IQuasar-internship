      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is looking at the long-term health effects of farming&#xD;
      exposures including pesticides, crops, and animals. The chronic health effects of exposure to&#xD;
      pesticides are easier to study in farmers and their spouses. They know what chemicals they&#xD;
      use and tend to live in the same place for most of their adult lives. AHS participants are&#xD;
      expected to report any changes in their health. This includes any new medical conditions.&#xD;
      Researchers want to follow up on these reports to confirm their accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To follow up AHS participants who have self-reported that they have a new disease and&#xD;
      confirm their diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Current AHS participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will confirm self-reported changes in medical conditions by contacting the&#xD;
           AHS participant to ask for more information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The AHS participant will give permission for researchers to contact their doctor to look&#xD;
           at their medical records. They will also be asked to provide a cheek swab or saliva&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diseases of interest are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Sjogren s Syndrome. Other&#xD;
           diseases will be followed up in the future. Other diseases will be followed up in the&#xD;
           future....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pesticides are a common environmental exposure due to their widespread use for agricultural,&#xD;
      residential, and public health purposes. Farmers and their families represent a unique&#xD;
      population for studying the chronic health effects of pesticides because farmers know what&#xD;
      chemicals they use, furthermore, farmers tend to remain at the same location over most of&#xD;
      their adult life. The Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a cohort of approximately 89,000&#xD;
      pesticide applicators and spouses from Iowa and North Carolina, is the largest US cohort&#xD;
      study of individuals working with pesticides. The AHS cohort was enrolled in 1993 to 1997 to&#xD;
      assess human health effects associated with well-characterized exposures to pesticides and&#xD;
      other agricultural factors. Detailed exposure data were collected at enrollment and in two&#xD;
      five-year follow-up interviews. As a result, the AHS has a wealth of information on pesticide&#xD;
      use by both farmers and their spouses, as well as the ability to account for changes in&#xD;
      pesticide use over time. Information on medical history and important covariates was also&#xD;
      collected at enrollment and in the follow-up interviews, and will continue to be collected&#xD;
      over time.Only mortality and cancer incidence are updated annually through linkage to vital&#xD;
      statistics and cancer registries; all other health outcomes are based on self-reported&#xD;
      information from participants.The accuracy of self-reported health outcome information can&#xD;
      vary from quite good (e.g., asthma) to poor (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). In order to ensure&#xD;
      high quality epidemiologic analyses, validation of self-reported disease is necessary prior&#xD;
      to statistical analysis. To date, several health endpoints have been validated through&#xD;
      follow-up with AHS participants and their physicians. The purpose of the current protocol is&#xD;
      three-fold: 1) update information on medical history and other important covariates through&#xD;
      ongoing follow-up interviews of the cohort; 2) validate self-reported diseases among cohort&#xD;
      participants over the duration of cohort follow-up (at least through 2020); and 3) complete&#xD;
      initial contact of potential participants to inform them of other health outcome studies&#xD;
      being conducted within the cohort by an outside institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will contact AHS cohort members to complete a follow-up interview allowing one of three&#xD;
      modes of response: self-administered paper questionnaire, self-administered web survey&#xD;
      (CAWI), and interviewer-administered telephone interview (CATI). We will contact proxy&#xD;
      respondents if the participant is unable to provide information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will validate a variety of diseases of interest as they are ascertained in the cohort.&#xD;
      While the characteristics of the diseases may vary, the strategy for disease validation is&#xD;
      similar to the cohort wide follow-up. Validation efforts may also include a request for&#xD;
      permission to contact the participant s physician, and contacting the physician s office to&#xD;
      obtain the relevant medical information. We will contact proxy respondents if the participant&#xD;
      is unable to provide information.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All members of the AHS cohort who were eligible for the Phase 3 interview were eligible for&#xD;
        the Phase 4 health follow-up. We will apply the same eligibility criteria for future&#xD;
        cohort-wide follow-ups. Individuals who only completed the enrollment questionnaire were&#xD;
        excluded from Phase 3 eligibility. Depending upon the disease outcome of interest, we may&#xD;
        conduct the disease confirmation and validation efforts under this protocol among all&#xD;
        participants in the AHS who provided self-reported diagnoses at any interview (e.g.&#xD;
        Baseline, or Phases 2-4). For individuals who are unable to participate, we will allow a&#xD;
        proxy to provide the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the validation efforts, individuals who do not confirm their diagnosis of interest (via&#xD;
        self or proxy report) will not be asked to provide physician contact for medical records.&#xD;
        For specimen collection, we will ask the proxy respondent about whether the individual&#xD;
        would be able to provide a sample. In order to obtain MRR we will allow the participant or&#xD;
        their medical proxy to sign the form. For cases who are cognitively impaired or deceased, a&#xD;
        medical proxy will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Determination of cognitive impairment will be made by report of proxy or by interviewer&#xD;
        during conversation with participant. Because the AHS enrolled husband - wife pairs, we&#xD;
        should be able to identify an appropriate proxy for most participants.&#xD;
