    <textblock>
      Studies conducted assessing diabetic eye disease have shown a progression of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy with rapid improvement of glycemic control during pregnancy and in patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. It is also well documented that bariatric surgery may result in rapid&#xD;
      improvement of glycemic control in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge the&#xD;
      progression of diabetic eye disease seen in pregnancy and type 1 diabetes has not been&#xD;
      studied in obese type 2 diabetics undergoing bariatric surgery. To this end, this study will&#xD;
      examine the effects of rapid glycemic control which is seen in type 2 diabetics following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery on the progression of diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;

      Participants will be referred from the Department of Bariatric Surgery at NYU. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to enroll 50 patients in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline eye exam will be conducted prior to surgery. Data, such as preoperative HbA1c&#xD;
      level, weight, BMI, duration and control of diabetes, current medication regimen, and the&#xD;
      grade of retinopathy will be noted. Study participants will have a baseline eye exam within&#xD;
      three months of the scheduled surgery, followed by regular follow-up visits at 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 9 months, and 1 year. At each visit the following measures will be assessed: (1)&#xD;
      weight, (2) blood pressure, (3) glycemic control as assessed by HbA1C, (4)level of&#xD;
      retinopathy, and (5) visual acuity using the EDTRS acuity chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye examinations will consist of a measure of best-corrected visual acuity, slit lamp&#xD;
      examination to assess pressure, and a dilated funduscopic examination to determine the&#xD;
      presence and/or level of retinopathy. The level of retinopathy will be characterized as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (0)None, (1) Mild, (2) Moderate, (3) Severe, and (4) Proliferative. In addition, the presence&#xD;
      or absence of cystoid macular edema (CME) will be noted as (a) no CME or (b) CME present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit, a baseline questionnaire will be given to participants to gather&#xD;
      background information on demographics and pertinent medical history. During each follow up&#xD;
      visit, an additional questionnaire will be given to monitor changes in factors such as&#xD;
      medications, blood pressure, and weight that may occur after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c measurements will be checked every 3 months in accordance with current standard of care&#xD;
      recommendations. Due to established evidence of rapid improvement in glycemic control shortly&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery, it is essential that the investigators have this lab data and&#xD;
      perform funduscopic examinations at these intervals, to monitor improvement in glycemic&#xD;
      control ascertain associations between changes in HbA1c levels and progression of&#xD;
      retinopathy.&#xD;
