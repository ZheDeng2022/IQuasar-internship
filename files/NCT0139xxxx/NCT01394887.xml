      Hypothesis. To determine the effect of metformin on the concentrations of resistin and other&#xD;
      insulin resistance or inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, cytokines, body weight,&#xD;
      HbA1c, among others) in minors with glucose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with glucose intolerance are given either metformin or placebo for 12 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High sensitivity C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL1-beta, resistin, leptin,&#xD;
      adiponectin, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile and transaminases are measured at the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of the period. Statistical analysis: t Student test; Friedman and&#xD;
      Kruskal Wallis test are used. Variables are adjusted for: sex, age, baseline BMI and&#xD;
      percentage weight change.&#xD;

      Experimental, double-blind, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled study. Patients aged&#xD;
      4-17 years old are selected from the endocrine outpatient clinic of the Hospital de Pediatria&#xD;
      del CMN &quot;Siglo XXI&quot;, and both patients and parents sign informed consent. They are scheduled&#xD;
      for a fasting oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 1.75 mg/kg of oral glucose. A blood&#xD;
      sample is taken from antecubital vein at baseline and 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high carbohydrate diet is indicated for 3 days prior to the test. All patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with glucose intolerance are invited to participate. All followed an aerobic program of 30 to&#xD;
      45 minutes every day, an isocaloric diet from the moment of inclusion throughout the study&#xD;
      period, in order to decrease the effect of nutrition modification in the metabolic and&#xD;
      vascular parameters. A complete medical history is taken, recording family background of&#xD;
      diabetes plus blood pressure, heart rate and Tanner stage13. Age, body weight, height, waist&#xD;
      circumference are measured and recorded in percentile according to age and gender, and the&#xD;
      body mass index is calculated (kg/m2), and recorded in percentile according to reference&#xD;
      values of the Center for the Disease Control, Atlanta, GA14. Subjects are randomized for&#xD;
      metformin or placebo. Both metformin and placebo are placed in capsules with gelatin to blind&#xD;
      their aspect. Treatments are administered during 3 months. Children are evaluated monthly,&#xD;
      measuring transaminases, glucose, creatinine, and uric acid. Measurements of C reactive&#xD;
      protein, cytokines, adipokines, insulin concentrations, HbA1c levels and lipid profile are&#xD;
      made at the beginning and end of the study. Insulin resistance was assayed by HOMA-IR index.&#xD;
      Beta cell function is determined by using HOMA-β. These are complemented with an evaluation&#xD;
      of diet, physical activity, and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignment: Two groups are formed, randomly assigned using a table of random&#xD;
      numbers previously designed with the Epistat statistic package (Round Rock, Texas). When the&#xD;
      screening finished, every child receives a consecutive number. This number corresponds to an&#xD;
      envelope with a card identifying his/her medication flasks, containing 60 tablets of 850 mg&#xD;
      or placebo. The content of the capsules is not identified, so both the physician and the&#xD;
      patient are blinded. A blinded member of the study prepared the flasks and labeled them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take the capsules twice daily, at breakfast and dinner. They are instructed to&#xD;
      take medication with meals in order to decrease the possibility of adverse effects (nausea,&#xD;
      meteorism, diarrhea), which are checked during every visit. Hepatic function is monitored&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FPG, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, liver function tests and creatinine&#xD;
      are measured using the Synchron CX analyzer (Beckman Systems, Fullerton CA), according to the&#xD;
      standard protocols. The coefficients of variation for cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol are&#xD;
      3.3% and 2.5% respectively. Plasma leptin, adiponectin and insulin concentrations are&#xD;
      measured in duplicate by radioinmmunoassay (Linco Research Inc, St Charles, MO). HbA1c is&#xD;
      determined in whole blood using ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (normal&#xD;
      range 4-6). Plasma resistin is measured using Human Resistin Elisa Kit (PeproTech, Rock Hill,&#xD;
      NJ, USA) read by Multiscan EX, Lab Systems, USA). Plasma IL-6, IL1-b, TNF-α concentrations&#xD;
      are determined by ELISA using Quantike HS Human Immunoassay Kits (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis,&#xD;
      MN, USA), plasma C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is measured using a highly sensitive human CRP&#xD;
      ELISA Kit (Alpha diagnostic international, San Antonio, TX, USA ) according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions and are read by an ELISA reader (Sunrise, Tecan USA, Durham&#xD;
      NC,USA).&#xD;
