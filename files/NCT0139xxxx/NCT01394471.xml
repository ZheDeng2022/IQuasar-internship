      Purpose: Test whether intranasal administration of the neuropeptide, oxytocin, improves&#xD;
      social cognition, psychotic symptoms and social functioning in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 80 adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder for at least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Oxytocin or placebo will be administered twice daily in an intranasal&#xD;
      spray for 12 weeks. Before, during and at the end of the trial, each subject will undergo&#xD;
      psychiatric symptom ratings and tests of mental abilities used in social functioning,&#xD;
      cognition, and social competence.&#xD;

      Overview of Procedures: All procedures will be conducted at the UNC Hospitals Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Research Center (CTRC) outpatient clinic or at the outpatient North Carolina&#xD;
      Psychiatric Research Center (NCPRC), a specialized program of the University of North&#xD;
      Carolina Center for Excellence in Community Mental Health in Raleigh, NC. Except for&#xD;
      Screening, all clinic visits will begin between 0800-1000 hours and subjects will have fasted&#xD;
      since midnight. Approximately 10 minutes after checking into the clinic, subjects' weight and&#xD;
      vital signs will be measured followed by blood and urine sample collection. Breakfast will&#xD;
      then be served. At regular intervals during each clinic visit, subjects will be allowed to&#xD;
      rest for 15-20 minutes. Lunch will also be provided for the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessment: During the initial clinic visit and after giving informed consent,&#xD;
      prospective subjects' psychiatric and medical histories will be reviewed, physical exams&#xD;
      conducted, EKGs run and blood and urine collected for complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
      electrolytes, liver/renal function tests, TSH, glucose, urinalysis (UA), pregnancy test, and&#xD;
      urine drug screen (UDS). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV will be administered to&#xD;
      confirm diagnoses if one not on record within the past two years. The WRAT will be&#xD;
      administered to determine reading ability as well as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test&#xD;
      (Eyes Test) to determine if subjects meet the social cognition criterion for impairment.&#xD;
      Finally, PANSS and Calgary Depression Scale ratings will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Treatment Week 6 and 12 assessments: All of the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be obtained during clinic visits at Baseline (occurring within 1 week after the&#xD;
      Screening assessment) and at the end of the treatment trial (12-week time point). Some of the&#xD;
      outcome measures will be obtained at a clinic visit at the 6-week time point during the&#xD;
      treatment trial. Subjects will arrive at the clinic between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. for each of&#xD;
      these visits where they will be given breakfast. At Baseline, administration of assessments&#xD;
      will begin 10 min after completion of breakfast. At the 6 and 12-week clinic visits,&#xD;
      assessments will begin 50 min after intranasal administration of test treatment (which will&#xD;
      be given before breakfast-see details below). The primary outcomes are social cognition&#xD;
      measures (details below): emotion recognition (ER-40, Eyes Test), theory of mind (Eyes Test,&#xD;
      Br√ºne test), social perception (Trustworthiness Task) and attributional style (AIHQ). The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (details below) are social functioning (SLOF), social skill (role plays),&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms (PANSS), paranoia (Green Paranoia Thought Scale), empathy (IRI),&#xD;
      non-social cognition (RBANS), anxiety (Liebowitz social anxiety scale) depression (Calgary&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale), social perception (IPT-15) and food cravings (Food Craving&#xD;
      Inventory and Night Eating Questionnaire). While we ultimately want to improve social&#xD;
      functioning, we acknowledge that this domain might be slower to improve than social&#xD;
      cognition, thus rendering it a secondary rather than primary outcome (and for that reason, we&#xD;
      are assessing social functioning only at baseline and week 12 (end of treatment)). We&#xD;
      included non-social cognition in the battery to assess whether treatment effects on social&#xD;
      cognition generalize to other domains of cognition. A similar sentiment underlies our&#xD;
      inclusion of symptoms (both psychotic and general) in the battery, as the value of OT may be&#xD;
      enhanced if it can impact symptoms that might ultimately interfere with treatment engagement.&#xD;
      Finally, we included empathy because of the relationship with theory of mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test substance administration and other procedures during the treatment trial: During the&#xD;
      treatment trial, subjects will self-administer test treatments twice daily; before breakfast&#xD;
      and before dinner. Each treatment consists of 6 insufflations (each 0.1 ml) of Syntocinon&#xD;
      Spray (Novartis), which contains 24 international units of OT, or placebo solution containing&#xD;
      all of the ingredients in Syntocinon Spray except OT. Blind-labeled test treatment vials will&#xD;
      be dispensed following a randomization scheme permuted in blocks of 4, stratified by gender,&#xD;
      as oxytocin often has different effects in males and females, in animals and in humans.&#xD;
      Subjects will self administer test treatments from 60 ml spray vials (ejecting 0.1 ml per&#xD;
      spray) initially containing 35 ml of test substance. Each vial contains enough solution for 3&#xD;
      weeks of self administration. Subjects will receive their first vial of test treatment right&#xD;
      after assessments are complete at the Baseline clinic visit. They will be instructed in&#xD;
      intranasal self administration and care of test vials at that time and given written&#xD;
      instructions on these matters. They will take their first intranasal test dose under the&#xD;
      observation of research nurses before leaving the clinic. Before leaving the clinic, subjects&#xD;
      will be given a card with the date of their return appointment in one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic at the 2, 6, 9 and 12 week time points during the&#xD;
      treatment period. At the 2, and 9-week visits, subjects will have a brief visit with a study&#xD;
      clinician who will assess side effects, perform a mental status examination, administer the&#xD;
      PANSS and CGI. Spot urine pregnancy tests will also be done at the 2 and 9 week visits. At&#xD;
      the baseline, 6 and 12-wk time points, subjects will arrive at the clinic between 8:00 and&#xD;
      10:00 a.m., having fasted overnight. Before eating breakfast, weight and vital sign&#xD;
      measurements will be obtained along with blood and urine samples. Blood collected at baseline&#xD;
      will be used to measure serum glucose and lipids and urine will be used to screen for&#xD;
      pregnancy in women and for drug screening in all subjects. Blood and urine samples obtained&#xD;
      at the 6 and 12-week time points will be used for the same measures obtained at the Screening&#xD;
      visit. EKG will also be repeated at the 6 and 12-week time points. Prior to breakfast at the&#xD;
      6 and 12-wk time point visits, subjects will self-administer their morning dose while&#xD;
      observed by a research nurse to be sure the process is being done correctly. To obtain plasma&#xD;
      for later assay of OT concentrations, blood will be drawn 40 minutes after the morning test&#xD;
      dose into a chilled EDTA vacutainer tube which will be immediately placed in an ice bath and&#xD;
      spun down within 20 minutes. Plasma samples will be stored at ultralow temperatures. OT&#xD;
      levels may reflect individual variability in OT absorption and metabolism and will be a&#xD;
      covariate in statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 50 minutes after the morning test dose (6 and 12-week treatment time points),&#xD;
      primary and secondary measures will be re-administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will bring their used test treatment vial to the clinic visits at the 2, 6, 9 and&#xD;
      12-week time points during the treatment trial. At the 2, 6 and 9 wk time points, subjects&#xD;
      will be given a fresh test treatment intranasal spray vial from which they will continue&#xD;
      twice daily self administration until the next visit. Subjects may be given two vials at the&#xD;
      two week visit to ensure they have enough study medication until their week 6 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be called for two days following the baseline visit to remind them to take&#xD;
      their study medication. They will then be called weekly for reminders for the remainder of&#xD;
      the study (combined with check in call).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization plan: The statistician (Dr. Hamer) will generate a randomization plan for&#xD;
      randomizing 27 subjects to OT treatment and 27 subjects to placebo treatment using PROC PLAN&#xD;
      in SAS Version 9.2. We will use a blocksize of 4 within each sex so that every 4 subject's&#xD;
      randomization to the two groups will be equalized. The statistician will then export the&#xD;
      randomization plan to a spreadsheet, which the data manager will import as a table into the&#xD;
      study data management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject is to be randomized, an authorized investigator (the data management systems&#xD;
      we design allow different levels of functioning for each investigator) who does not need to&#xD;
      be blinded will obtain the randomization number from the data management system. This&#xD;
      authorized investigator will then contact the investigational drug service to give them the&#xD;
      randomization number, and collect the appropriate medication from the investigational drug&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of test treatments: Dr. Pedersen has an IND exemption (#77,774) from the FDA to treat&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia with intranasal OT spray obtained from overseas pharmacies. The&#xD;
      IND exemption is necessary because intranasal OT spray (Syntocinon Spray) has not been&#xD;
      marketed in the USA since 1997 when Novartis let FDA approval of the product lapse for&#xD;
      financial reasons (the product was not being prescribed frequently enough in this country to&#xD;
      warrant the cost of maintaining FDA approval). Syntocinon Spray vials (5 ml) are ordered as&#xD;
      needed from an international pharmacy. Triangle Compounding Pharmacy (Cary, NC) prepares each&#xD;
      intranasal spray vial containing 35 ml of OT solution by decanting seven 5 ml Syntocinon&#xD;
      Spray vials into a 60 ml spray vial. Triangle Compounding also prepares identical 60 ml spray&#xD;
      vials containing 35 ml of a placebo solution that contains the same ingredients as Syntocinon&#xD;
      Spray except for OT. OT in Syntocinon Spray remains stable for at least 1 month at room&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and enhancing compliance: Change in 60 ml spray vial weight over each 3-4 weeks of&#xD;
      test treatment will be used to monitor subject compliance. Each insufflation (0.1 ml) should&#xD;
      decrease the vial weight by 0.1 gram. Subjects will be called each week day morning to remind&#xD;
      them to take their intranasal test treatment. Less than 75% of the anticipated decline in&#xD;
      vial weight may be grounds for termination from the study, especially if it occurs more than&#xD;
      once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring safety: Laboratory tests, EKGs and vital signs will be obtained at the 6 and&#xD;
      12-week time points. Abnormalities or adverse events may result in exclusion from further&#xD;
      participation. The Barnes, Simpson-Angus, and AIMS scales as well as a general side effects&#xD;
      checklist will assist in thorough assessment of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical evaluation Screening: During the initial clinic visit and after giving informed&#xD;
      consent, prospective subjects' psychiatric and medical histories will be reviewed, physical&#xD;
      exams conducted, EKGs run and blood and urine collected for CBC, electrolytes, liver/renal&#xD;
      function tests, TSH, glucose, UA, pregnancy test, and drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and during the treatment trial: An extensive set of lab values, EKGs and vital&#xD;
      signs will be obtained during clinic visits at 6 and 12 weeks during the test treatment&#xD;
      period (serum glucose and lipid measures will also be obtained at baseline). Subjects will&#xD;
      have been fasting since midnight and will have not yet taken their morning test dose when&#xD;
      their blood is drawn and urine collected shortly after they arrive for the baseline, week-6&#xD;
      and week-12 clinic visits. Running laboratory tests on blood and urine samples obtained in&#xD;
      the fasting state, at these time points, is optimal for rapid detection of negative effects&#xD;
      of OT treatment on subjects' physiology. It may also provide preliminary information about&#xD;
      the influence of OT on the adverse metabolic effects of the atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications that most subjects will be taking throughout the study period. Vital signs will&#xD;
      be repeated 2 hours after subjects take their morning intranasal test dose at the 6 and&#xD;
      12-week time points. Spot urine pregnancy tests will be obtained at screening, baseline, and&#xD;
      weeks 2, 6, 9 and 12 clinic visits during the treatment trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Cognition Measures (Primary outcomes) The Emotion Recognition-40 Task (ER-40, Kohler&#xD;
      et al 2004) consists of 40 faces presented sequentially on a computer screen along with the&#xD;
      choices of rating the face as happy, sad, anger, fear or no emotion. It uses racially and&#xD;
      ethnically diverse face images and is a psychometrically sound measure of social cognition in&#xD;
      this clinical population (Carter et al 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Br√ºne Theory of Mind Stories Task (Br√ºne 2003) involves a series of 6 sets of 4 cartoon&#xD;
      pictures that illustrate interactions between two or more individuals. The subject is asked&#xD;
      to rearrange the pictures, initially presented in an illogical sequence, in an order that&#xD;
      conveys a logical story. The period of time the subject takes to complete the task and the&#xD;
      accuracy of the sequencing is recorded. Then, after the subject correctly organizes the&#xD;
      pictures (which is done by the examiner if the subject's response is incorrect), the subject&#xD;
      is asked questions about the cartoon characters' own beliefs and beliefs of other characters&#xD;
      in the cartoons. The subject's interpretations of the characters' beliefs are scored as&#xD;
      correct or incorrect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (Eyes Test, Baron-Cohen et al 2001) consists of 36&#xD;
      photographs and participants are asked to guess the mental state (i.e. what the person is&#xD;
      thinking or feeling) from among 4 choice words. Participants are given a practice item to&#xD;
      ensure that they understand the task. Each eye region is presented on a note card or is&#xD;
      displayed on a computer screen with the four choice mental states shown in the four corners&#xD;
      of the card or computer screen (one target word and three foil words). There is no time&#xD;
      constraint in choosing the mental state. A glossary of the mental states is made available if&#xD;
      the participants are unsure of the meaning of a word. Performance is measured by the number&#xD;
      of faces correctly discriminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trustworthiness Task (Adolphs et al 1998) is comprised of 42 faces of unfamiliar people.&#xD;
      Participants will be shown each picture individually (on a computer monitor) and will be&#xD;
      asked to rate how much they would trust that person (i.e., with their money or their life) on&#xD;
      a 7-point scale, ranging from -3 (very untrustworthy) to +3 (very trustworthy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ, Combs et al 2007) is comprised of 15&#xD;
      short vignettes that reflect negative events that vary in intentionality (i.e., obvious,&#xD;
      accidental, and ambiguous intentions). Participants are asked to read each vignette, to&#xD;
      imagine the scenario happening to her/him (e.g., &quot;You walk past a bunch of teenagers at a&#xD;
      mall and you hear them start to laugh&quot;), and to write down the reason why the other person&#xD;
      (or persons) acted that way toward her/him (as a means of measuring attributions). Two&#xD;
      independent raters subsequently code this written response for the purpose of computing a&#xD;
      &quot;hostility bias&quot;. The participant then rates, on Likert scales, whether the other person (or&#xD;
      persons) performed the action on purpose (anchored by [1], definitely no, and [6], definitely&#xD;
      yes), how angry it would make her/him feel (anchored by [1], not at all angry, and [5], very&#xD;
      angry), and how much they would blame the other person (or persons) (anchored by [1], not at&#xD;
      all, and [5], very much). Finally, the participant is asked to write down how she/he would&#xD;
      respond to the situation, which is later coded by 2 independent raters to compute an&#xD;
      &quot;aggression index.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Function Measures (Secondary outcomes) The Specific Levels of Functioning Scale is a&#xD;
      30-item questionnaire that has recently been found to be an excellent measure of social and&#xD;
      general real-world functioning. The questionnaire has 2 social functioning subsections&#xD;
      (Interpersonal Relationships, Social Acceptability) and 2 community living skills subsections&#xD;
      (Activities, Work Skills). One version is completed by the subject and another is completed&#xD;
      by an informant, who will meet the following criteria: a) does not have a psychotic disorder,&#xD;
      b) is literate, c) has known the subject for at least 1 year, and d) spends time with the&#xD;
      subject on a regular basis (e.g., case worker, clinician, family member, caretaker). After&#xD;
      giving informed consent, these criteria will be reviewed with each prospective informant.&#xD;
      Informants will be compensated for each completed questionnaire. The informant questionnaire&#xD;
      asks how well she/he knows the affected participant. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale with anchors describing the frequency of the behavior and/or the patient's level of&#xD;
      independence. To informants understand each item on the SLOF, this instrument will be&#xD;
      administered by a member of the research team to the informant either in person or, if more&#xD;
      convenient, over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Competence test consists of two 90-second role-plays. The first role-play is an&#xD;
      unstructured conversation in which the research confederate plays the role of a new neighbor&#xD;
      with whom the subject is instructed to strike up a conversation. In the second role-play, the&#xD;
      research confederate plays an upset friend who the subject is instructed to attempt to&#xD;
      console. The role plays are recorded and later scored for conversational skills (e.g. overall&#xD;
      social skills; affect; speech content, etc) and ability to perceive distress in others (e.g.,&#xD;
      emotional empathy; cognitive empathy). We have used similar role plays in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cyberball Task is a computerized ball tossing game that investigates the effects of being&#xD;
      favored and/or ostracized on four fundamental needs; belonging, control, self-esteem, and&#xD;
      meaningful existence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Interpersonal Perception Task (IPT-15) is a video task that measures non-verbal&#xD;
      perception. It consists of a video of 15 brief scenes (28-122 seconds) with are paired with a&#xD;
      question with two or three possible answers, allowing the subject to &quot;decode&quot; something&#xD;
      important about the people in the scenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empathy and Motivation Measures (Secondary outcomes) The Interpersonal Reactivity Index of&#xD;
      empathy is a self-report measure of cognitive and affective empathy. The IRI consists of 28&#xD;
      items where participants rate how well each item describes them using a five point scale. The&#xD;
      28 items yield four subscales: perspective taking (PT), empathic concern (EC), fantasy (F),&#xD;
      and personal distress (PD). The PT subscale measures the tendency to take another's point of&#xD;
      view (e.g., &quot;I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look&#xD;
      from their perspective.&quot;). The EC subscale measures feelings of sympathy and concern for&#xD;
      others (e.g., &quot;I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.&quot;).&#xD;
      The F subscale measures the ability to imagine oneself in the role of a fictitious character&#xD;
      in books (e.g., &quot;When I am reading an interesting story or novel, I imagine how I would feel&#xD;
      if the events in the story were happening to me.&quot;). The PD subscale measures personal&#xD;
      feelings of anxiety and unease in interpersonal settings (e.g., &quot;Being in a tense emotional&#xD;
      situation scares me.&quot;). The IRI has been used previously to assess self-reported empathy in&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-social cognitive Measures (Secondary outcome) The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment&#xD;
      of Neuropsychological Status will be administered to measure cognitive abilities such as:&#xD;
      immediate memory, delayed memory, visual-spatial, language and attention. The assessment&#xD;
      takes about 20-25 minutes to complete and will be administered by a trained research&#xD;
      assistant. The RBANS will allow us to determine the relationship between neurocognitive&#xD;
      abilities and social cognitive abilities, particularly in regards to accuracy in theory of&#xD;
      mind testing and emotion perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric Measures (Secondary outcomes) The Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale is a&#xD;
      30-item scale on which an interviewer rates the subject for severity of positive and negative&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms, and general and symptoms after asking a standard series of questions.&#xD;
      Items are rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (severe), and yield five scaled scores:&#xD;
      positive symptoms, negative symptoms, dysphoric mood, activation, and autistic preoccupation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Green Paranoia Thought Scale consists of two 16-item scales to assess ideas of social&#xD;
      reference and persecution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Severity Scale is a widely used scale in schizophrenia&#xD;
      research for repeated evaluations of global psychopathology. The CGI-S is a single Likert&#xD;
      scale rating severity of psychopathology at the time of rating on a scale of 1 (normal, not&#xD;
      ill) to 7 (very severely ill). Patients are assessed on the basis of the rater's total&#xD;
      clinical experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Calgary Depression Rating Scale is an interviewer-rated measure of depression for&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale is a questionnaire that lists 24 social situations on&#xD;
      which the subject rates (0-3) how much fear/anxiety he/she would experience and how much&#xD;
      he/she would avoid each situation (0-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Measures Food Cravings and Night Eating Questionnaires. Atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications, (which most subjects will be taking), increase appetite and may contribute to&#xD;
      weight gain. Oxytocin is known to affect food intake in animals. Therefore, we are including&#xD;
      these measures that have been used in previous studies of weight gain/appetite change in&#xD;
      patients taking atypical antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
