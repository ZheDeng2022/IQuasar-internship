      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of two&#xD;
      formulations of CO-1.01 in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine is used alone or in combination with other chemotherapy as a treatment for&#xD;
      several solid tumor types, including pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, many patients fail to derive benefit from this treatment. No clinical or&#xD;
      molecular marker has been established to predict benefit from gemcitabine therapy, so&#xD;
      patients are treated empirically until evidence of disease progression or worsening&#xD;
      performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) expression to predict&#xD;
      survival in gemcitabine-treated patients has been studied, and data suggest that patients&#xD;
      with low levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression derive less benefit from gemcitabine treatment&#xD;
      than patients with high levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression. Furthermore, the PK profiles&#xD;
      of CO-1.01 and gemcitabine are different, and this may also favorably influence the in vivo&#xD;
      antiproliferative effects of CO-1.01. These data support the hypothesis that patients&#xD;
      expressing low levels of hENT1 will derive minimal benefit from gemcitabine, but will receive&#xD;
      benefit from CO-1.01 (gemcitabine elaidate) which enters tumor cells in a hENT1-independent&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formulation of CO-1.01 that is currently used in clinical studies contains 15 mg/mL of&#xD;
      gemcitabine-5'-elaidate solubilized in purified phospholipids. Recently, Clovis Oncology&#xD;
      developed a 30 mg/ml formulation which will be characterized in this study.&#xD;
