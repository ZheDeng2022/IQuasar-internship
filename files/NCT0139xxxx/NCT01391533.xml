      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR125844. To confirm safety profile of&#xD;
      SAR125844 when administered as single agent at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumoral effect of SAR125844 in patients with MET-gene&#xD;
      amplified solid tumors (including sub-group of MET-amplified non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      [NSCLC] patients) and in patients with Phospho-MET positive tumors without MET-gene&#xD;
      amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the global safety profile including cumulative toxicities. To evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of SAR125844 in the proposed dosing schedule(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess preliminary antitumor activity in patients with measurable/evaluable disease,&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the pharmacodynamic effects (PD) of SAR125844. To explore MET gene amplification&#xD;
      status in Circulating Tumoral Cells (CTCs) and on tumor biopsies collected during the study,&#xD;
      in the escalation part only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate other pharmacodynamic biomarkers and help selection of patients who could benefit&#xD;
      from SAR125844.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore MET-gene amplification status in circulating DNA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The duration of the study for one patient in the dose escalation phase of the study will&#xD;
      include a screening period of up to 3 weeks and a 4-week treatment cycle(s). The patients may&#xD;
      continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or willingness to stop,&#xD;
      followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up. The study will also include 2 expansion cohorts.&#xD;
      If a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohorts, continues to benefit&#xD;
      from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study&#xD;
      treatment for a maximum of 1 year and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the&#xD;
      study flowchart. Such patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
