    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled study, approximately 608&#xD;
      eligible subjects with type 2 diabetes and inadequate control on diet control alone or on&#xD;
      diet control and metformin monotherapy or on at least two and up to 3 oral glucose-lowering&#xD;
      agents will undergo an initial 21-day Screening Period, followed by a 6 month Double-Blind&#xD;
      Treatment Period and a 6 month Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will review the aim of the study, study procedures and potential risks and&#xD;
      benefits. These subjects will then sign a written informed consent during the Screening Visit&#xD;
      1. They will be scheduled to return to the clinic 10 days prior to randomization for&#xD;
      Screening Visit 2. At this visit, a CGM sensor will be placed with appropriate instructions&#xD;
      by the study team for a 10-day blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collection by&#xD;
      the site. Subjects will then return to the clinic after 10 days (± 1-day) for removal of the&#xD;
      CGM sensor. The subjects will be randomized to one of the three arms of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 month Double-Blind Treatment Period: After the Screening Period, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to 6 months of the Double-Blind Treatment Period. In a double-blind, double dummy&#xD;
      randomization scheme, subjects will either receive ORMD-0801 administered once-daily at night&#xD;
      (1 x 8 mg capsule between 8 PM to 12 Midnight and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner) or&#xD;
      ORMD-0801 8 mg (1 x 8 mg capsule) administered twice daily, each morning approximately 45&#xD;
      minutes (±15 minutes) prior to breakfast and each night prior to bedtime (between 8 PM to 12&#xD;
      Midnight and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner); or matching placebo. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      1 capsule approximately 45 minutes (±15 minutes) prior to breakfast and 1 capsule between 8&#xD;
      PM to 12 Midnight and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Double-Blind Treatment Period commencing at Week 0 (Visit 1, CGM removal),&#xD;
      subjects will return to the clinic every six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit requiring CGM application will occur 10 days prior to the CGM removal visit within&#xD;
      ± 1-day window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-Month Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period: Following the completion of the Double-Blind&#xD;
      Treatment Period, subject will enter a 6-month Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period.&#xD;
      Subjects previously randomized to placebo during the Double-Blind Treatment Period will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either ORMD-0801 8 mg QD or 8 mg BID for the duration of the&#xD;
      Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period. Subjects previously randomized to 8 mg QD or 8 mg&#xD;
      BID during the Double-Blind Treatment Period will remain in the same treatment arm for the&#xD;
      duration of the Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period. The Extension Period treatment&#xD;
      assignments will remain blinded for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will occur at the following intervals during the 6-month Double-Blind Treatment: every&#xD;
      six weeks. Extension Period: also every six weeks until the last visit (CGM removal and end&#xD;
      of Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit requiring CGM application will occur 10 days prior to the CGM removal visit within&#xD;
      ± 1-day window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects completing the trial will return to the clinic in 2 weeks ± 3 days for a safety&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit. Subjects withdrawing prematurely from the trial will have the early&#xD;
      termination (ET) visit procedures completed. All patients will continue to be followed in&#xD;
      accordance with ITT principles to avoid lost to follow up and missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the course of the study, subjects will measure and record fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      levels at least 2-3 times a week [self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG)] or when they&#xD;
      experience any symptoms of hypoglycemia using a glucose meter. Subjects will be provided a&#xD;
      paper diary at each clinic visit and trained to record information related to fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose and description of hypoglycemic events: time and date of occurrence; symptoms&#xD;
      experienced, if any; treatment given, if any; and specific circumstances. Subjects will be&#xD;
      required to bring the paper diary at each clinic visit where data will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Visits and Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both the Double-Blind Treatment Period and Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period,&#xD;
      background oral glucose-lowering dose regimens will be maintained, and further dose&#xD;
      adjustments are discouraged unless clinically indicated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be eligible for rescue based on the following glycemic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From Day 1 (Visit 1) through Week 6 (Visit 2), if at least two fasting SMBG levels are &gt;&#xD;
           270 mg/dL in the week preceding a visit are confirmed by a single central laboratory&#xD;
           fasting glucose &gt; 270 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From Week 6 (Visit 2) through Week 12 (Visit 3), if at least two fasting SMBG levels are&#xD;
           &gt; 240 mg/dL in the week preceding a visit are confirmed by a single central laboratory&#xD;
           fasting glucose &gt; 240 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From Week 12 (Visit 3) through Week 26 (Visit 6), if at least two fasting SMBG levels&#xD;
           are &gt; 220 mg/dL in the week preceding a visit are confirmed by a single central&#xD;
           laboratory fasting glucose &gt; 220 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From Week 26 (Visit 6) through the end of the study, if at least two fasting SMBG levels&#xD;
           are &gt; 200 mg/dL in the week preceding a visit are confirmed by a single central&#xD;
           laboratory fasting glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue will allow subjects to remain in the study, remain on double-blind study medication,&#xD;
      complete all visits until the end of the study, and thereby, contribute to exposure and&#xD;
      safety data. Rescue medication will be prescribed in accordance with the study Investigator's&#xD;
      usual standard of practice.&#xD;
