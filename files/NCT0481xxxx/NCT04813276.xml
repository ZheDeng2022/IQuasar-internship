  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cancer must overcome multiple, ongoing challenges (&quot;self-advocate&quot;) related&#xD;
      to their cancer experience to receive patient-centered care. Women with metastatic breast or&#xD;
      advanced gynecologic cancer often face significant challenges managing their quality of life&#xD;
      concerns and cancer- and treatment-related symptoms. If they do not self-advocate to manage&#xD;
      these concerns, they risk having poor quality of life, high symptom burden, and care that is&#xD;
      not patient-centered. Serious games (video games that teach) are effective health&#xD;
      interventions that allow users to vicariously engage in situations reflecting their personal&#xD;
      experiences, receive meaningful information, and learn personally relevant skills that they&#xD;
      can apply in real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current study is to test the efficacy of a novel intervention using a serious&#xD;
      game platform to teach self-advocacy skills to women with metastatic breast or advanced&#xD;
      gynecologic cancer. The Strong Together intervention consists of a multi-session, interactive&#xD;
      serious game application with tailored self-advocacy goal-setting and training. The serious&#xD;
      game is based on a self-advocacy conceptual framework and applies behavior change theories&#xD;
      and serious game mechanisms to promote skill development and implementation. The game works&#xD;
      by immersing users in the experiences of characters who are women with advanced cancer;&#xD;
      requiring users to make decisions about how the characters self-advocate; demonstrating the&#xD;
      positive and negative consequences of self-advocating or not, respectively; and providing&#xD;
      multiple, individualized feedback mechanisms and game features to enforce self-advocacy skill&#xD;
      acquisition and transference to real life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-centered care (e.g., incorporating patient preferences, needs, and values into all&#xD;
      care aspects) is an essential component of high-quality care, associated with improved&#xD;
      patient health, well-being, treatment adherence, and care coordination. Patients cannot&#xD;
      participate in patient-centered care if they do not have the skills to self-advocate.&#xD;
      Self-advocacy is defined as the ability to overcome health challenges by making informed&#xD;
      healthcare decisions, communicating effectively with healthcare providers, and gaining&#xD;
      strength through connection to others. Our work established that self-advocacy is associated&#xD;
      with higher quality of life, lower symptom burden, higher patient-centered care, and fewer&#xD;
      hospital admissions and emergency visits. Self-advocacy is particularly necessary in the&#xD;
      advanced cancer setting where patients face numerous health challenges including complex&#xD;
      treatment decisions, multiple cancer- and treatment-related symptoms, and poor quality of&#xD;
      life. However, many patients struggle to self-advocate because they have not previously&#xD;
      needed these skills or do not know how to apply these skills within their cancer experience.&#xD;
      Interventions to teach patients self-advocacy are lacking, and the few programs that exist&#xD;
      rely on non-interactive patient education that does not leverage behavior change or&#xD;
      educational theories. There is a critical need for theoretically grounded interventions to&#xD;
      teach patients with advanced cancer self-advocacy skills so that they can address health&#xD;
      challenges related to their care and experience improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology-based serious games (educational video games) allow users to vicariously engage in&#xD;
      situations reflecting their personal experiences, receive meaningful information, and learn&#xD;
      personally relevant skills that they can apply in real life. Serious games are an ideal&#xD;
      platform for teaching self-advocacy skills because they use immersive, motivational elements&#xD;
      and mechanisms to provide highly-relevant skills-training. Serious games improve patient&#xD;
      knowledge and skills though their mechanisms of action remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team developed the Strong Together intervention which teaches self-advocacy skills in a&#xD;
      serious game platform. Patients vicariously respond to health challenges managing symptoms,&#xD;
      communicating with providers, and managing their health and are then exposed to the positive&#xD;
      and negative consequences of self-advocating or not, respectively. It is based on our team's&#xD;
      self-advocacy conceptual model, grounded in behavior change and educational theories, and&#xD;
      integrates multiple mechanisms to promote learning outcomes. Our valid, reliable self-report&#xD;
      self-advocacy measure captures the three dimensions of self-advocacy: informed&#xD;
      decision-making, strength through connection, and effective communication. Our pilot&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the Strong Together intervention among N=70 women newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with advanced breast or gynecologic cancer demonstrated feasibility (82% completed&#xD;
      6-month surveys, 71% engaged in all intervention sessions) and intervention acceptability&#xD;
      (97% satisfied; 90% saw it as useful).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators will test the efficacy of the Strong Together&#xD;
      intervention compared with an enhanced care as usual group in a larger, more diverse sample&#xD;
      of women with advanced cancer.&#xD;
