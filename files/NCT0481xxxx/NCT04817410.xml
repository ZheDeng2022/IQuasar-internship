  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit Emergency Department (ED) patients with moderate to severe alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder (AUD) who are interested in initiating medication assisted treatment (MAT). The&#xD;
      study is split into two phases. The first phase (N=10) will use implementation science&#xD;
      strategies to strengthen existing non-targeted ED based AUD screening program and optimize&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and linkage pathways. The second phase (N=20) will incorporate&#xD;
      lessons learned from phase 1 to initiate ED patients on MAT for AUD in the form of oral&#xD;
      naltrexone. The primary outcome for both phase 1 and phase 2 is engagement in comprehensive&#xD;
      addiction treatment at 14 and 30 days post enrollment.&#xD;

      Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be comprised of two components outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Site Implementation Component&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this component implementation science strategies will be used to strengthen existing&#xD;
           non-targeted ED based AUD screening program and optimize feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
           linkage pathways. Three specific aims are to, 1) optimize registered nurse (RN) driven&#xD;
           non-targeted alcohol use screening supplemented with secondary screening using DSM-5&#xD;
           criteria for AUD and an SBIRT (screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment)&#xD;
           intervention administered by trained staff. 2) During a 3-month period, use continuous&#xD;
           quality improvement methods to decrease the time for completion of AUD screening to an&#xD;
           interval that is acceptable to ED patients and ED providers and 3) Assess willingness to&#xD;
           initiate oral naltrexone among ED patients with moderate to severe AUD. Ten (10)&#xD;
           patients will be enrolled in phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oral Naltrexone Feasibility Component&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this component the study team aims to assess the feasibility of initiating treatment in ED&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe AUD on oral naltrexone, an evidence based and accepted&#xD;
      standard of care treatment for AUD. Specifically, 1) over an 8-month period the study team&#xD;
      aims to identify 20 patients with moderate to severe AUD eligible and interested in immediate&#xD;
      initiation of oral naltrexone. Consenting patients will be receive a standard SBIRT&#xD;
      intervention and be provided with immediate oral naltrexone initiation in the ED with a&#xD;
      14-day starter pack at the time of ED discharge. All participants will receive facilitated&#xD;
      linkage to comprehensive out-patient care. 2) The study team aims will evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      immediate ED initiated oral naltrexone with the primary outcome being engagement in&#xD;
      comprehensive addiction care at 14 and 30 days post enrollment. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      medication adherence, changes in daily alcohol consumption, number of heavy drinking days,&#xD;
      hospital admissions and ED utilization, transition to long-acting injectable naltrexone and&#xD;
      alcohol craving. 3) Lastly, the study team will collect data on recruitment and attrition&#xD;
      rates, as well as means and standard deviations for key measures that will be needed to plan&#xD;
      a definitive randomized controlled trial of ED-initiated oral naltrexone.&#xD;
