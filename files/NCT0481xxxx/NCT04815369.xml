  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, comparative cohort observational study is to determine whether&#xD;
      the use of Guidance® UTI Clinical Pathway, a standardized infrastructure for specimen&#xD;
      collection and result delivery, compared with current traditional pathways for urine testing&#xD;
      reduces the proportion of UTI patients with poor outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if prospective data, collected over 12 months&#xD;
      from over 200 nursing homes, will show that the use of Guidance® UTI Clinical Pathway is more&#xD;
      effective than the Traditional Clinical Pathways for urine testing in UTI diagnosis in&#xD;
      Nursing Homes. Guidance® UTI Clinical Pathway provides standardized infrastructure for&#xD;
      specimen collection, and result dissemination via assigned report point person to verify&#xD;
      receipt of actionable data. The pathway also includes several in-services on molecular&#xD;
      testing for UTI, Pooled Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing, and polymicrobial infections to&#xD;
      help providers better understand test methodology. Standardizing a Clinical Care Pathway for&#xD;
      testing and reporting of clinical results approach may lead to a reduction in empiric broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotic use and in turn better health-related outcomes for patients. Such&#xD;
      efficiency in clinical decision making at the time of initial presentation may lead to&#xD;
      improved patient care by avoiding ineffective therapy due to mismanagement or incomplete lab&#xD;
      diagnosis. The study will be observing the implementation of the Guidance® UTI Clinical&#xD;
      Pathway and comparing it to traditional clinical care pathways from facility-level data&#xD;
      entered into the National Healthcare Safety Network for its LTCF (Long Term Care Facilities)&#xD;
      Component.&#xD;
