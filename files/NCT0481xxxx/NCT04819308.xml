  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who have previously participated in the study MI Energy will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in SUPER kids. Investigators want to better understand differences in nutrient&#xD;
      use (e.g., fatty acid and carbohydrate) during rest and exercise in children of varying body&#xD;
      types and activity levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will examine fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation at rest and&#xD;
      during exercise in children of all body types and activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children 8-11 years old who have done the MI Energy study will participate. Up to 80 children&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate in this study at Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center&#xD;
      (ACNC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be asked to attend three study visits (baseline, and two exercise visits). For the&#xD;
      exercise visits they will follow a diet plan and be encouraged to avoid certain foods and&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will do two testing days with the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine (pee) will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight and height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise test on the bike - children will ride a stationary bike at a set intensity and&#xD;
           at an intensity relative to their previous bike test during the study MI Energy. The&#xD;
           order in which they bike will be random. Before and during biking, children will wear a&#xD;
           mask that will measure the gases in their breath and a monitor that will measure heart&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
