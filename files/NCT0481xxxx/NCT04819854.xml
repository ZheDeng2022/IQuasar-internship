      This is a study to asses the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses&#xD;
      of EP395, administered by oral capsules, in healthy subjects with the aim to determine the&#xD;
      safe dose range of EP395 for further clinical development. The study consists of two parts,&#xD;
      part A where single-ascending doses will be assessed and part B where multiple-ascending&#xD;
      doses will be assessed. The primary objective being safety and tolerability as well as the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic properties of EP395.&#xD;
