  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gout is a chronic disease caused by the deposit of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in body&#xD;
      tissues secondary to hyperuricemia. Patients with gout suffer severe attacks of acute joint&#xD;
      pain. As the disease progresses, the joint pain becomes chronic and associated with disabling&#xD;
      and deformative manifestations called tophi. Gout is strongly associated with various&#xD;
      comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney failure. Gout is a very&#xD;
      common disease, affecting 0.9% of the adult population in France and nearly 4% of the&#xD;
      North-American population. Data from New Zealand show a particularly high prevalence of gout&#xD;
      among Polynesians (minority populations in New Zealand and other islands of the South&#xD;
      Pacific) that would be explained by genetic susceptibility and frequently intertwined with&#xD;
      metabolic diseases. Recent findings obtained from the Polynesian population in New Caledonia&#xD;
      disclose high prevalence figures close to 7%, a level expected to be confirmed by an&#xD;
      epidemiology study that will be conducted in parallel with the present study and designed to&#xD;
      determine the precise prevalence of gout in French Polynesia and the most frequently&#xD;
      associated genetic variants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      International genomic studies conducted in populations with hyperuricemia and gout have&#xD;
      identified a number of associated alleles. The strength of the association between a given&#xD;
      allele and gout (or hyperuricemia) provides an indication of the importance of the encoded&#xD;
      protein in disease pathogenesis. It was in this way that the development of gout was found to&#xD;
      depend on renal urate transporters that were subsequently targeted by new uricosuric&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the search for gout-associated genes has mostly been done in the general European&#xD;
      population and revealed a small number of candidate loci. Most of these only contribute a&#xD;
      small amount to the heritability for gout susceptibility, suggesting that additional genes&#xD;
      and mechanisms of genetic influence are yet to be discovered. A common feature of Genome-Wide&#xD;
      Association studies done so far is that usually large sample sizes are required in order to&#xD;
      detect differences in allele frequencies and their contribution to different traits between&#xD;
      test groups. The Polynesian population of French Polynesia possesses characteristics that&#xD;
      make it particularly attractive to carry out population-based genetic research. Historical&#xD;
      records indicate that the Polynesians of Tahiti and surrounding islands originate from a&#xD;
      small founder population that has undergone a number of bottlenecks, eventually becoming a&#xD;
      genetically homogenous population with a fairly high degree of consanguinity. The combination&#xD;
      of a historic founder event, continued isolation and recent expansion are all ideal&#xD;
      properties for a Genome Wide Association Study, as they ensure that 1) population&#xD;
      stratification will be easy to correct when performing association tests and 2) there are&#xD;
      likely high-effect variants that were kept at low frequency in mainland Europe due to&#xD;
      negative selection but rose to high frequencies in the Polynesians via the increase in&#xD;
      genetic drift or selection through adaptation to a specific environment and diet. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is plausible that rare variants with large effect on health-related quantitative traits&#xD;
      may be more easily detectable in Polynesians, even with much smaller sample sizes.&#xD;
