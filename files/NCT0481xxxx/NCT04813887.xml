      Pregnancy-induced physiological dermatological changes are common. In 2016, they represented&#xD;
      between 23% (acne) and 75% (pigmentary changes) of pregnancies in France. Some dermatological&#xD;
      changes require medical advice to identify a possible pathological rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These pathological rashes can be dangerous for the mother or the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of skin diseases during pregnancy and to&#xD;
      evaluate the care pathway in a healthcare sector (Vendee) for these pregnant women?&#xD;

      Pregnancy-induced physiological dermatological changes are common. In 2016, they represented&#xD;
      between 23% (acne) and 75% (pigmentary changes) of pregnancies in France. Some dermatological&#xD;
      changes require medical advice to identify a possible pathological rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These pathological rashes can be dangerous for the mother or the fetus. It is therefore&#xD;
      essential to recognize them for a quick specialized treatment. They include: intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholestasis of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic eruption during pregnancy,&#xD;
      atopic eczema, generalized pustular psoriasis in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the demography of dermatologists in the Vendee, 18 dermatologists in 2020 in all&#xD;
      establishments (hospitals, clinics, practices), the general practitioner is at the center of&#xD;
      these considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the situation of skin disease during pregnancy and to&#xD;
      evaluate the care pathway in a healthcare sector (Vendee) for these pregnant women?&#xD;
