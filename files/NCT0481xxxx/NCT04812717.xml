  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasoplegia is a common complication after heart surgery for heart failure. With vasoplegia,&#xD;
      the blood vessels can no longer squeeze properly, causing low blood pressure that is&#xD;
      sometimes difficult to treat with medication. One of the causes of this complication is&#xD;
      likely to be the use of the heart-lung machine, a device that takes over the function of the&#xD;
      heart and lungs during surgery. The blood then comes into contact with a foreign environment&#xD;
      and this can cause a reaction of the immune system. Patients with heart failure are extra&#xD;
      sensitive to this reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CytoSorb device is a filter that can be built into the heart-lung machine and can reduce the&#xD;
      response of the immune system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether the use of&#xD;
      this filter during heart surgery in patients with heart failure results in a less frequent&#xD;
      occurrence of vasoplegia after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of chronic heart failure is increasing. Despite the expansion of&#xD;
      therapeutic options, overall survival and quality-of-life remain poor. When optimal medical&#xD;
      therapy and cardiological interventions have failed to improve a patient's condition,&#xD;
      surgical intervention may be a valid option in order to improve cardiac function. Different&#xD;
      surgical treatments have improved clinical outcome. Unfortunately, heart failure surgery is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of vasoplegia. This syndrome is characterized by&#xD;
      hypotension and the continuous need of vasopressors, despite a normal or high cardiac index.&#xD;
      The incidence of vasoplegia ranges from 11-31% in patients undergoing heart failure surgery.&#xD;
      The prognosis of vasoplegia is poor. Prolonged hypotension and the accompanying hypoperfusion&#xD;
      lead to end-organ dysfunction and is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the balance of the vascular system of patients with heart&#xD;
      failure is fragile and therefore could easily be disturbed by a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response syndrome (SIRS) caused by the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and surgical trauma,&#xD;
      making these patients more prone to develop vasoplegia. Minimising this SIRS reaction could&#xD;
      be a strategy to prevent vasoplegia. Therefore, the objective of this single-center,&#xD;
      investigator-initiated study is to analyse the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of using&#xD;
      CytoSorb in preventing vasoplegia in patients with heart failure undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;
      on CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CytoSorb treatment will be conducted intraoperatively and the device will be applied in a&#xD;
      parallel circuit in the CPB. The total study intervention protocol takes 5 days and starts on&#xD;
      the day of the surgery (day 0) and ends at day 4 postoperatively. Patient clinical data will&#xD;
      be collected until day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vascular reactivity in response to a vasoconstrictor will be assessed in all patients at&#xD;
      3 different time points (after induction, after CPB, on day 1 postoperatively). During the&#xD;
      vasoconstriction test, a bolus of 2 μg/kg phenylephrine is administered intravenously, after&#xD;
      which the effect on the systemic vascular resistance is registered. At the same time points&#xD;
      and in addition, before induction (baseline) and on day 4 the sublingual microcirculation&#xD;
      will be monitored and blood samples will be collected.&#xD;
