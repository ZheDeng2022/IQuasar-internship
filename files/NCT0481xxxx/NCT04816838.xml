  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor) for the management of NSCLC(non-small cell lung cancer) harbouring EGFR(Epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor) T790M mutation after acquired resistance to previous first-generation&#xD;
      EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. Moreover,&#xD;
      osimertinib was approved or the treatment of patients with EGFR(Epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) in the first-line setting based on the&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical activity and favorable toxicity profile of osimertinib has led to broadly&#xD;
      research into this drug as a strategy to inhibit and prevent drug resistance in&#xD;
      EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer). Evidences&#xD;
      of benefit from EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in&#xD;
      EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) patients&#xD;
      have been increasing in early stages as well as in advance stages. Therefore, adjuvant or neo&#xD;
      adjuvant EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in operable&#xD;
      NSCLC(non small cell lung cancer) patients could improve survival in EGFR(Epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquired resistance by widespread clinical use has become a hot clinical problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of target therapies are being developed to overcome tolerance to osimertinib to&#xD;
      improve this outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an approach that should improve the molecular and clinical understanding of the drug&#xD;
      resistance. Specifically, we want to investigate innate drug resistance and tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment to osimertinib by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). and&#xD;
      single cell research is obviously needed to develop cancer therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
