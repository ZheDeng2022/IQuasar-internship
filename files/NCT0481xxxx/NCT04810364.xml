      In a prospective multi-center observational study, 200 HIV-infected patients treated with&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) and who suffered from coronary artery disease (CAD) will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Blood samples for biological parameters will be collected with all participants:&#xD;
      lipid profile and markers of systemic inflammation specific for HIV-infection&#xD;
      (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF -α, INF-γ,&#xD;
      INF-α; procalcitonin; inflammatory hsCRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of them will undergo functional testing (Echo, CMR both at rest and stress if necessary)&#xD;
      and invasive imaging with QCA, FFR, QFR, OCT, IVUS, VH-IVUS, NIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated according to the current and previous recommendations. Both medical&#xD;
      treatment and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stenting&#xD;
      will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data will be analyzed: correlation between ART, blood test results, coronary&#xD;
      angiography results, including performed PTCA, history of myocardial infarctions, and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period will achieve 12 months prospectively with collected clinical events and&#xD;
      imaging outcomes which will be determined at the baseline and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent ethics expertise will be provided by the Central Clinical Hospital of the&#xD;
      Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow, Russia). The monitoring of the clinical data with&#xD;
      imaging will be provided by The Ethics Board of Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian&#xD;
      Academy of Sciences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV, the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), is one of the world's&#xD;
      most serious health and development challenges. Approximately 38 million people live with&#xD;
      HIV, and tens of millions of people have died of AIDS-related causes since the beginning of&#xD;
      the epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, with increasing access to effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care,&#xD;
      including opportunistic infections, HIV infection has transformed from an irreversible&#xD;
      terminal illness to chronic disease. Unfortunately, increased life expectancy has increased&#xD;
      the risk of other chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Actually, CVD has&#xD;
      become the most common cause of death in HIV-infected individuals. The risk of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and coronary atherosclerosis prevalence is nearly twice as high in people living&#xD;
      with HIV than in the general population. Statins are effective primary prevention for CAD&#xD;
      events; however, there are no specific statin use guidelines in HIV. Besides, there is not&#xD;
      enough information about systemic inflammation markers and their correlation with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, using invasive imaging, including quantitative coronary angiography with or without&#xD;
      further percutaneous coronary intervention, optical coherence tomography/ OCT, intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound/ IVUS, VH-IVUS, near-infrared spectroscopy/ NIRS, cardiovascular events can be&#xD;
      predicted and prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective multicenter observational study, 200 HIV-infected patients treated with&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) and who suffered from coronary artery disease (CAD) will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Blood samples for biological parameters will be collected with all participants:&#xD;
      lipid profile and markers of systemic inflammation specific for HIV-infection&#xD;
      (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF -α, INF-γ,&#xD;
      INF-α; procalcitonin; inflammatory hsCRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of them will undergo functional testing (Echo, CMR both at rest and stress if necessary)&#xD;
      and invasive imaging with QCA (Quantitative Coronary Angiography), FFR (Fractional Flow&#xD;
      Reserve), QFR (Quantitative Flow Reserve), OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography), IVUS&#xD;
      (Intravascular Ultrasound), VH-IVUS (Virtual Histology - IVUS), NIRS (Near Infrared&#xD;
      Spectroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated according to the current and previous recommendations: The 2019 HIV&#xD;
      Russian National Guidelines; EACS Guidelines 2020; The AHA scientific statement&#xD;
      Characteristics, Prevention, and Management of Cardiovascular Disease in People Living With&#xD;
      HIV A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. Circulation 2019; ESC/EACTS&#xD;
      Guidelines on Myocardial Revascularization 2018; 2019 Guidelines on Chronic Coronary&#xD;
      Syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both medical treatment and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or&#xD;
      without stenting will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period will achieve 12 months prospectively with collected clinical events and&#xD;
      imaging outcomes which will be determined at the baseline and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent ethics expertise will be provided by the Central Clinical Hospital of the&#xD;
      Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow, Russia). The monitoring of the clinical data with&#xD;
      imaging will be provided by The Ethics Board of Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian&#xD;
      Academy of Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data of the HIVE trial include information of the complex examination with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. invasive imaging with QCA, FFR, QFR, OCT, IVUS, VH-IVUS, NIRS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. two interviews with the risk factor modification recommendations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. blood tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
                VLDL cholesterol),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  markers of systemic inflammation specific for HIV-infection&#xD;
                (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF -α,&#xD;
                INF-γ, INF-α; procalcitonin; inflammatory hsCRP),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  biochemical blood test (glucose, asparagine transaminase, alanine transaminase,&#xD;
                total bilirubin, creatinine, markers of the myocardium damage (myoglobin, troponin&#xD;
                I, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, brain natriuretic peptide - NT-proBNP),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  complete blood count,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ECG,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Echo,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. CMR results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective patients will be tested with HeartAge, SCORE, Duke ACC/ AHA, Duke - DCS,&#xD;
      Diamond-Forrester - DFM, The Seattle Angina Questionnaire - SAQ, DukeActivity Status Index&#xD;
      -DASI, and EQ-5D-5L, scores that are specific for HIV: EuroSida AIDS/Death risk score, FENCE&#xD;
      score, CSRFENCE Score. Patients will be screened for the major risk factors and their&#xD;
      modification: unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, smoking, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, diabetes, overweight or obesity, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet, older&#xD;
      age, genetic or lifestyle factors, family history of early heart diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCI and PTCA will be undergone by the 2020 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on Myocardial&#xD;
      Revascularization. The imaging data from non-invasive (CMR, Echo) and invasive (QCA, FFR,&#xD;
      QFR, OCT, IVUS, VH-IVUS, NIRS) methods will be handled and analyzed with the expert-level&#xD;
      post-processing imaging software (Medis Suite Solutions: MR, XA, QFR, CT, Intravascular,&#xD;
      Ultrasound) from Medis Medical Imaging Systems B.V. (Leiden, The Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to evaluate the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in HIV-patients with CAD&#xD;
      and its correlation with markers of systemic inflammation specific for HIV-infection (LBP;&#xD;
      cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF -α, INF-γ, INF-α; procalcitonin; inflammatory hsCRP)&#xD;
      and to estimate their value in preventing cardiovascular events.&#xD;
