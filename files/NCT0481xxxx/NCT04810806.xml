    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that immediate coronary angiography (CAG) within 2 hours after&#xD;
      admission can reduce mortality compared to delayed CAG after stabilization of acute&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (NSTE-ACS) complicated by ADHF. Patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF will be&#xD;
      randomized to immediate CAG (coronary angiography &lt; 2 hours after randomization) or delayed&#xD;
      CAG after stablization group by 1:1 fashion. This study is a prospective, non-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;

      Study objective In this study, investigators aim to compare early coronary angiography (CAG &lt;&#xD;
      2 hours after randomization) and delayed CAG after stabilization of acute decompensated heart&#xD;
      failure (ADHF) in patients with acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)&#xD;
      complicated by ADHF. This study is a prospective, non-blinded, randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study background An ADHF is frequently encountered in patients with NSTE-ACS. Although its&#xD;
      incidence has been decreased during the decades, it is still high up to 8-12% at initial&#xD;
      presentation of NSTE-ACS. Patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF is also known to be&#xD;
      associated with worse in-hospital and long-term clinical outcomes than those without heart&#xD;
      failure (HF). Because revascularization could reduce mortality in these patients, it should&#xD;
      be done in all patients with NSTE-ACS with ADHF. Current guidelines recommend immediate CAG&#xD;
      within 2 hours after admission in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF. However, it is&#xD;
      difficult to decide the timing of coronary angiography in these high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, the most of randomized trials about the timing of coronary angiography in NSTE-ACS&#xD;
      excluded these high risk patients, therefore there is lack of evidence for immediate coronary&#xD;
      angiography within 2 hours after admission in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare immediate CAG within 2 hours after admission and delayed CAG after&#xD;
      stabilization of ADHF in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF by randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis Immediate CAG within 2 hours after admission can reduce mortality compared&#xD;
      to delayed CAG after stabilization of ADHF in patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by ADHF.&#xD;
