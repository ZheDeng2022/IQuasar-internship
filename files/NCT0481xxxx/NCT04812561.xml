    <measure>Changes of CAT{Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) Assessment Test} scores</measure>
    <time_frame>screening, 6, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>CAT were measured in study screening, visit 2(6 week), visit 3(12 week). CAT was developed for use as a way to assess the quality of life of COPD patients, consisting of eight items, each of which evaluates 0 to 5 points, and the sum of all eight item scores is the CAT score. The best quality of life is 0 points, and the worst is 40 points.</description>

    <measure>Changes of BCSS(Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>BCSS were measured in study visit 1(0 week), visit 2(6 week), visit 3(12 week). BCSS is a scale for evaluating symptoms of Breathlessness, cough, and sputum, which is a major symptom of COPD(Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and symptoms of Breathlessness, cough, and sputum are evaluated in five stages.&#xD;
&lt;Breathlessness, sputum&gt; 0: never, 1: rare, 2: occasionally, 3: often, 4: almost always &lt;Cough&gt; 0: never, 1: a little hard, 2: moderate extent of hard, 3: over moderate extent of hard, 4: serious hard</description>
