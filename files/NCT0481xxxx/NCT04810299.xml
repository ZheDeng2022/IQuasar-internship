  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the incidence of colorectal cancers is high, it is often possible to treat it when&#xD;
      diagnosed at an early stage. Although the treatment options vary according to many factors&#xD;
      such as the type and stage of the cancer, possible side effects, the preference of the&#xD;
      patient, and the general health status, surgery stands out as the most commonly used&#xD;
      treatment method. However, in addition to the methods and drugs used in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment process, temporary or permanent stomas that are opened to ensure discharge cause&#xD;
      biopsychosocial effects on the life of the individual and lead to deterioration of the&#xD;
      quality of life. In this context, knowing and resolving the problems experienced by patients&#xD;
      in the pre-operative and post-surgical period, which is the most commonly used treatment&#xD;
      method, will also increase the quality of life of patients. In the literature, it was stated&#xD;
      that patients experienced high levels of anxiety before colorectal surgery and this situation&#xD;
      caused emotional and cognitive reactions; in the postoperative period, it is seen that they&#xD;
      experience many problems such as anxiety, restlessness, fatigue, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      dysfunction, pain, loss of control (inability to control gas and stool output), decreased&#xD;
      appetite, insomnia, nausea-vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation. However, modern&#xD;
      treatment methods, drug and non-drug treatments used to control these symptoms are not&#xD;
      effective in some cases. At this stage, complementary and alternative medicine applications&#xD;
      come into play, one or more of these methods are used to alleviate symptoms and increase&#xD;
      well-being during traditional treatments. In this study, it was planned to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of aromatherapy massage after colorectal surgery on postoperative symptom control&#xD;
      (pain, anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality, nausea-vomiting, flatulence).&#xD;

      The population of the study will consist of patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery&#xD;
      between June 2021 and June 2022, and the sample of patients who meet the criteria for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.The sample was planned to be 90 people, 30 patients for each of the&#xD;
      aromatherapy massage, classical foot massage and control groups. However, power analysis was&#xD;
      also performed to calculate the minimum sample size to be reached. In the study, it was aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the differences in mean scale between three groups, including one control and two&#xD;
      experiments. When it is not known how many units of difference between groups are important,&#xD;
      the effect width value is taken as 0.35 as the method used. The effect width value gives&#xD;
      results with a very high constraint of 0.10, medium level of 0.25 and a maximum acceptance&#xD;
      constraint of 0.40. The total number of patients was 84, including 28 patients in the groups,&#xD;
      with an error margin of 5% and a width of effect value of 0.35 at 81.19% power level.Block&#xD;
      Randomization technique will be used in the sample selection of the research. In order to&#xD;
      blind the randomization, it was made by a statistician who was not related to the research&#xD;
      and the group rankings were put in 9 envelopes and numbered by another person who was not&#xD;
      related to the research. For data collection Patient Information Form , Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS-Pain), Visual Analog Scale (VAS-Fatigue), Richard-Campbell Sleep Quality Scale, State&#xD;
      Anxiety Scale, Post-operative Nausea-Vomiting Effect Scale will be used.The first interview&#xD;
      with the patients will be held in the preoperative period and information will be given about&#xD;
      the research. For patients who agree to participate in the study, a Patient Information Form&#xD;
      will be filled out and a group assignment will be made using the block randomization method.&#xD;
      In patients assigned to the aromatherapy massage group, a patch test will be applied to the&#xD;
      inner elbow area to evaluate the allergy status against aromatic oils. In the patch test, it&#xD;
      is recommended to drop the diluted essential oil into the inner elbow area and to follow the&#xD;
      development of allergic reaction after 24 hours by wrapping it with a transparent cover.&#xD;
      Allergy development status will be evaluated 24 hours after the test, and the test result&#xD;
      will be shown to a dermatologist. The study will start according to the opinion received.&#xD;
