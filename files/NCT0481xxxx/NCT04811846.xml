  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is usually performed in a piecemeal&#xD;
      technique. Tumor fragmentation and cell spilling could be responsible for high recurrence&#xD;
      rates. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been shown to be a prognostic predictor in disease&#xD;
      progression in transitional cell carcinoma. In the current study the investigators aim to&#xD;
      quantify CTCs in purging fluid and blood for recurrent intermediate risk bladder cancer&#xD;
      during surgery for two different methods: TURBT and Plasma-kinetic vaporization of bladder&#xD;
      tumor (PKVBT). Also correlations for recurrence will be investigated for the two different&#xD;
      surgical methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the 9th most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide, with a&#xD;
      standardized incidence rate of 9.0 per 100,000 person-years for men and 2.2 per 100,000&#xD;
      person-years for women. Amongst any caner entity, bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer&#xD;
      regarding follow-up and life-time treatment costs due to the high probability of recurrence.&#xD;
      Up to 85% of patients initially present with non muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).&#xD;
      Progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is up to 10-20%. NMIBC is characterized&#xD;
      by a high risk of recurrence after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT): the 1-yr&#xD;
      recurrence rate is 15-61% and the 5-yr recurrence rate is 31-78%. These numbers represent the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against any existing oncological principle, during TURBT bladder tumors are resected in a&#xD;
      piecemeal manner. This results in tumor fragmentation and floating cancer cells inside the&#xD;
      bladder during surgery. These cells may have the ability to re-attach on and re-implant into&#xD;
      the bladder wall and may be responsible for early disease recurrence which is commonly seen&#xD;
      after initial surgery. It has been shown that tumor cells may access the circulatory system&#xD;
      through cut vessels. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be detected in up to 20% in T1 high&#xD;
      grade disease and are commonly seen in metastasized disease. They have shown to be an&#xD;
      independent predictor of disease progression and relapse in several studies and reflect&#xD;
      biological aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the investigators want to quantify CTCs for recurrent intermediate risk&#xD;
      transitional cell carcinoma in purging fluid and blood for two different surgical methods:&#xD;
      TURBT and Plasma-kinetic vaporisation of bladder tumors (PKVBT). Also correlations for&#xD;
      recurrence will be investigated for the two different surgical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2 urological centers (LKH Hall, LKH Salzburg) participants with diagnosed intermediate&#xD;
      risk recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder will be randomly enrolled for&#xD;
      either TURBT or PKVBT. Before surgery CTCs will be analyzed in peripheral blood and purging&#xD;
      fluid. (preoperative CTCs blood and purging fluid, morphological aspect of CTCs in purging&#xD;
      fluid) After resection for TURBT and vaporization for PKVBT, a tumor ground biopsy will be&#xD;
      taken for both groups. After coagluation, CTCs will again be drawn in peripheral blood&#xD;
      (intraoperative CTCs blood). After completion of surgery an indwelling catheter is inserted&#xD;
      and purging fluid is again analyzed (postoperative CTCs purging fluid, morphological aspect&#xD;
      of CTCs in purging fluid). Blood is again taken on day 2 after surgery during the morning&#xD;
      routine to assess CTCs after surgery (postoperative CTCs blood). Patients will be dismissed&#xD;
      on earliest day 2 after surgery after indwelling catheter removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence will be assessed during follow-up by cystoscopic controls (From 3 to 36 months&#xD;
      after surgery). If recurrence is detected the study is terminated. If no recurrence is&#xD;
      detected up to 36 months after surgery, the study is likewise terminated.&#xD;
