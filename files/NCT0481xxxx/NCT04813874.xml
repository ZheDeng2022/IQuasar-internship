      The purpose of this study is to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in parturients who&#xD;
      used nitrous oxide and neuraxial labor analgesia during labor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of nitrous oxide during labor is common in several countries including the United&#xD;
      Kingdom, Finland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.1, 2 The use of nitrous oxide during&#xD;
      labor has undergone a resurgence in popularity recently in the United States and became&#xD;
      available at Brigham and Women's hospital in August 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled nitrous oxide has a rapid onset (30-50 seconds) and clearance with a half-life of&#xD;
      about 5 minutes.3 It can be used for analgesia during the first, second and third stages of&#xD;
      labor, as well as during post-delivery procedures such as laceration repair, manual removal&#xD;
      of the placenta, and uterine curettage. It is also commonly used to facilitate the initiation&#xD;
      of epidural analgesia.4 At the Brigham and Women's Hospital, a pneumatically driven gas mixer&#xD;
      is designed to deliver a 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide mixture to patients. Nitrous oxide&#xD;
      passes readily across the placenta, and reaches equilibrium within a few minutes; the fetal&#xD;
      maternal concentration ratio after 2 minutes of inhalation is 0.64.5 Hence, when administered&#xD;
      at 50% concentration to the mother, the fetal concentration approximates at 32%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its long track record of maternal safety reported in numerous countries, the effect&#xD;
      of nitrous oxide on the fetus is less well-studied. A number of studies have published data&#xD;
      on the use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia, including the effectiveness in labor&#xD;
      analgesia, maternal satisfaction and maternal fetal adverse effects. Most of these studies&#xD;
      have not identified adverse neonatal outcomes. However, these studies used Apgar scores or&#xD;
      neonatal behavior scores as outcome measures and the quality of these studies was&#xD;
      predominately poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in parturients who&#xD;
      used nitrous oxide and neuraxial labor analgesia during labor.&#xD;
