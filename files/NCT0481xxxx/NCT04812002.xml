  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational trophoblastic Neoplasia（GTN） is a kind of malignant tumor in women of&#xD;
      childbearing age. It is easy to metastasized through the blood system in the early stage, so&#xD;
      it is a relatively malignant tumor. The tumor is highly sensitive to chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      low-risk patients have good prognosis, with survival rate and cure rate approaching 100%, but&#xD;
      high-risk patients are prone to drug resistance, or relapse after remission. For relapsed,&#xD;
      refractory, high-risk GTN, multiple remedies have been reported in the literature, but the&#xD;
      remission rate is only 75-80%. For relapsed or refractory high-risk GTN, multiple remedies&#xD;
      have been reported in the literature, but the remission rate is only 75-80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy are widely used in various refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors. For GTN, there are also a number of related studies. In this study, PD-1 inhibitors&#xD;
      combined with bevacizumab were used to treat refractory high-risk GTN with relapse or drug&#xD;
      resistance after receiving previous second-line or above multidrug combination therapy, to&#xD;
      study the efficacy and safety of the treatment regimen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, PD-1 inhibitors combined with bevacizumab were used to treat refractory&#xD;
      high-risk trophoblastic tumor (GTN) with relapse or drug resistance after receiving previous&#xD;
      two-line or above multidrug combination therapy, and the efficacy and safety of the two drugs&#xD;
      were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the requirements will sign the informed consent and be enrolled&#xD;
      voluntarily. This project is a single-arm study without a control group. Twenty patients are&#xD;
      expected to be enrolled, and there are 4 centers competing for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received at least two-line multidrug combination therapy, and some patients may&#xD;
      have undergone or planned surgery and/or radiation therapy. Through the HCG value and&#xD;
      measurable changes in the size of the lesions, we can understand the changes of the disease.&#xD;
      The primary endpoints were PFS and ORR Whenever, for whatever reason, the subject does not&#xD;
      complete the clinical trial observation, is considered to be an abscission case. When the&#xD;
      subject falls off, the researcher must fill in the reason for the fall off in the CRF, and&#xD;
      contact the subject as much as possible, complete the items that can be evaluated, and record&#xD;
      the time of the last medication to prepare for the analysis of its efficacy and safety. The&#xD;
      CRF should be kept for future reference&#xD;
