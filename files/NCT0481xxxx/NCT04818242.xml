  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is prevalent in adults admitted to subacute rehab (SAR) and long-term care (LTC)&#xD;
      skilled nursing care facilities. Management of diabetes in these facilities is challenging&#xD;
      due to number of older adults with higher prevalence of other diseases, functional&#xD;
      disability, and altered nutritional intake, which increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low&#xD;
      blood sugars). The investigators propose to conduct this randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine whether the use of Dexcom CGM with Glucose Telemetry System (CGM-GTS) with&#xD;
      hypoglycemia alarm compared to standard of care using capillary POC testing, will facilitate&#xD;
      diabetes treatment and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D in LTC&#xD;
      facilities. Participants in the standard of care group will also wear a CGM (blinded one).&#xD;
      The results of this study have great potential to impact and facilitate care and to change&#xD;
      current clinical guidelines in the management of older adults with diabetes in SAR and LTC&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;

      Diabetes is prevalent in adults admitted to subacute rehab (SAR) and long-term care (LTC)&#xD;
      skilled nursing care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of diabetes in these facilities is challenging due to number of older adults with&#xD;
      higher prevalence of other diseases, functional disability, and altered nutritional intake,&#xD;
      which increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugars).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many Clinical guidelines recommend the use of insulin, as the preferred therapy for glycemic&#xD;
      (sugar) control for most patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The use of insulin is effective&#xD;
      in improving glycemic control, but associated with high rates of hypoglycemia in LTC&#xD;
      residents with T2D. This high rate of hypoglycemia is concerning, because hypoglycemia has&#xD;
      been associated with many complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bedside capillary point of care (POC) glucose monitoring is the standard of care to&#xD;
      assess glycemic control in the hospital and in LTC facilities. POC testing is usually&#xD;
      performed before meals and at bedtime. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) measures glucose&#xD;
      every 5-15 minutes, thus provides a more complete glycemic profile during 24-hours when&#xD;
      compared to POC testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the&#xD;
      use of Dexcom CGM with Glucose Telemetry System (CGM-GTS) with hypoglycemia alarm compared to&#xD;
      standard of care using capillary POC testing, will facilitate diabetes treatment and reduce&#xD;
      the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D in LTC facilities. Participants in the standard&#xD;
      of care group will also wear a CGM (blinded one).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Participants will be identified from electronic medical records and enrolled during&#xD;
      admission to subacute rehabilitation (SAR)and long-term care (LTC) skilled nursing care&#xD;
      facilities and will be followed up for up to sixty (60) days or discharge (whichever comes&#xD;
      sooner). Subjects will be compensated for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study have great potential to impact and facilitate care and to change&#xD;
      current clinical guidelines in the management of older adults with diabetes in SAR and LTC&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;

    <description>CGM sensor will be placed after consent. Glucose values obtained from the CGM sensor will be sent to the CGM transmitter by Bluetooth technology and DEXCOM Share2 software application to a smart phone that serves as an intermediate-transmitting (routing) device. Glucose values from the smart phone will be transmitted wirelessly to a table computer (I-Pad) using the DEXCOM Follow application. Information on the CGM will activate an alarm in case of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia events. Hypoglycemia alarm will be set to &lt; 85 mg/dl (for prevention for low blood glucose levels). Nursing staff will be instructed to provide 15 grams of carbohydrates in response to a hypoglycemia alarm.The hyperglycemia alarm will be set at 300 mg/dl. If this occurs, the nursing staff will assess clinical status and perform a POC glucose testing to confirm glucose values. If BG &gt; 300 mg/dl, nursing staff will communicate the high glucose value to the primary care team.</description>
