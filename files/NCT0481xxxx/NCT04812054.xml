    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized study on the effects of hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion in&#xD;
      patients undergoing liver transplantations from donors after brain death with allocation of&#xD;
      patients to either end-ischemic hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion group (at least 2&#xD;
      hours of allograft perfusion at 12 degrees Celsius though hepatic artery and portal vein&#xD;
      prior to implantation) or simple cold storage group in a 1:3 ratio. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure of the study will be model for early graft dysfunction (MEAF) score. A total number&#xD;
      of 104 patients, including 26 in the hypothermic perfusion group and 78 in simple cold&#xD;
      storage group will be included. Data on potential risk factors for worse allograft function&#xD;
      and increased ischemia-reperfusion injury will be collected perioperatively. Circulating&#xD;
      levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-10, TNFα), nuclear damage (HMGB-1, 8-OHdG),&#xD;
      serum activity of transaminases, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, bilirubin concentration, and&#xD;
      INR will be assessed in the perioperative period. Wedge allograft biopsies will be performed&#xD;
      90 minutes post-reperfusion to evaluate activation of innate immunity (TLR4), activation of&#xD;
      endothelium (vWF, P-selectin), hepatocyte necrosis, hepatocyte apoptosis (TUNEL assay), ATP&#xD;
      content, and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde content). Further, wedge biopsies will be&#xD;
      performed at the end of simple cold storage and at the beginning and after two hours of&#xD;
      perfusion to determine steatosis and ATP content. During the perfusion, perfusate samples&#xD;
      will be periodically tested for lactate, sodium, and potassium concentration, CO2 partiall&#xD;
      pressure, and flavin mononucleotide concentration. Patients will be closely monitored in the&#xD;
      postoperative period for allograft function and secondary end-points: 2-year recipient and&#xD;
      graft survival, 2-year incidence of biliary complications, and 90-day complication rate. Both&#xD;
      groups will be compared with respect to the primary and secondary end-points, circulating&#xD;
      levels of IL-2, IL-10, TNFα, HMGB-1, 8-OHdG, activity of transaminases and&#xD;
      gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, and findings in post-reperfusion allograft biopsies. Further,&#xD;
      changes of hepatic steatosis and hepatic ATP content during perfusion will be evaluated, and&#xD;
      the results of perfusate analyses will be tested as predictors of allograft function in the&#xD;
      post-transplant period.&#xD;

      This will be a parallel, randomized controlled study on the effects of end-ischemic&#xD;
      hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion in liver transplantations from donors after brain&#xD;
      death. Patients will be randomized to either hypothermic perfusion or simple cold storage&#xD;
      (1:3 ratio). The primary end-point will be model for early graft dysfunction (MEAF) score, a&#xD;
      recently validated continuous measure of allograft function in the early period after liver&#xD;
      transplantation, calculated using serum alanine transaminase (ALT) activity, international&#xD;
      normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR), and serum bilirubin concentration within 3 first&#xD;
      postoperative days. In the original study, the mean MEAF score was 5.01 with a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 1.99. The primary hypothesis of this study is reduction of the mean MEAF score&#xD;
      from 5 to 3.5 using hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion. With the thresholds for type I&#xD;
      error of 0.05 and power of 0.90, respectively, 1:3 allocation ratio, and a standard deviation&#xD;
      of 1.99, the number of patients required to detect such difference is 26 in the hypothermic&#xD;
      perfusion group and 78 in the simple cold storage group (104 in total). The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will comprise age &gt;18 years, deceased-donor liver transplantation, and provision of&#xD;
      informed consent. Exclusion criteria will comprise donation after cardiac death and either&#xD;
      reduced or split graft. Secondary outcome measures will include 2-year recipient and graft&#xD;
      survival, 2-year incidence of biliary complications, and complications in the 90-day&#xD;
      postoperative period classified by type and their severity according to the Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
      grading system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following provision of informed consent, recipients will be randomly assigned in a 1:3 ratio&#xD;
      to either hypothermic perfusion group or simple static cold storage group. In the hypothermic&#xD;
      perfusion group, allografts will be subject to end-ischemic hypothermic oxygenated perfusion&#xD;
      at 12 degrees Celsius through both hepatic artery and portal vein after a period of simple&#xD;
      cold storage at 4 degrees Celsius and immediately prior to implantation. The perfusion will&#xD;
      last at least 2 hours and the period will be prolonged in case of ongoing hepatectomy, in&#xD;
      order to perform graft implantation immediately after perfusion. Two wedge allograft biopsies&#xD;
      will be performed at the beginning and after 2 hours of perfusion for the assessment of&#xD;
      micro- and macrovesicular steatosis and ATP content. Samples of the perfusate will be taken&#xD;
      at the beginning and every 30 minutes for the assessment of sodium, potassium, and lactate&#xD;
      concentration, CO2 partial pressure, and FMN. Perfusate temperature, portal and arterial&#xD;
      flow, and portal and arterial resistance will be closely monitored during the procedure. In&#xD;
      the simple cold storage group, the allografts will be stored in perfusate at 4 degrees&#xD;
      Celsius from the procurement until implantation. At the end of simple cold storage, a wedge&#xD;
      biopsy will be taken for the assessment of micro- and macrovesicular steatosis and ATP&#xD;
      content. In both groups during the back-table procedure, the allograft will be flushed with 1&#xD;
      litre of perfusate through the portal vein. At the end of flushing, a sample of perfusate&#xD;
      will be taken from the right hepatic vein for assessment of FMN and lactate concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory pre-transplant data will be&#xD;
      collected. This includes: indication for transplantation, Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification,&#xD;
      presence of hepatitis B and C virus infection, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score&#xD;
      (without exception points), patient weight, height, body mass index, and waist circumference,&#xD;
      serum bilirubin, creatinine, glucose and albumin concentration, INR, and serum activity of&#xD;
      transaminases. Relevant donor and procurement data will be collected, including donor age,&#xD;
      height, body mass index, cause of death, ethnicity, serum sodium and bilirubin concentration,&#xD;
      serum activity of transaminases, INR, and extraction time. Donor risk index will be&#xD;
      calculated in every case. Duration of cold ischemia and several intraoperative parameters&#xD;
      will be collected, including: duration of warm ischemia, intraoperative transfusions, serum&#xD;
      sodium and potassium changes, occurrence of post-reperfusion syndrome, and duration of&#xD;
      operation. A wedge biopsy will be performed in all patients 90 minutes after portal&#xD;
      reperfusion for histological assessment of ischemia-reperfusion injury (Suzuki score),&#xD;
      apoptosis, endothelial activation (vWF and P-selectin), activation of innate immunity (TLR4)&#xD;
      , oxidative injury (MDA), and ATP content. Blood samples will be collected immediately prior&#xD;
      to reperfusion, 90 minutes after reperfusion, and at first postoperative day for the&#xD;
      assessment of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-2, IL-10), nuclear damage (HMGB1, 8-OHdG)&#xD;
      and hepatocyte and cholangiocyte injury (transaminases and GGT activity). Following&#xD;
      transplantation, all patients will be strictly followed according to the centre protocol with&#xD;
      the assessment of serum activity of transaminases and GGTP, bilirubin and creatinine&#xD;
      concentration, and INR twice daily within the first 3 postoperative days and daily or once&#xD;
      every 2-3 days (according to the clinical assessment) thereafter. All complications occurring&#xD;
      during the 90-postoperative period will be recorded, including primary non-function, early&#xD;
      allograft dysfunction, biliary leaks, rejection episodes, and vascular complications. After&#xD;
      hospital discharge, patients will be followed-up according to the center protocol with&#xD;
      regular appointments in the outpatient clinic, every 2 weeks within first 2 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation, every month up to 6 months, every 2-3 months up to 1 year, and every&#xD;
      3-6 months thereafter. Occurrence of all complications, particularly biliary complications,&#xD;
      will be recorded. Both groups will be compared with respect to primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures, other pre-defined clinical outcomes, allograft injury and ATP content before&#xD;
      implantation, and signs of ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative damage, apoptosis, ATP&#xD;
      content, activation of innate immunity, and endothelial activation in allograft biopsies&#xD;
      after reperfusion. Comparisons will also include pro-inflammatory cytokine release,&#xD;
      circulating markers of nuclear injury, and other laboratory markers of allograft function and&#xD;
      injury. Analyses of perfusate samples and allograft biopsies obtained before and after&#xD;
      reperfusion is planned in order to determine both the impact of hypothermic perfusion on&#xD;
      hepatic ATP content and mitochondrial injury (FMN). Further, results of perfusate analyses&#xD;
      (particularly FMN) will be evaluated for potential association with clinical outcome&#xD;
      measures, results of post-reperfusion allograft biopsies assessment, and serum markers of&#xD;
      allograft function, injury, and inflammatory response in order to determine its role in&#xD;
      pre-transplant assessment of allograft viability.&#xD;
