  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of myeloma disease burden is currently suboptimal. This limits treatment planning&#xD;
      and evaluation of residual disease following treatment. 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab is a novel&#xD;
      immunoPET tracer, designed to detect CD38 on myeloma cells and allow visualization of myeloma&#xD;
      in a PET scanner. A phase I study of 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab demonstrated safety and successful&#xD;
      visualization of myeloma with 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab. This will be a phase II study of&#xD;
      89Zr-DFO-daratumumab to evaluate potential clinical applications of this novel imaging agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II clinical trial to assess the potential clinical value of&#xD;
      89Zr-DFO-daratumumab immunoPET. 60 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and a plan for&#xD;
      daratumumab containing combination therapy will be enrolled. Prior to therapy, current&#xD;
      standard of care (SoC), as well as a research 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab PET/CT, tests will be&#xD;
      performed. Patients will then undergo standard of care therapy for myeloma as defined by a&#xD;
      medical oncologist and SoC response assessments as defined by the International Myeloma&#xD;
      Working Group (IMWG). Upon suspected complete response (CR) or completion of 12 cycles of&#xD;
      therapy, a repeat research 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab PET/CT will be repeated and standard of care&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment will be performed. This design will determine how&#xD;
      89Zr-DFO-daratumumab immunoPET compares with current methods of measuring and localizing&#xD;
      disease prior to therapy, if immunoPET can predict response to therapy, and how immunoPET&#xD;
      compares with current methods of detecting MRD after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy in this trial is standard of care. The research component is the addition of a&#xD;
      novel immunoPET imaging test before and after standard of care therapy, to determine if the&#xD;
      novel imaging test adds value over current measures of myeloma disease burden.&#xD;
