  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rampant prescription of opioid has in part contributed to the ongoing worldwide opioid&#xD;
      crisis. In the United States of America, it is estimated that death from the use of opioids&#xD;
      outnumber death from motor vehicle accident deaths by more than 40%. Consequently, many&#xD;
      countries such as America and Canada have drawn up guidelines pertaining to safe opioid&#xD;
      prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tramadol is often used by pain physicians to treat chronic pain. As it is a weak opioid and&#xD;
      unscheduled in many countries, it is often considered to have a lower addiction potential&#xD;
      compared to strong opioids. Despite this, the literature does reveal evidence of abuse,&#xD;
      addiction and withdrawal - although the incidence of this is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to determine the prevalence of tramadol misuse in a pain&#xD;
      clinic population. The investigators also aim to determine the real-life compliance of&#xD;
      physicians to guidelines provided by International regulatory bodies (CDC) and the modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors associated with tramadol misuse.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the prevalence of Current Opioid Misuse (defined as a COMM score of 9 or greater) in the patients included in the cross-sectional study (ie patients who are on tramadol)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 measures depression with scores of 5-9, 10-14,15-19 and 20 or higher representing mild, moderate , moderate to severe and severe depression. PHQ-9 scores will be performed on all patients to determine the level of depression among patients prescribed tramadol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>GAD-7 measures anxiety with scores of 5, 10 and 15 representing mild, moderate and severe anxiety. GAD-7 scores will be performed on all patients to determine the level of anxiety among patients prescribed tramadol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Risk Tool (ORT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>ORT measures the risk of future opioid abuse. A score of equal or less than 3 correlates with a low risk of opioid abuse. Scores of 4 to 7 indicates moderate risk and scores above 8 represents high risk.ORT scores will be performed on all patients to determine the risk of future opioid misuse among patients prescribed tramadol.</description>
