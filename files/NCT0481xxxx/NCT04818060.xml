      This is a prospective investigation which aims to address key challenges to the design of&#xD;
      clinical trials to prevent the onset of Huntington's disease (HD). The project will provide&#xD;
      necessary psychometric data for clinical outcome assessments (COAs) and biomarkers (BMs) in&#xD;
      the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to address questions of central importance to the success of&#xD;
      these measures for premanifest clinical trials. Of the 258 participants: 52 will be low risk&#xD;
      of motor diagnosis, 102 high risk of motor diagnosis, 52 with diagnosed HD (stages I or II),&#xD;
      and 52 healthy controls. Participants can expect to be on study for up to 2 years.&#xD;

      This is a prospective investigation which aims to address key challenges to the design of&#xD;
      clinical trials to prevent the onset of Huntington's disease (HD). The project will provide&#xD;
      necessary psychometric data for clinical outcome assessments (COAs) and biomarkers (BMs) in&#xD;
      the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to address questions of central importance to the success of&#xD;
      this measure for premanifest clinical trials such as: (1) How reliable the measure is in the&#xD;
      same person when repeated over time; (2) how reliable the measure is in the same person when&#xD;
      analyzed by two different labs/sites; (3) how well the measure reflects disease symptoms; (4)&#xD;
      how well the measure predicts meaningful disease outcomes; (5) how well the measure tracks&#xD;
      disease progression or severity; and (6) how many research subjects are required to test that&#xD;
      an intervention is delaying/slowing the onset of HD? Answers to these questions will better&#xD;
      position the field to more effectively test new interventions to prevent HD such as gene&#xD;
      therapies and new drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive, motor and behavioral data, blood, CSF, and genetic samples, and MRI measures&#xD;
      will be collected from 258 participants at baseline. Of the 258 participants: 52 will be low&#xD;
      risk of motor diagnosis, 102 high risk of motor diagnosis, 52 with diagnosed HD (stages I or&#xD;
      II), and 52 healthy controls. Neurocognitive and behavioral data, blood and CSF samples, and&#xD;
      MRI will be repeated 2 years (18-24 months) after the baseline visit. Remote assessments of&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures (neurocognitive, motor and behavioral data) will be conducted 1&#xD;
      year (9-12 months) following baseline to determine the feasibility of at-home HD assessment&#xD;
      for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Study Aims and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs) currently being used in premanifest&#xD;
      HD. In accordance with the FDA, all types of COAs (a) Clinician-reported; (b)&#xD;
      Observer-reported; (c) Patient-reported; and (d) Performance-based outcomes will be evaluated&#xD;
      as appropriate for each phenotypic domain (motor, cognitive, psychiatric/behavioral,&#xD;
      functional activity, quality of life). Specific outcomes of this aim will follow those&#xD;
      recommended by the FDA including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a) Cross-sectional evaluation (critical for sample selection) of currently-used COA&#xD;
           instruments according to the following recommended criteria: mode of administration;&#xD;
           format and scoring criteria; content validity; internal consistency reliability;&#xD;
           test-retest reliability; floor and ceiling effects; construct validity; convergent&#xD;
           validity; and strength of each COA expressed in terms of effect sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  b) Longitudinal evaluation (critical for endpoint selection and responsiveness) of each&#xD;
           COA to detect change using effect sizes across the premanifest and early HD disease&#xD;
           continuum with documentation of the responder definition(s) of construct validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  c) Identification and documentation of the context of use (COU) and concept of interest&#xD;
           (COI) for clinical trials in premanifest HD to position available COAs within a&#xD;
           preliminary conceptual model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the psychometric properties of various biomarkers obtained from cerebral&#xD;
      spinal fluid when compared between groups (premanifest HD, HD, NC) and over time (baseline&#xD;
      and 2 years). Specific outcomes of this aim will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a) CSF mHTT collected at baseline and 2 years in 100 premanifest HD, 25 diagnosed HD,&#xD;
           and 25 healthy controls (HC) will be analyzed (blind to gene status) by two independent&#xD;
           labs. Safety, feasibility, cost efficiency, and inter-site reliability will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  b) Validity of CSF mutant huntingtin (mHTT) will be examined in HD groups for&#xD;
           association with cross-sectional and longitudinal (a) phenotypic severity and decline&#xD;
           using measures of the primary triad of clinical manifestation and progression (motor,&#xD;
           cognitive, psychiatric/behavioral); (b) meaningful clinical outcome measures such as&#xD;
           diagnosis in premanifest subjects and patient-reported outcomes, functional capacity and&#xD;
           disability in all HD patients; and (c) available disease burden measures calculated as&#xD;
           the product of Cytosine-Adenine-Guanine (CAG) repeat length and current age (considered&#xD;
           a reflection of genetic toxicity by time survived; AKA disease burden). The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that the candidate biomarkers will show appropriate&#xD;
           association reflecting concurrent and predictive validity (types of criterion-related&#xD;
           validity) with the most widespread &quot;benchmarks&quot; of HD phenotype, the Unified HD Rating&#xD;
           Scale in diagnosed and advanced prodromal HD. Data from this Aim will immediately inform&#xD;
           the interpretation of ongoing clinical trials that show biomarker levels in &quot;some&quot;, but&#xD;
           not &quot;all&quot;, premanifest. Although it is unknown whether the biomarkers will demonstrate&#xD;
           any predictive validity or concurrent validity for the entire premanifest HD group, data&#xD;
           will immediately be useful to develop an evidence threshold for when in the premanifest&#xD;
           HD prodrome, the biomarker will be detectable and tracked over time. The evidence&#xD;
           threshold is immediately useful to the design of disease modifying trials in HD,&#xD;
           particularly when the paramount goal is to prevent diagnosis, or manifestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  c) Biological criterion-related validity for biomarkers will be examined in HD groups&#xD;
           for association with (a) microglial biomarkers; (b) inflammatory biomarkers; (c)&#xD;
           neuronal death biomarkers; and (d) mHTT HD-specific protein. The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that mHTT will show detection at the earliest point in the prodrome,&#xD;
           followed by microglial markers, then inflammatory markers and, finally, neuron death&#xD;
           markers in diagnosed HD.&#xD;
