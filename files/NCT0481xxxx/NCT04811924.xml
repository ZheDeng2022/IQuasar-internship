  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal crosslinking (Crosslinking, CXL) is a treatment offered for the stabilization of&#xD;
      early corneal ectatic disorders such as keratoconus. Although CXL is an excellent treatment&#xD;
      option to stabilize early ectatic corneas, complications include corneal haze, sterile&#xD;
      infiltrate, endothelial cell toxicity, treatment failure and stromal scarring. Corneal haze&#xD;
      is a common finding in almost all CXL patients and may decrease visual quality. The effect of&#xD;
      0.02% mitomycin C (MMC) for 2 minutes on corneal haze and scarring in refractive surgery is&#xD;
      well established in the literature with many clinical studies confirming its effectiveness.&#xD;
      Although the pattern of corneal haze after CXL appears to be different from the haze pattern&#xD;
      seen following refractive procedures, both processes are thought to be caused by an&#xD;
      inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate that MMC can reduce post-CXL haze and scars when using the&#xD;
      optimal concentration and duration of exposure.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study will be double blinded from the patients and the researchers. An external pharmacy will be responsible for preparing the investigational product (IP) in an open manner, which will be transferred to the research pharmacy of the CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Île-de-Montréal. The research pharmacy will label and dispense the IP in a blinded manner for study team on the day of treatment and according to the randomization list provided by the study team.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal haze/scarring</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-operation</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal haze or scarring will be measured by densitometry. Densitometry values obtained from Scheimpflug images (software 70722, Pentacam HR, Oculus, Germany) will inform backward light scattered reflected by the cornea and therefore reflect the amount of stromal haze, and expressed as grayscale units (GSU), defining the backscattered light in a 0 to 100 scale in concentric zones. A 6mm central zone will be used for the analysis and compartmentalized in: anterior 160 microns depth (epithelium, bowman and anterior stroma), posterior 60 microns depth (endothelium, Descemet and posterior stroma) and the layer in between.</description>
