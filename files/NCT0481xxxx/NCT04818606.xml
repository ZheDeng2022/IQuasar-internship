    <textblock>
      INTRODUCTION: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a ubiquitous musculoskeletal (MSK) complaint&#xD;
      that often presents as a chronic and difficult to treat condition. Lumbosacral&#xD;
      radiculopathy/radiculitis (LR) or &quot;sciatica&quot; is a common secondary condition that can last&#xD;
      well beyond the expected time frame after treatment with physical therapy, oral&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications, local steroidal injections, and surgery. Challenges in the&#xD;
      treatment of LR indicate that persistent pain may have evolved from mechanical to&#xD;
      neuropathic. Previous research has shown that, in addition to the aforementioned treatments,&#xD;
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is effective in limiting self-reported pain in&#xD;
      patients with CLBP and neurogenic conditions such as fibromyalgia. This study proposes a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of a newer mindfulness program, Mindfulness&#xD;
      Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), on self-reported pain, physical function, quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL), depression symptoms, trait mindfulness, reinterpretation of pain, and surface&#xD;
      electromyography (sEMG) findings in patients with LR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Participants will be recruited from the Portland, OR metro area. Upon screening and&#xD;
      recruitment, participants will receive a battery of questionnaires collecting demographic,&#xD;
      self-reported pain, physical function, QoL, depression symptoms, mindfulness, and&#xD;
      reinterpretation of pain data. Participants will also undergo sEMG to identify neurological&#xD;
      abnormalities that can be characterized diagnostically. Upon enrollment, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the mindfulness-based intervention group (MBI), MORE; or the control&#xD;
      group, treatment as usual (TAU), for 8 weeks. Self-reported pain measures and sEMG studies&#xD;
      will be conducted again at eight weeks post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES: Primarily, investigators hypothesize that MORE will be effective in improving&#xD;
      self-reported pain, physical function, QoL, depression symptoms, mindfulness, and&#xD;
      reinterpretation of pain scores after eight weeks of mindfulness training. Secondarily,&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that those individuals with abnormal sEMG findings at baseline will&#xD;
      have improved sEMG findings at their eight-week follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS PLAN: Changes in self-reported pain, physical function, QoL, depression symptoms,&#xD;
      trait mindfulness, and reinterpretation of pain will be analyzed using descriptive statistics&#xD;
      as well as ANCOVA. Regression will also be used to evaluate the dose-response relationship&#xD;
      between all outcome measures and time spent in mindfulness practice for the intervention&#xD;
      group. Finally, ANCOVA will be used to evaluate the relationship between pain and physical&#xD;
      function and sEMG findings.&#xD;
