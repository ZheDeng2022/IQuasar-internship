    <textblock>
      Neurodevelopmental treatments are a progressive therapeutic method experienced thru qualified&#xD;
      therapists for the improvement in affected ones. The most important trial in Down syndrome&#xD;
      children is motor milestones and postural reactions to develop on time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental therapy is applied to accurate atypical postural tone and to enable&#xD;
      further regular motion for execution of presentation of abilities. Objective: To determine&#xD;
      the effects of Neuro Developmental therapy in improving postural reaction and motor&#xD;
      milestones in infants with Down syndrome.&#xD;

      This study was a randomized trial design. This study was conducted in Rehab Care&#xD;
      Physiotherapy Department. 20 Children with Down syndrome meeting the predetermined inclusive&#xD;
      and exclusive criteria were arbitrarily allocated into dual batches through convenient&#xD;
      sampling technique. The first batch which was the experimental group was given&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental therapy and the duration of the treatment comprised of 1.5 hour, three&#xD;
      days a week for 6 weeks. The second group which was the control group received conventional&#xD;
      therapy and the period of the ministrations comprised of 1 hour, with 10 repetition 3 sets&#xD;
      for each muscle three days a week for 1.5 months, Pre-assessment and post-assessment was&#xD;
      evaluated through Gross motor function-88. Recorded values were analyzed through SPSS.&#xD;
