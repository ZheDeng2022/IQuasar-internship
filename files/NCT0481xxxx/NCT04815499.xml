  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that consequences of malnutrition affect a situation of risk and&#xD;
      have negative effects on the evolution of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),&#xD;
      accompanied by higher morbidity and mortality. The impact of malnutrition on the respiratory&#xD;
      system affects the respiratory muscles, the lung parenchyma, and the immune system. In&#xD;
      summary, the risk of complications can lead to a worsening of the quality of life of the COPD&#xD;
      patient. Also, dyspnea as the main symptom of COPD is the one that produces the greatest loss&#xD;
      of quality of life, especially in older patients. The components of our authorized food&#xD;
      supplement improve the quality of life of the patient. These components maintain the strength&#xD;
      and energy of the patient, help the body to recover and regain its optimal state, help&#xD;
      improve the immune system, help reduce the side effects of therapies associated with the&#xD;
      control or cure of cancer and help correct nutritional deficiencies. This is the reason why&#xD;
      this experimental study aims to improve the quality of life in patients with COPD with a CAT&#xD;
      score&gt;15.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is developed in two phases: pilot phase and experimental phase. The pilot phase is&#xD;
      preliminary and progressive in order to demonstrate a sufficient effect of improving the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients and to be able to continue in an experimental phase with more&#xD;
      investigational sites and more patients, and to evaluate other secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the pilot phase is finished, an intermediate analysis of the results will be carried out&#xD;
      to evaluate the magnitude of the variation in quality of life at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. If&#xD;
      the expected success expectations are achieved and it is approved by the Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      the study will continue to the experimental phase.&#xD;
