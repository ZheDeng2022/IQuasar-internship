  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Develop a scalable approach for delivering water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) messages to&#xD;
      households in areas with confirmed cholera patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This will be done&#xD;
      by conducting formative research through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and&#xD;
      intervention planning workshops with households in areas with confirmed cholera patients and&#xD;
      government officials to identify perceptions of WASH behaviors and to inform the development&#xD;
      of a mobile health intervention (mHealth) for this population. This intervention approach&#xD;
      will then be piloted in a subset of households, and revised according to feedback. Then the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled of the refined mHealth intervention.&#xD;

      Aim 1. Develop an evidence and theory based WASH mHealth intervention for households in areas&#xD;
      with confirmed cholera patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh through formative research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct formative research through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and&#xD;
           intervention planning workshops with caregivers and household members of young children,&#xD;
           and government officials to identify perceptions of WASH behaviors and to inform the&#xD;
           development of intervention materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pilot the WASH mHealth intervention in a subset of households, and revise according to&#xD;
           feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the developed WASH mHealth intervention in increasing&#xD;
      WASH behaviors and reducing fecal contamination on hands and in stored drinking water by&#xD;
      conducting a RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit and prospectively follow for 12 months 120 households (600 participants, 4 per&#xD;
           household) with a child under five years of age assigned to one of two study arms (60&#xD;
           households per arm). The first arm will receive the CHoBI7 mHealth program (CHoBI7&#xD;
           mHealth program Arm) and the second arm will serve as a Control Arm and only receive a&#xD;
           general message on oral rehydration solution (ORS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the 2 study arms using structured observation of handwashing with soap at stool&#xD;
           and food related events, unannounced spot checks of the presence of soap in the cooking&#xD;
           and latrine areas of the household, and fecal coliform counts on caregiver hands and in&#xD;
           stored drinking water.&#xD;

    <description>We will start delivery of this intervention with a pictorial module delivered in the home during two 30 minute visits on cholera transmission and prevention after enrollment. Households will be provided a handwashing station, a covered water vessel, and chlorine tablets. Households will then receive the CHoBI7 WASH mHealth program voice and text messages on handwashing with soap and water treatment bi-weekly.</description>
