  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In acute pancreatitis, approximately 20% of the cases result in severe necrotizing&#xD;
      pancreatitis which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Necrotizing&#xD;
      pancreatitis is characterized by the development of an acute necrotic collection and as this&#xD;
      collection persists beyond 4 weeks, walled off necrosis (WON) encapsulates the collection. To&#xD;
      date, this is treated by the step-up approach, which contains percutaneous drainage and&#xD;
      minimally invasive video assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) or endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      (EUS) guided drainage followed by direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN). Different DEN&#xD;
      techniques are available for the treatment of WON, however, there is a lack of effective&#xD;
      endoscopic instruments to perform DEN. Recently, the first dedicated alternative to&#xD;
      conventional DEN has been cleared for use, namely the EndoRotor® Resection System. This&#xD;
      device is a powered mechanical debridement device intended for use in endoscopic procedures&#xD;
      to resect and remove necrotic debris during DEN for WON. Previous (pilot and feasibility)&#xD;
      studies showed promising results in terms of the amount of procedures, adverse events and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, aim of this study is to assess the performance of the EndoRotor, as compared to&#xD;
      conventional endoscopic techniques, for direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) of walled off&#xD;
      necrosis (WON) in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
