    <textblock>
      Perianal fistula(PF) is one of the most frequent disease in anorectal disease.The incidence&#xD;
      of PF is 8,6 -10 / 100 000 . The first surgical treatment is defined by Hippocrates in PF&#xD;
      .This surgical treatment which found by Hippocrates , involves seton insertion into the tract&#xD;
      of fistula . Today most of surgeon still use the same technic but PF is really hard disease&#xD;
      to treat. Recurrence rate of PF is really high and there are lots of complication about this&#xD;
      disease. The most scary complication during the surgery or postoperatively is anal&#xD;
      disfunction. ın PF surgical technics involves ;fistulectomy (coring out), lay open&#xD;
      (fistulotomy), Ligation of Intersphincteric Fistula Tract, advancement flap and laser&#xD;
      ablation of the fistula tract . The popularity of laser ablation of the fistula tract is&#xD;
      increasing day by day.This surgical procedure is applied with the laser device which use in&#xD;
      varicose vain ablation in vascular surgery.In this study the investigator are trying to find&#xD;
      out the effect of steam ablation in PF on rats.&#xD;

      Intersphincteric Fistula Tract), advancement flap and laser ablation of the fistula tract .&#xD;
      The popularity of laser ablation of the fistula tract is increasing day by day.This surgical&#xD;
      procedure is applied with the laser device which use in varicose vain ablation in vascular&#xD;
      surgery.In this study the investigator are trying to find out the effect of steam ablation in&#xD;
      PF on rats.This new procedure has to be tried on rat firstly and the studies is very&#xD;
      important which tried on rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research includes 32 rats and Firstly the investigator created perianal fistula tract&#xD;
      with 2.0 silk suture material on 3 o'clock in perianal region.1 month will wait for the&#xD;
      maturation of fistula tract. After that the suture materials removed from the fistula tract&#xD;
      and one fistula tract will treat with steam ablation device (3 o'clock )in 16 rats and the&#xD;
      other 16 rats will be the control group .1 month will be wait for the examination of&#xD;
      treatment of fistula tract in steam ablation group.Evaluation of fistula tract will define&#xD;
      with microscopic examination after the excision.End of the study the investigator will be&#xD;
      find out the effect of steam ablation on perianal fistula .&#xD;

    <description>In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of steam ablation , associated or not to seton in the treatment of anal fistula surgically produced in rats. Although still very limited number of publications, the use of steam ablation in the treatment of anal fistula has shown promise, which was also observed in this study. There was a statistically significant difference when comparing the group treated with steam ablation and the control group. The previous seton placement not shown in this research any advantage, perhaps by allowing in some.</description>
