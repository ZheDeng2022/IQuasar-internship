  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Turkey, the prevalence rate of perinatal depression has been estimated between 20%-40%,&#xD;
      reflecting the global average of 25%. Untreated perinatal depression is of concern not only&#xD;
      because of its effect on maternal health but also from the effect that impaired maternal role&#xD;
      fulfilment has on the mother-infant bonding and child care and the long-term impact on the&#xD;
      infant's physical and cognitive development. Thinking Healthy Programme (THP) is an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention incorporated into the World Health Organization's flagship Mental&#xD;
      Health Gap Action Programme, tailored to the perinatal period that has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective for depressed or stressed mothers. Turkey prioritize antenatal care, and this&#xD;
      provides an opportunity to integrate mental health care into an existing antenatal care&#xD;
      programme. Public hospitals operate 'antenatal pregnancy schools' where women are invited to&#xD;
      attend 5 weekly group sessions that incorporate education about pregnancy and newborn care.&#xD;
      We have developed an on-line group version of the Thinking Healthy Programme which has been&#xD;
      designed to be integrated into the routine on-line antenatal pregnancy classes. The&#xD;
      intervention has been designed so it is suitable for all women (universal) rather than&#xD;
      depressed mothers only (targeted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to pilot this adapted on-line group intervention in selected&#xD;
      hospitals' pregnancy schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a two-arm pilot individual randomised controlled trial comparing the&#xD;
      Thinking Healthy group intervention integrated into antenatal pregnancy school classes with&#xD;
      antenatal pregnancy school classes alone. Our sample size of 60 pregnant women (that is 30&#xD;
      participants in each arm of the pilot trial), who are over 18 years old, between 12-30 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation, and intend to attend all 5 sessions of the online antenatal classes. Participants&#xD;
      in both arms will be assessed for depression and anxiety symptoms, levels of disability,&#xD;
      quality of sleep, perceived social support, coping skills, and relationship with partner. All&#xD;
      one hundred and twenty women will get a detailed assessment initially and 4-6 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention. Some of the study participants and antenatal nurses delivering these sessions&#xD;
      will be approached for in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility and perceptions of the study participants' receiving the intervention sessions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systematic reviews provide robust evidence that perinatal depression can be treated&#xD;
      effectively in low to middle income countries with psychological treatments delivered by&#xD;
      non-specialists. The intervention with the strongest demonstrated effect size is the Thinking&#xD;
      Healthy Programme, the first psychological intervention to be incorporated into the World&#xD;
      Health Organization's flagship Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). Turkey prioritize&#xD;
      antenatal care, and this provides an opportunity to integrate mental health care into an&#xD;
      existing antenatal care programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public hospitals operate 'antenatal pregnancy schools' where women are invited to attend 5&#xD;
      weekly group sessions that incorporate education about pregnancy and newborn care. The groups&#xD;
      usually consist of 8-10 mothers and are run by antenatal nurses. During the COVID19 pandemic,&#xD;
      these classes have been adapted into an on-line platform. Group interventions are less&#xD;
      resource-intensive per person helped than individual interventions and are possibly more&#xD;
      cost-effective. We have developed an on-line group version of the Thinking Healthy Programme&#xD;
      which has been designed to be integrated into the routine on-line antenatal pregnancy&#xD;
      classes. The intervention has been designed so it is suitable for all women (universal)&#xD;
      rather than depressed mothers only (targeted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives are to conduct a pilot/feasibility study of the on-line group intervention in&#xD;
      a socioeconomically deprived population in Istanbul, Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this pilot study is not to test a specific hypothesis but to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. test all operational elements including: the acceptability and feasibility of the&#xD;
           intervention including training and supervision; the materials developed such as the&#xD;
           manual, visual aids, and added activities to promote perinatal mental health and&#xD;
           psychosocial well-being;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. test the willingness of women, and antenatal nurses to participate (recruitment rates),&#xD;
           respond to questionnaires, and be followed up (attrition rates); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. test the procedures for outcome measures as well as training and supervision.&#xD;
           Quantitative methods will closely follow the procedures for a future definitive trial.&#xD;
           The results will be used to finalise the intervention content and structure, to&#xD;
           establish appropriate support systems, and to finalize all materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in socioeconomically deprived districts of Istanbul within the&#xD;
      catchment area of the First Region of the Public Hospitals Union. Primary institution will be&#xD;
      Marmara University Hospital which has an affiliation with the Ministry of Health. With the&#xD;
      support of Turkish Ministry of Health, the hospital operates 'antenatal pregnancy schools'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study participants will include all consecutive pregnant women who have been offered, and&#xD;
      accepted to attend, the on-line antenatal care classes during the study recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is a feasibility/pilot trial, sample size calculations have not been conducted.&#xD;
      Our sample size of 60 (that is 30 participants in each arm of the pilot trial) is based on&#xD;
      the pragmatics of recruitment and the necessities for examining feasibility. The intervention&#xD;
      and control arms will each consist of 3 groups per arm with 10 participants per group,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design is a two-arm pilot individual randomised controlled trial comparing the&#xD;
      Thinking Healthy group intervention integrated into antenatal health classes with antenatal&#xD;
      health classes alone.The unit of randomization for the pilot trial will be individuals (i.e,&#xD;
      eligible pregnant women). The generation of random allocation sequence will be carried-out by&#xD;
      an independent person at the University of Liverpool UK (not involved in the enrolment of&#xD;
      participants into the trial). Simple random numbers will be generated and the case will be&#xD;
      assigned a Trial Number and treatment allocation (TAU or THP) which will be emailed back to&#xD;
      the Local PI at Marmara in an encrypted form who will be responsible for notifying the site&#xD;
      coordinator. The site coordinator will then inform both the participants and the designated&#xD;
      nurses for the particular treatments to commence. To minimise the threat of selection bias&#xD;
      through allocation concealment, the team recruiting/enrolling participants will be separate&#xD;
      to the team opening the encrypted forms and informing participants about the treatment that&#xD;
      will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcomes will be recorded by outcome assessors blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked before the interview with the assessor not to reveal anything&#xD;
      about their sessions. The outcome assessors will not have information about the on-line&#xD;
      groups. It will not be possible to blind therapists and antenatal nurses in participating&#xD;
      centres or the participants themselves to intervention allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The Thinking Healthy Programme (THP) is an evidence-based intervention that is&#xD;
      based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. It includes strategies that incorporate&#xD;
      behavioral activation, active listening, collaboration with the family, guided discovery, and&#xD;
      homework. THP was designed to be delivered by community health workers, and it was the first&#xD;
      low-intensity psychological intervention to be adopted by WHO. THP has been translated and&#xD;
      adapted into Turkish. For the current study, we have developed an on-line group version of&#xD;
      the Thinking Healthy Programme which has been designed to be integrated into the routine&#xD;
      on-line antenatal pregnancy classes. It will be delivered by trained antenatal nurses who&#xD;
      routinely run the antenatal classes. The routine on-line antenatal classes consist of 5&#xD;
      weekly group sessions that incorporate education about pregnancy and new-born care. The&#xD;
      groups usually consist of 8-10 mothers. Our adapted 'group' version of the Thinking Healthy&#xD;
      Programme will be incorporated into these antenatal pregnancy classes. The adapted THP&#xD;
      consists of 5 integrated sessions. Session 1 introduces the programme and focuses on&#xD;
      engagement of participants, introduction of THP, and breathing exercises. Session 2 focuses&#xD;
      on psychoeducation and problem solving. Session 3 focuses on the mother's well-being and&#xD;
      introduces activities such as physical exercises, good sleep practices and ensuring a&#xD;
      balanced diet. Session 4 focuses on the mother's relationship with the unborn baby. Session 5&#xD;
      focuses on activating social support from family, friends and peers and provides closure of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the control arm will not be offered the THP intervention but will&#xD;
      attend the 5 sessions of the routine group antenatal class. The class provides education&#xD;
      about pregnancy, birth and new-born care and offers support to women. The women will also be&#xD;
      able to access all usual care and support offered by the participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will take place at baseline on recruitment and one month after conclusion of the&#xD;
      intervention sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for human subjects' protection in this research will follow guidelines and&#xD;
      policies of the Institutional Reviews Boards (IRBs) of the sponsoring organization, the&#xD;
      University of Liverpool and the implementing partner, University of Marmara, School of&#xD;
      Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data and safety monitoring plan will involve the continuous evaluation of safety, data&#xD;
      quality and data timeliness. Incoming data will be cleaned and compiled on a regular basis&#xD;
      and examined for unusual or unexpected patterns. PIs and project coordinators will conduct&#xD;
      continuous review of data and participant safety at monthly Project Management Group meetings&#xD;
      and the discussion will be documented in minutes. The governance mechanisms will provide&#xD;
      oversight to the programme. The governance and administrative activities will be based in&#xD;
      Istanbul at Marmara University (School of Medicine) and will be the responsibility of the&#xD;
      site investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow of participants through the trial will be presented as the trial flow chart. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics including socio-demographic characteristics and all baseline measures across arms&#xD;
      will be tabulated to check for any baseline imbalances among the participants. Mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation scores for all continuous measures shall be presented, followed by&#xD;
      univariate associations between demographic variables and severity of symptoms. While the&#xD;
      study is not powered to test any hypothesis, exploratory intention to treat analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted to compare the two treatment groups. For baseline comparisons, t-tests will be&#xD;
      conducted for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical ones. At follow up,&#xD;
      comparisons will be made using analysis of covariance with baseline score as a co-variate.&#xD;
      Any significant baseline imbalances will be treated as co-variates and adjusted for in&#xD;
      analysis. All qualitative data will be analysed using framework analysis approach&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-6 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). The questionnaire score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-6 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). It was developed to evaluate sleep quality in clinical studies. The items in the PSQI were arranged using clinical observations of patients with sleep disorders, other scales about sleep quality specified in the literature, and an 18-month clinical observation period regarding PSQI. If the PUKI global score is greater than 5, it indicates poor sleep quality</description>

    <measure>Change in Perceived social support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-6 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The scale will be used to understand the changes in perceived social support. The MSPSS is a 12-item scale designed to measure perceived social support from three sources: Family, Friends, and a Significant Other. It has 12-item and every item uses a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). A higher score indicates greater the social support perceived by an individual; the total possible score ranges 12~84, or it can be scored according to its subscales by adding the items in each subscale and then dividing by 4.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Coping skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-6 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Brief-COPE. Change in coping skills will be assessed by the Brief-COPE which is a 28 item self-report questionnaire designed to measure effective and ineffective ways to cope with a stressful life event. The Brief-Cope was developed as a short version of the original 60-item COPE scale, which was theoretically derived based on various models of coping. &quot;Coping&quot; is defined broadly as an effort used to minimize distress associated with negative life experiences. The scale can determine someone's primary coping styles as either Approach Coping, or Avoidant Coping. In addition, the following subscales are reported: Self-distraction, Active coping, Denial, Substance use, Use of emotional support, Use of instrumental support, Behavioral disengagement, Venting, Positive reframing, Planning, Humor, Acceptance, Religion, &amp; Self-blame.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in relationship with partner</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-6 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS). This is a 7 item scale, used to assess subjective satisfaction with a given relationship. Answers are rated on a 5 point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not well), to 5 (very well). The respondent's average score is obtained after reverse scoring items 4 and 7. Although this scale was originally created to assess romantic relationships, created a generic version that they found to be sufficiently reliable: Cronbach's α = .89 for parents, .87 for friends, and .90 for romantic partners.</description>
