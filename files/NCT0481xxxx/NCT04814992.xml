      A significant number of patients develop chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) following knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery. Proposed is the testing of a novel computer-assisted behavioral&#xD;
      intervention with opioid taper delivered in the 4 weeks prior to surgery to address the risk&#xD;
      factors for CPSP, with the expectation that severity of post-op pain and the incidence of&#xD;
      CPSP will be reduced.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients develop chronic post-surgical pain following knee joint&#xD;
      replacement surgery, and the risk factors for this problematic outcome have been identified.&#xD;
      Proposed is the development and preliminary efficacy testing of a novel computer-assisted&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral intervention integrating opioid taper delivered in the four weeks prior&#xD;
      to surgery to address these risk factors, with the expectation that both the severity of&#xD;
      post-operative pain and the subsequent incidence of chronic post-surgical pain will be&#xD;
      reduced. In that chronic post-surgical pain brings with it diminished functionality and&#xD;
      quality of life, ongoing opioid use, and direct patient costs, it is it is critical that&#xD;
      interventions aimed at mitigating its development are implemented and evaluated in the&#xD;
      clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sample of adult men and women with chronic pain, on opioid therapy and undergoing a&#xD;
      planned TKA, the objectives of this randomized clinical trial are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Add a motivational interviewing component to a validated computer-assisted CBT&#xD;
           intervention for chronic pain (PAINTrainer) to encourage opioid tapering in the 4 weeks&#xD;
           prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the efficacy of the 4-week targeted pre-operative CBT intervention in 75 TKA&#xD;
           patients to decrease preoperative chronic pain severity, preoperative opioid&#xD;
           consumption, and symptoms of depression, anxiety and pain catastrophizing prior to&#xD;
           surgery in comparison to 75 TKA patients randomized to treatment-as-usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe the effects of a 4-week targeted pre-operative CBT intervention in 75 TKA&#xD;
           patients on 48hr post-operative pain severity, and 3- and 6-month rates of CPSP in&#xD;
           comparison to 75 TKA patients randomized to treatment-as-usual.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized clinical trial is proposed to evaluate the efficacy of the novel computer-assisted preoperative CBT/opioid sparing intervention to affect acute and chronic post-operative pain outcomes. Specifically, 150 male and female patients meeting study inclusion criteria and preparing to undergo TKA at the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center will be randomized to either receive the computer-assisted preoperative CBT intervention (n=75) or treatment-as-usual (control, n=75).</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>baseline; prior to surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of preoperative chronic pain will be evaluated with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI),52 along two dimensions: intensity and interference. Pain intensity is rated on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) scale as the worst in the past 24 hours, least in the past 24 hours, average pain and current pain. Pain interference is measured in 7 areas: general activity, mood, walking ability, work, sleep, enjoyment of life and relationships on a 0 (no interference) to 10 (interferes completely) scale. The composite mean of these scores are used as a pain interference score. BPI scores will be collected prior to the intervention and compared to those collected just prior to surgery and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Preoperative Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; prior to surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperative opioid use will be measured by converting to morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) prior to beginning the intervention, during the study visit just prior to surgery and at the 3 and 6 months follow up if the patients are still taking opioids. At each timepoint, state prescription drug monitoring program will be queried as a check on self-reported opioid use.</description>

    <description>To measure symptoms of depression and anxiety, the PROMIS速 (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) person-centered measures will be utilized.54 Specifically, the 8-item PROMIS depression and anxiety short forms will be compared prior to and following completion of the intervention; to evaluate the stability of CBT skills, the PROMIS will also be administered at 3 and 6 months</description>

    <measure>Pre-Op Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing will be measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS).53 The PCS is a 13-item self-report scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales (magnification, rumination, and helplessness); results from the initial development and validation studies indicate that the PCS is a reliable and valid measurement tool for catastrophizing in clinical and non-clinical populations. PCS will be completed prior to and following completion of the intervention and at the 3- and 6-month follow ups to assess the durability of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Op Pain Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of post-operative pain will be operationalized as (1) responses on a visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and (2) consumption of opioid analgesic medications during the first 48 hours following surgery. The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable), and pain scores are collected every 4 hours as part of routine practice. Pain ratings will be graphed over time and area under the curve calculated. Dose of opioid analgesics consumed during this period (24hr increments and total) will be abstracted from the electronic health record and converted into MEDD for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Post-Surgical Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months; 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate for the presence of CPSP, subjects will be asked at 3- and 6-months if they have pain in the surgical site that developed or increased in intensity following the surgery utilizing a checklist based upon the IASP definition of CPSP (Appendix). If they respond affirmatively, BPI pain scores will be collected to assess the intensity and interference associated with the CPSP. In addition, subjects will be asked if they are continuing to use opioids at these timepoints, and if so, daily MEDD calculated for analysis.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the computer-assisted preoperative CBT intervention (n=75). A particularly promising internet-based CBT pain program for the population of interest, PAINTrainer, demonstrated improved pain, function, coping and global health in patients with chronic knee arthritic pain in comparison to an internet education control, with benefits persisting for up to 52 weeks. In addition to the PAINTrainer, there will be an integration of a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention delivered by a trained &quot;coach&quot; across the sessions about (1) the benefits of opioid tapering for post-operative pain control, (2) approaches for safely tapering, (3) identifying and managing withdrawal symptoms patients may experience.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete eight (8) 30- to 45-minute educational sessions during the 4 weeks prior to your surgery. In addition to the computer based training sessions, there is a motivational interviewing component that requires subjects to meet with a member of the study team weekly for a total of four (4) 30- to 45-minute meetings to help manage opioid medication use. It is expected that subject participation in this arm of the study will be a total of 12 hours over the course of the entire study.</description>
