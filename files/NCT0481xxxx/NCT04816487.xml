    <textblock>
      Although black staining is considered a drawback that is clinically observed following SDF&#xD;
      application and is the main primary barrier for its use clinically . Child's behaviour and&#xD;
      cooperation cannot be controlled at a young age or in special health care needs cases.&#xD;
      Therefore, the best treatment modality will always be a simple, fast and painless procedure&#xD;
      and SDF is the best solution for those cases. Discolouration caused researchers to search for&#xD;
      a solution that will reduce or prevent discolouration using KI and GSH. A systematic review&#xD;
      was conducted in-vitro, and it showed the use of SDF with KI had reduced stains markedly,&#xD;
      potential advantages of minimal staining might be advantageous, along a short period.&#xD;
      However, studies with long-term follow-up would be required to provide evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines for using SDF and KI formulations in routine clinical practice&#xD;

      Early childhood caries (ECC) has been increasing worldwide and became a significant health&#xD;
      problem. ECC is a multifactorial disease result from the interaction of different factors as&#xD;
      cariogenic microorganisms, exposure to fermentable carbohydrates through inappropriate&#xD;
      feeding habits. It affects teeth that are less susceptible to caries. The management of ECC&#xD;
      is expensive, often requiring extensive restorative treatment such as the drill and fill&#xD;
      technique and extraction of teeth at an early age. Nowadays, non-invasive treatment for&#xD;
      arresting untreated dental caries is becoming urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) treatment offers an alternative non-invasive treatment for&#xD;
      caries as it arrests caries progression. S.D.F. is a colourless agent in the form of liquid&#xD;
      with an alkaline PH of 10 it contains 24.4% to 28.8% (weight/volume) silver and 5.0 to 5.9%&#xD;
      fluoride .. SDF is inexpensive treatment, and its ease of the application makes it a durable&#xD;
      treatment option in dental clinics. Arresting active caries is an essential treatment&#xD;
      modality and requires training by all dental auxiliaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major drawback to SDF treatment has been its black stain and discolouration, which has&#xD;
      limited its use. The precipitation of silver by-products in the dental tissues results in&#xD;
      black staining, which can be discouraging and limits its use in visible areas. SDF also&#xD;
      temporarily stains skin and gingiva, requiring them to be handled carefully to avoid contact&#xD;
      with these tissues. To overcome the staining, SDF researchers investigated applying a&#xD;
      saturated solution of potassium iodide (10% weight % KI) and studied the effect of&#xD;
      glutathione (GSH) biomolecule on reducing of enamel and dentin discolouration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potassium iodide (KI) is used as a nutritional supplement. A supersaturated solution of KI is&#xD;
      used in managing the discolouration problem of the carious lesion without affecting its&#xD;
      caries arresting effect. It reduces the staining caused by the SDF as silver ions from the&#xD;
      SDF solution reacts with the iodide ions present in KI solution, which results in the&#xD;
      formation of silver iodide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutathione (GSH) is a tri-peptide biomolecule, and it is considered one of the best with&#xD;
      silver as it contains a thiol group (-SH) which has a high affinity for adsorption onto metal&#xD;
      surfaces . GSH also forms a coat around silver particles, decreasing the aggregation of&#xD;
      silver particles and controlling the rate of silver ion release (Homeostasis) , which reduces&#xD;
      the discolouration of an SDF-coated tooth over time. This study was conducted to compare the&#xD;
      effect of glutathione (GSH) versus Potassium iodide (KI) in reducing the SDF staining effect&#xD;
      in carious primary teeth.&#xD;
