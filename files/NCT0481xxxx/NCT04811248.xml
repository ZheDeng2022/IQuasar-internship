  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital admission for infant bronchiolitis is associated with an increased risk of recurrent&#xD;
      wheezing and subsequent asthma in childhood. In the literature, 17 to 60% of children will&#xD;
      develop repeated wheezing (infant asthma in France). This highly variable incidence could be&#xD;
      linked in part to the fact that the definition of bronchiolitis varies between continents. In&#xD;
      Europe the usual definition is an acute and contagious viral infection which affects the&#xD;
      bronchioles (small bronchi) of infants accompanied by coughing, rapid breathing and wheezing.&#xD;
      In research studies, bronchiolitis must be associated with wheezing and / or crackles on&#xD;
      auscultation in Europe, and wheezing imperatively in the USA. The diagnosis of wheezing is&#xD;
      difficult, and medical agreement on auscultatory respiratory abnormalities is poor. We thus&#xD;
      have developed a wheezing diagnostic tool using artificial intelligence processing of&#xD;
      respiratory sound recordings by smartphone (Bokov P, Comput Biol Med 2016, DOI:&#xD;
      10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.01.002). In a second larger bicentric study that included only&#xD;
      infants suspected of bronchiolitis, our approach has consisted in obtaining a recording by&#xD;
      smartphone but also by electronic stethoscope in order to allow deferred listening of the&#xD;
      sounds (WheezSmart study). The objective of these studies was to obtain a formal diagnosis of&#xD;
      wheezing, the current project aims to assess the benefit of this diagnosis. The main&#xD;
      objective of this cross-sectional study is to determine whether the formal presence&#xD;
      (diagnosis of wheezing from a recording of pulmonary auscultation) is associated with the&#xD;
      risk of childhood asthma (diagnosis of asthma at 6 years) regardless of the usual risk&#xD;
      factors (atopic / allergic terrain, exposure to smoking, recurrence of symptoms). The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine whether the formal presence of wheezing on auscultation&#xD;
      is a risk factor for subsequent repeated wheezing (diagnosis of infant asthma) and for&#xD;
      initial disease severity (bronchiolitis) compared to SpO2 and admission of the child to&#xD;
      hospital. The interest in differentiating between high and low frequency sibilants will be&#xD;
      evaluated also.&#xD;

      included in the WheezSmart study at Robert Debré Hospital • Diagnosis at inclusion of&#xD;
      bronchiolitis • Telephone numbers of the 2 parents available • Informed parents who do not&#xD;
      object to participation in research. Population of wheezsmart study: 281 children diagnosed&#xD;
      with bronchiolitis at Robert Debré Hospital for whom we have a recording of respiratory&#xD;
      sounds. Statistical analyses: Comparison of the proportions of infant asthma then asthma in&#xD;
      the groups with and without wheezing (chi-square tests). For the two groups with and without&#xD;
      wheezing, the SpO2 means and the hospital admission rate will be compared (t and chi-square&#xD;
      test).&#xD;
