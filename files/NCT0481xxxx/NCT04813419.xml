  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractional non-ablative laser (FNAL) has been widely used in improving acne scarring.&#xD;
      However, there was only one study reported efficacy and safety of the fractional non-ablative&#xD;
      1927nm thulium laser (FTL) and no studies have reported a comparison between FTL and&#xD;
      fractional ablative 2940nm Er:YAG laser(FEL), which had been proved effective and safety in&#xD;
      many studies. Thus, we designed a prospective, simultaneous spilt-face trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of FTL in the treatment of acne scarring and make a comparison between&#xD;
      FTL and FEL, hoping to provide a new available modality for patients who are intolerable or&#xD;
      reluctant to ablative lasers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a chronic and recalcitrant inflammation of pilosebaceous unit that has a&#xD;
      high incidence rate in adolescence and even adults. Acne scarring is not an uncommon cosmetic&#xD;
      complication which will cause physical and phycological pressure and impair the life quality&#xD;
      of patients. It can be divided into two types according to morphology: atrophic and&#xD;
      hypertrophic acne scarring. Atrophic acne scarring can be subclassified into boxcar, icepick&#xD;
      and rolling scarring due to morphological features. Although a great variety of modalities to&#xD;
      treat atrophic acne scarring such as chemical peeling, lasers and light, micro-needling and&#xD;
      radiofrequency have emerged, fractional laser (FL) have come out on top. Unlike resurfacing&#xD;
      lasers, FL creates three-dimensional, evenly distributed &quot;microscopic thermal zones(MTZs)&quot;on&#xD;
      the treating area, which only covering about 3-40% of the skin and leaving the surrounding&#xD;
      tissue undamaged and serving as &quot;cell reservoir&quot;. Then, the MTZs can be rapidly replaced by&#xD;
      keratinocytes in &quot;cell reservoir&quot; within the first 24 hours and by new collagen within 3-6&#xD;
      months. FL can be categoried into fractional ablative laser(FAL) and fractional non-ablative&#xD;
      laser(FNAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a wavelength of 2940nm, FEL could be highly absorbed by water-containing tissues of skin&#xD;
      and cause superficial epidermis ablation and collagen induction[4]. But thermal damage is&#xD;
      limited to about 20-50um. FTL has a moderate affinity for water content tissue. Thus, rather&#xD;
      than causing epidermis turnover, it keeps the epidermis intact. But it can penetrate deep&#xD;
      into 200-300um and stimulate collagen regeneration. Prior studies have shown that both FAL&#xD;
      and FNAL were effective in treating acne scarring and the former were more effective while&#xD;
      the latter had less side effects. However, in our clinic, we have observed outstanding effect&#xD;
      and high satisfaction rate of FTL in improving atrophic acne scarring. Since there was only&#xD;
      one clinical trial reported the efficacy and safety of FTL in Asian and no study have made a&#xD;
      comparison between FTL and FEL, we designed this prospective, simultaneous spilt-face trial,&#xD;
      hoping to provide a new available modality for patients who are intolerable or reluctant to&#xD;
      ablative lasers.&#xD;
