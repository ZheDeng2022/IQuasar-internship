  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional pilot study with the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish scalable methodology for collection of retinal images, blood pressure (BP) and&#xD;
           laboratory-based assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the results of a machine-learning algorithm in predicting BP, glycated&#xD;
           haemoglobin (HbA1c) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from digital retinal&#xD;
           images with clinical and laboratory-based measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the required sample size needed to support a future study to fully validate&#xD;
           the machine-learning algorithm&#xD;

        following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With or without DM (at least 50% of participants will have an HbA1c ≥ 6.5%* and/or a&#xD;
             known diagnosis of DM)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be ≥ 35 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With or without DM (at least 50% of participants will have an HbA1c ≥ 6.5%* and/or a&#xD;
             known diagnosis of DM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female (at least 40% of participants must be male, and at least 40% must be&#xD;
             female)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix A&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of a medical condition which in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the participant to participate in the&#xD;
             study for example, but not limited to, if a participant is critically unwell or&#xD;
             requiring ongoing emergency treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known eye condition that may preclude clear imaging of the retina for example;&#xD;
             cataracts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca&#xD;
             staff and/or staff at the study site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judgment by the investigator that the participant should not participate in the study&#xD;
             if the participant is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous enrolment in the present study with the exception of roll-in participants who&#xD;
             may be re-screened and re-enrolled.&#xD;
