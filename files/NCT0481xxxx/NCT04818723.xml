  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators planned this research to elucidate if there is any efficacy of montelukast,&#xD;
      a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in steroid sensitive childhood onset NS to help prevent&#xD;
      relapses. This study was done to know the role of leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)&#xD;
      montelukast in preventing relapses in idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome (NS)&#xD;

      A quasi-experimental study, done at Department of Pediatric Nephrology at the Children's&#xD;
      Hospital &amp; the Institute of Child Health, Multan. A total of 96 patients aged 1-10 years with&#xD;
      steroid sensitive Idiopathic NS were assigned into two groups (48 patients in each group).&#xD;
      The case group received montelukast 5mg daily at bed time while the control group was not&#xD;
      given montelukast. Steroid treatment protocol was the same for the two groups as per&#xD;
      institutional guidelines. Patients were monitored and followed for the response to treatment&#xD;
      and evidence of relapse over the study period (minimum 12 months).&#xD;

    <description>53 in Case Group (given montelukast 5mg at bed time). All patients were induced with prednisolone 2mg/kg single morning dose with breakfast for total 4 weeks. Patients who did not achieve remission after 4 weeks' full dose were labeled steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome SSNS were further treated by prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg single morning dose with breakfast every other day for the next 4 weeks. Prednisolone was then tapered by reducing 25% dose fortnightly and completely stopped in 8 weeks. Patients in the Case Group continued taking montelukast after stopping steroids. All patients were followed up every 4-8 weeks for a minimum of 12 months to look for response to treatment, side effects of medications, other co-morbidities, and the number of relapses. Relapses were treated with repeat prednisolone doses according to the protocol of treatment for relapse.</description>
