      This phase Ib/II trial studies the effects of ASTX727 (decitabine and cedazuridine) in&#xD;
      combination with venetoclax in treating patients with higher-risk acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      patients who do not have a change in the gene called fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3).&#xD;
      Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping&#xD;
      the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow.&#xD;
      Cedazuridine is an enzyme inhibitor. It helps to increase the amount of decitabine in the&#xD;
      body so that the medication will have a greater effect. Venetoclax may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Venetoclax and&#xD;
      decitabine are commonly given together for older patients with AML ASTX727 (a pill form of&#xD;
      decitabine + cedazuridine) has been found to be equal to decitabine (given intravenously),&#xD;
      and this part of the study is to confirm that venetoclax and ASTX727 is as safe as venetoclax&#xD;
      and decitabine given intravenously. This study allows for lowering doses of study drugs to&#xD;
      assure the dose chosen for the randomized study (second portion of this trial) is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable for people. Giving ASTX727 in combination with venetoclax may help in the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with higher-risk acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended safe phase 2 dose of venetoclax + decitabine and cedazuridine&#xD;
      (ASTX727) defined as the highest dose level in which one or fewer dose limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs) are experienced among six patients. (Phase Ib) II. To determine and compare the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of venetoclax +ASTX727 versus (vs.) standard anthracycline induction&#xD;
      therapy ('7+3') with a primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS). (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the complete&#xD;
      response (complete response [CR] + complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery&#xD;
      [CRi]) rate in patients with treatment naive FLT3WT acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with&#xD;
      venetoclax and ASTX727 vs. standard anthracycline induction therapy ('7+3'). (Phase II) III.&#xD;
      To determine the duration of response (DoR) in patients with treatment naive FLT3WT AML&#xD;
      treated with venetoclax and ASTX727 vs. standard anthracycline induction therapy ('7+3').&#xD;
      (Phase II) IV. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with treatment&#xD;
      naive FLT3WT AML treated with venetoclax and ASTX727 vs. standard anthracycline induction&#xD;
      therapy ('7+3'). (Phase II) V. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with&#xD;
      treatment naive FLT3WT AML treated with venetoclax and ASTX727 vs. standard anthracycline&#xD;
      induction therapy ('7+3'). (Phase II) VI. To determine the overall survival (OS) of patients&#xD;
      with treatment naive FLT3WT AML treated with venetoclax and ASTX727 vs. standard&#xD;
      anthracycline induction therapy ('7+3'). (Phase II) VII. To determine the proportion of&#xD;
      patients receiving stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with treatment naive FLT3^WT&#xD;
      AML treated with venetoclax and ASTX727 vs. standard anthracycline induction therapy ('7+3').&#xD;
      (Phase II) VIII. To identify mutational burdens in venetoclax +ASTX727 sensitive vs.&#xD;
      resistant AML leukemia initiating cells (LICs). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify transcriptomic signatures in venetoclax +ASTX727 sensitive vs. resistant AML&#xD;
      LICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the utility of high-throughput phenotype-based assessment of drug efficacy for&#xD;
      predicting patient response to venetoclax +ASTX727.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine if treatment failure is a function of therapy sequence or results in&#xD;
      resistance to the alternative therapy by conducting a co-clinical trial via patient-derived&#xD;
      xenograft (PDX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax. V. To determine the morphologic&#xD;
      leukemia-free state (MLFS) rate in patients with treatment na√Øve FLT3WT AML treated with&#xD;
      venetoclax and ASTX727 vs. 7+3 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib dose de-escalation study followed by a phase II randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE Ib: Patients receive ASTX727 (decitabine and cedazuridine) orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 1-4 or 1-5 and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28 or days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive ASTX727 PO QD at the recommended phase II dose and venetoclax PO QD&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 24 hours on days 1-7 and&#xD;
      daunorubicin IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

             composition to venetoclax, ASTX727, or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have received known moderate or strong CYP3A inducers within 7 days&#xD;
             of enrollment. Patient must not have known medical conditions requiring chronic&#xD;
             therapy of moderate CYP3A inducers. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations (including substance abuse) that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because venetoclax and ASTX727 have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with venetoclax, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with venetoclax. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous exposure to either venetoclax or &gt; 1 cycle of DNMTi (e.g. azacitidine,&#xD;
             decitabine, ASTX727, CC486)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, uncontrolled infection as determined by the investigator. Patients with&#xD;
             infection under active treatment and controlled with antibiotics are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition deemed by the investigator to make the patient a poor candidate for&#xD;
             clinical trial and/or treatment with investigational agents&#xD;
