  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore and define the correlations between genotype and&#xD;
      phenotype in patients with CTNNB1 mutations as well as monitor and survey the natural history&#xD;
      of the CTNNB1 syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CTNNB1 mutation is linked with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. So far, there&#xD;
      have been 28 studies published describing 71 patients with this syndrome, which leaves much&#xD;
      to be yet discovered. The goal of the study is to reach out to the community and include as&#xD;
      many families of patients with CTNNB1 syndrome as possible to create a strong and reliable&#xD;
      base of information. the investigators are specifically interested in the correlation between&#xD;
      different genotypes and phenotypes and the natural course of the disease. The information&#xD;
      gathered with this study will help understand CTNNB1 mutations as well as their effect on&#xD;
      patient's overall health and wellbeing. The long-term goal is using this information to help&#xD;
      create new treatment options, e.g. gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be guided through a detailed questionnaire about the patient's history,&#xD;
      prenatal and delivery risk factors, current medical issues and standardized questionnaires on&#xD;
      a variety of subjects that constitute the patient's health and daily function. The&#xD;
      investigators wil ask the participants to provide results of genetic testing and other&#xD;
      diagnostic measures, thus providing the medical community as well as the families of the&#xD;
      patients a reliable overview of the syndrome.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with a documented CTNNB1 gene change and/or their caretakers will report detailed medical and family history information and provide the results of genetic and other diagnostic testing by completing our online questionnaire. They will be guided through the questionnaire by the help of a medical doctor via an electronic meeting (Zoom) by one of our researchers. Online research surveys will be used to collect information about the patient's genotype and phenotype, with the goal of better understanding the diversity of CTNNB1 syndrome and thus improving clinical care and treatment for these patients.</description>

    <description>The Viking Speech Scale (Pennington, Virella, Mjøen, da Graça Andrada, Murray, Colver, … &amp; Andersen, 2013) is used to classify children's speech production, specifically the ease at which children can make themselves understood using different methods of communication. The scale has four levels and is ordinal. The four levels include: (1) speech is not affected by motor disorder (2) speech is imprecise but usually understandable to unfamiliar listeners (3) speech is unclear and not usually understandable to unfamiliar listeners out of context (3) no understandable speech. It is intended for children above the age of 4 years.</description>

    <description>The Functional Communication Classification System (Barty, Caynes &amp; Johnston, 2016) was designed to classify how children with cerebral palsy communicate on a daily basis. The tool focuses on how children typically communicate with familiar and unfamiliar communication partners. There are five classifications a child can be categorized in: (1) effective communicator in most situations (2) effective communicator in most situations, but does need some help (3) an effective communicator in most situations and can communicate small ranges of messages and topics to most familiar people (4) assistance is required in most situations, especially with unfamiliar people and environments. Communicates daily needs and wants to familiar people (5) communicates using undirected movement, vocalisation and/or behaviour, for interpretation by familiar people. The FCCS is valid for use in children up to 13 years.</description>

    <description>The Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS; Sellers, Mandy, Pennington, Hankins, Morris, 2013) has been developed for people with cerebral palsy to describe five distinct levels of ability using the key features of safety and efficiency. The patient can be categorized in: (1) eats and drinks safely and efficiently, (2) eats and drinks safely but with some limitations to efficiency, (3) eats and drinks with some limitations to safety; maybe limitations to efficiency, (4) eats and drinks with significant limitations to safety or (5) unable to eat or drink safely - tube feeding may be considered to provide nutrition. The EDACS is valid for use in children above the age of 36 months.</description>

    <description>The Gross Motor Function Classification System - Expanded &amp; Revised (GMFCS - E&amp;R; Palisano, Rosenbaum, Bartlett, Livingston, 2007) is a 5-level classification system that describes the gross motor function of children and youth with cerebral palsy on the basis of their self-initiated movement with particular emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility. Distinctions between levels are based on functional abilities, the need for assistive technology, including hand-held mobility devices (walkers, crutches, or canes) or wheeled mobility, and to a much lesser extent, quality of movement. The questionnaire is available for four age groups of children and youth: 2 to &lt; 4 years, 4 to &lt; 6 years, 6 to &lt; 12 years, and 12 to 18 years.</description>

    <description>The ECOHIS measures the impact of oral problems and/or experience of dental treatment on the quality of life in children under 5 years old and their parents or other family members. It has 13 questions divided into two domains: one related to impact on the child (9 questions), and another to impact on the family (4 questions), measured using the Likert scale. In children with cerebral palsy and/or the ECOHIS has been validated for ages up to 6,5 years, in children with intellectual disability for ages up to 5 years and in children with special need for ages up to 9 years.</description>

    <description>The FIS evaluates the impact of a child's oral condition on family life. It consists of 14 items divided into three subscales: parental/family activity (PA), parental emotions (PE), and family conflict (FC). The financial burden subscale (FB) is the only one that is evaluated separately, since it comprises a single item and addresses economic rather than psychosocial or behavioural impact. It has been validated for children above the age of 12 years.</description>

    <description>The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA; Achenbach) is a collection of questionnaires used to assess adaptive and maladaptive behavior and overall functioning in individuals. The system includes report forms for multiple informants - the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is used for caregivers to fill out ratings of their child's behavior, the Youth Self Report Form (YSR) is used for children to rate their own behavior, and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) is used for teachers to rate their pupil's behavior. The ASEBA seeks to capture consistencies or variations in behavior across different situations and with different interaction partners. The ASEBA exists for multiple age groups, including preschool-aged children, school-aged children, adults, and older adults. Scores for individuals in each age group are norm-referenced.</description>

    <description>The ABAS-3 (Harrison, Oakland, 2015) is a rating scale useful for assessing skills of daily living in individuals with developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, learning disabilities, neuropsychological disorders, and sensory or physical impairments. Rating forms are filled out by the parent and a teacher. The ABAS-3 covers three broad domains: conceptual, social, and practical, using 11 skill areas within these domains. Tasks focus on everyday activities required to function, meet environmental demands, care for oneself, and interact with others effectively and independently. On a 4-point response scale, raters indicate whether, and how frequently, the individual performs each activity.</description>
