      Objective: To compare the use of autogenous bone graft versus autogenous bone graft mixed&#xD;
      with bioactive glass bone graft in the treatment of maxillary anterior horizontal bone&#xD;
      defects by ridge splitting technique combined with simultaneous implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Twenty-two patients were divided randomly into two groups; control&#xD;
      group and study group. In control group, bone expansion was performed and autogenous bone was&#xD;
      used to augment the intercortical bone defect. In study group, bone expansion was performed&#xD;
      and autogenous bone mixed with bioactive glass was used to augment the intercortical bone&#xD;
      defect. In both groups, the implants were inserted simultaneously with ridge splitting. 6&#xD;
      months after implant placement, the mean bone width and alveolar bone loss values were&#xD;
      evaluated. Statistical analysis using paired Student's t- test to compare results within the&#xD;
      same group of patients, whereas, independent samples t-test was used to compare variables&#xD;
      between the two groups&#xD;

      Participants' selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      22 patients, aged from 18 to 50 years, were selected in this prospective, randomized and&#xD;
      blinded clinical trial from the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Oral Medicine and&#xD;
      Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Kafrelsheikh University. Those subjects had inadequate&#xD;
      bone volume for implant placement due to width insufficiency of maxillary anterior alveolar&#xD;
      ridges. The research ethical committee of Faculty of Dentistry, Kafrelsheikh University&#xD;
      approved the study (KD/06/21). Research procedures were explained to all patients, and they&#xD;
      agreed to participate in the study and signed the appropriate informed consent form. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria implemented for patient selection were good general health at the time of&#xD;
      surgery; at least 3months postextraction healing period; and horizontally compromised&#xD;
      maxillary anterior alveolar ridges (at least 3mm bone width and 13mm bone height). The&#xD;
      criteria of patients exclusion were vertical bone defect; thick labial cortex with less&#xD;
      cancellous bone inside; obvious undercut on the labial/buccal side; uncontrolled periodontal&#xD;
      conditions; history of radiotherapy in the head and neck region; uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus or other systematic disorders; smokers; pregnancy; non-compliant patients; and&#xD;
      allergic reaction to the used medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgical therapy and grouping Pre-surgical therapy consisted of a thorough full-mouth&#xD;
      scaling and root planning. Patients were randomly assigned immediately before surgery into&#xD;
      two groups (11 patients each) by computer-assessed randomization software (Random Allocation&#xD;
      Software, Version 1.0). Control group received ridge splitting with simultaneous implant&#xD;
      placement in combination with autogenous bone graft alone, while study group used (1:1)&#xD;
      mixture of autogenous and bioactive glass bone grafts. Bone volume was assessed two weeks&#xD;
      before operation using CBCT (Scanora 3D, Soredex Oy, Tuusula, Finland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operations were performed under local anesthesia. Mid-crestal incision followed by full&#xD;
      thickness flap reflection to expose surgical site. Mid crestal cut using piezo-surgery unit&#xD;
      (Piezotome® Cube, ACTEON®, Acteon Group Ltd, Norwich, England). Then, the cut was extended&#xD;
      deep to the length of implant. Then, ridge was expanded progressively using bone wedges&#xD;
      (Microdent Implant System, Spain). Implant location was marked, with a buccal bony wall as&#xD;
      uniformly thick (&gt;1 mm) as possible to avoid bone fracture. The implant site was prepared and&#xD;
      3.75*13 mm dental implant fixture (Humana Dental Implants &amp; Accessories GmbH, Germany) was&#xD;
      placed stably in between the two bony plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autogenous bone harvesting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incision was made at mucogingival junction in the symphysis area followed by full thickness&#xD;
      flap reflection, and then corticocancellous bone was harvested using a trephine drill.&#xD;
      Finally the flap was sutured by interrupted and horizontal mattress suture by 3-0 black silk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control group, harvested autogenous bone graft was used for augmentation of the gap&#xD;
      between buccal and lingual plates. Study group received the same way of treatment except&#xD;
      using (1:1) mixture of the harvested autogenous bone with bioactive glass bone graft&#xD;
      (BonyGlass, Pharma-Excellence, Egypt). The wound was completely closed in a tension-free way.&#xD;
      All surgeries were performed by the same operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1g. every 12hours antibiotic (Augmentin&#xD;
      1g, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals), and 0.12% chlorhexidine hydrochloride mouth wash&#xD;
      twice daily (Hexitol, ADCO, Cairo, A.R.E). The sutures were removed 14days postoperatively.&#xD;
      No removable denture was allowed to wear for 2weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6months postoperatively, clinical evaluation was recorded including implant survival,&#xD;
      presence of infection, pain, tenderness or wound dehiscence. CBCT was taken at 6months&#xD;
      postoperatively to evaluate ridge width and bone level. All clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      measurements were recorded by one calibrated masked examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables The primary outcome variable was linear changes in the marginal bone&#xD;
      surrounding the implants and alveolar ridge width, taken from cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal CBCT images. Bone heights and width were assessed preoperatively and after&#xD;
      6months postoperatively using the CBCT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was undertaken via G power version 3.1 statistical software based on&#xD;
      the following pre-established parameters: an alpha-type error of 0.05, a power test of 0.80,&#xD;
      a total sample of 22 subjects (11 subjects for each group) appeared to be sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 20 software (IBM Corp., Armonk,&#xD;
      NY, USA). Data were presented as the mean+stanstandard deviation. The paired Student's t-&#xD;
      test was used to compare the obtained results within the same group of patients at 2&#xD;
      different intervals. The independent samples t-test was used to compare variables between the&#xD;
      two groups. In all tests, the result was considered statistically significant if the P-value&#xD;
      was &lt;0.05.&#xD;
