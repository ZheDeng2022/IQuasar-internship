      This phase 1, open-label, single-arm, prospective, single center study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of cyclosporine in combination with carfilzomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The patients&#xD;
      will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of RRMM, who have received&#xD;
      at least two prior lines of therapy including carfilzomib, and were non responsive or&#xD;
      refractory to carfilzomib as specified below, and who were found to have elevated expression&#xD;
      of Peptidylprolyl Isomerase A (PPIA) in scRNA sequencing of their myeloma cells, and who meet&#xD;
      other protocol outlined eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated with cyclosporine with dose titration based on repeated&#xD;
      determinations of whole blood concentrations to achieve a target trough concentration of 250&#xD;
      ng/mL, in combination with carfilzomib plus dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive treatment for 4 months or until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, the earliest of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for Adverse Events (AEs), clinical status-Overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) as defined by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, Progression Free&#xD;
      Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DOR), Time to Progression (TTP), stringent Complete&#xD;
      Response (sCR 0, Complete Response (CR), Very Goog Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response&#xD;
      (PR), Depth of Best Response (DpR), Time To Response (TTR), Progressive Disease (PD), Overall&#xD;
      Survival (OS) and laboratory parameters for up to 4 months, unless they terminate early due&#xD;
      to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or due to meeting one of the withdrawal&#xD;
      criteria&#xD;
