  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of cardiac rehabilitation on blood vessel health using a&#xD;
      newly developed microfluidic-based tactile sensor to assess blood vessel health. The&#xD;
      participants will have their blood vessel health measured using a sensor that is placed on&#xD;
      top of the skin over the artery before and after exercise (1, 3, 5, 10, 30 and 60 mins). The&#xD;
      investigators will study these responses at the first session of cardiac rehabilitation and&#xD;
      following 1 and 4 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation (sessions 3 and 6). The investigators will&#xD;
      also collect some information from the medical record regarding: age, gender, body mass&#xD;
      index, resting cardiovascular measures (heart rate, blood pressure etc), medications, reasons&#xD;
      which qualified the participant into cardiac rehabilitation, blood tests related to heart or&#xD;
      cardiovascular function, metabolic panel, lipid panel, echocardiogram results, recorded&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, known vascular diseases, presence of implantable devices, Seattle Heart&#xD;
      Failure Model data and cardiovascular measures and exercise workloads during cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will make the following research measurements (pre-exercise measurement and&#xD;
      post-exercise measurement) on the first day of cardiac rehab, and following 1 and 4 weeks of&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have their arterial pulse measured at the radial (wrist), carotid (neck) and&#xD;
      temple (side of the head) arteries. The sensor will remain in place for 2-3 minutes while the&#xD;
      recordings are made. Light pressure will be applied during this time. Blood pressure will&#xD;
      also be obtained in the opposite arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will then exercise on the modalities, intensity and duration designated by the&#xD;
      staff in the Sentara Heart Hospital Cardiac Rehabilitation. It's important to note, that the&#xD;
      normal standard of care will not change by the individual participating in this research&#xD;
      study. The participants will follow standard physician ordered cardiac rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      order of the modalities performed will be completed in the same order on the day of research&#xD;
      testing in weeks 1 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing the exercise, the subject will sit down for 1hr. The participant's pulse&#xD;
      signals will be measured at 0-5min, 10min, 20 min, 30min and 1hr after exercise. Blood&#xD;
      pressure will also be obtained from the opposite arm at the same time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be collecting cardiac rehab data from each research day. This data&#xD;
      will be entered into Redcap by the Sentara researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will record from the most recent values/visits prior to start of cardiac&#xD;
      rehab therapy, and this information will be entered into Redcap by the Sentara researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will document at 1, 2 and 3 years from start of cardiac rehab, as to&#xD;
      patient survival status.&#xD;
