      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a high definition tDCS-accompanied intensive&#xD;
      cognitive training of working memory leads to performance improvement in women with&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment after breast cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have undergone chemotherapy, may develop post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (PCCI), which may occur in several cognitive domains and persist for many years. These&#xD;
      declines in cognitive functions can lead to psychological distress and affect overall&#xD;
      patients' quality of life. The goal of the present study is to assess behavioral effects of a&#xD;
      multi-session cognitive training combined with high-definition transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) in women with PCCI. First studies have shown positive effects of cognitive&#xD;
      training on trained and untrained functions and the subjective perception of stress, however&#xD;
      the effects are small and transfer effects are inconsistent. A promising approach to elongate&#xD;
      and increase the effects of cognitive training is to combine the training with tDCS.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study women with PCCI will participate in a three-week cognitive training&#xD;
      with concurrent online high-definition tDCS application. Cognitive performance (primary), as&#xD;
      well as Quality of Life scores and Sleep data will be examined before, during and after the&#xD;
      intervention. In order to draw conclusions about the effect of tDCS in addition to cognitive&#xD;
      training, a control group, receiving sham stimulation during training, will be assessed. A&#xD;
      Follow-up session to assess long-term effects is planned four weeks after the post&#xD;
      assessment. The results of the study will offer valuable insights into efficacy of combined&#xD;
      tDCS and cognitive training intervention in women with PCCI in order to establish its&#xD;
      potential to induce improvements in cognitive functions, and to beneficially affect&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures.&#xD;
