  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin type A injections into the detrusor at a dose of 200 units (U) of BOTOX® are&#xD;
      a recognized second-line treatment for the treatment of adult neurogenic lower urinary tract&#xD;
      disorders. Anticholinergics are established as the usual first-line treatment for neurogenic&#xD;
      detrusor hyperactivity, but are oft not sufficiently effective and have significant side&#xD;
      effects. In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffering from overactive bladder, the 200&#xD;
      U dose of BOTOX® is very effective but induces a risk of urinary retention in 30% of patients&#xD;
      requiring the temporary use of self-catheterization1. At 100 U, a recent study shows the&#xD;
      efficacy and very good tolerance of botulinum toxin A in terms of probing risk in MS patients&#xD;
      with overactive bladder and failure of anticholinergics. Furthermore, the efficacy of&#xD;
      anticholinergics in MS has been little studied and is also disputed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to test the therapeutic alternative as the first line of treatment in&#xD;
      two groups of randomized MS patients from a homogeneous population suffering from overactive&#xD;
      bladder:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group testing the effectiveness of low doses of botulinum toxin type A (100 U,&#xD;
           BOTOX®),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the other group receiving the standard anticholinergic treatment (solifenacin succinate,&#xD;
           Vesicare®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this pilot study, the efficacy and side effects profile of each treatment will be&#xD;
      analyzed in order to determine the amplitudes of effect and the safety profiles in this&#xD;
      population and in order to establish the statistical hypotheses for a subsequent randomized&#xD;
      multicenter study. The aim of this study will be to establish the benefit of botulinum toxin&#xD;
      at a dose of 100 U as a first-line treatment instead of anticholinergics&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX®) injections will performed on an outpatient basis by&#xD;
      cystoscopy under local anesthesia. Twenty minutes after an intravesical instillation of 20 ml&#xD;
      of 0.2% ropivacaine, the botulinum toxin is injected into the detrusor muscle using a&#xD;
      flexible injection needle at a rate of 10 U of BOTOX® per mL (10 points of 1 mL injections).&#xD;
      Intravenous prophylaxis (cefuroxime 1.5 g) will be performed 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Vesicare® arm will be given the tablets at the baseline visit to be taken&#xD;
      once a day in the morning for 12 weeks. For this arm, there will be no antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out via eCRF in the secuTrial® environment with an integrated&#xD;
      Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) function allowing the allocation of a participant to&#xD;
      one of the two intervention groups. Randomization will be carried out using a randomization&#xD;
      table in blocks of 2, predefined without the knowledge of the investigator, respecting a&#xD;
      balanced allocation between the two groups, necessary given the modest number of participants&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of therapeutic responses for each treatment is not precisely known in this&#xD;
      patient population. As a result, there are no reliable preliminary data which would allow the&#xD;
      investigators to calculate under these &quot;effect size&quot; assumptions the necessary numbers of&#xD;
      participants to be randomized between the two intervention groups in order to demonstrate a&#xD;
      possible superiority of treatment by injection of BOTOX® 100 U in comparison to the reference&#xD;
      anticholinergic treatment. The comparative study will therefore only be accessible after&#xD;
      determining the intensity of these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the framework of a pilot study not directly comparative of the therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      but seeking to identify the amplitude of the effects obtained independently by the two&#xD;
      treatments, it does not appear necessary to resort to a study design with &quot;double-dummy&quot; to&#xD;
      leave the patient blind to the method used. Such an approach would require the use of a sham&#xD;
      injection by cystoscopic route in the group treated with anticholinergics and would not&#xD;
      appear ethical in this context.&#xD;
