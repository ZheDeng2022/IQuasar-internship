  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to compare both methods of skin incisions to determine differences&#xD;
      in postoperative pain, hemodynamic changes, incisional time, blood loss during incision,&#xD;
      wound healing, and wound complication.&#xD;

      Our study aims to compare the use of diathermy versus scalpel in making skin incision during&#xD;
      cesarean section to judge the variations in&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. incision time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. incision blood loss,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. hemodynamic changes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. postoperative pain,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. wound healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. wound complications.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>incision time</measure>
    <time_frame>during surgical operation. the difference between starting skin incision till the rectus sheath was visualized</time_frame>
    <description>We compared incisional time by using a digital clock. The incisional time was established as follows: when skin incision was made, the surgeon called out &quot;start the clock&quot;. Once the rectus sheath was visualized, the surgeon calls out &quot;stop the clock&quot;. The incision time was the difference between &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot;.</description>

    <measure>incision blood loss</measure>
    <time_frame>during surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This was calculated by weighing the swabs pre and postoperatively (1mg = 1ml) after complete hemostasis was achieved.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>during the first day after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We compared those patients clinically for postoperative pain for 24 hours by visual analog scale (VAS) score, a psychometric response scale, and it is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. It is 11 points numeric scale ranges from &quot;0&quot; representing one pain extreme (e.g., no pain) to &quot;10&quot; representing the other pain extreme (e.g., &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;). This score was recorded for each participant at 2,4,6,8,10,12,24 hours postoperatively.</description>

    <description>In the scalpel group, the incision was made by the traditional method, with proper homeostasis by applying pressure to skin blood vessels and ligating the subcutaneous bleeding.</description>

    <description>In the diathermy group, the incision made using a small flat blade pen electrode, set on cutting mode and delivering a 120 watt (maximum) sinusoidal current, electrosurgical cutting performed without pressure or mechanical displacement.</description>
