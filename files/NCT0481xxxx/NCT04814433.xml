  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized trial examining the effect of topically combined&#xD;
      antifibrinolytics (Tranexamic acid) with local anesthetics in all electively created surgical&#xD;
      wound beds in hand surgery to provide long term pain relief and decrease the use of&#xD;
      postoperative narcotics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to provide long term pain relief and decrease the use of&#xD;
      postoperative narcotics. All treatments are applied topically to the surgical bed prior to&#xD;
      closure of the skin. Each of the drugs used in this study are Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) approved and routinely used for pain relief. However, the route of administration of&#xD;
      the drugs and addition of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid is considered off-label&#xD;
      (outside of the FDA-approved indications) and therefore investigational.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Aminocaproic acid</intervention_name>
    <description>FDA notes that aminocaproic acid is useful in enhancing hemostasis when fibrinolysis contributes to bleeding. Aminocaproic acid inhibits both the action of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree, plasmin activity. The fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects of aminocaproic acid appear to be exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree through antiplasmin activity. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.&#xD;
Total of 1000 mg total will be given.</description>

    <intervention_name>Recombinant Human Thrombin</intervention_name>
    <description>Topical thrombin is FDA approved as an aid to hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules is accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques is not sufficient.&#xD;
Recombinant human thrombin is available as 5000-unit and 20,000-unit vials of sterile recombinant topical thrombin lyophilized powder for solution. When reconstituted as directed, the final solution contains 1000 units/mL.&#xD;
For topical application, a total of 10000 units per open surgical study arm involving use of Thrombin will be given</description>

It is frequently used as a standard local anesthetic for surgical procedures.&#xD;
