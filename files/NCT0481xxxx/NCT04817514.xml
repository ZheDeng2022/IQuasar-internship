      Goals: to compare the effects of two distinct rehabilitation protocols (conventional shoulder&#xD;
      musculoskeletal rehabilitation combined with aerobic exercises versus solely conventional&#xD;
      shoulder musculoskeletal rehabilitation) on shoulder pain, function, strength, kinematics and&#xD;
      tendon thickness in patients with type 2 DM after 12 weeks of intervention and a subsequent&#xD;
      follow up of 8 weeks. The secondary objective of this study will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between AGEs accumulation and shoulder pain, function, strength, kinematics and&#xD;
      tendon thickness in individuals with type 2 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial, in which all subjects with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of type 2 DM (with at least 1 year of diagnosis), of both sexes, between&#xD;
      40 and 70 years, presenting shoulder pain (uni or bilateral) for at least 3 months with a&#xD;
      pain intensity score from 3 points on a numerical rating scale for pain intensity, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate. The main outcomes of this study will include the AGEs accumulation&#xD;
      through skin autofluorescence measurement; shoulder pain through NRS scales; shoulder&#xD;
      function through SPADI questionnaire and range of motion measurement; isometric shoulder&#xD;
      muscles strength through manual muscle dynamometer measurement; shoulder kinematics through&#xD;
      three dimensional inertial units measurements; supraspinatus tendon thickness through&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement. All these outcomes will be measured before and after the&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocols. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      rehabilitation groups: specific shoulder rehabilitation protocol group (SRG); or 2) specific&#xD;
      protocol of shoulder rehabilitation plus aerobic exercise group (ARG). All individuals will&#xD;
      be evaluated before starting the rehabilitation protocol (baseline) and at the end of&#xD;
      rehabilitation (post 12 weeks) and 8 weeks after the end of the rehabilitation (follow up).&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, to verify the effectiveness of protocols over time, a variance&#xD;
      analysis (ANOVA) of mixed model with Bonferroni adjustment will be performed for pairwise&#xD;
      comparisons. Variables that do not meet the ANOVA assumptions will be analyzed by the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction a priori. In order to assess the&#xD;
      secondary objective of the study, correlation tests depending on data distribution will be&#xD;
      performed (Pearson or Spearman correlation tests). A simple linear regression analysis will&#xD;
      also be performed in order to analyze how much the AGEs accumulation can explain the&#xD;
      alterations in the musculoskeletal and biomechanical variables. The significance level will&#xD;
      be set at 5%.&#xD;

      SRG Protocol: shoulder rehabilitation protocol The protocol will be performed on a group with&#xD;
      a maximum of 5 participants. Exercises intensity and difficulty will progress after&#xD;
      completing 1 month of assistance, by increasing range of motion and loads (dumbbells) or&#xD;
      resistance (elastic bands) in the exercises that are convenient. Each session will consist of&#xD;
      6 stages: 1) Pendulum exercise (10 repetitions - maintenance for 20 seconds); 2) Slide in&#xD;
      flexion of the arms on the table (2 sets of 10 repetitions, maintenance in maximum range for&#xD;
      20 seconds); 3) Abduction and adduction (2 sets of 10 repetitions, maintenance for 20&#xD;
      seconds); 4) Wall slide - sliding of the arms on the wall (2 series of 10 repetitions,&#xD;
      maintenance of 20 seconds); 5) Internal and external rotation (2 sets of 10 repetitions,&#xD;
      maintenance for 20 seconds); 6) Elongation of the posterior capsule (cross-body) and&#xD;
      pectoralis minor (3 repetitions of 30 seconds each). Pain will be evaluated during the&#xD;
      protocol using the visual analog scale (VAS). The exercises proposed in this protocol are&#xD;
      those that have already demonstrated in the literature an improvement in the function,&#xD;
      strength, range of motion, and pain of the shoulder complex of the general population (27,&#xD;
      58).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity and duration of the resistance exercises will be monitored by the physical&#xD;
      therapist using heart rate monitors and adjusted to follow the same heart rate progression as&#xD;
      outlined below for the aerobic group (ARG). In this manner, the average energy expenditure&#xD;
      for both exercise groups will be similar. The protocol duration will be between 30-35&#xD;
      minutes. All sessions will be supervised by a physiotherapist with experience in physical&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARG group: Shoulder rehabilitation protocol combined to aerobic exercise program The ARG&#xD;
      group will perform the shoulder rehabilitation protocol presented above combined with the&#xD;
      aerobic exercise program. The aerobic program will last 20 minutes per session at 40% of the&#xD;
      reserve heart rate (HRC), progressing up to 40 minutes with a maximum of 60% of the HRC in&#xD;
      the last two weeks, according to the recommendations for patients with type 2 DM proposed in&#xD;
      the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines (59). The program will be carried out in&#xD;
      groups of 4 participants and each session will consist of 3 stages: 1) Warm-up (5 min):&#xD;
      patients will perform stretches of the main muscle groups; 2) Aerobic exercise in the&#xD;
      treadmill with continuous heart rate monitors (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland), which&#xD;
      will be used to adjust workload to achieve the target heart rate (15-40 min); 3) Cooldown (5&#xD;
      min): Stretching of the main muscle groups worked during the sessions and relaxation. In this&#xD;
      way, the rehabilitation protocol of ARG group will last a total of approximately 90 minutes&#xD;
      maximum. Before and after each session, blood pressure, heart rate and subjective perception&#xD;
      of effort will be measured. During sessions, heart rate will be monitored by a heart rate&#xD;
      monitor (Polar Vantage, Finland), and perceived exertion will be measured using the Borg CR20&#xD;
      scale, which should remain approximately between 11-13 (59). All sessions will be supervised&#xD;
      by a physiotherapist with experience in physical exercise.&#xD;
