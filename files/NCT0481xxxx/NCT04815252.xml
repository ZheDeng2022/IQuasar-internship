  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial of the 'Cultivating Healthy, intentional, Mindful Educators'&#xD;
      (CHIME) intervention designed for early childhood educators. The intervention aims to enhance&#xD;
      wellbeing, emotion regulation, and sensitive, responsive caregiving among educators by&#xD;
      providing them with mindfulness, compassion-based techniques to alleviate stress and respond&#xD;
      to emotional challenges in the classroom. The intervention ultimately aims to enhance&#xD;
      children's self-regulation through sensitive, responsive caregiving. Measures of teachers'&#xD;
      emotional regulation, wellbeing, and stress physiology will be collected pre- and post- the 8&#xD;
      week intervention and compared to a waitlist comparison group. Measures of child&#xD;
      self-regulation also will be collected to assess the relation of teacher stress, wellbeing&#xD;
      and emotion regulation to child self-regulation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Across varied disciplines, the science is clear that early relationships and the quality of&#xD;
      early care are central in achieving positive language, cognitive, and social development&#xD;
      outcomes for young children and investments made in early childhood pay for themselves. Early&#xD;
      childhood education is a critical context for fostering stimulating, responsive, and&#xD;
      sensitive caregiving as a substantial number of children under the age of 5 years spend time&#xD;
      in childcare settings, with 64% of children aged 3 to 5 years enrolled in non-relative care&#xD;
      outside the home. While great efforts are made to improve the children's social emotional&#xD;
      well-being in child care environments, less attention has been given to early childhood&#xD;
      educators' (encompassing of early childhood teachers') own well-being. Research that has been&#xD;
      conducted finds early childhood educators experience high levels of distress, including high&#xD;
      levels of depression and burnout. Additionally, previous research finds school age teachers&#xD;
      feeling overworked and overstressed show an altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis&#xD;
      and higher levels of teacher burnout is related to elevated cortisol levels in elementary&#xD;
      school students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will test the efficacy of an 8-week compassion and mindfulness based stress&#xD;
      reduction program for early childhood educators, as well as characterizing relations from&#xD;
      early childhood educator wellbeing to child self-regulation. Teachers will be assigned at the&#xD;
      center level to an intervention group or a wait-list comparison condition, with the wait-list&#xD;
      group receiving the intervention after the 8-week study. Pre- intervention, teachers in both&#xD;
      groups will complete survey measures of their wellbeing, mindfulness, and emotion regulation;&#xD;
      emotion regulation tasks; and assessments of stress physiology in the classroom.&#xD;
      Teacher-child interactions will be observed and children's self-regulation will be measured.&#xD;
      Post-intervention, the same teacher measures will be collected.&#xD;

    <description>Measures attention regulation, awareness, acceptance, and mindful focus on the present. The scale comprises 12 items rated on a 5-point scale. Scores on this scale range from 12-60, with higher scores indicating greater levels of mindfulness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Self Compassion Scale - Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the tendency to treat oneself with compassion, mindfulness and feelings of isolation. The scale comprises 12 items, with scores ranging from 12-60. Higher scores indicate greater levels of self-compassion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the tendency to engage in cognitive reappraisal or suppression of negative emotions. The reappraisal scale comprises 6 items with scores ranging from 6-42. the suppression scale comprises 4 items with scores ranging from 4-28. Higher levels of reappraisal and lower levels of suppression are associated with better emotion regulation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
