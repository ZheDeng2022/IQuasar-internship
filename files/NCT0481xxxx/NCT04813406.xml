      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib&#xD;
      combined with sindilimab as second-line treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (ESCC). In addition, we also explored the possible mechanism of anlotinib combined&#xD;
      with sindilimab in order to screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      China is one of the regions with the highest risk of esophageal cancer in the world, and more&#xD;
      than 90% of esophageal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The incidence of esophageal&#xD;
      cancer is ranked sixth and the mortality rate ranks fourth in China. At present, the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer is mainly based on the combination of&#xD;
      paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the failure of first-line treatment, there is&#xD;
      no standard second-line treatment. The investigators designed a multicenter, single-arm,&#xD;
      open-label phase Ⅱ clinical trial of anlotinib combined with sindilimab as second-line&#xD;
      treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).&#xD;
