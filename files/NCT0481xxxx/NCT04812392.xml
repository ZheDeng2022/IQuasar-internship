  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is known to increase post meal blood sugar levels in young, active&#xD;
      populations. However, how quickly this may occur in active, older adults is not clear.&#xD;
      Further, the relationship between blood vessel health and blood sugar disturbances which&#xD;
      occur to acute physical inactivity is not clear. It is unknown if impairments in blood vessel&#xD;
      function precede increases in blood sugar levels that occurs with inactivity in an aging&#xD;
      population. This study aims to determine if short term reductions in physical activity impair&#xD;
      blood vessel health and blood glucose control to a greater extent in an aging population&#xD;
      compared to a young population. The investigators hypothesize that 5 days of reduced physical&#xD;
      activity will result in impaired blood vessel function and glycemic control in an aged&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      Subjects will undergo testing in 2 study phases separated by at least 2 weeks: 1) active&#xD;
      phase: subjects will have post meal glucose levels measured across 5 days of participating in&#xD;
      their normal exercise routines. Blood vessel health will also be measured via flow mediated&#xD;
      dilation at the end of the 5 day monitoring period. 2) physically inactive phase: subjects&#xD;
      will stop participating in exercise for 5 days while post meal glucose levels are measured.&#xD;
      Blood vessel health will also be assessed on days 1, 3 and 5 of removal of exercise. The&#xD;
      subject will need to come into the lab on these days of inactivity to have blood vessel&#xD;
      health measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring The investigators would like to gain more information about how&#xD;
      blood sugar levels change over the course of a day in a free living setting. To do this the&#xD;
      investigators will use a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). This system is what&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes frequently use to monitor their glucose levels over the course of&#xD;
      the day. Subjects will be asked to wear the CGMS for 5 consecutive, full days on 2 different&#xD;
      occasions. This includes 5 days during their normal regular physical activity, then for 5&#xD;
      days following during the no exercise protocol. The CGMS is worn on the stomach, and it is a&#xD;
      tiny glucose sensor which is inserted just under the skin. This device measures and records&#xD;
      blood glucose values throughout the day. In addition, subjects will be asked to make at least&#xD;
      four finger stick blood glucose readings taken with a standard glucose meter at different&#xD;
      times each day and record these numbers on a log sheet. During the continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring, subjects will need to consume the same type and quantity of foods at the same&#xD;
      time each day (i.e. whatever the subjects consumes on day 1 of baseline testing, they need to&#xD;
      eat that exact same food, volume of food and at the same time on days 1-5 of the study).&#xD;
      Meals and snacks consumed are also entered into a paper-based diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Vessel Health Measurement (Flow Mediated Dilation: FMD) Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      perform their normal exercise routines 12-16 hours prior to blood vessel health being&#xD;
      measured in the active phase as well as prior to the first blood vessel health measurement in&#xD;
      the inactive phase to control for the acute effects of exercise on blood vessel health. Blood&#xD;
      vessel health will be measured at the end of the active phase in both groups of subjects.&#xD;
      Further blood vessel health will be measured following 1, 3, and 5 days of being inactive in&#xD;
      both groups of subjects. Blood flow to the leg will be measured by applying blood pressure&#xD;
      cuffs around the ankle. Pre flow mediated dilation diameter and velocity are recorded for 3&#xD;
      minutes prior to a blood pressure cuff being inflated for 5 minutes. Following cuff&#xD;
      deflation, a 2-minute diameter and velocity recording is collected.&#xD;
