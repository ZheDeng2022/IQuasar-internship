  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is performed on patients with breast cancer to resect and&#xD;
      completely remove the cancer while conserving as much of the surrounding healthy tissue as&#xD;
      possible. Current methods do not allow surgeons to determine the completeness of surgical&#xD;
      resection in real-time. This often results in the need for a second surgical procedure, or in&#xD;
      some cases more than two surgical procedures in order to have confidence that all cancer has&#xD;
      been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 3 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the fluorescent imaging agent PD&#xD;
      G 506 A for the real-time visualization of cancer during standard of care breast conserving&#xD;
      surgery. PD G 506 A is an investigational drug which is converted in the body into a&#xD;
      fluorescent molecule that accumulates in cancer cells. Patients receiving PD G 506 A will&#xD;
      undergo standard of care breast conserving surgery followed by fluorescence imaging and&#xD;
      removal of any potentially cancerous tissue left behind in the surgical cavity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Re-operations due to positive margins following breast conserving surgery (BCS) increase poor&#xD;
      cosmesis, complications, discomfort, stress, adjuvant delay, medical costs and risk of local&#xD;
      recurrence. Reducing positive margin rates can be achieved through optimizing surgical&#xD;
      procedures. This study evaluates a new method for surgeons to visualize carcinoma in&#xD;
      real-time, both in the surgical cavity and on the margins of excised specimen(s) during the&#xD;
      index BCS procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active ingredient of PD G 506A is aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA HCl). ALA HCl is&#xD;
      a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the fluorescent molecule protoporphyrin&#xD;
      IX (PpIX). The exogenous application of ALA HCl leads to a highly selective accumulation of&#xD;
      PpIX in malignant tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 3, 2-part, single-blind [pathologist(s)-blinded] randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD G 506 A to aid in the&#xD;
      visualization of carcinoma during BCS. The Eagle V1.2 Imaging System will be used in this&#xD;
      trial to visualize PpIX fluorescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is an open-label training phase of the study to optimize workflow and Part B of the&#xD;
      study is randomized and single-blind and will serve as the pivotal portion of the study.&#xD;
