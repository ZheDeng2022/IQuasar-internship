  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A good understanding of the principles of balance is vital to achieve optimal outcomes when&#xD;
      treating spinal disorders. A complex interaction of the neuromotor system and muscular&#xD;
      recruitment is necessary for ergonomic balance and deliberate displacement of the human body.&#xD;
      Sagittal plane misalignment in spinal deformities challenges balance mechanisms used for&#xD;
      maintenance of an upright posture. The occurrence of postoperative complications after spinal&#xD;
      deformity correction like under-correction of sagittal misalignment, postoperative reciprocal&#xD;
      changes in thoracic kyphosis, proximal junctional kyphosis and failure of instrumentation are&#xD;
      possibly due to the current state-of-the art inadequate diagnostic work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators do not fully understand the roll of vision and exact strategy of recruitment of&#xD;
      neuromuscular units (trunk, pelvis, lower limbs) in patients with sagittal plane misalignment&#xD;
      during standing and walking. To understand this, a dynamic evaluation of individuals with&#xD;
      spinal deformities is needed. Currently there is only very little research performed in the&#xD;
      field of clinical balance tests and instrumented movement analysis in patients with spinal&#xD;
      deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge for future studies is to further unravel the relation between trunk and lower&#xD;
      limb movements, grouped into functional movement patterns. Moreover, additional information&#xD;
      on trunk and lower limb kinetics and muscle activity (using dynamic electromyography (EMG))&#xD;
      will highly contribute to the understanding of this functional relationship, and will provide&#xD;
      more in-depth insights into compensatory mechanisms of the trunk versus the lower limbs and&#xD;
      vice versa.&#xD;

      A good understanding of the principles of balance is vital to achieve optimal outcomes when&#xD;
      treating spinal disorders. A complex interaction of the neuromotor system and muscular&#xD;
      recruitment is necessary for ergonomic balance and deliberate displacement of the human body.&#xD;
      Spinal alignment has to allow an individual to stand pain free with minimal muscular energy&#xD;
      expenditure. This concept is reflected in the &quot;Cone of Economy&quot; principle by Jean Dubousset.&#xD;
      Sagittal plane misalignment in spinal deformities challenges balance mechanisms used for&#xD;
      maintenance of an upright posture. The current state of the art diagnostic work-up of spinal&#xD;
      deformities is mainly a static 2D radiological evaluation in Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)&#xD;
      free standing position with analysis of the spinopelvic parameters as described by&#xD;
      Duval-Beaupmet and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now sagittal balance has been assessed by dropping a vertical plumb line from C7&#xD;
      vertebral body center and quantifying the distance of the sacral plate from this vertical&#xD;
      (Sagittal Vertical Axis or SVA). Others measure the T1 spinopelvic inclination angle&#xD;
      (T1-SPI). SVA, T1-SPI and pelvic tilt are correlated with self-reported disability and health&#xD;
      related quality of life scores (HRQL) compared to age- and sex-related normal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature suggests a multifactorial etiology of impaired balance capacity with neurological&#xD;
      or vestibular disease, muscular atrophy in mm erector spinae, increasing age, low back pain&#xD;
      and history of spinal surgery. The occurrence of postoperative complications after spinal&#xD;
      deformity correction like under-correction of sagittal misalignment, postoperative reciprocal&#xD;
      changes in thoracic kyphosis, proximal junctional kyphosis and failure of instrumentation are&#xD;
      possibly due to the current state-of-the art inadequate diagnostic work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators do not fully understand the roll of vision and exact strategy of recruitment of&#xD;
      neuromuscular units (trunk, pelvis, lower limbs) in patients with sagittal plane misalignment&#xD;
      during standing and walking. Several compensatory mechanisms in sagittal balance disorders&#xD;
      are identified in the static situation. Intra-spinal mechanisms like hyperextension of lumbar&#xD;
      discs, retrolisthesis of lumbar vertebrae, reduction of thoracic kyphosis, and pelvic back&#xD;
      tilt and extra-spinal mechanisms like knee flessum and ankle extension are suggested to act&#xD;
      as compensatory mechanisms. In literature, a strong correlation between the occurrence of&#xD;
      knee flessum and lack of lumbar lordosis is seen. To understand these mechanisms a dynamic&#xD;
      evaluation of individuals with spinal deformities is needed. Currently there is only very&#xD;
      little research performed in the field of clinical balance tests and instrumented movement&#xD;
      analysis in patients with spinal deformity. With regard to clinical balance tests the&#xD;
      Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB scale) is presented as a reliable tool to predict&#xD;
      wether or not higher-functioning older adults will fall. The FAB scale is a reliable and&#xD;
      valid tool in Parkinson disease with minimal ceiling effect and shows promising results in&#xD;
      detecting small balance disturbances.The use of these balance tests in patients suffering&#xD;
      from spinal deformity with sagittal imbalance has not been validated in literature till now.&#xD;
      Last but not least the use of instrumented movement analysis to examen gait in subjects with&#xD;
      spinal deformity is unconventional. Subjects with fixed sagittal balance are reported to have&#xD;
      a significant slower walking speed and poorer endurance score relative to age matched&#xD;
      controls. An inadequate use of pelvic tilt during walking is also observed. Subjects with&#xD;
      forward inclination of the trunk present with abnormal kinematics and kinetics of the lower&#xD;
      limbs during walking compared to age- and sex-related normal subjects. When deformity exceeds&#xD;
      the primary compensation mechanisms, additional mechanisms, such as crouch gait, are used to&#xD;
      reorient the trunk to a more vertical position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently used trunk model in movement analysis in UZ Leuven has been developed by&#xD;
      Heyrman et al after the work of Leardini et al. Armand et al also considered the thorax not&#xD;
      as one rigid segment and presented the use of an optimal marker placement set on the thorax&#xD;
      for clinical gait analysis. However they did not include markers on the head. Heyrman et al&#xD;
      showed in their study with cerebral palsy children (CP) that increased altered trunk&#xD;
      movements during gait were related to a lower performance on the Trunk Control Measurement&#xD;
      Scale (TCMS) in sitting, indicating the presence of an underlying trunk control deficit.&#xD;
      These authors were thus able to show a correlation between a clinical postural test like the&#xD;
      TCMS and trunk-and lower limb parameters during gait. However, they could not find a&#xD;
      significant correlation between overall altered trunk movements and altered lower limb&#xD;
      movements during gait in a CP population and concluded that observed thorax movements during&#xD;
      gait, most likely are the resultant of both compensatory movements for lower limb deficits&#xD;
      and an underlying trunk control deficit. The current concept of thinking is that in an adult&#xD;
      spinal deformity population with sagittal plane misalignment the observed altered movements&#xD;
      in the lower limbs during standing and gait are compensatory for the forward inclination of&#xD;
      the trunk. The challenge for future studies is to further unravel the relation between trunk&#xD;
      and lower limb movements, grouped into functional movement patterns. Moreover, additional&#xD;
      information on trunk and lower limb kinetics and muscle activity (using dynamic&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG)) will highly contribute to the understanding of this functional&#xD;
      relationship, and will provide more in-depth insights into compensatory mechanisms of the&#xD;
      trunk versus the lower limbs and vice versa.&#xD;
