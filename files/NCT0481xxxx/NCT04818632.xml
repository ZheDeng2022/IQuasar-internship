               1. Pre-menopausal women must have commenced treatment with an LHRH agonist at least&#xD;
                  4 weeks prior to the start of study intervention and must be willing to continue&#xD;
                  to receive LHRH agonist therapy for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Post-menopausal defined according to standard criteria in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histological or cytological confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the breast.&#xD;

          3. Documented positive ER status and HER2 negative status of primary or metastatic tumour&#xD;
             tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status 0 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metastatic disease and radiological or objective evidence of progression on or after&#xD;
             the last systemic therapy prior to the start of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least one lesion as per RECIST Version 1.1 that can be accurately assessed at&#xD;
             baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment by CT, MRI, or plain X-ray or&#xD;
             clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Recurrence or progression on at least one line of endocrine therapy in the metastatic&#xD;
             disease setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For Part A and Part B cohort 1, patients should be eligible for SERD monotherapy&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For Part B Cohort 2, patients should be eligible for SERD treatment and CDK4/6&#xD;
             inhibitors, and prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. For Part B Cohort 3, patients should be eligible for SERD treatment and mTOR&#xD;
             inhibitors, and prior treatment with mTOR inhibitors is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous treatment with AZD9833.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of life-threatening metastatic visceral disease, uncontrolled CNS metastatic&#xD;
             disease or life-threatening extensive hepatic involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, or infection requiring intravenous&#xD;
             antibiotic therapy, which makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the&#xD;
             study or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any clinically important and symptomatic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any concurrent anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Refractory nausea and vomiting, uncontrolled chronic gastrointestinal diseases,&#xD;
             inability to swallow the formulated product, or previous significant bowel resection&#xD;
             that would preclude adequate absorption of AZD9833 (and palbociclib and everolimus).&#xD;
