  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the degree of digestibility of 3 different Fermotein™ products and&#xD;
      compare this to a reference commercially available Mycoprotein (Quorn) and to assess the&#xD;
      effects on blood glucose and insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomized, cross-over, double blind, controlled design. Four different&#xD;
      treatments, all representing a 20g protein load, will be evaluated with a washout period of&#xD;
      minimum one week between the test days. On test days, research subjects will receive a&#xD;
      product e.g. Fermotein™ dry, Fermotein™ wet, modified Fermotein™ wet and a reference&#xD;
      Mycoprotein (Quorn), in the form of a porridge, in randomized order. Blood will be collected&#xD;
      via a catheter before and up-to five hours after protein consumption. Wellbeing, health&#xD;
      complaints or other adverse effects will be collected via short questionnaires during each&#xD;
      test day. After each test day gastrointestinal complaints are collected via an online&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycoprotein is a protein source derived from fungi produced for human consumption. It is high&#xD;
      in protein, high in fiber, low in saturated fat and contains no cholesterol. Their functional&#xD;
      properties and nutrient content make them ideal to use as an ingredient for meat&#xD;
      alternatives. Fermotein™ is such a mycoprotein type novel food source. The digestion&#xD;
      characteristics of Fermotein™ are not known, but essential to evaluate their future potential&#xD;
      as a sustainable protein source. Also, information on the degree of digestibility would&#xD;
      strengthen a novel food dossier that is being constructed for this product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the degree of digestibility of 3 different Fermotein™&#xD;
      products and compare this to a reference commercially available Mycoprotein (Quorn).&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects on blood glucose and insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <measure>Change in degree of digestibility</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention period on 4 test days: at baseline and postprandial blood samples will be collected from the cannula at 10 time points (T=0, 30, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300 minutes).</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess change in the degree of digestibility, we determine 19 free amino acids in blood samples collected via a catheter before and at several time points up-to five hours after protein source consumption. Blood amino acids will be determined by the laboratory of Wageningen FBR, according a valid method: AccQ-Tag ultra-derivation kit &amp; HPLC.</description>
