      INFINITY is a Phase II, multicentre, single-arm, multi-cohort trial aimed at evaluating the&#xD;
      activity and safety of the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab as neoadjuvant (Cohort&#xD;
      1) and definitive (Cohort 2) treatment for MSI-high gastric/gastroesophageal juction cancer&#xD;
      patients eligible for radical surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will pre-screen approximately 310 patients, in order to enrol a total number of 31&#xD;
      patients, 18 in Cohort 1 and 13 in Cohort 2, across 25 Italian Centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After central confirmation of MSI-high, dMMR and EBV-negative status, patients with&#xD;
      resectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Siewert II/III), categorized as cT≥2,&#xD;
      any cN, M0 or any cT, cN1-3, M0 according to TNM classification 8th edition, will be enrolled&#xD;
      and they will receive a pre-operative treatment with tremelimumab 300 mg single&#xD;
      administration (day 1) and durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W for 3 cycles (day 1, 29 and 57).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a complete disease restaging with chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scan,&#xD;
      18-FDG PET/CT, EUS with biopsies and liquid biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, patients will undergo standard gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy between weeks&#xD;
      15 and 18 from enrolment (at least six weeks after the last treatment administration),&#xD;
      followed by an active follow-up every 12 weeks for two years and then a standard follow-up&#xD;
      every six months until the end of the fifth year from surgery. In Cohort 2, patients with no&#xD;
      evidence of complete clinical response (defined as absence of disease persistence at&#xD;
      radiological imaging, liquid biopsy and EUS) will be treated as in Cohort 1. Patients with&#xD;
      complete clinical response will undergo a non-operative management (NOM) and will start an&#xD;
      active follow-up phase every 12 weeks for two years with chest-abdomen-pelvis CT with&#xD;
      contrast, 18-FDG PET/TC, if clinically indicated by the Investigator, EUS with multiple&#xD;
      random biopsies of the tumor site and FNA of clinically suspicious regional nodes and liquid&#xD;
      biopsy, followed by standard follow-up every six months until the end of the fifth year. At&#xD;
      any time during follow-up, in case of clinical suspicion or confirmation of residual gastric&#xD;
      cancer, either at imaging, pathologically at tissue biopsies/cytological specimens or at&#xD;
      ctDNA in liquid biopsy, the patients will undergo standard surgery according to the clinical&#xD;
      practice at their Centre (subtotal/total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment in Cohort 2 will start only after the completion of enrolment in Cohort 1 and after&#xD;
      the extensive evaluation of the final results of Cohort 1 regarding to all endpoints&#xD;
      (including exploratory endpoints) and after potential amendment(s) on study design,&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and study procedures requested by the Sponsor's Steering Committee and&#xD;
      an Independent Data Monitoring Committee made of foreign experts, and after the approval of&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee and the Italian Medicines Agency.&#xD;
