  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with both, migraine and endometriosis, present the case-group, while women with&#xD;
      endometriosis without migraine serve as controls. The primary endpoint is endometriosis stage&#xD;
      confirmed by laparascopy compared to the control group. Further points to compare between&#xD;
      groups are infertility, dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, dyspareunia, number of operations, family&#xD;
      history with first-degree relatives, and age of first symptoms for both conditions and age at&#xD;
      first operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints to evaluate in percentages within the migraine group are migraine&#xD;
      frequency, migraine aura/non-aura, age at migraine start, hormonal migraine, family history,&#xD;
      treatment response, response to prophylactic agents, localization, types of aura and&#xD;
      triggers. Other medical conditions and comorbidities like depression will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the questionnaire we will ask 62 Questions overall. The Questions for endometriosis are&#xD;
      based on a questionnaire from the world endometriosis research foundation and to evaluate the&#xD;
      severity of the migraine we will use the MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) questionnaire&#xD;
      (8).&#xD;
