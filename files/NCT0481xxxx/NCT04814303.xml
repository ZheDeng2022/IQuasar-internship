      TKA involves extensive bone resection as well as soft tissue excision and therefore is&#xD;
      associated with profound postoperative pain. Adequate analgesia after TKA is therefore&#xD;
      considered paramount to facilitate early hospital discharge and effective functional&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee has become a major public health issue and imposes a&#xD;
      significant healthcare burden and accounts for high annual hospitalizations. Chronic OA of&#xD;
      the knee may lead to reduced physical fitness, mobility disability with a resultant increased&#xD;
      risk of cardio-metabolic comorbidity and early mortality. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is&#xD;
      indicated in severe cases to improve long-term pain and function. (1) TKA involves extensive&#xD;
      bone resection as well as soft tissue excision and therefore is associated with profound&#xD;
      postoperative pain. (2) Inadequate perioperative pain control may prolong hospitalization,&#xD;
      hinder early rehabilitation, and is also a strong predictor of persistent pain beyond 3&#xD;
      months. (3) Adequate analgesia after TKA is therefore considered paramount to facilitate&#xD;
      early hospital discharge and effective functional recovery. (4) The recently introduced&#xD;
      adductor canal block (ACB) typically covers the anterio-medial aspect of the knee and&#xD;
      preserves quadriceps function, which presumably enhances postoperative rehabilitation by&#xD;
      allowing patients to actively participate in knee movement. The relative effectiveness of&#xD;
      this ACB technique added to intrathecal morphine is limited to a single study (1) in which&#xD;
      assessment of short-term functional recovery was done and dexamethasone was neither included&#xD;
      in the LIA solution nor perineurally in the ACB. Thus, we hypothesize that adductor canal&#xD;
      block as an adjunct to intrathecal morphine will have a better impact on functional recovery&#xD;
      than peri-articular infiltration.&#xD;

The block will be performed in the mid adductor canal to block both the saphenous and the nerve to vastus medialis. After skin infiltration with 1 to 2 mL of 2% lidocaine, an 80-mm, 22-gauge, the short-bevel echogenic needle is advanced in-plane with the ultrasound beam in an anterior-to-posterior direction until the tip is located within the adductor canal deep to the vastoadductor membrane. After negative aspiration, 1-2 mL of local anesthetic is injected to confirm the proper injection plane. The study solution will be injected within the canal adjacent to the femoral artery. Patients in this group received 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine and 4 mg dexamethasone.</description>

    <description>the surgeon will perform the PAI intra-operatively; 150 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, 30 mg of ketorolac, and 8 mg dexamethasone. Half of the solution will be administered into the posterior capsule and posterior soft tissues of the knee under direct vision after osteotomy but before insertion of the implants. The remaining half of the solution will be administered into the anterior soft tissues after placement of the implants and before skin closure. All local infiltration will be carried out while a thigh tourniquet (used to limit surgical bleeding) was inflated at a pressure of 300 to 350 mm Hg.</description>
