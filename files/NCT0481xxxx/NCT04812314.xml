      Participants will be randomized into one of two different experimental groups: 1) Exercise&#xD;
      group and 2) No exercise (control group). Subject participation in the study will involve a&#xD;
      series of metabolic tests before and after participants undergo a 10% weight loss program&#xD;
      (with or without exercise training depending on group randomization). After completing this&#xD;
      weight loss portion of the study, participants will then be required to adhere to a high&#xD;
      calorie diet program to regain half of the weight the participant lost - followed by the same&#xD;
      series of metabolic tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is among the first line treatments for obesity and obesity-related diseases, yet it&#xD;
      is shocking how little is known about how exercise works to improve health. Expanding the&#xD;
      knowledge about novel exercise-induced adaptations in fat tissue of obese individuals and&#xD;
      furthering the understanding about mechanisms underlying these adaptations could lead to&#xD;
      innovative approaches for preventing and treating insulin resistance and obesity-related&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the researchers believe that exercise training modifies key processes in&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat tissue that may contribute to an increase body fat storage capacity (without&#xD;
      increasing fat mass). The research team anticipates that exercise will evoke an even more&#xD;
      potent adaptive response when fat tissue is dynamically changing in response to alterations&#xD;
      in nutritional status (i.e., weight loss and weight regain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into one of two different experimental groups: 1) Exercise&#xD;
      group and 2) No exercise (control group). Subject participation in the study will involve a&#xD;
      series of metabolic tests before and after participants undergo a 10% weight loss program&#xD;
      (with or without exercise training depending on group randomization). After completing this&#xD;
      weight loss portion of the study, participants will then be required to adhere to a high&#xD;
      calorie diet program to regain half of the weight the participant lost - followed by the same&#xD;
      series of metabolic tests. After the participant completes the study, the study team will&#xD;
      help the participant to lose more weight. Total involvement in the study for each participant&#xD;
      will likely be about 8-10 months.&#xD;
