      Parkland Hospital inpatient nursing staff will be the focus of this study. This project aims&#xD;
      to investigate the use of lavender on the stress levels associated with the nursing role.&#xD;
      Nurses will wear the Elequil aromatabs ® over a four-hour period and a post survey will be&#xD;
      given to assess root cause of stress and changes related to intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nurses today are facing unprecedented patient acuities, burnout, fear, uncertainty, a&#xD;
      continuously evolving workflow and nursing shortages, Therefore, workplace-related stress has&#xD;
      become one of today's most serious occupational hazards. Aromatherapy can be a convenient,&#xD;
      inexpensive, and non-invasive method of stress relief. There is little research regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of aromatherapy by means of inhaling essential oils in reducing workplace&#xD;
      stress-related symptoms among nurses. Therefore, this study will examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      lavender-scented aromatherapy tabs (Elequil ® aromatabs ®) in reducing job stress-related&#xD;
      symptoms among nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study for the participants goes as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nurse identified by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Leadership&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-identified&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SPARKS member&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identified nurse will be informed and consented regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An aromatab will be given to the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  They will place the aromatab on their uniform top to allow for continuous exposure&#xD;
                to the scent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Four (4) hours later - nurse completes survey as to the effects of the aromatab&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Completed survey is placed in research file at charge nurse desk in opaque folder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be used within the research project will be obtained from the collected survey forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be completed face-to-face between the SPARKS team member, leadership, or&#xD;
      self -identification of the potential subject. Considerable care will be taken so that the&#xD;
      person contacted does not feel pressured to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will meet prior to enrolling the first participant, during and upon&#xD;
      completion of data collection. Any safety concerns will be addressed at those times. At any&#xD;
      time during data collection, the PI's or any study team members may request that the team&#xD;
      meets to address a safety concern. Study participants will be assured of anonymity and&#xD;
      confidentiality of the data and they will also be reminded that they can withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time.&#xD;
