    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women, In 2021 it is&#xD;
      estimated that about 30%of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancer. As of&#xD;
      January 2021, there are more than 3,8 million women with history of breast cancer in U.S.A&#xD;
      including women currently being treated and those who finished treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death rates have been steady in women under 50years old since 2007,but have continued to drop&#xD;
      in women over 50 years old .The overall death rate from breast cancer decreased by 1% per&#xD;
      year from 2013 to 2018.these decreases are thought to be the result of treatment advances and&#xD;
      earlier detection and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 43,600 women in U.S.A are expected to die in 2021 from Breast cancer. A woman's risk of&#xD;
      breast cancer nearly doubles if she has a first degree relative who has been diagnosed with&#xD;
      breast cancer .Less than 15% of women who get breast cancer have family member diagnosed with&#xD;
      breast cancer. About 85% of breast cancer occur in women who have no family history of breast&#xD;
      cancer ,these occurs due to genetic mutations that happen as results of aging process rather&#xD;
      than inherited mutations. . [1]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of breast cancer includes the treatment of local disease with surgery,&#xD;
      radiation therapy or both ,and systemic treatment with chemotherapy ,endocrine therapy&#xD;
      ,biologic therapy or combination of these.[2]&#xD;
&#xD;
      After lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is strongly recommended with or without boost to&#xD;
      tumor bed for node positive (category 1 for those with positive nodes; category 2A for those&#xD;
      with negative axillary nodes). This recommendation shows reduction in 10 -year risk of&#xD;
      recurrence in those who received whole breast irradiation versus those who did not. In&#xD;
      addition significant reduction in 15-year risk of breast cancer death was also observed. [3]&#xD;
      Radiotherapy after mastectomy and Axillary lymph node dissection in (node positive disease)&#xD;
      reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in women with 1-3 positive lymph nodes&#xD;
      even when systemic therapy was administered. [4] In node negative disease and tumor less than&#xD;
      5 cm and clear margin &gt;1mm, post mastectomy radiation therapy is not recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary radiotherapy has been used for local control of breast tumors in variety of&#xD;
      situations. Excellent local control was obtained by Chargari et al with radiation alone in&#xD;
      early stage tumors with loco regional control at 7 years of 95,8%. [5] Certain&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents are known as radio-sensitizers, allowing for enhanced therapeutic&#xD;
      ratio and improved tumor control when given concurrently with radiotherapy .concurrent chemo&#xD;
      -radiotherapy has been used at multiple disease sites , with gains in local control, disease&#xD;
      free survival ,and overall survival over radiation alone.[6] Combining adjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      with capecitabine appears to be safe and feasible for chemotherapy resistant breast cancer&#xD;
      patient with stage I-III who has residual disease in form of improve local and distant&#xD;
      disease control [7].&#xD;
