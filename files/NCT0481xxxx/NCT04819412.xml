      Study Rationale A single Rotavirus vaccine container with the vaccine virus and antacid&#xD;
      buffer would be ideal for logistical, administrative and distribution ease, especially in&#xD;
      routine immunization program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The advantages of the liquid vaccines are: Liquid vaccines take lesser time to&#xD;
           administer compared to the current practice of giving antacid buffer prior to vaccine&#xD;
           which takes 40% more time to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easier to transport as it is stable at 2-80C compared to the frozen formulation that&#xD;
           needs to be stored at -200C and transported in dry ice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chances of human error during administration are lesser than the sequential&#xD;
           administration of antacid and vaccine.&#xD;

      Study Design and plan The study is designed as an adaptive, seamless sequential multicenter,&#xD;
      single-blinded, randomized clinical trial with two phases: exploratory phase and confirmatory&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Infants of 6-8 weeks of age will randomly be assigned to receive 3 doses of two different&#xD;
      formulations of ROTAVAC 5C (BBIL-R2014-1 &amp;BBILR2014-2) or ROTAVAC®. In this phase,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of the two new formulations will be compared with each other and&#xD;
      with ROTAVAC® in the three treatment arms when administered at 4 weeks interval (+1week&#xD;
      window). The first dose will be administered at 6-8 weeks of age. Each of the rotavirus&#xD;
      vaccine formulations contains NLT 105fluorescent focus units (FFU)/Dose. After completion of&#xD;
      the exploratory phase, analyses will be undertaken for selection of the most suitable&#xD;
      formulation to undergo confirmatory phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmatory Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infants of 6-8 weeks of age will randomly be assigned to receive 3 doses of the selected&#xD;
           formulation of ROTAVAC 5C (3 production lots) and ROTAVAC® to evaluate lot consistency.&#xD;
           Additionally, non-interference with immune response to antigens contained in childhood&#xD;
           vaccines will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Active surveillance will be conducted for all participants for seven days after each&#xD;
           dose of vaccine to ascertain information on solicited adverse events.(&quot;Reactogenicity&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surveillance for unsolicited AEs for all participants will be conducted from the time&#xD;
           between first dose and 4-6 weeks after the 3rd dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance for SAEs for all participants will be conducted from the time between first dose&#xD;
      and 4-6 weeks after the 3rd dose&#xD;
