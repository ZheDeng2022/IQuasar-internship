  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In practice, a single test is used to quantify thumb proprioception. Previous studies have&#xD;
      found a decrease in joint position sense (JPS) and force sense (FS) in patients diagnosis of&#xD;
      thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis, but no correlation have been stabilize between JPS, FS&#xD;
      and pain intensity perceived by the patient during activity daily life (ADL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is compared joint position error (JPE) with joint force sense error&#xD;
      (JFSE) in subjects with carpometacarpal (CMC) joint osteoarthritis and investigated a&#xD;
      possible correlation between thumb pain intensity and thumb proprioception in patients with&#xD;
      CMC joint OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-five subjects over 18 with thumb CMC joint OA in the dominant hand grade 1-3 according&#xD;
      o the Eaton Classification Stage will be evaluated for thumb active joint position sense&#xD;
      (JPS) test and Force sense test to measure proprioception function. For measurement of JPS,&#xD;
      the subjects will blindfolded and repositioned their thumb to a target position, which will&#xD;
      be determined by the examiner previously. For force sense, participants will should reproduce&#xD;
      pinch force measure with dynamometer. The severity of pain with activity will be measured&#xD;
      according to the visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity will be measured according to the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity and is widely used in adult populations, including those with rheumatic diseases. Sensitivity and reliability of the instrument are well defined including sensitivity to change in pain for patients with chronic inflammatory or degenerative joint pain</description>

    <description>Participants will be instructed to perform daily exercises grouped in 3 sets of 10 repetitions in the absence of pain for 4 weeks. If the patient experienced pain, the number of repetitions dropped sequentially until the exercise was performed pain free. Exercises consisted of active - resistive exercises for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, manual distraction of the CMC joint and relaxation of the adductor thumb muscle. Each participant will also engaged in a one month re-education/joint protection program for thumb use during ADL's and completed a weekly record sheet for monitoring purposes.&#xD;
In addiction, they will received a &quot;thumb whale&quot; orthosis to wear at night and during ADL's as needed for pain.</description>
