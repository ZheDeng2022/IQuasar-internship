  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a randomized, partially double-blind, controlled, multi-center clinical&#xD;
      research method was used. A total of 4 groups were designed, namely, single decoction group,&#xD;
      co-decoction group, powder group and simulation group. The four groups of patients all&#xD;
      received basic health education, diet control and increased exercise guidance. All the&#xD;
      patients in the group have taken western medicine according to their own conditions and&#xD;
      followed the doctor's instructions for hypoglycemic, blood pressure, and lipid-lowering&#xD;
      treatments. After joining the group, they continue to take the medicine at the original dose,&#xD;
      and the patients are advised not to change the medicine during the observation period. Take&#xD;
      12 weeks as a course of treatment, and set the observation period to 12 weeks. Follow up&#xD;
      every 4 weeks.&#xD;

      The research purpose of this project is to observe the effectiveness and safety of Wulingsan&#xD;
      single decoction granules compared with traditional powder, co-decoction granules and&#xD;
      analogues in the treatment of metabolic syndrome in combination with conventional therapies.&#xD;
      ; Compared with Wulingsan traditional powder and co-decoction granule group, observe the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of traditional powder combined with conventional therapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of metabolic syndrome. The trial adopts a randomized, partially double-blind,&#xD;
      controlled, multi-center clinical research method. A total of 320 cases were included in 4&#xD;
      groups, namely, single decoction group, co-decoction group, powder group, and simulated agent&#xD;
      group. The four groups of patients all received basic health education, diet control and&#xD;
      increased exercise guidance. All the patients in the group have taken western medicine&#xD;
      according to their own conditions and followed the doctor's instructions for hypoglycemic,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and lipid-lowering treatments. After joining the group, they continue to take&#xD;
      the medicine at the original dose, and the patients are advised not to change the medicine&#xD;
      during the observation period. Take 12 weeks as a course of treatment, and the observation&#xD;
      period is set to 12 weeks. Follow up every 4 weeks.&#xD;
