      This study is a post market clinical follow up study performed to confirm the performance of&#xD;
      BrOxy M pulse oximeter in comparison with a reference, CE marked, pulse oximeter equipment in&#xD;
      a controlled desaturation study over a range between 80% and 100% SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on a group of healthy volunteers in a controlled clinical&#xD;

      This study is a post market clinical follow up study performed to confirm the performance of&#xD;
      BrOxy M pulse oximeter in comparison with a reference, CE marked, pulse oximeter equipment&#xD;
      (Nellcor™ Bedside Respiratory Patient Monitoring System model PM1000N, Covidien LLC, USA) in&#xD;
      a controlled desaturation study over a range between 80% and 100% SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on a group of healthy volunteers in a controlled clinical&#xD;
      setting. Due to the use of a controlled desaturation protocol foreseen by the standard ISO&#xD;
      80601-2-61:2017, this study is classified as an interventional post-market clinical study in&#xD;
      accordance with Annex I of EN ISO 14155:2020.&#xD;
