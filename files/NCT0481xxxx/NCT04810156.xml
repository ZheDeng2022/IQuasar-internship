  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is to clarify and investigate the patterns of immune related hepatitis&#xD;
      and the optimal treatment choice for patients who are refractory to steroids. The project&#xD;
      aims to prospectively characterize the various histopathological, biochemical and&#xD;
      phenotypical liver injury patterns induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the response&#xD;
      to treatment to corticosteroids. Furthermore, the effect of adding a second-line&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drug, either MMF or tacrolimus in steroid refractory or steroid dependent&#xD;
      cases will be explored and compared.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is expanding worldwide&#xD;
      due to an increasing number of indications, including additional types of cancer, combination&#xD;
      of ICI with other antineoplastic therapies and have recently moved into the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
      According to clinical trial material, almost all patients in ICI treatment will eventually&#xD;
      develop any grade of adverse event, here, estimated in up to 90% of treated patients. Around&#xD;
      10-30 percent of ICI treated patients will show signs of liver injury related to ICI&#xD;
      treatment and will be diagnosed with immune related hepatitis. The treatment hereof, should&#xD;
      include observation and medium dose steroids in low grade asymptomatic patients (grade ≤ 2&#xD;
      ir-hepatitis) and high-dose steroids in higher grades according to the current European and&#xD;
      American guidelines. However, up to 25 percent of patients with ir-hepatitis may not respond&#xD;
      properly to steroids due to primary resistance or relapse during tapering. These patients&#xD;
      should be offered a second line immunosuppressive treatment. The present recommendation for&#xD;
      patients with steroid-dependent ir-hepatitis is based on case series and includes&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). To date, no evidence exists for&#xD;
      which second line treatment to choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the similarity of immune related hepatitis with autoimmune hepatitis, tacrolimus may&#xD;
      be more efficient than MMF in achieving complete and faster response in patients with steroid&#xD;
      refractory or steroid dependent ir-hepatitis. Furthermore, patients with signs of biliary&#xD;
      injury may benefit from adding ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The aim is to enrol around 80 patients to achieve 20 patients with a refractory to corticosteroids for block-randomization. During treatment initiation all patients will be treated with Solu-medrol 2 mg/kg/day for at least 72 hours. Patients with mixed or cholestatic liver injury pattern will also be administrated peroral UDCA.&#xD;
Patients with sufficient steroid response will undergo steroid tapering with transition to peroral steroids. Patients with insufficient treatment response are considered as having a steroid refractory condition and will undergo block-randomization to either MMF or tacrolimus (second line) meanwhile current steroid dose is continued.&#xD;
10 patients will be allocated to mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
10 patients will be allocated to tacrolimus Meanwhile corticosteroids are continued until response of the above treatment, defined as least 20 percent reduction of liver parameters</intervention_model_description>
