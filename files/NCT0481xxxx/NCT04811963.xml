  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare prototype pulse oximeter saturation measurements, during normal to low saturation,&#xD;
      to saturation measurements made by a multi-wavelength CO-oximeter, taken from arterial blood&#xD;
      samples from healthy human subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study utilizes a single-site, physiology laboratory (Clinimark) for non-randomized,&#xD;
      prospective, observational studies. The goal is to enroll a minimum of ten subjects. Subjects&#xD;
      may be of any race, ranging in pigmentation from light to dark to meet the study design&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general purpose of Invasive Controlled Desaturation Studies is to validate the SpO2 and&#xD;
      pulse rate accuracy in comparison to reference-standard measurements of blood SaO2 by a&#xD;
      CO-oximeter during low saturation conditions. This is achieved through paired observations of&#xD;
      SpO2 and SaO2 values over the specified SpO2 accuracy range of 60 % to 100 % SaO22 of the&#xD;
      prototype pulse oximeter on a group of healthy adult volunteers. The fraction of inspired&#xD;
      oxygen (FiO2) delivered to test subjects is varied to achieve a series of targeted&#xD;
      steady-state saturation periods. Arterial blood samples are periodically taken from an&#xD;
      indwelling arterial catheter for use in the comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse rate accuracy will be evaluated during the same data collection period as SpO2. Pulse&#xD;
      rate will be compared to reference ECG heart rate. In the unlikely event that the ECG monitor&#xD;
      malfunctions, the Pulse rate reference may be taken using the average pulse rate value from&#xD;
      the transfer standard pulse oximeters. This study is designed to support an FDA submission&#xD;
      for pulse rate and saturation accuracy in a diverse subject population during low saturation&#xD;
      conditions over a specified saturation range for the OxySoftN pulse oximetry system.&#xD;
