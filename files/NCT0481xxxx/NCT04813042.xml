      This is an individually randomised trial, where Working Out Dads (WOD) will be delivered as a&#xD;
      group intervention. Participants will be randomised to one of two groups: either WOD or usual&#xD;
      care.The trial aims to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WOD, a 6-week week&#xD;
      group-based peer support intervention, in reducing fathers' mental health difficulties in&#xD;
      early parenthood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an individually randomised trial, where Working Out Dads (WOD) will be delivered as a&#xD;
      group intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WOD in&#xD;
      reducing fathers' mental health difficulties in early parenthood. A second aim is to identify&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators for sustained use and scalability of the WOD program and its&#xD;
      adaptation across Victoria and Australia in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 280 fathers of young children (0-4 years) who are experiencing mental&#xD;
      health difficulties or at risk of poor mental health and suicide. Approximately 140 fathers&#xD;
      will be randomised to WOD, and 140 fathers randomised to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fathers will be recruited from four Victorian Local Government Areas (LGAs): Wyndham,&#xD;
      Whittlesea, Geelong, and Ballarat. Within these sites, fathers will be recruited through&#xD;
      maternal and child health, medical and family support services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected via self report surveys at baseline, 10 weeks, and 24 weeks. The&#xD;
      assessment at 24 weeks will also include a telephone interview with a researcher (blinded) to&#xD;
      assess mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment arms. A statistician not&#xD;
      directly involved in the analysis of the trial results will prepare the randomisation&#xD;
      schedule using permuted block randomisation, stratified by LGA, using a random number&#xD;
      generator on a computer. The schedule will be held by the independent statistician and&#xD;
      embedded within the web-based data management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention condition - WOD: Fathers will attend a WOD group within approximately two weeks&#xD;
      of randomisation and within four weeks of baseline assessment. WOD is a 6-week group-based&#xD;
      peer support intervention. WOD's weekly sessions consists of 1-hour group discussion focused&#xD;
      on common challenges and risk factors for poor mental health in early fatherhood, followed by&#xD;
      a 30-minute group exercise session. Fathers in the WOD intervention condition will also have&#xD;
      access to online resources and a father-managed WhatsApp group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care condition: Fathers will receive the clinical care typically provided by an early&#xD;
      parenting or community health service to parents experiencing mental health difficulties.&#xD;
      Within two weeks of baseline assessment, Tweddle's Clinical Manager will conduct a brief&#xD;
      telephone consultation to: (a) enquire about mental health symptoms and conduct a risk&#xD;
      assessment for suicidal ideation; (b) provide referral options to telephone support services&#xD;
      (e.g., PANDA, MensLine); and (c) encourage visiting a general practitioner to discuss&#xD;
      accessing a mental health care plan.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a parallel group randomised controlled trial. The treatment (Working Out Dads 6-week group intervention) will be compared to usual care (brief consultation + resources + referral). Randomisation and analyses will be at the level of the individual participant and adjusted for clustering at the level of the WOD group and Local Government Area (LGA) as a stratification variable. For the primary analysis, the model based mean K10 score in each trial arm will be compared at post-intervention and at the 6-month follow-up (primary outcome).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Treatment allocation will be concealed prior to randomisation by the use of a web-based randomisation system.

The schedule will be held by the independent statistician and embedded within the web-based data management system.&#xD;
Treatment allocation will only be revealed after it has been confirmed that the participant is eligible and enrolled and has completed the baseline questionnaire. REDCap will display the father's assignment for the Project Coordinator, who will notify the father of his treatment assignment and intervention/usual care information by telephone. The treatment allocation in the database will only be visible to the Project Coordinator.</masking_description>

    <measure>Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, mean difference in total scale scores between the Working Out Dads and Usual Care arms</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) assesses depressive and anxiety symptoms in the last 4 weeks. Scores range from 10-50 with higher scores indicating greater levels of psychological distress. Rationale: The K10 is widely used in clinical trials for common mental health disorders, and is consistent with a transdiagnostic approach proposing a common set of psychological distress symptoms underlie mood and anxiety disorders.</description>

    <measure>The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview mean difference in proportion of depressive, suicidal, and anxiety mental health disorders between Working Out Dads and Usual Care arms</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be used to determine clinically significant depressive, suicidal or anxiety mental health disorders. Administered via telephone by trained staff, this 15-minute structured diagnostic interview assesses 17 common DSM-5 and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders. It is well validated for use in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. In this prevention trial, we predict a higher proportion of fathers in the usual care arm (vs. the intervention arm) will have ongoing or emerging clinically significant depressive, suicidal or anxiety mental health disorders by 6 months</description>

    <description>Fathers allocated to the Working Out Dads (WOD) arm will receive the intervention program. WOD is a 6-week manualised program. The weekly 90 minute sessions combine a one hour facilitated discussion by a male facilitator trained in delivery of WOD and a 30-minute gym workout provided by a personal trainer. The group size ranges from 6-10 fathers, with 14 groups running over the study period. The weekly sessions are provided in the evenings, in local gyms or a community setting (e.g., maternal child health centre, local council rooms, local hall, local park, Tweddle Child &amp; Family Health Service).</description>

    <description>The WOD is a manualised group intervention underpinned by solution-focused therapy and social cognitive theories. Psychoeducation about the transition to fatherhood and its potential impacts on wellbeing and family relationships is provided. Fathers are encouraged to share practical ideas for managing stress, revisit previous strategies, validate what they are doing well, and explore solutions.&#xD;
The group discussion is followed by a structured group fitness session provided by a personal trainer. This session focuses on body weight exercises, cardio-based activities, stretching, mobility and incidental activity.&#xD;
Fathers in the WOD study arm receive 10 weeks of encouraging text messages - one each week during the intervention, and four in the weeks after. These will be sent via the WhatsApp group created for each WOD group. These text messages and the WhatsApp group are designed to facilitate fathers' active engagement with the intervention, and to maintain contact with each other.</description>
