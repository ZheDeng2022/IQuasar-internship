  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To perform a liver biopsy in haemophilia A and B patients stably expressing human FVIII/FIX&#xD;
      for a period of at least 6 months following AAV mediated gene transfer. This is to obtain&#xD;
      tissue for analysis, to understand if FIX/FVIII transgenic protein expression is mediated by&#xD;
      AAV proviral DNA that is integrated into the host cell DNA or if stable expression in humans&#xD;
      is mediated by episomal maintained AAV genome.&#xD;

      To better understand the consequences of AAV gene transfer patients will be recruited to&#xD;
      undergo a liver biopsy. Patients will be from a unique cohort of successfully treated&#xD;
      patients, who are at least 6 months post gene transfer (patients will be at varying&#xD;
      timepoints post gene transfer, with the current maximum time post gene transfer being 9.5&#xD;
      years) and have been treated with self-complementary and over-sized AAV vectors will advance&#xD;
      the state-of-the-art, in the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a clearer insight into the AAV life cycle in human liver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the number of human hepatocytes that are transduced&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve our understanding at the human hepatocyte level of long-term consequences of AAV&#xD;
           mediated transgene expression from the liver that will include (i) changes in the&#xD;
           pattern of gene expression in human hepatocytes following AAV mediated gene transfer,&#xD;
           (ii) information on the epigenetic signature in the liver following AAV mediated gene&#xD;
           transfer and how this changes with time and (iii) the consequences of transgene&#xD;
           expression in hepatocytes including the endoplasmic reticulum stress response This study&#xD;
           will provide new data addressing several unknowns with AAV mediated gene transfer in&#xD;
           humans that will better inform on safety and efficacy following AAV gene transfer for&#xD;
           patients who have already participated in gene therapy studies as well as those&#xD;
           considering this treatment option.&#xD;
