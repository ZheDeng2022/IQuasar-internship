      This study seeks to define what constitutes an MCID and a PASS in patients undergoing a&#xD;
      variety of elective major orthopedic surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute postoperative pain after orthopaedic surgery is common and approximately 40% of all&#xD;
      surgical patients experience moderate-severe acute postoperative pain. Treatment of acute&#xD;
      pain after surgery is important to relieve patient suffering, expedite resumption of&#xD;
      activities of daily living, mitigate the risk of postoperative complications, speed&#xD;
      ambulation and rehabilitation and hospital discharge. Good pain treatment requires proper and&#xD;
      sound pain assessment to guide analgesic therapy. Past studies have determined the MCID&#xD;
      values for a variety of chronic pain disorders. There are however limited data on the MCID&#xD;
      for acute pain.At the present time, most perioperative acute pain studies use MCID values&#xD;
      that are extrapolated from chronic pain studies yet the validity of MCID extrapolation&#xD;
      remains unknown. Procedure-specific MCID for pain after most major orthopedic surgery has not&#xD;
      been reported.The MCID for a patient reported outcome can be determined using an anchor and a&#xD;
      distribution based method.The anchor based method uses a subjective Global Rating Scale (GRS)&#xD;
      scale to assess patient's perception of pain relief after treatment. This is a 15-point&#xD;
      Likert scale that ranges from -7 to +7 .Another method to determine the MCID value in pain is&#xD;
      the distribution based method using mathematical calculations to generate 3 MCID values - 1)&#xD;
      0.3 standard deviation (SD) of mean change in NRS scores, 2) the standard error of&#xD;
      measurement (SEM), and 3) 5% of the instrument range of the mean change in the NRS scores&#xD;
      after an analgesic intervention according to patient-rated GAR scale. The SEM is calculated&#xD;
      as the SD multiplied by the square root of 1 minus the intraclass correlation coefficient.&#xD;
      The final MCID value is the average of 4 values, 1 generated from the anchored and 3&#xD;
      generated from the distribution based methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is another measure for patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
      It represents the threshold beyond which patients consider themselves well (satisfied) after&#xD;
      an intervention. The PASS is an absolute value, not a change but this value will vary among&#xD;
      patients. In essence, PASS indicates a state of wellbeing (feeling good) as opposed to MCID,&#xD;
      a state of improvement (feeling better). The 2 concepts are complementary but contrary to&#xD;
      MCID, the PASS is the outcome of interest, instead of the extent of improvement. To determine&#xD;
      PASS, the patients are asked this question &quot;In your opinion, do you consider your current&#xD;
      pain state satisfactory after your operation?&quot; Patients responding &quot;yes&quot; are considered&#xD;
      having an acceptable pain state. The PASS is the 75th centile of the pain scale in those who&#xD;
      rated their pain state as satisfactory. Higher baseline pain scores are often associated with&#xD;
      higher PASS estimates. Little is known about PASS for acute pain after surgery thus a need to&#xD;
      determine this benchmark to properly evaluate the clinical benefits of analgesic&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Recovery (QoR) is another important PRO measure when evaluating the impact of&#xD;
      novel intervention strategies. Quality of recovery can be assessed using the QoR-15&#xD;
      questionnaire (scores 0-150) which measures physical &amp; mental well-being as an indication of&#xD;
      the quality of recovery after surgery and anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine MCID for QoR, both the anchor and distribution based methods will be used. The&#xD;
      patient will be asked &quot;How would you rate your overall recovery from surgery since&#xD;
      yesterday?&quot; Patients will use the same GRS (-7 to +7) to measure their response. With the&#xD;
      anchored-based method, the MCID is the mean change in the QoR-15 score when the patient&#xD;
      reports a GRS score of +2 or +3. The distribution-based method will generate 3 other MCID&#xD;
      values: 1) 0.3 standard deviation (SD) of the mean change in the QoR score; 2) the standard&#xD;
      error of measurement (SEM); and 3) 5% of the instrument range. Again, the final MCID value is&#xD;
      the average of 4 values, 1 generated from the anchored and 3 generated from the distribution&#xD;
      based methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine PASS for QoR, the patients will be asked, &quot;In your opinion, have you made a good&#xD;
      recovery from your operation?&quot; with response options of yes, no, or unsure. Those who give a&#xD;
      positive response is considered having made a good recovery. The PASS for QoR is the 75th&#xD;
      centile of the QoR-15 score in those who rated their recovery as good. The only MCID and PASS&#xD;
      study by Myles reported a QoR-15 score of 8 &amp; 118 (out of 150), respectively, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing a broad range of surgical procedures. Procedure-specific MCID &amp; PASS for QoR-15&#xD;
      after major orthopaedic surgery are currently unknown. Our proposed observational study seeks&#xD;
      to define what constitutes an MCID and a PASS in patients undergoing a variety of elective&#xD;
      major orthopedic surgery.&#xD;

    <description>postoperative pain will be managed on the ward using a multimodal analgesic regimen as appropriate. This includes:&#xD;
