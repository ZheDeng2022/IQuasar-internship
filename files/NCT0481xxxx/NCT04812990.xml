      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of chronic liver disease and has a long-term&#xD;
      resultant complications4 and it considered as a major endemic medical health problem in&#xD;
      Egypt. It affects multiple organs and reflect various manifestations on oral cavity.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of oral mucosa conditions, type of oral&#xD;
      manifestation and gingival lesions in patients with hepatitis C&#xD;

      Study design: It is a cross sectional observational study. Sample size estimation: 100&#xD;
      patients (50 in each groups) A total of 100 adult participants of both genders above 18 years&#xD;
      will be included in the study, patients was able and willing to participate in the study. 50&#xD;
      patients will be recruited for study group from consecutive patients previously diagnosed by&#xD;
      hepatitis C regardless of the etiology of the condition and regularly attending at Soad Kafay&#xD;
      hospital. Participants with history of smoking and alcoholism that could affect their oral&#xD;
      health status were excluded. The control group populations will be randomly recruited from&#xD;
      the out-patient of dental diagnosis clinic in Misr University For science &amp; technology&#xD;
      university to include total 50 clinically healthy participants, with no history of liver&#xD;
      disease, or any other chronic debilitating illness, or habit of smoking or drinking, , as&#xD;
      well as history of an intervention or condition that could affect the oral mucosa (e.g.,&#xD;
      history of radiotherapy and/or not receiving any medication that could affect oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the oral cavity was recorded on the entire mucosal surface recording signs,&#xD;
      symptoms, and oral lesion absence or presence. All the information will be recorded and the&#xD;
      data will be analyzed after the end of the study . The prevalence of various oral&#xD;
      manifestations in hepatitis C patients will be documented.&#xD;
