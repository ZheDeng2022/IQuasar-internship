    <textblock>
      In this cohort, prospective clinical cohort study was used to establish a follow-up cohort of&#xD;
      preterm infants with different gestational ages. The regular monitoring indexes of physical&#xD;
      development and neuropsychological development of preterm infants from birth to 3 years after&#xD;
      birth were collected. The influencing factors of preterm infants' development at different&#xD;
      stages were recorded, and the high-risk factors leading to different stages of preterm&#xD;
      infants' growth retardation were analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at high risk of stunting due to premature birth, insufficient&#xD;
      intrauterine nutrient reserves, burden of various diseases after birth, and persistent&#xD;
      nutrient liabilities. The growth retardation of premature infants at different developmental&#xD;
      stages has an important impact on both short-term survival and long-term health. The growth&#xD;
      and development data of premature infants during hospitalization and after discharge are very&#xD;
      limited in foreign countries. Domestic researches on growth retardation of preterm infants&#xD;
      only involve retrospective cross-sectional studies during hospitalization, and lack of&#xD;
      prospective follow-up study data on growth and development data of premature infants during&#xD;
      hospitalization and after discharge.&#xD;

      In this cohort, prospective clinical cohort study was used to establish a follow-up cohort of&#xD;
      preterm infants with different gestational ages. The regular monitoring indexes of physical&#xD;
      development and neuropsychological development of preterm infants from birth to 3 years after&#xD;
      birth were collected. The influencing factors of preterm infants' development at different&#xD;
      stages were recorded, and the high-risk factors leading to different stages of preterm&#xD;
      infants' growth retardation were analyzed. In order to provide a strong scientific basis for&#xD;
      the development evaluation and intervention of premature infants in China, a systematic and&#xD;
      scientific clinical cohort study method was explored to improve the overall medical quality&#xD;
      and medical level of the Department and further promote the development of the discipline.&#xD;
