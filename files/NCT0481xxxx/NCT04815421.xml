    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study . The objective is to observe the therapeutic effects&#xD;
      of dredging three yang meridians of hand with deep tissue massage on stiff-neck syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: patients with stiff-neck syndrome were randomly divided into meridian group and&#xD;
      paste group.The meridian group were treated once a day for 3 days and the paste group therapy&#xD;
      was a 3 courses therapy（ one course includes 24-hour rest and 24-hour paste）. After 3&#xD;
      courses, pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), the therapeutic effects were&#xD;
      compared between the two groups in every stage of the therapy and the self-controlled&#xD;
      study.The evaluation criteria on stiff-neck syndrome is based on criteria of diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of orthopaedic and traumatologic diseases and syndromes in traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine . Cure: Absence of neck-stiff, neck sore and free functional activities.&#xD;
      Improvement: partially functional activities with light to moderate pain. Failure: No&#xD;
      improvement or alleviation of neck stiff and agony. All data will be analyzed by SPSS 16.0,&#xD;
      the statistical difference is considered if the P&lt;0.05 and the significant difference is&#xD;
      considered if the P&lt;0.01 .&#xD;

      1 Clinical Materials 1.1 Diagnostic criteria Acute onset of severe pain and stiffness in&#xD;
      one-sided neck after sleep; Mostly because of bad sleep posture or cold in neck, shoulder or&#xD;
      head; Pain or discomfort can radiate to head, arm and back; Any attempt to move neck can&#xD;
      obviously exacerbate the pain; The head slants to the affected side; Without neck injury&#xD;
      history or other relative systematic diseases.; Neck X-ray film has no positive signs such as&#xD;
      degenerative lesions of cervical spine; Trachelismus and rhomboideus major/ minor, levator&#xD;
      scapulae accessible lumps or streak in muscle. All criteria conformed to the prescription in&#xD;
      criteria of diagnostic and therapeutic effect of orthopaedic and traumatologic diseases and&#xD;
      syndromes in traditional Chinese medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Inclusion criteria The onset of symptoms and signs are less than 24 hours; Male or female&#xD;
      aged from 14 to 60 years; No other therapy before grouped; Be willing to participate the&#xD;
      study and sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Exclusion criteria Stiff neck patients who had diagnosed cervical vertebra or cervical&#xD;
      spondylosis; Suffered from systemic collagen immune diseases or other acute or chronic&#xD;
      infection; Use pain-killer drugs may affect the outcome evaluation; Refuse to join the trial;&#xD;
      Drop out in follow-up visit; Aggravation of disease or complications during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Patients All patients were outpatients and be diagnosed with stiff-neck syndrome&#xD;
      according to the diagnostic criteria. They were randomly allocated into 2 groups (meridian&#xD;
      group and paste group) according to the visiting time (with digital random table)and their&#xD;
      wills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 meridian group Patients in the meridian group were treated with dredging the same side&#xD;
      three yang meridians of hand techniques(include the gliding techniques of deep tissue massage&#xD;
      on the three yang meridians of back hand (the second, fourth and fifth metacarpal bone);&#xD;
      pinching and kneading the second, fourth and fifth phalanges of fingers of the affected side&#xD;
      hand; Encourage the patient to try his best to roll his neck to the most tolerable degree&#xD;
      during dredging the meridians) and the total time was about 3 to 5 minutes according the&#xD;
      tolerance of every patient and the smooth of three yang meridians of hand. The massage will&#xD;
      not stop until the meridian route was relatively smooth, soft and thermal. The sequence of&#xD;
      massage is Hand Yangming meridian(LI) the first, Hand Taiyang meridian(SI) the second and&#xD;
      Hand Sanjiao(SJ) the last. The frequency of massage was once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 paste group Patients in the paste group were treated with Nanxing paste on the affected&#xD;
      region include shoulder, neck or back and no more than 3 pieces. The paste lasted for 24&#xD;
      hours and then peeled it rested the pasted region for 24 hours and changed another paste on&#xD;
      the pain region. The therapy duration was 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), the therapeutic effects were compared&#xD;
      between the two groups in every stage of the therapy and the self-controlled study.The&#xD;
      evaluation criteria on stiff-neck syndrome is based on criteria of diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of orthopaedic and traumatologic diseases and syndromes in traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine . Cure: Absence of neck-stiff, neck sore and free functional activities.&#xD;
      Improvement: partially functional activities with light to moderate pain. Failure: No&#xD;
      improvement or alleviation of neck stiff and agony. All data will be analyzed by SPSS 16.0,&#xD;
      the statistical difference is considered if the P&lt;0.05 and the significant difference is&#xD;
      considered if the P&lt;0.01 .&#xD;
