  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profiles of albumin-bound docetaxel for intravenous infusion and Taxotere in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be performed as a randomized, open-label, two-period crossover trial to&#xD;
      compare the test drug (T, albumin-bound docetaxel) to the reference drug (R, Taxotere).&#xD;
      Approximately 28 subjects will be randomized to the two treatment sequences (T-R or R-T) at&#xD;
      the ratio of 1:1. Each enrolled subject will receive an intravenous infusion of the reference&#xD;
      drug and the test drug in two treatment periods per the randomization schedule. The treatment&#xD;
      periods will be separated by a washout period of 21 to 35 days. After completing two cycles&#xD;
      of treatments, subjects may continue to receive the treatment used in the second cycle&#xD;
      according to the responses (up to 1 year).&#xD;
