  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of an online mental health treatment. The goals of the study are to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of an online treatment for depression and anxiety symptoms with&#xD;
      little-to-no human support, in a sample of 50 adults with limited educational attainment. The&#xD;
      treatment is based on the Unified Protocol, an evidence-based treatment for mood and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms. The study will enroll participants on a rolling basis until reaching the goal of 50&#xD;
      participants. The intervention lasts 16 weeks, with 12 weeks of online treatment focused on&#xD;
      increasing mindfulness, decreasing avoidance, and increasing cognitive flexibility in order&#xD;
      to decrease depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants will complete surveys about their&#xD;
      symptoms and how they feel about the treatment to help us establish the feasibility of a&#xD;
      larger trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 12-week, randomized controlled trial (&quot;Hazel&quot;) comparing an intervention for&#xD;
      depression and anxiety symptoms with two different levels of support. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive: 1) a Unified Protocol intervention with 4 weeks of human&#xD;
      support during exposure exercises in weeks 8-11 (&quot;Partially Supported&quot;); or 2) a Unified&#xD;
      Protocol intervention without support at any point (the &quot;Unsupported&quot; arm). At 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention, participants will be sent a link to complete follow-up survey measures for&#xD;
      depression and anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Unified Protocol is an empirically supported, transdiagnostic treatment for emotion&#xD;
      disorders based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy.27 The Unified Protocol can be&#xD;
      delivered in 12 to 18 weeks, with one one-hour session per week. Treatment focuses on&#xD;
      increasing awareness of maladaptive thoughts and behaviors while decreasing avoidance of&#xD;
      emotions and physiological sensations. Each week, patients receive psychoeducation, complete&#xD;
      in-session practice exercises and self-monitor symptom change. At the end of each session,&#xD;
      patients are assigned a home practice assignment to increase adaptive coping and generalize&#xD;
      skill use outside of the therapy room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both arms will receive a 12-week Unified Protocol intervention delivered via&#xD;
      the same web platform (REDCap). The intervention will include all 8 modules of the Unified&#xD;
      Protocol. Every week, participants will be directed to complete the following content:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. depression symptom survey,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. anxiety symptom survey,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. information about their symptom change over time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. psychoeducational text&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. practice exercises,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. home practice instructions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. writing exercise, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. home practice worksheet(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptom surveys, symptom graph and writing exercise will remain the same each week. The&#xD;
      psychoeducational text, practice exercises and homework assignments will vary based on that&#xD;
      week's topic. For the writing exercise, participants will be prompted to write notes on their&#xD;
      take-aways, questions about the material, and ways they can incorporate the lesson into their&#xD;
      upcoming week. The investigators will aim to write as much text as possible at a 5th grade&#xD;
      reading level, based on evidence that 52% of US residents read English at a 5th-grade level&#xD;
      or below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the unsupported arm will receive the intervention exactly as&#xD;
      described above, with no additional components. Completion of all weeks will be entirely&#xD;
      self- guided, to emulate a publicly available, standalone intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the partially supported arm will receive all aspects of the&#xD;
      intervention described above, with no differences between arms for the first seven weeks of&#xD;
      the intervention (Modules 1-6). Participants in this arm will be introduced to their assigned&#xD;
      study therapist in week 8, at the start of Module 7 via email. During Module 7 (exposure;&#xD;
      weeks 8-11), participants in this arm will receive four video therapy sessions. These&#xD;
      sessions will entail synchronous, video-call contact with their assigned study therapist, and&#xD;
      session content will be based on principles of exposure therapy. The first session will&#xD;
      entail developing a personalized exposure hierarchy, which will inform subsequent in-session&#xD;
      and home practice assignments. In all sessions, study therapists will do live demonstrations&#xD;
      of exposure exercises, monitor participants during exposure practice and provide feedback as&#xD;
      clinically indicated, guide participants through post-exposure processing, and assign in-vivo&#xD;
      exposure practices for homework. In the second through fourth sessions, study therapists will&#xD;
      also review and provide feedback on participants' home practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study therapists will be clinical psychology graduate students at Duke University and will be&#xD;
      trained and supervised by Dr. Clair Robbins, a clinical associate at Duke and expert in the&#xD;
      Unified Protocol. Dr. Robbins is expected to pass licensure exams during the Spring 2021&#xD;
      semester. Until then, umbrella supervision will be provided by Dr. M. Zach Rosenthal, a North&#xD;
      Carolina-license psychologist and director of Duke's Cognitive Behavioral Research and&#xD;
      Treatment Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On recruitment and participant materials, the study will be referred to by the name &quot;Hazel.&quot;&#xD;
      Hazel was chosen as a name because it is a relatively uncommon word that is both a name and a&#xD;
      noun. The investigators' hope is that using a study title that can be a name will evoke a&#xD;
      sense of warmth and personalization in the online intervention. At the same time, &quot;Hazel&quot; is&#xD;
      not exclusively used a name, which the investigators hope will prevent undue confusion or&#xD;
      misleading respondents into thinking Hazel is a human therapist. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      hope that its relatively uncommon usage will help prevent confusion with any other similar&#xD;
      studies or programs. The name Hazel is incorporated into study materials in terms of color&#xD;
      scheme and logo. At the end of the intervention, the hazelnut logo used throughout Hazel will&#xD;
      be transformed into a hazelnut tree sprout, symbolizing both the ways participants have grown&#xD;
      over the course of the intervention and the possibility for ongoing growth as they continue&#xD;
      applying their new skills after the intervention period ends.&#xD;
