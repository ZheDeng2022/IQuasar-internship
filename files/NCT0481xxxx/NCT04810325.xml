    <textblock>
      High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment strategy for a variety&#xD;
      of movement disorders including Parkinson's disease, dystonia and tremor1-5, as well as for&#xD;
      other neurological and psychiatric disorders e.g. obsessive compulsive disorder, depression,&#xD;
      cluster headache, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy and eating disorders6-11. It is currently&#xD;
      applied in a continuous fashion, using parameters set by the treating clinician. This&#xD;
      approach is non-physiological, as it applies a constant, unchanging therapy to a&#xD;
      dysfunctional neuronal system that would normally fluctuate markedly on a moment-by moment&#xD;
      basis, depending on external stressors, cognitive load, physical activity and the timing of&#xD;
      medication administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluctuations in physical symptoms reflect fluctuations in brain activity. Tracking and&#xD;
      responding in real-time to these would allow personalised approaches to DBS through&#xD;
      stimulating at appropriate intensities and only when necessary, thereby improving therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy, preserving battery life and potentially limiting side-effects12. Critical to the&#xD;
      development of such adaptive/closed-loop DBS technologies is the identification of robust&#xD;
      signals on which to base the delivery of variable high-frequency deep brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local field potentials (LFPs), which are recordable through standard DBS electrodes,&#xD;
      represent synchronous neuronal discharges within the basal ganglia. Different LFP signatures&#xD;
      have been identified in different disorders, as well as in different clinical states within&#xD;
      individual disorders. For example, low frequency LFPs in the Alpha/Theta ranges (4-12Hz) are&#xD;
      frequently encountered in patients with Dystonia13,14, while both beta (12-30Hz) gamma&#xD;
      (60-90Hz) band frequencies may be seen in Parkinson's disease, when the patient is OFF and&#xD;
      dyskinetic, respectively15,16. Equally, suppression of these abnormal basal ganglia signals&#xD;
      through medication administration or high-frequency DBS correlates with clinical improvement.&#xD;
      As such, they represent attractive electrophysiologic biomarkers on which to base adaptive&#xD;
      DBS approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, neurophysiological assessments were purely a research tool, as they could&#xD;
      only be recorded either intra-operatively or for a short period of time post-operatively&#xD;
      using externalised DBS electrodes. However, advances in DBS technology now allow real-time&#xD;
      LFP recordings to be simply and seamlessly obtained from fully implanted DBS systems e.g.&#xD;
      Medtronic Percept PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will evaluate a cohort of patients with movement disorders and other&#xD;
      disorders of basal ganglia circuitry who have implanted DBS systems. Recordings of LFPs&#xD;
      and/or non-invasive data such as EEG, limb muscle activation and movement (surface EMG and&#xD;
      motion tracking) under various conditions (e.g. voluntary movement, ON/OFF medications,&#xD;
      ON/OFF stimulation) will allow us to evaluate their utility as markers of underlying disease&#xD;
      phenotype and severity and to assess their potential for use as electrophysiological&#xD;
      biomarkers in adaptive DBS approaches. These evaluations in patients with DBS systems with&#xD;
      and without LFP-sensing capabilities will take place during a single or multi-day evaluation&#xD;
      (depending on patient preference and researcher availability). This study will advance not&#xD;
      only the understanding of subcortical physiology in various disorders, but will also provide&#xD;
      information about how neurophysiological and behavioural biomarkers can be used to inform&#xD;
      personalised, precision closed-loop DBS approaches.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Both hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders are associated with abnormal&#xD;
      spatiotemporal activity within the basal ganglia circuitry13,16,17. This can be assessed&#xD;
      through measuring local field potentials (LFPs), which represent the product of synchronous&#xD;
      neuronal activity at a given site (unsynchronized, random activity being essentially&#xD;
      cancelled out)13. Numerous other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, major&#xD;
      depression, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, eating disorders and cluster headaches are also&#xD;
      amenable to successful modulation using DBS6-11. These disorders likely also have unique,&#xD;
      disease-specific electrophysiological signatures, the exact nature of which remains to be&#xD;
      thoroughly defined. Abnormal electrophysiological activity is useful not only in delineating&#xD;
      the pathophysiologic underpinnings of these disorders, but is central to the future&#xD;
      development of adaptive DBS systems which respond in real-time to ameliorate pathological&#xD;
      brain acticity12. Adaptive DBS may provide further clinical benefit beyond currently employed&#xD;
      continuous DBS approaches, with only a fraction of the energy requirements12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using microelectrode recordings at the time of DBS lead placement as well as&#xD;
      recordings from externalised DBS electrodes have identified distinct neurophysiological&#xD;
      signatures within different disorders. Examples include excess beta-frequency oscillations in&#xD;
      Parkinsonism, alpha and theta frequency oscillations in dystonia and gamma oscillations in&#xD;
      dyskinesia. These neurophysiologic biomarkers of disease can be affected by the application&#xD;
      of high-frequency DBS. Future closed-loop DBS systems may rely on real-time suppression of&#xD;
      such abnormal basal ganglia activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFPs in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant body of work has confirmed that beta-frequency oscillations, recorded from both&#xD;
      the subthalamic nucleus and the internal portion of the globus pallidus, correlate with&#xD;
      severity of bradykinesia and rigidity in Parkinson's disease13,16-18. These beta-frequency&#xD;
      oscillations are coherent across simultaneous recordings in different nuclei of the same&#xD;
      patient, implying that these represent a network-level dysfunction in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease16,19. The amplitude/power of abnormal beta-frequency LFPs correlates with the&#xD;
      severity of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease15,18. Moreover, beta-frequency LFPs can&#xD;
      be suppressed both by levodopa administration, or by the application of high-frequency&#xD;
      DBS20,21; in both scenarios the degree of suppression in beta-oscillations correlates with&#xD;
      the degree of clinical motor improvement. Beta oscillations may therefore represent an&#xD;
      electrophysiological parkinsonian symptom correlate which can act as a biomarker of the motor&#xD;
      state. Hence, they may be useful signals on which to base stimulation using adaptive DBS&#xD;
      technologies. However, some observations, such as the suppression of beta frequency&#xD;
      oscillations during periods of tremor, have cast doubt on the robustness of this potential&#xD;
      biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other LFP frequency alterations have also been observed to correlate with clinical&#xD;
      symptomatology in PD. For instance, synchronisation at frequencies in the gamma range&#xD;
      (60-90Hz) have been correlated with dyskinesia, as have synchronisation at lower frequencies&#xD;
      (4-8Hz)22,23. High-frequency oscillations in the 250Hz range have also been found to&#xD;
      associate with parkinsonian clinical states and to shift to even higher frequencies (350Hz)&#xD;
      following levodopa administration24. In contrast to beta-frequencies, changes in&#xD;
      high-frequency LFPs do appear to correlate with tremor25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from pure frequency characteristics, the temporal distribution of beta-frequency&#xD;
      oscillations has also been examined in different disease states. It is suggested that&#xD;
      prolonged periods of beta synchronisation (beta bursts) may be responsible for the overall&#xD;
      increase in beta power in patients with Parkinson's disease in the OFF state, and that a move&#xD;
      to shorter durations of synchronisation may occur in the ON state26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFPs in dystonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with dystonia display a distinct pattern of LFP alterations in the pallidum13,14,&#xD;
      particularly an excess of synchronized oscillatory activity in the low frequency 3-12 Hz&#xD;
      band13. Not only is pallidal LFP power prominent in the 3-12Hz band in patients with&#xD;
      dystonia13,27 but it correlates with28 and may be coherent with (especially contralateral)&#xD;
      dystonic muscular activity29. Moreover, there is a direct association between pallidal&#xD;
      low-frequency oscillations and dystonia severity30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased LFP power in the low-frequency band is seen across a variety of dystonia&#xD;
      phenotypes. In cervical dystonia, inter-hemispheric differences in LFPs have been&#xD;
      demonstrated, though clear correlations with directional head movements have not been&#xD;
      established31,32. In myoclonus-dystonia patients, increased pallidal LFP in the 3-15Hz range&#xD;
      correlate with dystonic muscle activity33. Oscillatory activity may be different in secondary&#xD;
      or combined dystonia, and may also differ according to genetic makeup 34-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFPs in essential tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFP recordings from patients undergoing thalamic DBS in ET have identified distinct thalamic&#xD;
      LFP frequency characteristics, often coherent with surface EMG recordings in these groups, at&#xD;
      frequencies which are either harmonics or subharmonics of the tremor frequency37.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFPs in other conditions Electrophysiologic recordings from patients with Tourette's syndrome&#xD;
      have shown an excess of low-frequency activity(2-13Hz) in both thalamic and pallidal&#xD;
      targets38 and that spontaneous tics in Tourette's syndrome are preceded by coherent&#xD;
      thalamo-cortical discharges39. Unique, disease specific LFP patterns have also been&#xD;
      identified in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, prominent alpha activity&#xD;
      in the basal ganglia has been suggested as an electrophysiologic correlate of major&#xD;
      depressive disorders40&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous recording from fully implanted DBS systems has only recently become possible, for&#xD;
      example using the Medtronic Percept PC battery system. The quality of signals recorded using&#xD;
      this system as well as the correlation with clinical features, and coherence with cortical&#xD;
      and motor activity however remain largely unexplored. Moreover, the number of patients on&#xD;
      which previous LFP studies has been based is small. Hence, their utility in the future&#xD;
      development of closed-loop DBS systems remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will address a number of unanswered questions relating to the utility of LFP&#xD;
      recordings in neurological disorders including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is it possible to replicate the previous findings concerning LFP signatures in various&#xD;
           movement disorders using currently available DBS systems with LFP sensing capabilities&#xD;
           e.g. Medtronic Percept PC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do LFP signatures persist many years after initiation of deep brain stimulation (most&#xD;
           previous studies have evaluated patients only at the time of DBS implantation)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How are LFP signatures related to modulations of wider brain networks as assessed by&#xD;
           EEG?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can non-invasive recording methods such as EEG provide alternative or complementary&#xD;
           biomarkers for closed-loop DBS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the influence of medications, body movements, sensory inputs and differential&#xD;
           stimulation parameters on LFPs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How robust are LFP signatures within and between individuals with similar disease&#xD;
           states?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Do robust LFP signatures exist for non movement disorder basal ganglia network&#xD;
           pathologies, and how do these correlate with symptoms severity?&#xD;
