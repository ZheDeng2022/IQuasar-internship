  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pelvic floor serves as stability and support as it is the postural balance and core&#xD;
      resource base for the pelvic organs. A dysfunction in the organs in this area can affect the&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscles, the functioning of an organs in the muscles. Incontinence organ&#xD;
      prolapse, pelvic pain and sexual problems may occur when the support or stability of the&#xD;
      pelvic floor is impaired. Pelvic floor novelization is not always seen weakness. Sometimes&#xD;
      excessive contractions and excessive activity in muscle tone can be seen. Stress and&#xD;
      anxiety-related tension are the main causes of pelvic floor dysfunctions. Involuntary&#xD;
      contractions and excessive muscle tone in the pelvic floor muscles cause chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      syndrome, constipation and dyssynergic defecation problems. Some of these patients have&#xD;
      complaints of tightening teeth in the temporamandibular joint, grinding teeth at night,&#xD;
      together with contractions in the pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of pelvic floor improvement on tinnitus&#xD;
      level as a result of dysfunctional condition in temporamandibular joint with treatment&#xD;
      practices of pelvic floor patients with excessive muscle activity.&#xD;

      The pelvic floor serves as stability and support as it is the postural balance and core&#xD;
      resource base for the pelvic organs. A dysfunction in the organs in this area can affect the&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscles, the functioning of an organs in the muscles. Incontinence organ&#xD;
      prolapse, pelvic pain and sexual problems may occur when the support or stability of the&#xD;
      pelvic floor is impaired. Pelvic floor novelization is not always seen weakness. Sometimes&#xD;
      excessive contractions and excessive activity in muscle tone can be seen. Stress and&#xD;
      anxiety-related tension are the main causes of pelvic floor dysfunctions. Involuntary&#xD;
      contractions and excessive muscle tone in the pelvic floor muscles cause chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      syndrome, constipation and dyssynergic defecation problems. Some of these patients have&#xD;
      complaints of tightening teeth in the temporamandibular joint, grinding teeth at night,&#xD;
      together with contractions in the pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of patients in the temporamandibular joint is very difficult for the clinician. The&#xD;
      difficulty of identifying etiological factors and the fact that dysfunction is associated&#xD;
      with multifactorial factors make it mandatory to use different assessment methods in&#xD;
      diagnosing patients with Temporamandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). One of the indexes used&#xD;
      to diagnose TMD patients in a healthy population is the&quot; Fonseca Anamnestic Index (FAI)&quot;. The&#xD;
      low cost and easy applicability of the index make it preferred for TMD patients at the stage&#xD;
      of diagnosis (Ayalı ve Ramoğlu, 2014; Türken vd., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pathogenesis of TMD, parafunctional habits such as day and night tooth tightening,&#xD;
      tooth grinding, nail eating, lip biting, cheek biting, pen biting, chewing gum play an&#xD;
      important role. It has been reported that there is often a positive correlation between TMD&#xD;
      and parafunctional habits. &quot;Oral Behavior Checklist (OBC)&quot; is used in the diagnosis of such&#xD;
      oral habits (Güngör, 2019; Türken vd., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that this dysfunctional condition in the temporamandibular joint may cause&#xD;
      tinnitus in patients. The fact that tinnitus is subjective and an unsolved symptom related to&#xD;
      the mechanisms of its occurrence makes it difficult to obtain objective assessment and&#xD;
      concrete data. For this reason, the evaluation of tinnitus is again possible by perceptual&#xD;
      measurement. For this purpose, psychoacoustic tests such as tinnitus intensity and frequency&#xD;
      matching, maskability, residual inhibition, and verbal, numerical, and visual rating scales&#xD;
      are used to evaluate tinnitus (Meikle vd., 2008). The Tinnitus Disability Questionnaire is&#xD;
      the only scale with validity and reliability in Turkish and is widely used in our country to&#xD;
      determine the level of tinnitus (Aksoy vd., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of scale is an important tool in determining the level of tinnitus, it is&#xD;
      difficult for each person to express their condition as it is. It is known that some patients&#xD;
      may exaggerate or underestimate their complaints, each scale has strengths and weaknesses,&#xD;
      and sensitivity may vary depending on the therapy used. Since most of the scales are&#xD;
      developed in English, it should be considered that when applied to different cultures and&#xD;
      socio-economic groups, there may be changes in specificity and sensitivity (Langguth vd.,&#xD;
      2006). For this reason, the addition of a structured interview form as a standard in addition&#xD;
      to the scale strengthens the opinion of the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, it is expected that temporamandibular joint loosens after treatment applications&#xD;
      in patients with pelvic floor dysfunction. As a result of this relaxation, we believe that&#xD;
      there may be a decrease in the level of tinnitus felt in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of pelvic floor improvement on tinnitus&#xD;
      level as a result of dysfunctional condition in temporamandibular joint with treatment&#xD;
      practices of pelvic floor patients with excessive muscle activity.&#xD;
