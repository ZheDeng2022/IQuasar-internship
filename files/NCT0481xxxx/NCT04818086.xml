      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, drug interactions&#xD;

      Disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of lemborexant when used in combination with&#xD;
      opioids (including buprenorphine). We are also interested in learning lemborexant might help&#xD;
      improve sleep problems and problems related to opioid use (e.g., cravings, withdrawal), in&#xD;
      people with opioid use disorder. Study participants will be randomly assigned in a two to one&#xD;
      ratio to receive either lemborexant or placebo. Lemborexant (DAYVIGO®) is approved by the U.&#xD;
      S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, Participants will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visit the CARI clinic and/or Motivate clinic at Jackson Center to complete study&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit the VCUHS Clinical Research Unit to complete an outpatient blood draw/testing&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Take either lemborexant or the placebo, depending upon which group subjects are assigned&#xD;
           to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Complete two (2) overnight study visits at the VCUHS Clinical Research Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Complete 8 outpatient follow-up visits (broken into 2 four day visit groupings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Have an EKG during screening and at each study visit (outpatient and inpatient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Have an IV inserted into your arm for blood draws at the outpatient blood draw visit and&#xD;
           each inpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Record sleep in a sleep diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Take surveys and answer questions about health, mental health, medications used, drug&#xD;
           use, and cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Complete tasks on the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Complete physical exams during screening, outpatient and inpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Give permission for the researchers to collect information about opioid treatment,&#xD;
           medical status, and other information from your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last approximately 4 weeks. Approximately 18 people will&#xD;
      participate in the drug interaction phase of this study.&#xD;
