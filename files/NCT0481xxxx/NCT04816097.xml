      Prophylactic antenatal administration of corticosteroid enhance fetal lung maturity and&#xD;
      reduce the probability of respiratory morbidity in preterm births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      assessment of administration of four doses intramuscular dexamethasone 48h before elective&#xD;
      cesarean section at term in reducing the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      and NICU admission as a result&#xD;

      Term neonates born between (37-39 wks) by elective cesarean section are likely to develop&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome more than neonates born by vaginal delivery, and this risk&#xD;
      increases for the subgroup of neonates born after elective caeserean section , i.e. before&#xD;
      onset of labour , , with potentially severe implications The risk is decreasing with advanced&#xD;
      gestational age and neonates born in 37 weeks are at 1.7 times more than those born at 38&#xD;
      weeks , which in turn are at 2.4 times more than those born at 39 weeks If the pregnant&#xD;
      female is given four intramuscular injections of 6 mg of dexamethasone , 48 hrs before&#xD;
      elective caesarean section decreases the neonatal respiratory morbidity. Five studies lasting&#xD;
      between 3 to 20 years with more than 1500 patients have shown no adverse effect of single&#xD;
      course of antenatal corticosteroid , neither through infection of the fetus or mother nor in&#xD;
      long term neurological or cognitive effect According to Cochrane Database of Systematic&#xD;
      Reviews 2018 , prophylactic administration of antenatal corticosteroids appeared to reduce&#xD;
      the rate of RDS by approximately 52%. It also reduced the need for NICU admission, both due&#xD;
      to respiratory morbidity (by approximately 58%) and for any indication. The reduction of NICU&#xD;
      admissions due to respiratory reasons is consistent with the reduction of respiratory&#xD;
      morbidity after corticosteroid administration&#xD;
