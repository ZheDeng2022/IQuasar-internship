    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MFI-20 is a self-report of 20-item scale designed to evaluate five dimensions of fatigue: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced motivation, reduced activity and mental fatigue. By limiting the length of questionnaire, developers hoped to accommodate those individuals who might find larger measures especially tiring in obtaining multiple facets of fatigue. The internal consistency of MFI-20 is ranging from .53 to .93.</description>

    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EPDS developed for screening postpartum women in outpatient, home-visiting settings or at 6-8-week postpartum examination. It consists of 10 questions for postnatal period which reliably identifies women at risk of developing depression. The sensitivity and specificity of EPDS is 70-85%.</description>
