  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a multicenter study, which consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: the Phase 1b part of the study will investigate the safety of the combination of&#xD;
      ATX-101 with carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (ACD). ATX-101 will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously in three escalation cohorts: 20, 30, and 45 mg/m² according to a 3+3 design. In&#xD;
      the case where 20 mg/m² is not tolerated, the dose can be de-escalated to 15 mg/m².&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: the Phase 2a part of the study will investigate the efficacy and safety of ACD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATX-101 will be administered at the dose defined in Part 1 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue up to six cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, participant withdrawal of consent, non-compliance, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal&#xD;
      at the Investigators discretion, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ATX-101 in combination with carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Measured by incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from the time of the first administered dose of ATX-101 up to the last treatment in Cycle 2 (i.e. Days 2 to 30).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT): the MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1/6 of treated participants experience a DLT during a DLT period of 30 days. The RP2D will be either the MTD or the highest tested dose level if MTD is not reached.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of ATX-101 in combination with carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Measured by Tumor assessments.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from Day 1 to Week 85</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by tumor imaging (CT-scan or MRI) in accordance to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) every 3 months over a treatment/observation period of 21 months for the individual patient. Tumor images will be compared and changes will be noted over the entire time. PFS means that the sum of diameters of target lesions will not increase by more than 20%, taking as reference the smallest sum measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: To assess the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] of ATX-101 in combination with carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from Day 1 to Week 85</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite outcome measure. Measured by Incidence, severity, and duration of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment-related TEAEs according to CTCAE v5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: To characterize the plasma PK profile of ATX-101 following IV infusion in combination with carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.</measure>
    <time_frame>From pre-dose [within 30 min prior to infusion] until 60 min post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by characterizing the PK profile by estimating the Area under the drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: To assess the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] of ATX-101 in combination with carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from Day 1 to Week 85</time_frame>
