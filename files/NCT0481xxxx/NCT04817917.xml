  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies against Japanese&#xD;
      encephalitis (JE) virus in children aged 6 years who were previously administered with 5&#xD;
      different immunization strategies by JE attenuated live vaccine (JEV-L) or/and inactivated&#xD;
      vaccine (JEV-I). The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the booster&#xD;
      dose of JEV-I at 6 years old for those previously immunized with 3 doses of JEV-I or those&#xD;
      sequential administered with 1 dose of JEV-L and another dose of JEV-I.&#xD;

      Based on the retrospective registry in Zhejiang Provincial Immunization Information System,&#xD;
      healthy children aged 6 years from 5 cohorts were included according to their previous&#xD;
      immunization schedules on JE: 3 doses of JEV-I (Group 1), JEV-L+ JEV-I (Group 2), JEV-L+&#xD;
      JEV-I + JEV-I (Group 3), JEV-I + JEV-I+ JEV-L (Group 4), and 2 doses of JEV-L (Group 5).&#xD;
      According to immunization programs in China, a booster dose of JEV-I is needed at the age of&#xD;
      6 for Group 1 and Group 2. A pre-vaccination blood sample (2.5ml) will be collected to&#xD;
      evaluate the proportions of seropositivity before the booster dose of JEV-I. A second blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected 28-35 days after the booster dose. Immunogenicity of the booster&#xD;
      dose will be assessed by seroconversion rates, proportions of seropositivity and GMTs for&#xD;
      these two groups. In addition, safety will be assessed with the occurrence of adverse events&#xD;
      reported in these two groups. For the rest three groups who have completed the immunization&#xD;
      schedules on JE, only one blood sample will be taken at the age of 6 to evaluate the&#xD;
      proportions of seropositivity and GMTs after 4 years post the complete immunization&#xD;
      schedules. Plague reduction neutralization test (PRNT) against both vaccine strains&#xD;
      (SA-14-14-2 strain for JEV-L and Beijing P3 strain for JEV-I) will be used to test&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody titers, so as to avoid potential bias in favor of either vaccine.&#xD;
      PRNT50 titers (the reciprocal of the serum dilution that reduced the virus plaque count by&#xD;
      50% compared with the virus-only controls) ≥ 1:10 are deemed as positive.&#xD;
