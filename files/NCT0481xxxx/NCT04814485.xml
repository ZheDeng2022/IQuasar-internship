  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of SHR-1020 combined with&#xD;
      albumin-bound paclitaxel in the second-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical research. Advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer is an aggressive disease with extremely low 5-year survival rate. For advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer patients who failed with first-line treatment, subsequent treatment options&#xD;
      are limited. SHR-1020 combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel could through multiple&#xD;
      mechanisms such as block tumor mitosis, inhibit tumor angiogenesis, inhibit interstitial&#xD;
      fibrosis to achieve anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of this study will be assessed through ORR, DCR,PFS, OS , and adverse&#xD;
      effects as graded by CTCAE 5.0.&#xD;
