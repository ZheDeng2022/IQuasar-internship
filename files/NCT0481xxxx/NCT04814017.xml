  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with chronic cervical myofascial pain (4 males, 26 females) aged between 25 to 57&#xD;
      years (with average age 41,20±10,23 years) were included the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were divided into two groups as intervention group (n=15) and control group&#xD;
      (n=15). Patients in intervention group received radial shock-wave application one times a&#xD;
      week for six weeks and home based stretching exercises. Patients in control group (CG)&#xD;
      received home based stretching exercises. Rest and activity pain (Visual Analog Scale),&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold (PPT), cervical range of motion (CROM) and disability (Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index) were assessed at baseline and after the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-four cervical MPS patients aged between 25-57 years (average age: 41,20±10,23 years)&#xD;
      who diagnosed cervical MPS (myofascial pain syndrome), had cervical MPS for 6 months and who&#xD;
      had at least one trigger point on their cervical, back and shoulder muscles were included to&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-four participant were included to the study. Taking into consideration including and&#xD;
      excluding factors 34 participants divided into two groups: intervention shock-wave therapy&#xD;
      group, control group. Because of several private reason (not attending treatment regularly&#xD;
      and not participating in the final evaluations), 4 participant were excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments done by the same physiotherapist (FU) before the first session and one week&#xD;
      after the last treatment session. Demographic data of participants recorded by using a form&#xD;
      at the baseline of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group (n=15) received 6 sessions radial shock wave treatment&#xD;
      once a week during 6 weeks. During the treatment, the patients sat on chairs and supported&#xD;
      their upper bodies with a pillow on the bed. Ultrasound gel was applied to the application&#xD;
      area. Radial shock-wave therapy was applied to each trigger point in the preliminary&#xD;
      evaluation. The muscles related trigger points were stretched position during the&#xD;
      application. Radial shock-wave therapy was applied in 1.0-4.0 bar intensity, 10-15 hz&#xD;
      frequency interval. 300-700 pulse for a trigger point, 1500-3000 pulse for a muscle.&#xD;
      Intensity, frequency and pulse increased every session regularly beginning from minimal&#xD;
      taking patients tolerance into consideration. Trigger points in the upper, middle and lower&#xD;
      trapezius, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and levator scapulae muscles were treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck and upper back muscle static stretching exercises were teached to patients in the both&#xD;
      groups as home exercise program. The patients were asked to do each stretching exercise given&#xD;
      as a home-based program every day, 3 times a day and 3 repetitions. The exercise program&#xD;
      consisted of static neck lateral flexors stretching, shoulder posterior capsule stretching&#xD;
      and apley stretching exercises. Exercise booklets were prepared and given to the patients.&#xD;
