  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was a pilot randomized trial conducted to compare the effects of Kendall&#xD;
      exercise and Gong's mobilization on pain, range of motion, function and strength in text neck&#xD;
      syndrome so that we can have best treatment option for patients with neck pain&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non Probability Convenient sampling was done. Patients following eligibility criteria from&#xD;
      Fatima hospital Sargodha were considered. Sample size was calculated 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly allocated in two groups equally via convenient sampling method.&#xD;
      Baseline assessment was done initially. Group A was given Kendall exercise and Group B was&#xD;
      given Gong's mobilization along with conventional physiotherapy treatment (hot pack).&#xD;
      Duration of research was almost 6 months. Participants were treated 3 times a week for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Pre and Post treatment readings were taken in 1st session and 4th week period&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment was done via Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS),Neck Disability index (NDI),&#xD;
      Universal goniometer and Modified sphygmomanometer test. All participants were provided&#xD;
      written informed consent prior to commencement of the procedures. They were free to quit the&#xD;
      treatment at any stage of research. Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 23.&#xD;
