  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one million transrectal prostate biopsies are performed annually in the U.S.,&#xD;
      and the risk of post- biopsy infection is increasing due to greater antibiotic resistance of&#xD;
      rectal flora. Preliminary data demonstrates that a transperineal MRI-targeted biopsy approach&#xD;
      under local anesthesia compared to the standard practice transrectal MRI-targeted prostate&#xD;
      biopsy has a much lower risk of infection, comparable pain/discomfort and may improve&#xD;
      detection of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will be the first prospective study to evaluate in-office&#xD;
      transperineal MRI targeted prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a transperineal MRI-targeted biopsy approach under local&#xD;
      anesthesia compared to the standard practice transrectal MRI-targeted prostate biopsy has a&#xD;
      much lower risk of infection, comparable pain/discomfort and may improve detection of&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in U.S. men. There are&#xD;
      approximately 1 million prostate biopsy performed annually in the U.S. Almost all biopsies&#xD;
      are performed as an office based procedure in under 15 minutes. The precision of biopsy has&#xD;
      improved over the last decade with the introduction of MRI guidance/targeting of suspicious&#xD;
      lesions within the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, significant limitations remain with this approach, including a significantly&#xD;
      increasing risk of post-biopsy infection. This arises because more than 97% of all prostate&#xD;
      biopsy are performed via a transrectal approach that introduces rectal bacteria with each&#xD;
      pass of the biopsy needle into the sterile urinary tract. The current risk of&#xD;
      post-transrectal biopsy infection, even with antimicrobial prophylaxis, is high at&#xD;
      approximately 7% overall with 3% (30,000 men) requiring hospitalization annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transperineal biopsy is an alternate approach that eliminates the direct introduction of&#xD;
      bacteria from the rectum to the prostate. This approach, which is perfomed without&#xD;
      antimicrobial prophylaxis, instead passes the biopsy needle through the perineal skin and&#xD;
      pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transperineal biopsy has not been widely adopted for several reasons. Historically, it has&#xD;
      been considered too painful for patients in the clinic and thus was traditionally performed&#xD;
      under general anesthesia. The added time, inconvenience and cost has limited its national&#xD;
      adoptance. Second, when transrectal biopsy was initially adopted over 40 years ago,&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance of rectal flora was not a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the potential for in-office transperineal biopsy to significantly reduce or eliminate&#xD;
      biopsy infections, transperineal biopsy may also improve cancer detection: studies of&#xD;
      transperineal biopsy (performed under general anesthesia) demonstrate higher detection rates&#xD;
      for prostate cancer, particularly for anterior zone tumors, compared to transrectal biopsy.&#xD;
      This is notable, as anterior tumors are difficult to sample with transrectal. Anterior tumors&#xD;
      are also twice as likely to occur in African American men. In fact, our research demonstrates&#xD;
      that some of the outcomes disparities in African American men may stem from an underdiagnosis&#xD;
      of anterior prostate cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although transrectal biopsy is used widely, it is associated with a significant and&#xD;
      increasing risk of biopsy infections due to growing antibiotic resistance, highlighting the&#xD;
      urgent need for a safer alternative approach to prostate biopsy. The study investigators have&#xD;
      refined a transperineal approach under local anesthesia with MRI-targeting/guidance without&#xD;
      the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. The investigators hypothesize that transperineal MRI&#xD;
      targeted biopsy will: (1) largely eliminate post-biopsy infections and costly&#xD;
      hospitalizations for urosepsis; (2) be performed in the office with similar discomfort and&#xD;
      non-infectious complications compared to transrectal MRI targeted biopsy; and (3) have&#xD;
      significantly better detection of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate in-office&#xD;
      transperineal MRI targeted vs. transrectal MRI targeted biopsy, the current gold standard.&#xD;
      This has transformative impact to change current standard of practice.&#xD;
