    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose phase I study to investigate the absorption,&#xD;
      metabolism and excretion of [14C] SH-1028 in healthy Chinese male subjects. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted into two steps：Firstly, 2 subjects are enrolled in to participate in the pilot&#xD;
      study to grope for the collection time of plasma, urine and feces sampling post-dose. Then,&#xD;
      the collection time of blood and excreta samples (urine and feces) from the subsequent 2-4&#xD;
      subjects will be adjusted according to the pilot study.&#xD;

      Subjects who had signed informed consent and meet inclusion criteria and no exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are admitted to Phase I Clinical Unit two days prior to dosing (D-2). On the morning&#xD;
      of Day 1 before dosing, subjects will be transferred to nuclear medical ward. And after an&#xD;
      overnight fast of at least 10 h, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 200 mg (88 μCi)&#xD;
      of [14C]SH-1028 as an oral suspension. Then, after two days of the dosing, subjects will be&#xD;
      transferred back to Phase I Clinical Unit ward and confined to this unit until blood or&#xD;
      excreta sampling and safety monitoring at the designated time points or intervals are&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
