  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to prospectively monitor the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;
      (DKA) during treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in type 1&#xD;
      diabetes after the treatment has become available as an adjunct therapy for people with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SGLT2 inhibitors have recently been approved for treatment of type 1 diabetes. SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors affect renal glucose transport and promotes glucose excretion in the urine. This&#xD;
      have attractive effects, notably by lowering of blood glucose without any increased risk of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia as well as a reduction in body weight. Since the risk of hypoglycemia and weight&#xD;
      gain during intensification of insulin treatment is a significant barrier for optimal&#xD;
      glycemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors could be an attractive adjunct therapy in type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
      Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects in persons&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. This may also benefit persons with type 1 diabetes. However, the major&#xD;
      limitation for an universal use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 1 diabetes is a substantial&#xD;
      increase in ketogenesis and the risk of DKA. DKA remain a substantial cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in persons with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no data exist on the risk of DKA during SGLT2 inhibition outside the randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, the investigators will initiate a nationwide monitoring study on the use&#xD;
      of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 1 diabetes. This will ensure follow-up on the efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and patient-reported outcome measures for SGLT2 inhibitors treatment of type 1 diabetes in&#xD;
      real-world clinical practice.&#xD;

        Individuals with type 1 diabetes initiated on SGLT2 inhibition will be prospectively&#xD;
        included after provision of informed consent. We have established a national network of&#xD;
        centers and investigators involved in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. We aim to offer&#xD;
        inclusion in the study to every individual where SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is planned&#xD;
