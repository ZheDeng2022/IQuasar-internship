  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the feasibility of two positive activities in improving quality&#xD;
      of life in collectivist culture cancer patients and their caregivers. Cancer patients of&#xD;
      collectivist cultures (e.g., Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans) have been found to&#xD;
      experience lower quality of life and more distress and depression when compared to those of&#xD;
      individualist cultures, such as European Americans. Following a cancer diagnosis,&#xD;
      collectivist patients may experience a change in their relationships with other family&#xD;
      members and their roles within the family. The cancer diagnosis may lead to changes in roles&#xD;
      and responsibilities, such as when a male breadwinner is no longer able to work due to&#xD;
      hospital treatments. The two positive activities are designed to increase a sense of&#xD;
      competence, autonomy, and connectedness, including contributing to household responsibilities&#xD;
      (an act of kindness) and writing a letter of gratitude. Performing certain simple activities&#xD;
      may improve quality of life in cancer patients and their caregivers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a study of two positive activities intended to&#xD;
      improve the psychological and interpersonal well-being of cancer patients from collectivist&#xD;
      cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily assess changes in psychological, interpersonal, and physical well-being&#xD;
      of the intervention patients and caregivers compared to control patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To preliminarily assess changes in psychological, interpersonal, and physical well-being&#xD;
      of patients and caregivers who are members of collectivist cultures (African American, Asian&#xD;
      American, or Latino/Hispanic) compared to patients and caregivers who are members of&#xD;
      individualist (European American) cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore mechanisms through which the interventions may improve psychological and&#xD;
      interpersonal well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITION I (CONTRIBUTION): Patients do 1 nice thing (can be as large or as small as they&#xD;
      wish) 2 times per week (BIW) for 4 weeks for their caregivers while at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITION II (GRATITUDE): Patients write a letter or note of gratitude BIW for 4 weeks to&#xD;
      their caregivers who have helped with their treatment or recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITION III (CONTROL): Participants keep track of their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up for 28 days.&#xD;
