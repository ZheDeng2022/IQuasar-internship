      The main purpose of this trial is to analyse the Effects of Xingnaojing for Mild-to-severe&#xD;
      Acute Ischemic Stroke by Metabonomics, proteomics and clinical parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Xingnaojing is widely used in China, but there is lack of sufficient and reasonable&#xD;
      explanation of its intervention effects for acute ischemic stroke currently. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis of this trial is that , Compared with the blank control group, Xingnaojing will&#xD;
      produce serial changes in plasma and urine metabolites and biomarkers at baseline (pre-dose),&#xD;
      8 days and 11days . The serial changes may be the potential support to explain the&#xD;
      intervention effect of Xingnaojing. All participants will have a National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS)entry score of 4-25. Participants who have planned or already&#xD;
      received the intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment will be excluded. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be determined at 11 days.&#xD;
