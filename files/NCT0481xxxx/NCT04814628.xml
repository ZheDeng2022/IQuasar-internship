  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine if the use of transnasal humidified&#xD;
      rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) can reduce by 90 seconds the time between&#xD;
      the entry into the operating room of the volunteer and the moment when the anaesthetic drugs&#xD;
      are ready and when the Oxygen Reserve Index has reached a plateau value for more than 10&#xD;
      seconds, a moment which would therefore allow the induction of general anaesthesia, compared&#xD;
      to the pre-oxygenation with the face mask applied by the anaesthetist alone in charge of&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>scenario 1 : pre-oxygenation with a face mask held by the anaesthetist</intervention_name>
    <description>the face mask is held by the anaesthetist (reference technique) to obtain effective pre-oxygenation for Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) which has reached a plateau value for more than 10 seconds. All the usual supplies and medicines are available and in the same place as usual.&#xD;
The sequence is as follows:&#xD;
Patient lying on the operating table, start of the stopwatch&#xD;
Opening of the computerized anaesthesia file&#xD;
Monitoring (ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, SaO2) of the patient&#xD;
Preparation of the hypnotic (propofol or thiopental, as desired)&#xD;
Preparation of curare (succinylcholine or rocuronium, as desired)&#xD;
Pre-oxygenation of the patient with the face mask held by the participating anaesthetist&#xD;
Waiting for an ORI which has reached a plateau value for more than 10 seconds&#xD;
Conditions for general anaesthesia met for the participating anaesthetist&#xD;
