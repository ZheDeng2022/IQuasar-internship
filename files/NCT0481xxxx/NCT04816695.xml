  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health issue due to its prevalence&#xD;
      of 8% in the general population (although it is underestimated), particularly due to the&#xD;
      number of severe patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure and the number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations estimated at 100,000 each year. Total health insurance expenditure in 2017&#xD;
      for chronic respiratory diseases (excluding cystic fibrosis and cancers) was approximately&#xD;
      €3.5 billion, including €1 billion for hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalizations are mainly related to a worsening of the disease (severe exacerbations&#xD;
      mainly of viral and/or bacterial origin). Although the majority of exacerbations are treated&#xD;
      on an outpatient basis with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids, those occurring in the&#xD;
      most severe and often the oldest patients may require hospitalization. It should be noted&#xD;
      that almost one out of two patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation is re-hospitalized&#xD;
      within six months; on the other hand, age and length of stay are the two main factors of&#xD;
      mortality in the year following hospitalization for COPD in the Intensive Care Unit. Early&#xD;
      detection of a worsening of the health status related to COPD could allow appropriate&#xD;
      management and avoid at least part of the hospitalizations for exacerbation with a consequent&#xD;
      reduction of the associated morbi-mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical study is to determine the evolution of the profile of volatile&#xD;
      organic compounds (VOCs) present in the exhaled air (volatolom) in patients with severe COPD&#xD;
      after hospitalization for exacerbation. This step should allow the identification of VOCs&#xD;
      (modification of the volatolom) which would be associated with a severe COPD exacerbation, by&#xD;
      comparing the volatolom at the acute phase of the exacerbation to the volatoloms during the&#xD;
      progressive return to a stable state after hospitalization and to those of patients with a&#xD;
      stabilized severe COPD (VOC-BPCO clinical study also sponsored by Foch Hospital)&#xD;

      Patients with severe COPD hospitalized for severe exacerbation (40 patients, ex-smokers or&#xD;
      smokers) will be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to participate in 4 sessions (V1 to V4) of 45 minutes duration for V1 and 30&#xD;
      minutes maximum for V2 to V4, separated by 4 to 6 weeks. All sessions will be carried out in&#xD;
      the Pneumology Department of the Foch Hospital, volatolomics platform (Exhalomics®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhalation collection will be performed at each visit in order to perform the volatolom&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
