      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival recession is a lesion characterized by the loss of attachment of root surface of the&#xD;
      tooth, resulting in an apical migration of the gingival margin that occasionally generates&#xD;
      aesthetic problems, hypersensitivity and difficulty in maintaining proper hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several anatomical factors have been associated both with the incidence and progression of&#xD;
      gingival recession and with the prognosis of the surgical treatments proposed for its&#xD;
      correction. These factors include the absence of keratinized tissue, the gingival phenotype,&#xD;
      root prominence and shallow vesrtibular depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate, through a series of prospective cases, the&#xD;
      influence of each of the anatomical factors on the success of root coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients with gingival recession defects will be treated with CAF+CTG using various&#xD;
      autogenous gingival graft. Three-dimensional analysis of superimposed preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative images will be performed. Linear and surface root coverage will be calculated&#xD;
      and correlated to various anatomical parameters such as vestibular depth and root prominence.&#xD;
      A multilevel statistical analysis will be conducted, adjusting for the correlation among&#xD;
      multiple observations.&#xD;

      - Pre-surgical treatment: Initial periodontal therapy will be performed 1 month prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will receive a pre-surgical prophylaxis, oral hygiene instructions and&#xD;
      elimination of toothbrushing traumatic technique, if needed. They will be taught to use a&#xD;
      toothbrush of medium hardness applying Roll brushing technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Surgical treatment: In brief description, CAF+CTG treatment will be performed by starting&#xD;
      with two vertical releasing incisions lateral to the teeth to be treated and split-full-split&#xD;
      thickness flap will be raised beyond the MGJ. The periosteum will be cut, and a blunt&#xD;
      dissection into the vestibular lining mucosa will be carried out to eliminate muscle tension&#xD;
      so that the mucosal flap can be passively positioned above the level of CEJ on the tooth. The&#xD;
      papillae adjacent to the involved teeth will be de-epithelialized and the exposed root&#xD;
      surfaces will be treated with pre-conditioning EDTA (Straumann PrefGel®) for 2 minutes. CTG&#xD;
      of 1mm in thickness will be harvested from the posterior palate by means of disepithelization&#xD;
      of a free gingival graft (22), cut to the exact size of the defect, and placed over the&#xD;
      dehisced defect, sutured to the interdental papillae (7-0 Polyglactin 910, Vycril, Ethicon,&#xD;
      Johnson and Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and subsequently covered with CAF. Sling sutures&#xD;
      will be placed to stabilize the flap in a coronal position about 1-2 mm above the CEJ (6-0&#xD;
      Polypropylene, Prolene, Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), followed by&#xD;
      interrupted sutures to close the releasing incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to avoid any mechanical trauma or tooth brushing in the surgical&#xD;
      sites for 2 weeks. Analgesic medication (ibuprofen) will be prescribed as required and&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to rinse with Chlorhexidine three times per day for 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Sutures will be removed after 14 days. Two weeks after surgery, patients will resume&#xD;
      mechanical tooth cleaning with a soft toothbrush. Patients will be recalled at 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months for professional oral hygiene procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Post-surgical instructions and infection control: Patients will be instructed to avoid any&#xD;
      mechanical trauma or tooth brushing in the surgical sites for 2 weeks. Analgesic medication&#xD;
      (ibuprofen) will be prescribed as required and patients will be instructed to rinse with&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine 0.12% two times per day for 2 weeks. Sutures will be removed after 14 days. Two&#xD;
      weeks after surgery, patients will resume mechanical tooth cleaning with a soft toothbrush.&#xD;
      Patients will be recalled at 1, 3 and 6 months for professional oral hygiene procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Data collection: A guidebook will be prepared to systematize the procedures for sample and&#xD;
      data collection. The data will be later transferred to a computerized database (Epidata®,&#xD;
      Odense, Denmark, Europe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Sociodemographic data An interview will be conducted during the pre-surgical visit to&#xD;
      obtain information regar- ding age, sex, medical history, use of medication, exposure to&#xD;
      tobacco, pregnancy and previous periodontal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Clinical measurements Probing depth (PD) and keratinized tissue width (KTW) will be&#xD;
      measured using a periodontal probe (PCP UNC 15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). KTW will be&#xD;
      measured at the most apical point in the GM to the mucogingival junction at the mid-buccal&#xD;
      site to the nearest millimeter. KTT will be measured 1.5mm and 3mm apical to the GM using an&#xD;
      injection needle, perpendicular to the tissues surface and a silicon stop over the gingival&#xD;
      surface and fixed with a cyanoacrylic adhesive (23). Clinical attachment level will be&#xD;
      calculated as REC + PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Digital measurements All patients will be scanned and their models will be digitalized&#xD;
      with an optical 3D measurement system (3Shape, Erlangen, Germany) creating surface&#xD;
      tessellation language (STL) files while a bilateral retractor is placed in the mouth and&#xD;
      teeth are held lightly in occlusion. The acquired data will be transferred into a digital&#xD;
      imaging software (3Shape Trios®, Erlangen, Germany) in which patient name will be substituted&#xD;
      for a random ID number in order to anonymize the data. Baseline and corresponding follow-up&#xD;
      scans of each clinical case will be then virtually superimposed and matched into one common&#xD;
      coordinate system (Geomagic, 3D Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) using the tool&#xD;
      Control X. By using the buccal surfaces of the concerned teeth as reference points for the&#xD;
      superpositioning of the different time points (pre-operative and post-operative), this&#xD;
      approach will allow for precise evaluation of dimensional soft tissue alterations over time&#xD;
      by a blinded examiner. Vestibular depth will be measured from the GM to the point of greatest&#xD;
      concavity of the mucobuccal fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital linear and volumetric measurements and assessment will be performed by a single,&#xD;
      calibrated examiner for the surgical. The examiner will be trained on 15 casts with gingival&#xD;
      recessions who will not be included in this study. This examination will be repeated 24 h&#xD;
      later; differences of ≤0.5 mm in at least 90% of the cases will be considered to be&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical measurements and volumetric evaluations of the soft will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 months and at 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
