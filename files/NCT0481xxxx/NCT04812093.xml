  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Otitis media is more common in young children and it is estimated that 75% of all children&#xD;
      experience at least one episode before the age of three. Otitis media is one of the common&#xD;
      pediatric diagnoses and recurrent episodes account for the most commonly performed surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Despite this a high degree of inaccuracy exists in diagnosis of this condition&#xD;
      which depends on subjective assessment of the ear drum via direct visualization using an&#xD;
      otoscope. Researchers can use LED-based multi wavelength light absorption and scattering&#xD;
      measurements for the analysis of ear drum and the middle ear.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research can use low energy LED signal light sent into the ear canal to measure the&#xD;
      tissue optical properties including the absorption of the light signal and the amount of&#xD;
      signal that will be backscattered by the tissue components. These measurements will then be&#xD;
      analyzed using a microprocessor to determine presence of fluid or inflammation of the&#xD;
      eardrum.&#xD;

    <description>Spectroscopic otoscope measurements are taken with the investigational device. Each measurement consists of placing the device in the ear canal and illuminating the ear with multiple light sources in a short period of time. If wax is present in the ear canal, it is removed by the study physician and another measurement is taken.</description>
