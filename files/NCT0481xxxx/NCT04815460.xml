      Hypoxic exposure increases right ventricular (RV) afterload by triggering pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, with consequent effects on the structure and function of the RV. Improved&#xD;
      myocardial contractility is a critical circulatory adaptation to exercise training. However,&#xD;
      the types of exercise that enhance right cardiac mechanics during hypoxic stress have not yet&#xD;
      been identified. This study investigated how high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and&#xD;
      moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) influence right cardiac mechanics during&#xD;
      hypoxic exercise (HE).&#xD;

      Hypoxic exposure increases right ventricular (RV) afterload by triggering pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, with consequent effects on the structure and function of the RV. Improved&#xD;
      myocardial contractility is a critical circulatory adaptation to exercise training. However,&#xD;
      the types of exercise that enhance right cardiac mechanics during hypoxic stress have not yet&#xD;
      been identified. This study investigated how high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and&#xD;
      moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) influence right cardiac mechanics during&#xD;
      hypoxic exercise (HE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The young and healthy sedentary males were randomly selected to engage in either HIIT (3-min&#xD;
      intervals at 40% and 80% of VO2 oxygen uptake reserve) or MICT (sustained 60% of VO2 oxygen&#xD;
      uptake reserve) for 30 min/day and 5 days/week for 6 weeks or were included in a control&#xD;
      group (CTL) that did not engage in any exercise. Right cardiac mechanics during semiupright&#xD;
      bicycle exercise tests under hypoxic conditions (i.e., 50 watts under 12% FiO2 for 3 min)&#xD;
      were measured using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. The primary outcome&#xD;
      was the change in right cardiac mechanics during semiupright bicycle exercise under hypoxic&#xD;
      conditions (i.e., 50 watts under 12% FiO2 for 3 min) as measured by two-dimensional speckle&#xD;
      tracking echocardiography.&#xD;

    <measure>The changes of right cardiac mechanics during hypoxia stress echocardiography: Strain</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoxia stress echocardiography was collected under hypoxic conditions (12% FiO2) and used two-dimensional Speckle-tracking echocardiography.&#xD;
The resting images were acquired after the subject was placed in the aforementioned position for 10 min.&#xD;
The exercise images were conducted using semirecumbent cycling with a 50-Watt resistance for 3 min and acquired at the third minute of cycling to ensure that subjects had reached a steady-state HR (i.e., HR changes &lt;10 bpm within 10 s and &lt;110-120 bpm).&#xD;
A modified apical four-chamber view was used to assess 2D-STE longitudinal and radial parameters of the RV and RA.&#xD;
The RV strain was calculated using the average peak segmental values displayed by the software using a 6-segment model.</description>

    <measure>Cardiopulmonary fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess cardiopulmonary fitness, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on a cycle ergometer was performed 4 days before and after the intervention. All subjects underwent exercise with a mask to measured oxygen consumption (VO2) breath by breath using a computer-based system (Master Screen CPX, Cardinal-health Germany).</description>

    <measure>The cavity diameters of RV</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RV basal cavity diameter (RVD1), mid-cavity diameter (RVD2), and RV longitudinal diameter (RVD3), at end-diastole and end-systole, were evaluated in the modified apical four-chamber view.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated using the formula PVR = ([tricuspid regurgitation velocity/RVOT VTI] × 10 + 0.16)&#xD;
Tricuspid regurgitation velocity: Doppler imaging was used to measure peak tricuspid regurgitation velocities in systolic phase.&#xD;
The RV outflow tract (RVOT): obtained from a parasternal short-axis base view modified apical four-chamber view, and the flow immediately proximal to the pulmonary artery valve during systole was detected to calculate both maximal velocity and pulsed-wave blood velocity time integral (VTI)</description>

    <measure>Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
