  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Patients with severe heart failure increasingly benefit from extracorporeal&#xD;
      circulatory assistance (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation - ECMO) that completely replaces&#xD;
      the function of the heart and is in addition to mechanical ventilation (veno-arterial ECMO).&#xD;
      In clinical practice, some of these patients have been found to be dyspneic, although&#xD;
      circulatory assistance ensures satisfactory hematosis. Indeed, nearly half of the patients&#xD;
      undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care have a generally intense dyspnea. In&#xD;
      addition to the immediate discomfort caused by dyspnea, which can be assimilated to pain,&#xD;
      this symptom is associated with a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      contributes to the genesis of neuropsychological sequelae of resuscitation such as&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the effectiveness and impact of an increase in ECMO sweep gas flow through the&#xD;
           membrane lung or positive tele-expiratory pressure (PEP) on dyspnea in patients under&#xD;
           ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the mechanism involved in this relief of dyspnea. Methods: in 30 patients&#xD;
           of Intensive Care Unit, dyspnea will be evaluated by psychophysiological scales and&#xD;
           scores as well as by neurophysiological tools (electromyography of inspiratory muscles)&#xD;
           during sweep gas flow through the membrane lung incrementation and PEP increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical framework: Changes in ventilation parameters and ECMO will be performed in the usual&#xD;
      manner, without additional or unusual diagnostic, treatment or monitoring procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and outlook: the investigators hypothesize that half of the patients on&#xD;
      veno-arterial ECMO have dyspnea related to pulmonary edema. Therefore, an increase in PEP&#xD;
      would alleviate this dyspnea. The investigators hypothesize that by using a relief method&#xD;
      related to increased sweep gas flow through the membrane lung, the investigators can reduce&#xD;
      the discomfort without inducing any associated complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will improve the knowledge of the mechanisms determining dyspnea in patients under&#xD;
      ECMO and the principle of therapeutic strategy to improve it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Half of the patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care have moderate to&#xD;
      severe dyspnea. This dyspnea has a negative impact on the prognosis and quality of life in&#xD;
      the medium term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As ECMOs, techniques for extracorporeal assistance to supplement cardiac and pulmonary&#xD;
      functions, are developing rapidly, it seems essential to study the dyspnea associated with&#xD;
      the use of these techniques. In particular, understanding the main mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      genesis of dyspnea in patients under ECMO would allow the development of therapeutic&#xD;
      solutions aimed at minimizing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that, in patients under veno-arterial ECMO with dyspnea, the&#xD;
      dyspnea decreases in response to an increase in ECMO sweep gas flow through the membrane lung&#xD;
      via modulation of central and peripheral chemoreceptors sensitive to variations in PaO2,&#xD;
      PaCO2 and pH. Since dyspnea experienced by patients on veno-arterial ECMO is related to&#xD;
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema, increased discharge from the left cavities by increasing&#xD;
      positive expiratory pressure should also alleviate dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the impact of sweep gas flow through&#xD;
      the membrane lung and PEP incrementation on dyspnea in patients with veno-arterial ECMO with&#xD;
      dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relief of dyspnea will be carried out by the clinician in charge of the patient. He will have&#xD;
      complete control of his behaviour. He will carry out this test according to the practices in&#xD;
      force in the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the investigators will be present and will collect the data listed above. This&#xD;
      investigator will not intervene in the conduct of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will participate in a dyspnea relief test according to the protocol of the&#xD;
      department and according to the management of the practitioner in charge of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially a recording of 5 minutes will be made in the basal state, before any therapeutic&#xD;
      action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as the D-VAS is ≤ 3 at one of these steps the data collection ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a sweep gas flow through the membrane lung increment has been decided upon to relieve&#xD;
      dyspnea, a new recording will be made after each scan increment and the patient will be asked&#xD;
      at each step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ventilated or non-ventilated patients in whom the decision to implement non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation has been made, an increase in PEEP in 2 cmH2O steps without exceeding a plateau&#xD;
      pressure of 25 cmH2O and a VT of 10ml/kg of the patient's theoretical weight will be&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;

    <description>The amplitude of the EMG signal of the extra-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles is proportional to the intensity of the dyspnea. The EMG will be collected by self-adhesive surface electrodes of the same type as those usually used to collect the ECG signal in ICU patients. A distance of 2 cm will separate the two electrodes. The impedance should be less than 2000 Ω. The position of the electrodes will depend on the muscle whose EMG activity is being collected:&#xD;
parasternal intercostal muscles: opposite the 2nd intercostal space, as close as possible to the sternum;&#xD;
Alae nasi muscles: on the wings of the nose.</description>
