  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide patients with easily accessible information in the form of a smartphone&#xD;
      application regarding medically appropriate information about breastfeeding and to assess the&#xD;
      impact this information has on women's breastfeeding rates and perception of self-efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and neonate have been well documented and&#xD;
      extensively researched. Breastfeeding rates remain suboptimal despite known advantages&#xD;
      including reduced lifetime risk of maternal ovarian cancer, more rapid return to&#xD;
      pre-gestational weight, improvement in maternal/neonatal bonding, reduction in neonatal&#xD;
      allergic/immunologic conditions. Both non-modifiable and modifiable factors affecting a&#xD;
      mother's decision regarding breastfeeding have been identified. Modifiable factors include&#xD;
      breastfeeding knowledge, self-efficacy, and confidence. Breastfeeding self-efficacy has been&#xD;
      positively correlated with breastfeeding duration. There is a lack of local data on&#xD;
      breastfeeding rates, duration, and self-efficacy in the Augusta University women's health&#xD;
      population as well as a lack of documented improvement of these factors following educational&#xD;
      programs. Our study aims to create a program that is easily accessible and available to our&#xD;
      patient population in the form of a free application available on Apple devices capable of&#xD;
      accessing the internet (e.g., i-phone, i-pad, etc.). This study will be a randomized control&#xD;
      trial. The intervention group will have access to the application while the control group&#xD;
      will not. Our hypothesis is that the application will improve breastfeeding rates, duration,&#xD;
      and self-efficacy if offered to patients at 32 through 36 weeks gestation. This will be&#xD;
      assessed by comparing initial self-efficacy survey results with survey results at six weeks&#xD;
      and six months postpartum for the intervention versus control groups.&#xD;
