    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics Inc. (MPO) plans to market the EVOLUTION® NitrX™ Non-Porous Keeled&#xD;
      Tibia and EVOLUTION® NitrX™ CS/CR Non-Porous Femur with the EVOLUTION® Cruciate Sacrificing&#xD;
      (CS) Tibial Insert globally, including in the European Union (EU). MPO is conducting this&#xD;
      post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      EVOLUTION® NitrX™ Non-Porous Keeled Tibia and EVOLUTION® NitrX™ CS/CR Non-Porous Femur. These&#xD;
      components are used along with the EVOLUTION® Cruciate Sacrificing (CS) Tibial Insert&#xD;
      components that is marketed in the European Union (EU). This type of data collection is&#xD;
      required by regulatory authorities for all TKA devices that do not have medium to long-term&#xD;
      clinical evidence available.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Has or had a distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread to the&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Has or had inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or&#xD;
             inadequate abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint&#xD;
             which would make the procedure unjustifiable&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which could affect the endpoints&#xD;
             of this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has documented substance abuse issues&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability or&#xD;
