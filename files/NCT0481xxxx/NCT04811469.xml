  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CBP-174&#xD;
      compared to placebo. The study plans to set 6 dose escalation cohorts with single oral dose.&#xD;
      Each subject will receive only one dose regimen in this study and the total duration to&#xD;
      participate the study is approximately 1 to 4-week.&#xD;
