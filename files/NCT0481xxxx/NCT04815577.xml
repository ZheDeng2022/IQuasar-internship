  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an incidence of 0.8 %, congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of congenital&#xD;
      anomalies at birth. Medical advances in CHD have transferred the mortality from childhood to&#xD;
      adulthood and today there are more adults with CHD than children. After focusing on survival,&#xD;
      more attention is being given to health-related quality of life and secondary prevention in&#xD;
      this population where warning signals are launched on the risk of sedentary lifestyle,&#xD;
      obesity, cardiovascular risk 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), which is a non-invasive and dynamic examination, is&#xD;
      becoming the gold standard to the follow-up 2 of these patients by allowing to quantify&#xD;
      disease severity, to evaluate the quality of life 3, to give important prognostic information&#xD;
      on functional capacity and haemodynamic response 4, to facilitate a safe decision-making when&#xD;
      prescribing exercise programmes and sport participation for these children with CHD 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, in a cross-sectional study from 2010 to 2015, the investigators evaluated&#xD;
      the cardiopulmonary fitness of children with CHD by comparing them with healthy children 6.&#xD;
      In this study, 496 children with CHD compared to 302 healthy children were included. It&#xD;
      showed that maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) are&#xD;
      decreased in CHD children compared to healthy children, clinical determinants of decreased&#xD;
      VO2max have been defined for CHD children. This study was proposed, despite the&#xD;
      cross-sectional nature, an average decrease in annual VO2max (0,84 ml/kg/min per year) to&#xD;
      make pediatric and congenital cardiologist aware of the need to a regular follow up for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this new study, the main objective was to know the real evolution of VO2max in these&#xD;
      patients from this same cohort, with a longitudinal design, by collecting a new CPET carried&#xD;
      out between 2015 and 2020 and compared these results to healthy pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives were: to know the evolution of the VAT, to define the clinical&#xD;
      determinants in relation to the annual decrease of the VO2max. And to describe the population&#xD;
      lost to follow-up in this retrospective study which represents current practice.&#xD;

      Longitudinal multi-center study from November 2010 to September 2020 in two pediatric CPET&#xD;
      laboratories (center 1: M3C Regional Pediatric and Congenital Cardiology Centre, Montpellier&#xD;
      University Hospital, France; center 2: Pediatric Cardiology and Rehabilitation Centre,&#xD;
      Institut-Saint-Pierre, Palavas-Les-Flots, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups will be identify: CHD group and control group. The CHD group is made up of the&#xD;
      children included in the first study6. From these 496 children with CHD, children with a&#xD;
      second CPET more than one year from the first referral CPET were included. If several CPETs&#xD;
      were performed in the follow-up, we retain the most distant CPET from the first. The patients&#xD;
      included in the initial study were aged 5-18 years old and they were referred by their&#xD;
      paediatric cardiologists to one of the two CPET laboratories after their annual medical&#xD;
      check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group consisted of children referred for a nonsevere functional symptom linked to&#xD;
      exercise (murmur, palpitation or dyspnoea) or for a medical sports certificate. These&#xD;
      children were classified in the control group only after a completely normal check-up,&#xD;
      including physical examination, ECG, echocardiography and spirometry. Children with any&#xD;
      chronic disease, medical condition (cardiac, neurological, respiratory, muscular or renal),&#xD;
      or medical treatment and those requiring any further specialised medical consultation were&#xD;
      not eligible. We included controlled children from 2015-2020 period who will be added to the&#xD;
      controlled patients of the initial study6. These patients only had one CPET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective was to describe the annual evolution in VO2max for patients with CHD&#xD;
      compared to control children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary obectives were :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe the annual evolution of ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) for patients with&#xD;
           CHD compared to control children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  define the clinical determinants in relation to the annual decrease of the VO2 max.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe the population lost to follow-up in this retrospective study which represents&#xD;
           current practice&#xD;

    <description>The CHD group is made up of the children included in the first study. From these 496 children with CHD, children with a second CPET more than one year from the first referral CPET were included. If several CPETs were performed in the follow-up, we retain the most distant CPET from the first, excluding the CPETs that were performed after a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program implemented in the region in 2018. The group corresponding to the first CPET was called. Among the initial 496 children, if patients had not had a second CPET, the cause was indicated. As a reminder, the patients included in the initial study were aged 5-18 years old and they were referred by their paediatric cardiologists to one of the two CPET laboratories after their annual medical check-up. The anatomical and clinical classification of congenital heart diseases was used to define the type of malformation. The demographic, clinical, echocardiographic data were collected during the first CPET.</description>
