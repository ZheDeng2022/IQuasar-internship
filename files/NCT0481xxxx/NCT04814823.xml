  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of devices called pulse oximeters, which&#xD;
      measure blood oxygen by shining light through fingers, ears or other skin, without requiring&#xD;
      blood sampling. Study will be used with patients at rest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate performance of a new design pulse oximeter (test device)&#xD;
      manufactured by Nihon Kohden Corporation sufficiently to support performance claims for an&#xD;
      FDA 510K submission or ISO technical file. Specifically, SpO2 and pulse rate accuracy will be&#xD;
      assessed for a Nihon Kohden OLV-4202 pulse oximeter with adult patients under a controlled&#xD;
      setting of varying levels of inhaled oxygen concentration levels for patients at rest.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Deviation of device SpO2 measurement with room air stabilization from co-oximeter SaO2 measurement at varying desaturation levels (Run 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will have an arterial catheter inserted in the left or right wrist and the pulse oximeter study device placed on different fingers of the left or right hand, or the left or right earlobe or the forehead. Measurement position is randomized across subjects. For each subject, a series of desaturation runs are performed.&#xD;
Run 1 starts with a stabilized period at room air and is followed by stabilized plateaus at various lower saturation level targets:&#xD;
room air, 92%, 87%, 82%, 77%, 72%&#xD;
SpO2 is observed breath by breath arterial saturation, which is in turn computed from end tidal PO2 and PCO2. FiO2 is reduced suddenly at first then adjusted to achieve a stable plateau value at the desired target. Each desaturation plateaus should not exceed 10 minutes. A blood draw is taken at stable FiO2 and +30 seconds. The gas mixture is then changed for the next value and repeated for each plateau value.</description>
