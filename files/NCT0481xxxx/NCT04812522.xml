      Executive summary: Cesarean delivery, or section (CS), is the single most common surgical&#xD;
      procedure performed. Estimates indicate that in low resource settings, CS comprises up to 50%&#xD;
      of more of the total volume of operations performed. The World Health Organization recommends&#xD;
      national CS rates of between 10-15% to save lives and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
      Population-based work indicates that CS rates of up to 19% are demonstrably related to&#xD;
      improved maternal and neonatal survival. However, complications are common, and gynecological&#xD;
      and obstetric surgical interventions are associated with high rates of morbidity. In low&#xD;
      resource settings, complication rates are particularly high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention being tested is based on a previously developed program called Clean Cut.&#xD;
      Clean Cut is an adaptive, multimodal surgical infection prevention program that integrates&#xD;
      perioperative process improvement and patient outcomes measurement using process mapping,&#xD;
      training and improved management practices, and compliance with critical standards of&#xD;
      surgical antisepsis. It was successfully piloted in five surgical departments in Ethiopia,&#xD;
      and reduced the relative risk of infection by 35%. This has been adapted specifically for&#xD;
      obstetric and gynecological operations and will be evaluated in a cluster randomized stepped&#xD;
      wedge trial design in ten maternity hospitals/departments in Ethiopia in order to reduce&#xD;
      infections and other complications for women undergoing cesarean delivery and other obstetric&#xD;
      and gynecologic operations.&#xD;

      Background: Cesarean section (CS) is the single most common surgical procedure performed&#xD;
      worldwide. In Ethiopia, estimates suggest that CS accounts for 30-50% of all operations&#xD;
      performed. Population-based work indicates that CS rates of up to 19% are demonstrably&#xD;
      related to improved maternal and neonatal survival. In Ethiopia, the national CS rate per&#xD;
      live births was 1.9% in 2016, but rates are highly variable by region. In addition,&#xD;
      complications are common, and gynecological and obstetric surgical interventions are&#xD;
      associated with high rates of morbidity. Infections and complications following CS are&#xD;
      estimated to cause 15% of maternal deaths in the country, and the overall SSI rate following&#xD;
      CS is estimated at 9%. Failure to administer preoperative antibiotics has been highlighted as&#xD;
      a particular improvement opportunity, and is one of the critical processes this program will&#xD;
      focus on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifebox, a charity devoted to improving surgical and anesthesia safety, developed a program&#xD;
      to improve compliance with the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist and improve adherence to&#xD;
      critical standards of perioperative infection prevention. This initiative, called Clean Cut,&#xD;
      is an adaptive, multimodal surgical infection prevention program that integrates&#xD;
      perioperative process improvement and patient outcomes measurement using process mapping,&#xD;
      training and improved management practices, and compliance with critical standards of&#xD;
      surgical antisepsis. The program was the result of a joint collaboration between the&#xD;
      Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), the Surgical Society of Ethiopia, and Lifebox&#xD;
      and resulted in a 35% relative risk reduction in postoperative infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To reduce postoperative infections in patients undergoing CS Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reduce postoperative infections in patients undergoing other obstetrical and&#xD;
           gynecological operations&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To improve compliance with a core set of critical perioperative infection prevention and&#xD;
           control practices that are essential to reducing infectious risks from surgical&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To reduce the need for reoperation in patients undergoing obstetrical and gynecological&#xD;
           operations&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To reduce the length of stay due to infectious and other complications for patients&#xD;
           undergoing obstetrical and gynecological operations&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To reduce mortality rates in mothers undergoing CS&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To reduce mortality rates in women undergoing obstetrical and gynecological operations&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To reduce mortality rates in neonates delivered by CS Ancillary&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To assess facility readiness for and capacities to engage in quality improvement&#xD;
           programs in surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention: Clean Cut focuses on improving compliance with six critical perioperative&#xD;
      infection prevention standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  appropriate skin preparation of the surgeon's hands and the surgical site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maintenance of the sterile field by ensuring the integrity and sterility of surgical&#xD;
           gowns, drapes, and gloves&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  confirmation of instrument sterility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  appropriate antibiotic administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete swab counts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  routine use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clean Cut is implemented in five phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of a Clean Cut team to include members from all perioperative&#xD;
           disciplines: Ob/Gyn, surgery, nursing, anesthesia, QI personnel and operating room (OR)&#xD;
           management;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishment of a baseline by conducting context assessments and process mapping the&#xD;
           six perioperative standards, and establishing a data collection system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Modification and implementation of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist to fit local&#xD;
           practices;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ongoing data feedback to connect baseline data with process maps, coupled with&#xD;
           site-specific action plans for improvement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Targeted training, workshops, and refresher courses using local providers, coupled with&#xD;
           a transition to hospital management for sustaining the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clean Cut has been adapted specifically for obstetric and gynecological operations and will&#xD;
      implement it in ten maternity hospitals/departments in Ethiopia in order to reduce infections&#xD;
      and other complications for women undergoing cesarean delivery and other obstetric and&#xD;
      gynecologic operations. Clean Cut has been designed with sustainability at its core - the&#xD;
      strategy emphasizes teamwork and collective leadership to identify and address critical gaps&#xD;
      in perioperative safety processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The impact of the CS-tailored Clean Cut program will be tested through a&#xD;
      cluster randomized stepped-wedge study design at 10 hospitals over the course of 24 months.&#xD;
      Each selected hospital will be distributed into two groups based on the type of facility:&#xD;
      university teaching and referral hospitals in one group, and regional, district, and&#xD;
      community hospitals in another. Five clusters and their order will be randomly established,&#xD;
      paring a teaching/referral hospital with a regional/district/community hospital. These&#xD;
      hospitals will start by collecting inpatient and outpatient outcomes on all patients&#xD;
      undergoing CS prior to implementation. Over the course of 10 months, 2 hospitals at a time&#xD;
      will begin implementing Clean Cut at 2-month intervals. Each starts by assembling a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary improvement team, undergoing team training on WHO Surgical Safety Checklist&#xD;
      use and implementation, and gathering compliance information about intraoperative safety&#xD;
      practices. The initiation of Clean Cut will also involve creating facility-specific process&#xD;
      maps of each critical perioperative practice. Once these process maps and compliance data are&#xD;
      complete, usually after 2-4 weeks, the team establishes an adaptive, facility-driven&#xD;
      improvement plan based on process gaps and barriers to best practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites and facility eligibility: Study sites will consist of ten hospitals in Ethiopia&#xD;
      that provide maternal surgical services. Five of these hospitals will be university teaching&#xD;
      or referral hospitals (aka specialized or referral hospitals), and five will be regional,&#xD;
      district or smaller community hospitals (aka general or regional hospitals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site randomization: Each selected hospital will be distributed into two groups based on the&#xD;
      type of facility: university teaching and referral hospitals in one group, and regional,&#xD;
      district, and community hospitals in another. One hospital in each group will be paired to&#xD;
      create five clusters; these pairings will be purposive as district and referral hospitals in&#xD;
      Ethiopia typically have long-standing relationships which will facilitate implementation at&#xD;
      the cluster level and prevent inadvertent crossover of the intervention prior to&#xD;
      randomization. The sequence of implementation for each of the five clusters will be&#xD;
      established using computer-based randomization (https://www.randomizer.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: As obstetric and gynecologic operations are typically undertaken in separate,&#xD;
      dedicated operating theatres, we will focus our prospective observations on patients admitted&#xD;
      to these theatres. Any patient undergoing surgery at any time in one of the targeted&#xD;
      operating theatres is eligible for inclusion; there will be no exclusion criteria. Enrollment&#xD;
      will occur at the time of observation and will include various times (day and night) and days&#xD;
      of the week (weekdays and weekends). As the standards being implemented are not in dispute&#xD;
      and are considered critical for ensuring antisepsis and sterility, patient informed consent&#xD;
      will not be obtained. While our focus will be on cesarean delivery, any obstetric or&#xD;
      gynecological operation will be included, with the inclusion of other operations in this&#xD;
      populations (such as appendectomy for appendicitis that is found incidentally or misdiagnosed&#xD;
      as ovarian torsion, for example). There will be no age range limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also interview key hospital personnel to understand the context of each facility, its&#xD;
      experience with quality improvement initiatives, and the perceived importance of this work to&#xD;
      patient safety, patient care, and the work routine. These interviewees will be recruited from&#xD;
      the implementation teams involved in Clean Cut. We will also administer surveys in&#xD;
      conjunction with Ariadne Labs, a partner in this work, to understand the context,&#xD;
      perceptions, and priorities of the various institutions, and how the Clean-CS team can&#xD;
      support implementation at the time of intervention (phases 3, 4, and 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculations: Our prior work and review of the literature indicate a&#xD;
      baseline SSI incidence of 12% following CS. Given our past work has reduced SSI by 35%, we&#xD;
      assume an effect size of Clean Cut resulting in a 25% absolute reduction in SSI (from 12% to&#xD;
      9%). We expect that the preintervention sample will match the postintervention sample in size&#xD;
      and general demographic characteristics. As we do not have specific information on the&#xD;
      interhospital characteristics or outcomes, we assume an intracluster correlation (ICC) of 0.1&#xD;
      With recruitment of 80-90 patients per cluster per month over 18 months, we expect the final&#xD;
      sample to include 7,200 to 8,100 patients, which will be sufficient to detect our expected&#xD;
      difference within a reasonable range of ICCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of our power calculations, data handling, and data forms will be available in our&#xD;
      online protocol: https://www.lifebox.org/cleancs/&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: We will conduct pre/post analyses with our planned assessment controlling for risk&#xD;
      factors and other demographic and procedure variables listed below that are known to affect&#xD;
      infection rates. We will compare patient demographics pre and post intervention as well to&#xD;
      evaluate overall matching of patients in each part of the study. We will evaluate compliance&#xD;
      individually and in an all-or-none manner as previously described in our Clean Cut pilot&#xD;
      work. We will undertake a planned subanalysis of patients observed early during baseline&#xD;
      (first two months) and compare them to patients undergoing surgery during the final stage of&#xD;
      the study (last two months) after implementation of the program has had time to take effect&#xD;
      to assess primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will not conduct any interim analyses as we believe that neither benefit nor futility&#xD;
      would be readily observable at an interim analysis given the implementation strategy and&#xD;
      approach; furthermore, even if we were able to assess benefit or futility we would want to&#xD;
      continue the trial to fully study the mechanisms of implementation. Regarding an assessment&#xD;
      of harm, if such an outcome were noted we believe this would most likely be due to detection&#xD;
      bias with improving ability to capture complications as the study progressed, and we would&#xD;
      want to let the study play out to mitigate this detection bias over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, benefits, and IRB review: The protocol was approved by the Armauer Hansen Research&#xD;
      Institute (AHRI/ ALERT) Ethics Review Committee and the Ministry of Science and Higher&#xD;
      Education. As the standards being implemented are not in dispute and are considered critical&#xD;
      for ensuring antisepsis and sterility, patient informed consent will not be obtained and&#xD;
      waiver for informed consent has been requested. The Investigator will ensure that this trial&#xD;
      is conducted in accordance with relevant regulations and with Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of this study are improvements in compliance with best practices in&#xD;
      perioperative infection prevention. There are no known risks other than those typically&#xD;
      associated with surgery that are not specific to this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional oversight: Lifebox and the Ethiopian Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&#xD;
      are jointly organizing and running this study. Lifebox will be responsible for data security&#xD;
      and analysis. The ten hospitals are listed in this protocol.&#xD;
