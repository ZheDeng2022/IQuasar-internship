  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease defined by persistently increased blood&#xD;
      glucose levels with fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, random plasma glucose ≥ 200mg/dl and&#xD;
      HbA1c ≥ 6.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes has emerged as a great socioeconomic burden for the developing world. In 2017,&#xD;
      globally, 451 million people were affected with diabetes. In Pakistan, the prevalence of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes is 16.98% which differs significantly with age, education, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      obesity, family history and blood pressure. DM is classified into type 1 diabetes (T1D) and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2D). T1D occurs due to an autoimmune pancreatic beta cell destruction with&#xD;
      consequent insulin deficiency whereas T2D occurs due to predominantly insulin resistance with&#xD;
      relative insulin deficiency or defective secretion. T2D cause serious and chronic&#xD;
      microvascular and macrovascular complications. One of the most prevalent microvascular&#xD;
      complication is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). DPN is defined as distal, symmetric&#xD;
      sensorimotor polyneuropathy as a result of hyperglycemia and microangiopathy. It is a&#xD;
      demyelinating disease of peripheral nerve fibers that manifests as parasthesias, impairment&#xD;
      of sensations of vibration, proprioception, touch, pressure, pain and temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors of DPN are age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c &gt;7.0%, increased BMI, hyperlipidemia&#xD;
      and hyperglycemia. Treatment of T2D is targeted towards good glycemic control that includes&#xD;
      life style modifications i.e. diet and exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) and&#xD;
      subcutaneous insulin administration. In life style modification, variety of exercises are&#xD;
      recommended that help to slow the progression of peripheral neuropathy.These include; aerobic&#xD;
      training, weight-bearing, static and dynamic balance training and strength training exercises&#xD;
      which improve the gait speed, stride length and nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) of sensory&#xD;
      and motor nerves while flexibility exercises improve the range-of-motion in ankle, hip and&#xD;
      shoulder joints and keep them flexible. Importance of dietary modification is enhanced if it&#xD;
      is synchronized with the circadian rhythm of the body. Therefore, Synchronized Lifestyle&#xD;
      Modification Program (SLP) is a personalized, homeostasis restoring, liver centric lifestyle&#xD;
      modification program that works through the correction of body clock rhythm. Lifestyle&#xD;
      medicine is defined as the discipline of studying how daily habits and practices impact both&#xD;
      on the prevention and treatment of disease. Its key aspects are: regular physical activity,&#xD;
      proper nutrition, weight management, avoiding tobacco and a sound mental health. Lifestyle&#xD;
      modification in diabetics is believed to enhance the function of pancreatic islet cells and&#xD;
      induce glucose-stimulated insulin release.Regarding pharmacological treatment, following OHAs&#xD;
      are used which are; biguanides, insulin secretagogues, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,&#xD;
      thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors and sodium glucose&#xD;
      co-transporter-2 inhibitors. Now a days, an injectable agent i.e. Glucagon like&#xD;
      peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor agonist is used with OHAs and is effective in decreasing blood&#xD;
      glucose levels with a low risk of hypoglycemia in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited data is available which supports the combined effect of Synchronized Lifestyle&#xD;
      modification Program (SLP) and Physiotherapy in the progression of DPN in T2D patients taking&#xD;
      OHAs and GLP-1.&#xD;
