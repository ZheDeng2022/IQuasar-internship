      AIM: To determine the influence of age and radiograph presentation on C-shaped canal&#xD;
      morphology in mandibular second molar by using CBCT Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval&#xD;
      CSICDSR/IEC/0054/2018 a total of 112 cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans from&#xD;
      mandibular second molar teeth with C-shaped canal was included for evaluation. These scans&#xD;
      were obtained from patients referred to author's department for root canal treatment in the&#xD;
      period from July 2016 to March 2020. Informed consent was obtained prior to CBCT scan&#xD;
      recommendation. Mandibular molars in this study did not have any root fillings, had fully&#xD;
      formed root apices and lack of root resorption. Mandibular second molars in this study were&#xD;
      recommended for single tooth CBCT recordings when there was an indication of fused roots in&#xD;
      the pre-operative periapical radiograph, with a confirmed C-shaped canal anatomy upon access&#xD;
      and / or canal exploration; or with a master cone verification cone shift technique&#xD;
      radiograph that a C-shaped canal was evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs were taken with paralleling cone technique using Blue dent X-ray&#xD;
      machine (60-70 Kvp, 4-7 mA) and image acquisition was done with Vista Scan Mini plus . The&#xD;
      CBCT machine Kodak CS 8100 3D was used for image acquisition with an exposure of 80 KV, 5mA ,&#xD;
      19.96 secs and had a voxel size of 90 micro m. All images used 1mm slice thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiograph image, axial, coronal and sagittal cross sections of root canal from&#xD;
      CBCT were displayed in a monitor and inspected by two experienced endodontic post graduates.&#xD;
      Cross sections of root canal were classified according to Fan et al. categorization. Intra-&#xD;
      and Inter-observer calibrations had previously been done by assessing 20 selected CBCT volume&#xD;
      recording of C-shaped mandibular second molar canal. Two observers analyzed the selected CBCT&#xD;
      recordings twice with a 1 week interval between the assessments. Kappa test was done to&#xD;
      evaluate the reliability of the observers. The kappa values ranged from 1.000 to 0.761 for&#xD;
      inter-and intra-observation reflecting a high level of agreement. Cross section CBCT images&#xD;
      were captured&#xD;
&#xD;
      1mm from root canal orifices, at the apical exit of canal and mid-way between the coronal and&#xD;
      apical extent of the canal. Any controversies in assessment of images were discussed among&#xD;
      the two observers; if consensus was not achieved an experienced endodontic teacher would&#xD;
      assist in decision making along with re-examining and scrolling through of CBCT volume&#xD;
      recording of the patient in all three planes using the software tools. The periapical&#xD;
      radiographs were assessed by an experienced endodontist under 2.5X magnification and optimal&#xD;
      light conditions. The C-shaped root appearance in the radiographs was categorized with a&#xD;
      modified Gao et al. classification. The modification for the classification was, Type I -&#xD;
      Merging: Canals merged into one major canal before exiting at the apical foramen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type II - Symmetric: Separated mesial canal and distal canal located at the mesial part and&#xD;
      distal part of the root, respectively. Maximum separation between the root canals should be &gt;&#xD;
      1/3rd of distance between the mesial and distal maximum contour of the roots. From the&#xD;
      buccal-lingual view, symmetry of the mesial canal and distal canal was present along the&#xD;
      longitudinal axis of the root.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type III - Asymmetric: Separate mesial and distal canals were evident. From a buccal-lingual&#xD;
      view, the distal canal may have a large isthmus across the furcation area, which commonly&#xD;
      made the mesial and distal canal asymmetrical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type IV - Merging symmetric: Canals merged into one major apical exit with partial dentin&#xD;
      fusion area may appear in the coronal and (or) middle portion of the canal system. Maximum&#xD;
      separation between the root canals should be &gt; 1/3rd of distance between the mesial and&#xD;
      distal maximum contour of the roots. Separated mesial and distal canals symmetry was present&#xD;
      along the longitudinal axis of the root.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type V - Merging asymmetric: Canals merged into one major apical exit with partial dentin&#xD;
      fusion area may appear in the coronal and (or) middle portion of the canal system. Separated&#xD;
      mesial and distal canals asymmetry was present along the longitudinal axis of the root&#xD;
      because of presence of large isthmus across the furcation area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any variation that could not be accommodated within these established criteria were allocated&#xD;
      as variable. C-shaped canal systems in mandibular second molars required three criteria (i)&#xD;
      fused roots (ii) a longitudinal groove on the buccal or lingual surface, and (iii) at least&#xD;
      one cross section of the canal belonging to classification C1, C2, C3 or C4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in prevalence of different types of C-shaped root canal configurations between&#xD;
      ages were compared using chi-squared test and ANOVA. Statistical analysis was performed using&#xD;
      SPSS. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered as significant difference.&#xD;
