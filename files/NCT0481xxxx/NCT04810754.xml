      This is a monocenter, open-label Phase II trial for refractory SLE patients currently on&#xD;
      stable background immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment in this trial will be daratumumab&#xD;
      weekly for a period of 8 weeks. This study will enroll 10 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial &quot;DARALUP&quot; is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daratumumab,&#xD;
      a monoclonal antibody directed against CD38, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE). This is a monocenter, open-label Phase II trial recruting SLE patients with clinical&#xD;
      and serologic activity despite state-of-the-art immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment in this&#xD;
      study will be Weekly daratumumab injections over a period of 8 weeks. This study will enroll&#xD;
      10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLE is a sometimes severe, generalized autoimmune disease with few approved therapies to&#xD;
      date. Therefore, the planned study offers an opportunity to identify a new, targeted&#xD;
      therapeutic approach. Daratumumab has been studied in multiple Phase III clinical trials in&#xD;
      patients with relapsing multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy, where it demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy with an acceptable safety profile and has been approved since 2016 under the trade&#xD;
      name Darzalex®. The aim is to investigate whether daratumumab provides clinically significant&#xD;
      efficacy in SLE, another disease in which plasma cells have been shown to play a pathogenic&#xD;
      role. Previous experience by the sponsor of this trial with the use of daratumumab in two&#xD;
      patients with SLE suggests that one cycle of 4 weekly infusions with 16 mg/kg daratumumab was&#xD;
      associated with a significant serologic and clinical response. In this study, a dosing&#xD;
      regimen of 2 cycles of Darzalex is planned, with one cycle containing 4 Weekly injections.&#xD;
      Based on the previously reported efficacy under anti-CD38 therapy, this human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody appears suitable for the therapy of SLE and will be investigated in this study.&#xD;
