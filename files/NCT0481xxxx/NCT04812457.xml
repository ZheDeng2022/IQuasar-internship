  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a postoperative treatment protocol&#xD;
      with hyaluronic acid-based ointment compared to the standard protocol (betadine gel) in&#xD;
      partial chemical matricectomies with phenol alcohol technique. This will allow to see if the&#xD;
      use of hyaluronic acid could help to reduce the healing time and total recovery of this&#xD;
      surgical technique&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled multicenter study will be conducted. Subject (n=60) will be&#xD;
      adolescent and healthy adults, between 14 and 40 years old, who require and demand surgical&#xD;
      treatment of onychocryptosis or stage I or IIa ingrown nail in the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After acceptance to participate in the study, they will be operated on in a standardized&#xD;
      protocol with phenol-alcohol technique. Then they will be randomly assigned into 2 groups, to&#xD;
      perform different treatment protocols. The experimental group will receive physiological&#xD;
      cures using pure hyaluronic acid (Hialucic®) after the onychocryptosis surgery, while the&#xD;
      control group will receive traditional cure (Betadine Gel). The periodicity of cures in both&#xD;
      groups will be the same, 48 hours, 6 days, 12 days 16 days and 20 days. For the design of the&#xD;
      study, the bases on randomized clinical studies described in CONSORT will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measurement will be the presence of exudate in each of the cures (carried out at&#xD;
      the same post-surgical times), presence or absence of granulation tissue, reduction of&#xD;
      inflammation (measured with the circumference of the finger in the eponychium area), cost&#xD;
      average treatment protocol, time elapsed until primary healing (when the wound stops staining&#xD;
      the bandage) and final surgical discharge (finger without wound or inflammation), referred&#xD;
      pain in the finger during the healing period and presence of complications, such like&#xD;
      persistent inflammation, infection, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through the Podiatric Clinic of the University of Extremadura&#xD;
      and Lopezosa y Gijon Nogueron clinics in Malaga and Granada&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE´S SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confidence level was established at 95% and the statistical power at 90%. We need a&#xD;
      minimum precision value of 3 days (time between cures). The squared variance (S2) is 16,&#xD;
      since in a previous pilot study the variance between groups of cures was 4 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients aged between 14 and 40 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with stage I, II, or III onychocryptosis (Kline classification) or Mozena stage&#xD;
           I or IIa [7]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with onychocryptosis unilateral or bilateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy patients without previous systematic pathologies (diabetes, coagulation or&#xD;
           immunological disorders) who require and demand surgical treatment of their pathology in&#xD;
           the participating centers and willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were excluded if any of the following were present:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onychocyptosis with significant involvement of the hypertrophic labrum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe paronychias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to any of the substances used in the intervention or in the cures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 RANDOMIZATION Participants will be divided into two groups: a) experimental or&#xD;
      intervention group (hyaluronic acid cures) and b) control group (Betadine Gel cures) by&#xD;
      random assignment of sealed envelopes, which will be previously sealed in sequential order.&#xD;
      Both the patient and the researcher will be blinded to hide the group to which each patient&#xD;
      belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention of unilateral onychocryptosis, the partial matricectomy technique with&#xD;
      phenol / alcohol will be carried out. After removal of the affected spicule, basic manual&#xD;
      curettage will be performed with a Wolkmann or Martini spoon. Once the matrix has been&#xD;
      mechanically removed, the phenol will be applied. Phenol 88% in sterile capsules will be used&#xD;
      in the affected canal using a cotton swab for two applications of 30 seconds. Between these&#xD;
      two applications, alcohol will be used to dissolve the phenol present in the nail bed. After&#xD;
      the last application of phenol, the area will be washed again with alcohol. After the&#xD;
      intervention, a non-stick dressing and a semi-compression bandage will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A professional not present at the intervention (researcher 2) will proceed to carry out the&#xD;
      postoperative cures 48 hours after the intervention. The bandage will be removed, the area&#xD;
      will be washed with physiological saline and the drug will be applied according to the group&#xD;
      to which it belongs. In the intervention group, an ointment with hyaluronic acid (hyalucic ®)&#xD;
      will be used together with a non-stick dressing and a semi-compression bandage to prevent&#xD;
      bleeding. In the control group, Povidone Iodine Gel (Betadine Gel®) will be applied following&#xD;
      the same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successive cures will be carried out every 4 days by the healthcare professional, where both&#xD;
      groups will be washed with saline solution and a new dose of ointment will be applied as&#xD;
      appropriate in each group. The patient will heal the wound once a day following the same&#xD;
      procedure. Primary healing will be taken as the first variable of surgical results and the&#xD;
      definitive discharge time, which will be determined by researcher 2 (who was responsible for&#xD;
      the cures) and confirmed by a third evaluator, who will verify the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 OUTCOME MEASURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic characteristics of the participants will be age, sex, and onychocryptosis&#xD;
      classification according to Kline or Mozena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables to be used are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dressing application time (time recorded in min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of exudate (Very Abundant / Abundant / Slight / Absent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of inflammation, measured in mm with flexible tape around the eponychium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost (average costs for all materials used per patient in €),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analog scale pain (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of complications such as infection (noted at the end of treatment or dressing&#xD;
           change).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time elapsed until the primary healing and total healing of the wound (days).&#xD;
