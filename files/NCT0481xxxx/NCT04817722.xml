  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the role of intraoperative crystalloid&#xD;
      administration on postoperative hospital length of stay and on the incidence of previously&#xD;
      reported adverse events following thoracic surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of intraoperative crystalloid administration, when expressed as dose-response&#xD;
      curves, on the duration of hospital length of stay (hLOS) and on previously reported&#xD;
      incidences of surgical, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, other, and long-term AEs was&#xD;
      evaluated with F-ratio statistics or with Chi-square tests set at a more stringent P&lt;.01&#xD;
      value for significance to reduce the incidence of false discovery rates. Loglinear variance&#xD;
      was utilized to examine the role of postoperative hLOS residuals across the range of&#xD;
      intraoperative crystalloid administration. Multivariable analysis screened those previously&#xD;
      reported independent variables with P&lt;.1 with length of surgery, and the a posteriori&#xD;
      variable of interest, rate of intraoperative crystalloid administration on duration of hLOS&#xD;
      in a stepwise fashion with a maximum 5-fold R2 stopping rule, a cross validation technique&#xD;
      that chooses the best model. The multivariable analysis was repeated with a regional&#xD;
      instrumental variable based upon state residency to represent unmeasured confounders in this&#xD;
      population that may have an association with the outcome of interest. Variance inflation&#xD;
      factors calculations were conducted to determine the role of multicollinearity by the&#xD;
      independent variables of interest. Sample size calculations for multivariable analysis&#xD;
      require a minimum of 100 patients with â‰¥200 the preferred sample size. Recursive partitioning&#xD;
      with 5-fold cross-validation, a measure of internal model validation, examined administration&#xD;
      rates of intraoperative crystalloid administration by quantiles on hLOS and the role of&#xD;
      intraoperative transfusion of pRBCs on hLOS. Tests to support the likelihood of causality of&#xD;
      the intraoperative crystalloid administration on duration of hLOS was examined following&#xD;
      analysis of seven likelihood tests; published findings consistent with prior research,&#xD;
      biologic plausibility, dose-response relationship, strength of effect, and exclusions of&#xD;
      effect-cause, confounding, and bias. The statistical program, JMP 13.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,&#xD;
      NC) was utilized in this study.&#xD;
