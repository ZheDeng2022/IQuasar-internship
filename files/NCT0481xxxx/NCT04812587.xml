      This study aimed to determine whether a 12-week combined exercise intervention program with&#xD;
      extra emphasis on balance, muscle strength, and walking ability was designed to improve&#xD;
      functional fitness, balance, walking speed in community-dwelling older people.&#xD;

      1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedures are&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The process of the experiment (brief describe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The 30 participants of the experimental group will be recruited from the &quot;community&#xD;
           eldercare service&quot; activities, and this group will receive a 12-week combined exercise&#xD;
           intervention program with extra emphasis on balance, muscle strength, and walking&#xD;
           ability. The other 30 community-dwelling older people of the comparison group who have&#xD;
           been involved in a other regular exercise style will not receive our exercise&#xD;
           intervention. The comparison group only receives 2 times measurement at an interval of&#xD;
           12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects completed medical histories, exercise histories, and information on lifestyles&#xD;
           by questionnaire and physical examination before participation in the study to ensure&#xD;
           they were free from exclusion criteria. The baseline measurements will be conducted&#xD;
           before the exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The experimental group will receive a 12-week combined exercise intervention program&#xD;
           with extra emphasis on balance, muscle strength, and walking ability which involved two&#xD;
           2-hour sessions per week. The exercise program contained aerobic exercises, activities&#xD;
           of balance, coordination exercises, strength training, and walking training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After 12 weeks group exercise, the experimental group will receive the second&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
