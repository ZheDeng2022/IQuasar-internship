    <textblock>
      The study includes 2 parts:The first part (Phase Ia) is a single ascending dose (SAD) study&#xD;
      and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy volunteers. The second part (Phase Ib)&#xD;
      includes two randomised, Placebo-Controlled 28-day repeated dose studies for AD and RA&#xD;
      participants respectively, using defined concentrations of the topical cream based on the PK&#xD;
      and safety data in healthy volunteers in Phase Ia.&#xD;
