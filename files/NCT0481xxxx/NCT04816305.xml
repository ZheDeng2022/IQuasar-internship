  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate if the size effect of repetitive magnetic transcranial&#xD;
      stimulation in the paretic upper limb in patients after stroke is influenced by the&#xD;
      therapeutic decision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the patients and volunteers signed an informed consent form they will be classified and&#xD;
      randomized using a website (randomization.com) by a non-involved researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients and volunteers will be assigned to groups (arms) after being tried:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) rTMS-DIR: in which the patients will be submitted to a customized treatment with&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) based in neurophysiological assessments;&#xD;
      (ii) rTMS: patients will be submitted to standard treatment in the lesioned or non-lesioned&#xD;
      hemisphere based in neurophysiological assessments; (iii) rTMS sham: each patient will&#xD;
      receive a sham intervention that emits the same sound as the real stimulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, the patients will be submitted to 10 sessions for two weeks, five days a week&#xD;
      in which will receive the rTMS followed by 45 minutes of neurofunctional physiotherapy. All&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed before and after the 10 sessions.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Fugl Meyer assesment of paretic upper limb motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>10 sessions (5 days a week for two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl Meyer assesment is used to measure motor control recovery. It is a 226 point scoring system that includes the following sessions: range of motion, pain, sensation,motor function of upper and lower limbs, balance, coordination and velocity. We will apply only two sessions: upper limb motor function and coordination/velocity, these sessions totalize 66 points. Higher scores indicates better outcomes</description>

    <time_frame>10 sessions (5 days a week for two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Ashworth scale is a 6-point rating scale that is used to measure muscle tone and it will be used to determine the spasticity wrist flexor muscles in the affected hand by stroke. It evaluates the antagonist muscles that limits the force of agonist muscled during a intended motion.</description>

    <time_frame>10 sessions (5 days a week for two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale will determine the severity and disability level of the post-stroke patient; which consists of 15 items that assess the domains: level of consciousness, eye movements, visual field, facial movements, motor function and ataxia of upper and lower limbs, as well as sensitivity, language, presence of dysarthria and spatial neglect. Each domain punctuates a specific skill from 0 (zero) to 4 points that may vary until a maximum of 42 points.</description>

    <description>In all rTMS protocols the patient will remain seated in a comfortable chair with adjustable arms and head rests. Before the start of the conventional rTMS (rTMSc), the resting motor threshold (RMT) of the first dorsal interosseous muscle contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere will be determined. The RMT will be defined as the lowest RMT intensity necessary to produce a motor evoked potential amplitude greater than or equal to 50 µV in at least 5 out of 10 attempts.</description>
