  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a complicated skin condition. In fact, it represents many&#xD;
      different underlying problems. These include abnormalities in the skin barrier, the immune&#xD;
      system and the ability to handle different bacteria. Despite many recent gains in the&#xD;
      understanding of eczema, a lot needs to be learned. There is little evidence to select&#xD;
      between some of the older treatments that are available now. Even the newest targeted therapy&#xD;
      does not clear most patients' skin. In order to improve the understanding of eczema, how to&#xD;
      treat it now, and to enable discovery of new treatments, the investigators plan to enroll&#xD;
      patients into a large study at three centres in Canada (University of Toronto, McGill&#xD;
      University and University of British Columbia). The study is called the Canadian Atopic&#xD;
      Dermatitis Cohort for Translational Immunology and Imaging (CACTI). In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect data on how severe participants' eczema is and what treatments&#xD;
      they use. For participants who give permission, the investigators will collect blood and skin&#xD;
      biopsy samples to study the mechanisms underlying their disease. The investigators will test&#xD;
      to see which form of phototherapy (Broadband or Narrowband Ultraviolet B phototherapy) works&#xD;
      best for eczema in a randomized clinical trial. The investigators will also use advanced&#xD;
      imaging techniques to visualize the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial registry entry, including the description of the treatment arms and outcomes,&#xD;
      refer to the nested BROadband vs Narrowband photoTherapy for Eczema clinical trial.&#xD;
