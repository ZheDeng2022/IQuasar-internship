      This study is a prospective, two-arm, randomized phase II study of talazoparib versus&#xD;
      talazoparib plus atezolizumab in ER+ premeonopausal women with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      harboring HRD scar&#xD;
&#xD;
      1st line treatment: GnRH agonist + Aromatase Inhibitor(AI) + Palbociclib 28 days after the&#xD;
      last treatment of 1st line treatment, randomization for 2nd line treatment is conducte to arm&#xD;
      A(Talazoparib+Atezolizumab) and arm B(Talazoparib monotherapy)&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  AI treatment: D1~28 days. Take once a day. Prescribed according to local prescribe&#xD;
                guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GnRH agonist: At D1 for every cycle with 4 week (+3days) interval via subcutaneous&#xD;
                injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 days after the last treatment of 1st line treatment, randomization for 2nd line treatment&#xD;
      is conducte to arm A(Talazoparib+Atezolizumab) and arm B(Talazoparib monotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Talazoparib: Take orally once a day at the same time&#xD;
