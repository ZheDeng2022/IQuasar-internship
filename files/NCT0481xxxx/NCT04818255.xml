  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When dementia is caused by AD, we refer to it as dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DAT). The&#xD;
      greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and DAT is advancing age, but DAT is not a&#xD;
      normal part of aging. Studies have shown that changes in the brain happen before full&#xD;
      symptoms of DAT develop. These changes include a buildup of two proteins within the brain,&#xD;
      called amyloid and tau. The two goals of this study are&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) to determine whether patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia-Alzheimer's type&#xD;
      (DAT) are able to demonstrate decisional capacity to engage in PET amyloid and tau disclosure&#xD;
      after receiving education; and (2) to assess how patients and care partners react to PET&#xD;
      amyloid and tau biomarker disclosure.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants and care partners who demonstrate intact decisional capacity to engage in PET biomarker disclosure, and who wish to receive the participant's PET results will be provided with education, results, and recommendations for next steps and supportive resources (the intervention). After this intervention, participants will complete follow-up evaluations of mood and anxiety within one week and at six weeks post disclosure.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline (at consent session, lasting up to 120 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>This interactive interview involves an assessment of understanding, appreciation, rationale, and communication of a decision regarding participating or not participating in PET biomarker disclosure. During an education session in which information about PET disclosure is reviewed, participants are asked questions to determine how well they comprehend and appreciated risks and benefits of engaging in PET biomarker disclosure. They are provided with prompts/clarification as needed. Examiners subjectively score each response as correct or incorrect and utilize this information to determine whether participants are demonstrate decisional capacity for PET biomarker disclosure. Results are pass (disclosure decisional capacity intact) or fail (disclosure decisional capacity not intact). Therefore, we will measure the percent of individuals who are able to pass this measure.</description>

    <description>This 10-item subscale asks respondents to rate the extent to which they are experiencing positive (e.g., excited, inspired) emotions on a Likert-style scale ranging from '1 = Very Slightly or Not at All' to '5=Extremely.' Scores range from 10-50, with higher scores indicating higher positive emotions.</description>

    <description>This 10-item subscale asks respondents to rate the extent to which they are experiencing positive negative (e.g., distressed, ashamed) emotions on a Likert-style scale ranging from '1 = Very Slightly or Not at All' to '5=Extremely.' The scores range from 10-50, with higher scores indicating higher negative emotions.</description>

    <description>The SSCI-8 demonstrates strong reliability for the measurement of both internalized and enacted stigma perceived by individuals with chronic neurological conditions. Respondents complete 8 items about experiences of stigma, rated on a Likert-style scale from 1 = 'Never' to 5 = 'Always.'</description>

    <description>The SECD is a 6-item scale that measures perceived ability to self-manage the physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms associated with their chronic disease. Items are listed on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 = 'Not at all confident' to 10 = 'Totally confident'.</description>

    <description>Participants who demonstrated decisional capacity for and interest in disclosure (or whose care partner is able to do so) will receive the participant's personalized PET amyloid and tau biomarker status, as well as information about the meaning and clinical utility of this information and recommendations for next steps (e.g., discussing findings with his/her provider).</description>

    <intervention_name>PET Biomarker Disclosure</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants receive information about whether they currently have elevated or not-elevated amyloid and/or tau based on recent PET imaging conducted as part of an affiliated research study (no additional imaging is required for this project). Participants meet with a licensed clinical neuropsychologist to discuss their biomarker status, the meaning of this information, and potential next steps to consider based of their status. Participants receive written summaries of this information, as well as resources as deemed necessary or as requested.</description>
