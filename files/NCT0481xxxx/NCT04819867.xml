      Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of Propolis and Gluma&#xD;
      desensitizer on the management of Dentin Hypersensitivity Methods Patients with dentin&#xD;
      hypersensitivity exhibiting pain scores of at least '2' on the visual analog scale (VAS) were&#xD;
      included in the study. Patient's response to an air blast stimulus was noted on Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale and Schiff's scale in order to record the degree of hypersensitivity of teeth.&#xD;
      There were 80 teeth, 40 in each group. The baseline scores were obtained. Propolis and Gluma&#xD;
      desensitizer were randomly applied to each hypersensitive tooth. VAS scores and Schiff's&#xD;
      sensitivity score for air blast stimulus were then noted at baseline, immediate, after 1 week&#xD;
      and then after 1 month of application.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Dentin hypersensitivity is commonly characterized by a short sharp pain. This&#xD;
      pain is believed to arise from the dentinal tubules that are exposed particularly in response&#xD;
      to external stimuli such as evaporative, thermal, tactile or chemical forces.Pain caused by&#xD;
      dentin hypersensitivity hampers an individual's day to day activities which includes eating,&#xD;
      drinking and often breathing. Since patients do not perceive this as a severe problem they&#xD;
      usually do not seek professional treatment. They prefer over the counter products to reduce&#xD;
      the sensitivity when the severity increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrodynamic theory by Astron and Brannstorm is accepted most widely out of several theories.&#xD;
      According to him the flow of the dentinal fluid was dependent upon the mechanical, thermal,&#xD;
      evaporative, and osmotic stimuli. This flow in tubules can activate nerves along the entire&#xD;
      canal of the pulp causing pain. Therefore, closing the dentinal tubules is the key approach&#xD;
      in the management of dentin hypersensitivity. This can be done possibly by crystal&#xD;
      precipitation in the tubule. Various methods and agents are being used for its management for&#xD;
      instance laser therapy and fluorine preparations, strontium and zinc chlorides, potassium&#xD;
      oxalate and dental adhesives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gluma desensitizer is an aqueous solution which contains glutaraldehyde 5% and hydroxyethyl&#xD;
      methacrylate (HEMA) 35%. It has been found to be an effective desensitizing agent. It blocks&#xD;
      the dentinal tubules intrinsically, countering the mechanism of hydrodynamics that eventually&#xD;
      leads to dentin hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propolis is a naturally occurring resin. It is brown in colour. It is collected by honey bees&#xD;
      from exudates of plants and trees. With the secretions and wax it is modified in the&#xD;
      beehives. Honey bees use it to protect their hives and repair any opening or damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In homeopathic practices it is widely used as an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic agent.&#xD;
      Propolis is composed of resins 50-60%, waxes 30-40%, essential oils 5-10%, pollen 5% and&#xD;
      other micro elements like aluminium and calcium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dentistry, propolis is found to have multiple clinical uses. It can be used as a mouth&#xD;
      freshener in halitosis, as a mouthwash, a relief from denture stomatitis, to heal&#xD;
      ulcerations, cervical, dentinal, and root caries sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies that were performed in vitro have revealed that, propolis has a significant&#xD;
      effect on the reduction of dentin permeability. Studies comparing the desensitizing effect of&#xD;
      propolis with gluma desensitizer in-vivo are found to be very few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and settings A randomized, single blind clinical trial was&#xD;
      conducted in the department of Operative dentistry, Dr. Ishrat ul Ebad Khan Institute of Oral&#xD;
      Health Sciences, Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients aged 18- 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who had at least two teeth with dentin hypersensitivity, non carious cervical&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients exhibiting pain scores of â‰¥ 2 on visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teeth with fractures or cracks in the cervical areas of the teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical areas that are involved in extensive fillings, dentures or orthodontics&#xD;
           appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients having any psychological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients taking analgesics on daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria Failure to complete follow-up after undergoing initial treatment and&#xD;
      giving consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of collection of data Ethical approval Approval was granted by the Institutional&#xD;
      review board of Dow University of Health Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent All the study participants were informed in detail about the nature of the&#xD;
      research procedure, and a written consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and technique The sample size calculated was 80 teeth, 40 teeth per group (Group&#xD;
      A = Propolis, group B = Gluma) carried out using PASS v.11 to independent sample T test at&#xD;
      95% confidence interval and 80% power of test. Calculation was done on mean SD values&#xD;
      0.6+/-0.58 and 0.31+/-0.459 of propolis and gluma respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling technique used in this study was non probability purposive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration The experimental period of this study was one month. The desensitizing agents&#xD;
      were randomly applied to the dentin hypersensitive teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First the affected area was cleaned of any debris or plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolation of the affected tooth was done with the help of cotton rolls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth surfaces was dried with cotton pellet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30% ethanolic extract of propolis was applied on the dentin hypersensitive site by using&#xD;
           a bonding brush then was allowed to dry for 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gluma desensitizer was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care was taken that the desensitizing agents do not touch any other surface of the oral&#xD;
           mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instructions were then given to the patient to not to rinse, eat or drink for 30 minutes&#xD;
           after the application of the desensitizing agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further the patient was asked to avoid the usage of any other desensitizing agent during&#xD;
           this one month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaporative (air blast) sensitivity test was assessed by application of air from a triple&#xD;
      air dental syringe for 1-2 second at a distance of 1 cm from the isolated tooth surface, to&#xD;
      avoid desiccation of the dentin surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schiff's sensitivity scale, and visual analogue scale were used to assess dentine&#xD;
      hypersensitivity on air blast stimuli at baseline, immediate, after one week of application&#xD;
      and after one month of application of the desensitizing agent.&#xD;
