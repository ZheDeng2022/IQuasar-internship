    <textblock>
      Malaria represents a major public health concern in sub-Sahara Africa. Seasonal malaria&#xD;
      chemoprevention (SMC) is one of the largest preventive measures. It consists to administer&#xD;
      Amodiaquine+Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine to children aged 3-59 months on a monthly basis during&#xD;
      the peak malaria transmission season. Despite its implementation, the burden of malaria is&#xD;
      still very high in children under five years old in Burkina Faso. This raises questions about&#xD;
      other hidden factors that can negatively affect the effectiveness of SMC intervention. Huge&#xD;
      effort aiming at preventing human-vector contact were deployed such as the large-scale&#xD;
      distribution of insecticide treated bed nets. Healthy humans are only infected via mosquitos&#xD;
      if there are parasites reservoir around. Yet, there is no strategy aiming at protecting&#xD;
      healthy humans from parasites reservoir. Under these circumstances, multiples humans sharing&#xD;
      the same habitat could continually entertain the transmission cycle despite adequate existing&#xD;
      measures. This would obviously jeopardize the expected impact of the SMC and the global&#xD;
      effort to control the disease. In such context, we postulate that screening and treating&#xD;
      malaria SMC-children's roommates could greatly improve the impact of SMC intervention and&#xD;
      reduce malaria transmission in endemic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to improve the impact of SMC intervention in terms of reducing&#xD;
      malaria morbidity and mortality in children under five years. Primary objectives include&#xD;
      assessing whether SMC + children's roommates screening and treatment with&#xD;
      Dihydro-artemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPPQ) is more effective than current routine&#xD;
      implementation of SMC alone as well as the assessment of the tolerance and safety of AQSP and&#xD;
      DHAPPQ. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the impact of the new strategy on the&#xD;
      circulating parasite population in terms of selection of resistant strains and the assessment&#xD;
      of determinants such as adherence and acceptability of the strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study will be carried out in the Nanoro health district catchment area in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso. This will be a randomized superiority trial. The unit of randomization will be&#xD;
      the household and all eligible children from a household will be allocated to the same study&#xD;
      group to avoid confusion. Households with 3 - 59 months old children will be assigned to&#xD;
      either (i) control group (SMC alone) or (ii) intervention (SMC+ roommates screening with&#xD;
      standard HRP2-RDT and treatment if positive) or (iii) intervention (SMC+ roommates screening&#xD;
      with highly sensitive RDT and treatment if positive). The sample size will be 789 isolated&#xD;
      households per arm, i.e. around 1,578 children under CPS coverage and 2,630 roommates&#xD;
      expected. They will be followed-up for 24 months to fully cover two consecutive malaria&#xD;
      transmission seasons and then two SMC cycles. Children will be actively followed-up during&#xD;
      the malaria transmission seasons while in the dry seasons the followed-up will be passive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The project will respond to a major public health concern by providing evidence&#xD;
      of the efficacy of a new strategy which should necessarily complement the existing ones to&#xD;
      achieve best impact in malaria control and elimination. The project is lifesaving and could&#xD;
      be scaled up easily at country and regional level in case of promising results. In addition,&#xD;
      if successful, the project will reinforce the capacity of the IRSS/CRUN by offering training&#xD;
      opportunities to young researchers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria represents a major public health concern in sub-Sahara Africa. According to the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) nearly half of the world's population is exposed to malaria&#xD;
      infection causing 400 000 deaths yearly worldwide. In Burkina Faso like in most of sub-Sahara&#xD;
      Africa countries, malaria remains endemic with peaks during raining seasons. To reduce the&#xD;
      burden of the disease in the country, Burkina Faso has subscribed to the Roll Back Malaria&#xD;
      initiative and adopted several malaria control measures including the use of&#xD;
      artemisininin-based combination therapies as first line treatment since 2005, the&#xD;
      intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women, the wide-scale distribution of&#xD;
      long-lasting insecticide treated net, and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) for children&#xD;
      under five years old. However, despite the implementation of these multiple interventions,&#xD;
      Burkina Faso is ranked among the top 10 countries carrying the highest malaria burden. For&#xD;
      instance, in 2018, over 10 million clinical episodes and 4294 deaths were reported in the&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In such context, new strategies to complement the existing ones or to improve their impact&#xD;
      are urgently needed in order to reduce malaria transmission. The project we propose aims at&#xD;
      improving the impact of Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) intervention to achieve best&#xD;
      impact in malaria control and elimination. SMC is one of the largest and reliable malaria&#xD;
      preventive measures recommended by WHO and is known to reduce malaria morbidity by 30 to 83%.&#xD;
      It involves the administration of antimalarial drugs (Amodiaquine+Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine -&#xD;
      AQSP) to children aged 3-59 months on a monthly basis during the high transmission season. In&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, SMC is implemented nationally from July to October each year by the NMCP with&#xD;
      the support of its technical and financial partners such as Global Fund, WHO, Malaria&#xD;
      Consortium, PMI, UNICEFâ€¦.). SMC was firstly implemented in 2014 in 6 of the 70 sanitary&#xD;
      districts of the country. Few years later almost national wide coverage (except in&#xD;
      Ouagadougou i.e. 60 over 70) was reached in 2018 and the intervention was adequately&#xD;
      delivered by community health workers. Since the adoption of this strategy, data assessing&#xD;
      the real-life impact of this intervention in the country are rare. In 2018, Druetz et al&#xD;
      reported a protective effect of 62% highlighting the potential of this intervention for&#xD;
      malaria control in Burkina Faso though this protective effect remains far below the highest&#xD;
      threshold of 83% reduction of malaria incidence expected from SMC intervention. We anticipate&#xD;
      that holding SMC campaigns in the context of the Covid-19 combined with the fact that some&#xD;
      parts of the country are prone to insecurity may be challenging. However, it is important to&#xD;
      stress that the year 2020 SMC campaign has been fully implemented in the study area without&#xD;
      any disturbance related to the Covid and/or security issue. In addition, the study area,&#xD;
      Nanoro is located at 85 km from Ouagadougou the capital city in the Central West Region of&#xD;
      Burkina Faso where we have not experienced any particular security issues so far. With&#xD;
      respect to research activities, the CRUN has no records of setbacks in fulfilling such&#xD;
      activities due to security issues. All the research activities initiated before the&#xD;
      insecurity onset have continued uninterrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the burden of malaria in children under five years old suggests that the&#xD;
      expected impact of this promising intervention is not achieved. Indeed, children under five&#xD;
      years old represented the most affected population accounting for about 90% of malaria cases.&#xD;
      RDT confirmed malaria cases in the country moved from 1 219 975 cases in 2016 to 1 487 954,&#xD;
      and to 1 509 931, in 2017, and 2018 respectively. In view of the actual trend it becomes&#xD;
      obvious that despite the implementation of this strategy, the burden of the disease and&#xD;
      associated mortality is still very high in children under five years old in Burkina Faso,&#xD;
      confirming that the expected impact from this intervention is not achieved. This raises&#xD;
      questions about other hidden factors that can negatively affect the effectiveness of SMC&#xD;
      intervention. At the same time, huge effort aiming at preventing human-vector contact were&#xD;
      deployed such as the large-scale distribution of insecticide treated bed nets (LLIN). The&#xD;
      latter are distributed on the basis of two individuals per unit. However, while most of the&#xD;
      bedroom in rural setting in Burkina Faso are not adequate for the fixation of several LLIN,&#xD;
      more than two individuals per room is commonly observed. In addition, the frequent mosquito&#xD;
      bites before sleeping time and changing mosquito behavior becoming more aggressive before and&#xD;
      after sleeping time is of concern. The latter could explain a persisting malaria transmission&#xD;
      within a relatively close environment despite full coverage in LLIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, with regard to the infestation cycle, healthy humans are only infected via&#xD;
      mosquitos if there are parasites reservoir (symptomatic and asymptomatic careers including&#xD;
      sub-patent parasitaemia) around. Yet, there is no strategy aiming at protecting healthy&#xD;
      humans from parasites reservoir. Under these circumstances, multiples humans sharing the same&#xD;
      habitat (room, household) could continually entertain the transmission cycle despite adequate&#xD;
      existing measures such as the use of LLIN. For instance, children under SMC coverage live&#xD;
      closely with their family members e.g. mother, father, siblings and other relatives, who are&#xD;
      not targeted by any specific interventions. According to the Nanoro health demographic&#xD;
      surveillance system, an average of 3 inhabitants per household was observed. Published&#xD;
      literature on sleeping behavior reported that children mostly sleep with their mother or with&#xD;
      mother + sibling. Attempts to improve the impact of SMC intervention includes its extension&#xD;
      to children under ten years old which showed promising results in Senegal. However, parents&#xD;
      and elder siblings (over ten) not covered by the SMC (implemented either in under 5 or&#xD;
      extended to under 10) sharing the same habitat could be parasites reservoir infecting&#xD;
      continually the vulnerable group under SMC coverage. This is particularly important in a&#xD;
      context of low coverage and compliance to ITN. Indeed, according to the household survey&#xD;
      results in 2018 from the word malaria report, 54.5% of the population in Burkina Faso had&#xD;
      access to ITN while only 44.1 had slept under ITN last night. This phenomenon of continual&#xD;
      infestation of children from parents and elder siblings would obviously jeopardize the&#xD;
      expected impact of the SMC intervention and the global effort to control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it's obvious that the presence of parasites reservoir within the community&#xD;
      represents a huge threat for malaria control and elimination but the detection of the&#xD;
      reservoir remains challenging given the low sensitivity of routine RDT for the detection of&#xD;
      low and sub patent parasitemia. Evidence of the contribution of sub-patents infections to the&#xD;
      sustainability of the transmission was reported. Highly sensitive RDT were developed for that&#xD;
      purpose but their use is only reserved for research. As they offer the opportunity to pick up&#xD;
      subclinical infections missed by routine RDT that potentially have a greater impact on&#xD;
      transmission, estimation of the contribution of sub clinical infections (though the use of&#xD;
      highly sensitive RDT) is necessary for a good assessment of the impact of this new&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, drug pressure, especially in wide scale community-based intervention such as SMC&#xD;
      could lead to a selection of less sensitive mutant strains that could compromise the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention in a long-term period. Therefore, sustainability of any&#xD;
      intervention relies on its selection pressure on parasite population which need to be closely&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these aspects underlie the idea of this project which stands on the assumption that&#xD;
      screening and treating (if positive) malaria SMC-children's roommates could greatly improve&#xD;
      the impact of SMC intervention and reduce malaria transmission in endemic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multidisciplinary collaborative research involving key stakeholders such as the&#xD;
      WorldWide Antimalaria Resistance Network (WWARN) and policy makers such as the National&#xD;
      Malaria Control Program (NMCP). The involvement of the NMCP will facilitate the rapid&#xD;
      translation of the project findings into policy. In case of promising results, the NMCP will&#xD;
      endorse the leadership of advocating with its financial and technical partners on the need to&#xD;
      change the policy with the adoption and extension of this new strategy at national level. To&#xD;
      better achieve this goal, a large-scale dissemination workshop will be organized by the NMCP&#xD;
      to share the project findings. This workshop will bring together all key stakeholders of&#xD;
      malaria policy decision making in Burkina Faso involving the WHO, UNICEF, USAID, WAHO, etc.&#xD;
      The project could also be scaled up easily at regional level (through the regional Roll Back&#xD;
      Malaria network) especially in other Sahelian countries with similar malaria epidemiological&#xD;
      profile and where SMC is also implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will respond to a major public health concern by providing evidence of&#xD;
      the efficacy of a new strategy which should necessarily complement the existing ones to&#xD;
      achieve best impact in malaria control and elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A superiority of the intervention over the routine implementation of SMC alone is expected.&#xD;
      By preventing malaria transmission within a relatively closed environment (shared rooms), the&#xD;
      project is life-saving and is in line with global effort toward the achievement of SDG3 by&#xD;
      horizon 2030. Therefore, the project will greatly contribute to the reduction of malaria&#xD;
      burden in terms of reduction of its morbidity and mortality in Burkina Faso. In addition, the&#xD;
      project will also contribute indirectly to the economic development by reducing the burden of&#xD;
      malaria, which constitute huge threats to economic development in the country. Moreover, it&#xD;
      will have a significant impact at the individual and community levels through, reduced&#xD;
      attendance in education; reduced working days lost due to the disease; reduced individual,&#xD;
      household, and community incomes because of the costs allocated to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By relying on existing strategy (SMC), if successful, the project could be scaled up easily&#xD;
      at country and regional level especially for other Sahelian countries with similar malaria&#xD;
      transmission profile and where SMC is implemented as well such as Mali, Niger, Mauritania,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, if successful, the project will strengthen the capacity of IRSS/CRUN by offering&#xD;
      training opportunities to young researchers as one PhD and two M.Sc. degrees are expected by&#xD;
      the end of this project. Finally, as a collaborative project, its implementation will&#xD;
      strengthen the links between the IRSS/CRUN and collaborating partners namely the NMCP and the&#xD;
      WWARN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of all these aspects, it is obvious that at the end of this study, we will have not&#xD;
      only collected data to answer the specific aims of the project, but will have also created a&#xD;
      strong and sustainable research platform able to answer any relevant health research problem&#xD;
      in the Greater Sahel in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized superiority trial in which children will be followed-up for two&#xD;
      years. The unit of randomization will be the household and all eligible children from a&#xD;
      household will be allocated to the same study group to avoid confusion. The household will be&#xD;
      defined as follow: one of several individuals living together within a shared habitat (house)&#xD;
      and sharing basic needs, especially kitchen, and which recognizes the authority of a single&#xD;
      person regardless of his/her gender. Households with 3 - 59 months old children with at least&#xD;
      one under 35 months of age living within the Nanoro Health and Demographic Surveillance&#xD;
      System (HDSS) catchment area will be assigned to either (i) control group (SMC alone) or (ii)&#xD;
      intervention (SMC+ roommates screening with standard HRP2-RDT and treatment if positive)&#xD;
      (iii) intervention (SMC+ roommates screening with highly sensitive RDT and treatment if&#xD;
      positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be children under SMC coverage i.e. aged 3-59 months and their&#xD;
      roommates (individual of all years) living within the Nanoro HDSS catchment area. Children&#xD;
      will be followed-up for 24 months to fully cover two consecutive malaria transmission seasons&#xD;
      and then two SMC cycles. Children who leave the bracket covered by the CPS, i.e. whose age&#xD;
      exceeds 59 months during the follow-up will subsequently be considered as roommates. Before&#xD;
      the implementation of the year 1 first SMC round, a list of potential eligible households&#xD;
      will be drawn from the HDSS database. Home visits will be performed to confirm the presence&#xD;
      of the children and to assess willingness of the parents/guardians to participate in the&#xD;
      study as well as willingness of all the roommates to be screened and treated. Households with&#xD;
      absent children or children whose parents/guardians and roommates are not willing to&#xD;
      participate, will be replaced by other eligible households from the list. Enrolment of study&#xD;
      participants will be made in parallel with the SMC first round after confirmation of the&#xD;
      administration of the first dose of the SMC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to demonstrate that SMC + roommates screening (through ultra-sensible RDT or&#xD;
      classic RDT) and treatment arm is superior to the SMC alone arm in reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      malaria after 1 year. The sample size is estimated for testing difference between two malaria&#xD;
      incidence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimation is performed under the assumption that the average number of malaria episode&#xD;
      per child aged between 3-59 months per year since the implementation of Seasonal Malaria&#xD;
      Chemoprevention (SMC) in Nanoro health district varied between 1.38 and 1.76 (Annual&#xD;
      statistic yearly book, 2016, 2017 and 2018). Sample size of 236 in each arm will give at&#xD;
      least 80% to detect 20% decrease in the incidence of malaria from a baseline incidence rate&#xD;
      in SMC arm between 1.5- 2.0 malaria cases per year, assuming one-sided test with significance&#xD;
      level of 0.025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for 10% study, drop-out rate for any reason, the sample size will increase to 260&#xD;
      in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the final estimated sample size for this study is 780 households (with at least&#xD;
      one child aged between 3-59 months). Assuming that each household will have an average of 2&#xD;
      children under SMC coverage, about 1560 children under SMC coverage are expected. The&#xD;
      expected number of roommates is estimated at about 2600 (260x2x5) under the assumption that&#xD;
      each household from the 2 interventions arms will have an average of 5 roommates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed with R software using the appropriate tests depending on the variables.&#xD;
      Adherence of treatment and acceptability of the strategy (focus group discussion) will be&#xD;
      assessed qualitatively.&#xD;
