    <textblock>
      Invesigators plan to conduct a 12-week longitudinal cohort study of 30 subjects with&#xD;
      calcaneal apophysitis. Subjects will be included if they are between 7-17 years-old, have&#xD;
      experienced an insidious onset of heel pain with running or jumping activities, and have no&#xD;
      underlying diagnosis predisposing heel pain and no other injury that limits their ability to&#xD;
      run and jump. Parents of subjects will be invited to participate by completing questionnaires&#xD;
      related to their perspective of their child's symptoms, physical activity level, quality of&#xD;
      life, and their satisfaction with the treatment protocol. Subjects will be asked to attend 4&#xD;
      monthly sessions consisting of evaluation and treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will recruit 30 subjects between ages 7-17 with heel pain and also invite their&#xD;
      parent/guardian to participate in this research study. Participants will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks and 12-weeks. Data collections at each assessment visit will be&#xD;
      identical except for the baseline visit. The baseline evaluation will consist of&#xD;
      questionnaires related to past medical history in addition to all other procedures. All&#xD;
      evaluations will include patient-reported outcome measures, clinical measures, and&#xD;
      measurement of tendon structure, mechanical properties, and muscle-tendon function Treatment&#xD;
      sessions will occur immediately following the evaluation sessions (4 total). During treatment&#xD;
      sessions, participants will be provided with education, therapeutic exercise instruction, and&#xD;
      discussion of their training diary and home exercise program. Treatment sessions will last&#xD;
      30-45 minutes. In addition to the 4 in-person treatment sessions, virtual visits will take&#xD;
      place 2 weeks in between each in-person visits, (one virtual visit maximum every 4 weeks) as&#xD;
      needed. Virtual visits will be no longer than 30 minutes to discuss patient needs.&#xD;

    <measure>Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time with evaluations at baseline, 2-weeks, 4-weeks, 6-weeks, 8-weeks,10-weeks and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VISA-A was specifically designed to assess symptom severity in individuals with Achilles tendinopathy and has demonstrated validity, reliability and responsiveness. Scores range from 0-100, where a higher score indicates less pain and symptoms with activity. This outcome measure has been used in previous trials with adolescents.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Pain Interference Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time with evaluations at baseline, 2-weeks, 4-weeks, 6-weeks, 8-weeks,10-weeks and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Pain Interference Scale assesses symptom severity and pain with daily activity. Raw scores range from 8-40, where lower scores indicate less pain interference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tendon Structure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time with evaluations at baseline, 2-weeks, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound images will be obtained using the LOGIQ e Ultrasound (GE Healthcare) system using a wide-band linear array probe (5.0-13.0 MHz). The subject will be prone lying with the hips and knees straight and the ankles hanging outside the treatment table. Three longitudinal images where the calcaneal insertion and as much of the tendon is visible will be saved. Three extended field of view images of the tendon between the insertion to the calcaneus and the start of the soleus muscle will be saved. Longitudinal and cross-sectional images will be taken at the area of tenderness to palpation on the injured side and at the same position on the contralateral side. These images will be used to evaluate tendon thickening, cross-sectional area, and the occurrence of hypoechoic areas.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tendon Mechanical Properties</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time with evaluations at baseline, 2-weeks, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be examined using continuous shear wave elastography (cSWE). This is a non-invasive technique that uses a low-amplitude vibration to mechanically perturbate the tendon. The resultant shear wave is imaged using ultrasound. The area of maximum tendon pathology will be identified using palpation and B mode ultrasound imaging. The distance from calcaneal insertion to this area will be measured to allow for identification of a comparable location on the asymptomatic side as well as to ensure the same area is assessed at each follow-up. The ultrasound probe for cSWE will be placed at this location and the actuator will be placed just proximal to the ultrasound probe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle-Tendon Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time with evaluations at baseline, 2-weeks, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle-tendon function will be assessed by a functional test battery including a single-leg counter movement jump (CMJ), a single-leg drop CMJ, single-leg hopping, and the heel-rise endurance test. For jump tests, the jump height for three trials will be recorded using a light mat (MuscleLab®, Ergotest Innovations, Porsgrunn, Norway). The drop CMJ jump is performed on single leg by jumping from a 20cm high box, landing, and immediately jumping up for maximum height. Hopping is similar or jumping rope on one foot; two trials of 20 hops will be recorded using a light mat to calculate hop frequency, average height, and plyometric quotient (flight time / contact time). The heel-rise endurance test is a single-leg standing heel-rise test. The heel-rise test for endurance is performed on one leg at a time with the participant standing on a box with an incline of 10°. A metronome is used to maintain the frequency of 30 heel-rises per minute.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Average compliance rate for each group over first year of study recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance will be tracked using training diaries. The number of training diaries and prescribed exercise sessions completed, and days in adherence with activity modification guidelines will be recorded. Compliance rates will be reported as a percentage, relative to the participants duration of participation in the study.</description>
