  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of Nimenrix in&#xD;
      infants at 3 months of age, followed by a second dose at 12 months of age. Current posology&#xD;
      allows for 2 doses of Nimenrix before 6 months of age, where the first dose is administered&#xD;
      from 6 weeks onwards with a second dose at least 2 months later, with a booster at 12 months;&#xD;
      and in infants from 6 months of age, a single dose at 6 months, with a booster dose at 12&#xD;
      months. This study will provide valuable immunogenicity and safety data for a single dose in&#xD;
      healthy infants &lt;6 months of age, followed by the booster at 12 months&#xD;
