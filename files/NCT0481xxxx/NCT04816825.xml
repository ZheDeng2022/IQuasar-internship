      Study title Feasibility and effectiveness of a home monitored rehabilitation intervention&#xD;
      using an exergaming approach in COPD patients - a randomized, controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common chronic&#xD;
      disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation caused by significant exposure to&#xD;
      noxious particles or gases, particularly cigarette smoking. In Sweden the prevalence of COPD&#xD;
      is approximately 8% and the annual estimated cost for society of 9.1 billion SEK. Improving&#xD;
      exercise capacity and physical activity levels are important goals in management of patients&#xD;
      with COPD and are strong determinants of positive outcomes, including increased quality of&#xD;
      life. Major barrier for rehabilitation recommendations is the limited access and adherence to&#xD;
      organized center-based exercise programs. Major barriers related to the side of health care&#xD;
      organization are budgets and infrastructure and the limitation in time of the programs. From&#xD;
      patient's perspective major barriers exist, like distance, and lack of transport to the unit,&#xD;
      also in relation to the frequency of the program, which is commonly two times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question and objectives The primary objective of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      whether home-based telemonitored supervised exercise programs using an exergaming approach&#xD;
      will be associated to improved physical fitness, measured with the (1-minute sit-to-stand&#xD;
      test, 1-MSTST) compared to the ordinary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether a home-based exergaming program is associated with improved&#xD;
           health-related quality of life, exercise capacity, physical activity levels and body&#xD;
           composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate if the home-based exergaming program is associated with less&#xD;
           exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate if the home-based exergaming program is associated with improved health&#xD;
           care utilization and/or less hospitalization from all causes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is an open label , randomized controlled clinical study. The study takes&#xD;
      place at the COPD-center at Sahlgrenska University hospital. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the use of the ALKIT exergaming tool in combination with telemonitored supervision by&#xD;
      a physiotherapist or ordinary care without this system at their first visit. A total of 92&#xD;
      subjects will be included in the study, 46 in every arm. The intervention will include&#xD;
      exergames performed 3 times a week for 12 weeks, consistent with the current recommendations.&#xD;
      Pre-and post-intervention tests will be performed and subjects in both groups will be&#xD;
      assessed. The tests include: 1-minute sit-to-stand test, 6-minute walk test, and timed-up and&#xD;
      go. Two self- assessed questionnaires will be filled in: COPD Assessment Test and EQ5D-5L.&#xD;
      Subjects will be also measured for quadriceps muscle strength, shoulder flexion and body&#xD;
      composition. Additionally, physical activity level will be assessed by outcomes of pedometer&#xD;
      worn over a week. Moreover, exacerbations and health care utilization will be measured.&#xD;
      Users' perception of the exergaming program will be also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and study size The study will include a total of 92 subjects, 46 in the&#xD;
      intervention- and 46 in the control arm. For each participant, the total study participation&#xD;
      time will be 12 weeks. A randomization list will be produced with random assignment of&#xD;
      treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1&#xD;

The total score ranges 5-25 and higher score indicates worse health condition. The second part of EQ5D-5L, the EQ VAS (Visual Analog Score) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale (0-100), where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' (100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (0). This part will be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
