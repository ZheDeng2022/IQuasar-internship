        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese males aged &gt;=20 and &lt;40 years at the signing of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects whose body mass index (BMI) &gt;=18.5 and &lt;25.0 kg/m2 at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have no abnormal findings in the physical examination, vital signs, and&#xD;
             standard 12-lead ECG in the screening test and the test on the day of admission and&#xD;
             the test obtained prior to administration of the investigational drug, and whose&#xD;
             clinical test results are within the standard values of the clinical trial site in the&#xD;
             screening test and the test on the day of admission. However, if who showed abnormal&#xD;
             findings but not clinically significant, they can be enrolled in clinical trials based&#xD;
             on comprehensive consideration of medical viewpoints by the principal investigator(s)&#xD;
             or subinvestigator(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who understand, and have willingness and ability to read and sign, the&#xD;
             informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received a substance labeled with a radioisotope within the last 12&#xD;
             months prior to dosing of the investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been exposed to a large amount of radiation for therapeutic or&#xD;
             diagnostic reasons (CT scan, stomach X-ray, PET scan etc.) within the last 12 months&#xD;
             prior to dosing of the investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Occupationally exposed worker in the last 12 months prior to dosing of the&#xD;
             investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had 3 days or less that one or more spontaneous defecations&#xD;
             (defecation that occurs without laxatives, enemas, disimpaction) within 7 days before&#xD;
             consent is obtained and during the 7 days until on the day of admission. Those who&#xD;
             have diarrhea during the 7 days until on the day of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any disease or surgery which have impact on investigational drug absorption&#xD;
             such as gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy or bowel resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply&#xD;
