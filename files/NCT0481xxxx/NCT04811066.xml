  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study seeks to examine the efficacy of multi-session transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex in people with Parkinson's disease on&#xD;
      sequential motor learning performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is characterised by deficits of motor control triggered by impaired basal&#xD;
      ganglia function, such as bradykinesia and tremor. Beyond the visibly recognisable motor&#xD;
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the ability to learn a sequence of movements is also&#xD;
      compromised and poses a significant barrier to effective rehabilitation. In healthy&#xD;
      individuals, transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex&#xD;
      during motor task practice has been shown to significantly improve motor learning compared to&#xD;
      placebo conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study seeks to examine the effect of multi-session transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex in people with Parkinson's disease on&#xD;
      sequential motor learning performance. Participants will be required to attend eight&#xD;
      laboratory sessions, comprising five intervention and three assessment sessions and will be&#xD;
      tested on their ability to learn a 16-digit finger tapping sequence with their right hand.&#xD;
      Sessions one to five will form the intervention and will be performed at the same time on&#xD;
      consecutive days (i.e. mon-fri). In addition, session one will double as a baseline&#xD;
      assessment and intervention session. Assessments sessions will be performed once before the&#xD;
      intervention (session one), and three times following the intervention on day three, one&#xD;
      week, and four weeks post intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Transcranial electrical stimulation device. A weak direct electrical current, up to 2 mA, is passed between two electrodes placed on the scalp. Electrodes are housed in 35 cm2 sponges saturated with 4 ml of saline solution (0.9 % NaCl) per side, per pad.&#xD;
Stimulation is phased in with a 30-second ramp up of the electrical current to the specified stimulation parameters. Following the specified stimulation period, the current is phased-out with a ramp down of the current. For sham stimulation, the ramp-up and ramp-down periods are retained, but stimulation is switched off during the specified stimulation period.</description>
