  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center prospective clinical study is to verify the algorithm of mCVI® in 4&#xD;
      different lighting conditions to accurately capture pulse rate and respiratory rate in 10&#xD;
      healthy subjects in comparison to commercially-available Masimo pulse oximeter devices. This&#xD;
      is a non significant risk device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective clinical study the mCVI® device is a mobile application used to simply&#xD;
      verify the algorithm when the mobile video reads a patients pulse rate and respiratory rate&#xD;
      while spontaneously breathing. There is no facial recognition technology. There is no&#xD;
      immediate feedback given to the research team to act upon or provide for further clinical&#xD;
      care decisions. In real time, the mCVI® device will be compared to two commercially-available&#xD;
      Masimo pulse oximeter devices in a single visit.&#xD;
