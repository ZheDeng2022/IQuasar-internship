      Point-of-care (POC) tests for HIV are easy to use, rapid and provide accurate results while&#xD;
      the patient is still in-front of a healthcare provider (HCP). Currently only blood-based POC&#xD;
      tests for HIV are licensed for use in Canada. The OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody&#xD;
      Test is a POC test developed by OraSure Technologies, Inc. to detect HIV antibodies in oral&#xD;
      fluid and fingerstick blood samples. As this device is very similar to the OraQuick HIV&#xD;
      Self-Test, Health Canada requires evidence that HCPs can successfully perform the POC version&#xD;
      of the OraQuick test in addition to performance of the self test version by intended users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves a minimum of 9 HCPs and 600 Patients at clinic sites in Toronto and&#xD;
      Ottawa (Ontario), Montreal (Quebec) and Edmonton (Alberta). It will assess the OraQuick&#xD;
      ADVANCE® Test's simplicity and accuracy in the hands of HCPs who have never used this Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess performance, using only the test kit instructions for use, HCPs will collect and&#xD;
      test oral fluid and fingerstick blood samples from patients with the OraQuick ADVANCE® Test&#xD;
      and will then read and interpret those results. Results of the OraQuick ADVANCE® Test will be&#xD;
      compared with results of a venous blood sample collected from each patient and tested with a&#xD;
      usual, licensed, laboratory test method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess usability, HCPs will interpret various mock device test results and respond to a&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine if the test instructions for use are clear and simple, that they&#xD;
      are aware of test requirements and limitations and provide opinions on the ease of use of the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final report of study results will be provided to the Test manufacturer for inclusion in&#xD;
      the Health Canada license application process.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 2018, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) noted 2,242 new HIV infections&#xD;
      (incidence rate of 6 per 100,000 people) representing a slight increase from 2016 estimates.&#xD;
      For the same period, PHAC estimated there were 62,050 Canadians living with HIV (prevalence&#xD;
      rate 167 per 100,000) and about 18,700 Canadians were missed throughout the HIV care&#xD;
      continuum, including 8,300 who are living with HIV but were undiagnosed. This represents&#xD;
      about 13% of Canadians living with HIV but are unaware of their status and not in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As testing is the entry point to HIV care, it is likely that those who are undiagnosed are&#xD;
      not engaging in HIV testing services. PHAC's &quot;Pan-Canadian Framework for Action &quot; sets out an&#xD;
      overarching and comprehensive approach to address sexually transmitted and blood-borne&#xD;
      infections including HIV, and is composed of 26 opportunities for action, including enhancing&#xD;
      testing. Testing opportunities which include elimination of barriers to access testing and&#xD;
      normalization of testing through primary healthcare providers (HCPs), strategies that use&#xD;
      community-based services and HIV self-testing could help Canada reach the undiagnosed.&#xD;
      However, testing by HCPs within clinical settings remains the foundation to Canadian HIV care&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point-of-care (POC) tests for HIV may have substantial utility for increased identification&#xD;
      of HIV-infected individuals through their relative ease of use and portability, as well as&#xD;
      their ability to deliver rapid, actionable results while the HCP still has access to the&#xD;
      patient. OraSure Technologies, Inc. has developed a POC test, the OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2&#xD;
      Rapid Antibody Test, which requires no additional instrumentation and can be used by HCPs in&#xD;
      multiple near patient settings. The OraQuick ADVANCE® Test is a single-use, visually read,&#xD;
      qualitative, in vitro lateral flow immunoassay to detect antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 in&#xD;
      oral fluid and fingerstick blood. The Test package includes a specific step-by-step&#xD;
      instructions, the device, testing buffer solution and a device stand. It is available in the&#xD;
      United States (FDA approved) but is not currently approved for use in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently only blood-based POC tests for HIV are licensed for use in Canada. Having a&#xD;
      licensed, oral-fluid test in addition to blood-based tests available for use in Canada&#xD;
      provides another option to increase the uptake of HIV testing, and further increase the&#xD;
      potential of reaching undiagnosed individuals living with HIV in Canada. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that interest and acceptability of testing with oral fluid is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this near patient study is to demonstrate the simplicity and accuracy of the&#xD;
      OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test when used by untrained HCPs in a clinical&#xD;
      setting. A secondary objective includes the ability of HCPs to correctly interpret a variety&#xD;
      of contrived (mock) test device results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The OraQuickADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test as performed by untrained HCPs&#xD;
      will meet or exceed the accuracy, usability and label comprehension requirements from Health&#xD;
      Canada for license as a Class IV in vitro diagnostic device for Canadian market entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed around the requirements set out in the Health Canada Guidance&#xD;
      Document: &quot;Guidance for Manufacturers of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Rapid Diagnostic&#xD;
      Tests (RDT's) for Use at Point of Care or Self Testing, 2017&quot;. It is a blinded, controlled&#xD;
      study to evaluate the ability of HCPs to perform and interpret the results of the OraQuick&#xD;
      ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol involves collection of oral fluid and fingerstick whole blood from&#xD;
      approximately 600 patients to test with the OraQuick ADVANCE® Test device. Testing will be&#xD;
      conducted by HCPs (blinded to patient's history and HIV diagnosis) in clinical settings. All&#xD;
      patient participants will also have a venous blood sample collected (prior to fingerstick and&#xD;
      oral fluid collection) for testing of plasma at a central laboratory with a 4th generation&#xD;
      HIV Ag/Ab EIA (licensed for use in Canada) and positives will be confirmed using a standard&#xD;
      HIV testing algorithm in place at the respective central laboratories. Results from the&#xD;
      OraQuick ADVANCE® Test will be compared to results from the blood based 4th generation EIA.&#xD;
      The sensitivity and specificity of the test result will be calculated relative to the&#xD;
      confirmatory test process, where applicable. HCP qualification and assessment of the ease of&#xD;
      device use will be evaluated. HCPs will also read and interpret 20 contrived (mock) device&#xD;
      results in order to assess their ability to correctly interpret 5 potential test results,&#xD;
      i.e. strong positive, weak positive, negative, invalid with no control and no test line, and&#xD;
      invalid with no control and a positive test line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will provide descriptive statistics for subject and HCP parameters. Test&#xD;
      results will be compared to a Health Canada licensed 4th generation EIA test and&#xD;
      investigators will calculate positive and negative percent agreement (with two-sided 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval for both) for each matrix (fingerstick and oral fluid) separately. For&#xD;
      mock device interpretation, agreement of the OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test&#xD;
      results with each sample type reactivity will be calculated overall and for each HCP&#xD;
      operator. Safety will be assessed by the incidence of reported adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population requirements published by Health Canada for near patient studies of&#xD;
      untrained HCP testers stipulates that the prospective study include: A minimum of 3 POC sites&#xD;
      (different geographic locations), a minimum of 9 HCPs, 200 known HIV positive individuals and&#xD;
      400 individuals whose HIV status is unknown including 200 individuals at high risk of HIV&#xD;
      infection (e.g. intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, etc.). Self-reported&#xD;
      practices or behaviour will be used to define those at high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The OraQuickADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test as performed by untrained HCPs&#xD;
      will meet or exceed the accuracy, usability and label comprehension requirements from Health&#xD;
      Canada for license as a Class IV in vitro diagnostic device for Canadian market entry.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      This study was designed around the requirements set out in the Health Canada Guidance&#xD;
      Document: &quot;Guidance for Manufacturers of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Rapid Diagnostic&#xD;
      Tests (RDT's) for Use at Point of Care or Self Testing, 2017&quot;. It is a blinded, controlled&#xD;
      study to evaluate the ability of HCPs to perform and interpret the results of the OraQuick&#xD;
      ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol involves collection of oral fluid and fingerstick whole blood from&#xD;
      approximately 600 patients to test with the OraQuick ADVANCE® Test device. Testing will be&#xD;
      conducted by HCPs (blinded to patient's history and HIV diagnosis) in clinical settings. All&#xD;

      The study population requirements published by Health Canada for near patient studies of&#xD;
      untrained HCP testers stipulates that the prospective study include: A minimum of 3 POC sites&#xD;
      (different geographic locations), a minimum of 9 HCPs, 200 known HIV positive individuals and&#xD;
      400 individuals whose HIV status is unknown including 200 individuals at high risk of HIV&#xD;
      infection (e.g. intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, etc.). Self-reported&#xD;
      practices or behaviour will be used to define those at high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCPs will be recruited by site coordinators first. If HCPs are interested in participating&#xD;
      they will complete the informed consent process and then complete an initial HCP&#xD;
      questionnaire which will collect information such as demographics, occupation and POC device&#xD;
      experience (about 15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, patients will be recruited to the study when they come in for voluntary HIV&#xD;
      testing (e.g. POC testing) and routine HIV follow-up care at study sites. If patients consent&#xD;
      to participating, all those enrolled will voluntarily complete a questionnaire (collecting&#xD;
      demographics and HIV medical history information) and then provide their venous whole blood&#xD;
      sample (for clinical laboratory testing) and fingerstick and oral fluid specimens, for the&#xD;
      testing with the OraQuick ADVANCE® Test - Visit 1 (day 1; about 40 - 60 minutes) as per&#xD;
      protocol and study procedures. An unblinded HCP will administer the patient questionnaire and&#xD;
      collect the venous whole blood sample. All patients will have a clinical laboratory test done&#xD;
      for performance comparison using their venous sample, but only those with unknown HIV status&#xD;
      will be instructed to return to the clinic for a follow-up visit two (2) weeks later to&#xD;
      obtain their laboratory test results (Visit 2; about 10 - 15 minutes). Patients may also have&#xD;
      a point-of-care (POC) test conducted on site as part of the clinic's standard of care&#xD;
      testing, outside of the protocol and after all study procedures for Visit 1 are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two HCPs who are blinded to the patient history (including HIV diagnosis) will collect and&#xD;
      test patient specimens, either the oral fluid or the fingerstick whole blood, using the&#xD;
      OraQuick ADVANCE® Test by following the instructions provided in the Step-by-Step Instruction&#xD;
      Guide and Package Insert for the Test. HCPs will then read, interpret (following the&#xD;
      instruction guide) and document these test results for each patient. Sampling, testing and&#xD;
      recording is estimated between 20 - 40 minutes per patient participant. At the end of testing&#xD;
      at a site, HCPs will complete a second questionnaire which will include reading and&#xD;
      interpreting 20 mock (contrived) device results, comprehension questions and collect&#xD;
      information about ease of use and experience with the Test (about 1 hour).&#xD;
