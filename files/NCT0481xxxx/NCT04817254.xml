  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is a type of malignant glioma. These cancers are nearly always fatal.&#xD;
      People who develop these cancers get aggressive treatments. But the tumors almost always&#xD;
      recur. Researchers want to study people with newly diagnosed disease to learn more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study people with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma to look at the changes in immune&#xD;
      cells in the blood of those who take ipilimumab and nivolumab, along with temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma, who have had surgical&#xD;
      removal of their tumor and have completed standard initial chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical record review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests to assess their nervous system and their ability to do typical activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessment. For this, they will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They may get a&#xD;
      contrast dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter. The MRI scanner makes noise. They will get&#xD;
      earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram. It measures heart rate and rhythm. They will lie still. Sticky pads will&#xD;
      be placed on their chest, arms, and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in cycles. Each cycle lasts 4 weeks. Participants will get nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab via IV. They will take temozolomide by mouth. They will keep a pill diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out surveys about their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits about 60 days and 100 days after treatment ends. Then&#xD;
      they will be contacted every 6 months for the rest of their life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma (GBM) represents an aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options. The&#xD;
      immunosuppressive nature of GBM may be reversible with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)&#xD;
      treatment, however, initial studies have yet to demonstrate this. It is postulated that&#xD;
      trafficking of peripherally activated lymphocytes may play a role in generating a robust&#xD;
      intracranial immune response. Therefore, a blood-based assay to identify peripheral blood&#xD;
      response may both predict response and better identify the ideal patient populations for&#xD;
      future ICI clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if the outcomes, as measured by overall survival, is improved in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma when treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors result in an&#xD;
      immune response in peripheral blood T lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed primary glioblastoma or gliosarcoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age greater than or equal to 18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 70;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must recently complete resection and chemoradiation;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must not have prior immunotherapy, other current investigational agents, or&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment &gt; 30mg cortisone-equivalents per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, investigator-initiated exploratory study of newly-diagnosed GBM who have&#xD;
      completed resection and chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to be treated in Arm 1 or 2, consistent of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (temozolomide (TMZ)) and immunotherapy (nivolumab + ipilimumab):&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 PO on days 1-5 q28 days for cycles 1-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab (1 mg/kg IV q2weeks for cycles 1-4, then 480 mg IV q4weeks for cycles 5-16) +&#xD;
      ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV q4 weeks for cycles 1-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab (1 mg/kg IV q2weeks for cycles 1-4, then 480 mg IV q4weeks for cycles 5-16) +&#xD;
      ipilimumab (3 mg/kg IV q4 weeks for cycles 1-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary objective, serial examination of peripheral blood, including comprehensive&#xD;
      flow cytometric analysis of leukocyte populations and cytokines, and Interferon- &gt;= (IFN- &gt;=)&#xD;
      ELISPOT functional analysis of CD4+/8+ response to common recall antigens will be used to&#xD;
      determine systemic response to ICI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary objectives, correlative studies assess peripheral blood T cells' ability to&#xD;
      respond to an in vitro stimulation paradigm, including nivolumab and ipilimumab, in a&#xD;
      microbead-based model. The T cell response to pretreatment in vitro stimulation would be&#xD;
      compared to post-treatment in vivo stimulation to determine if this in vitro model can&#xD;
      predict in vivo response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional exploratory studies are planned to characterize the in vivo immune response to&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, including but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phospho-flow functional analysis of NK cell response to IFN/IL-15 stimulation.&#xD;

        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations (within timeframes identified in the&#xD;
        bullets below) that&#xD;
&#xD;
        would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study treatment potential for&#xD;
        teratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
        risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to study treatment of the mother,&#xD;
&#xD;
        breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
