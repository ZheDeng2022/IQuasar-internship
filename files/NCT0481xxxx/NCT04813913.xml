  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiangiogenic treatments are used in many tumor locations such as metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC) with a significant improvement in carcinological results on overall survival&#xD;
      and / or progression-free survival. However, their use is characterized by an increase in&#xD;
      side effects and in particular cardiovascular effects such as high blood pressure&#xD;
      (hypertension). One of the main classes of antiangiogens used in this indication is that of&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, the leader of which is bevacizumab (Avastin®, Roche, Bale,&#xD;
      Switzerland). Bevacizumab works by inhibiting endothelial vascular growth factor-dependent&#xD;
      neoangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF). In the reference studies, the&#xD;
      inhibition of VEGF, whether extracellular (monoclonal antibody directed against VEGFA) or&#xD;
      intracellular (receptor inhibitors with tyrosine kinase activity), induces hypertension of&#xD;
      all grades, observed in 25% to 40 % of patients including 8 to 17% of severe grades (≥ grade&#xD;
      3 NCI-CTCAE). In terms of pathophysiology, inhibition of VEGFA results in a decrease in the&#xD;
      availability of nitric oxide (NO) at the endothelial level and the appearance of arteriolar&#xD;
      rarefaction. This induces an increase in peripheral resistance responsible ultimately for an&#xD;
      increase in blood pressure. The occurrence of hypertension induced by anti-VEGF treatment&#xD;
      seems to be predictive of the carcinological response in certain oncological situations such&#xD;
      as metastatic breast cancer9, glioblastoma and mRCC. Furthermore, it has also been shown that&#xD;
      there is an early attack on the elastic conductance arteries (branches of the aorta and its&#xD;
      main ones) characterized by an increase in their rigidity in patients exposed to a VEGF&#xD;
      receptor inhibitor with tyrosine activity. kinase or bevacizumab. This increase, whose poor&#xD;
      prognostic impact is known at the cardiovascular level is largely independent of the rise in&#xD;
      blood pressure and reflects a direct toxicity of treatments at the level of the artery wall.&#xD;
      This increase in rigidity, refused when the pressure rises, would be predictive of a low&#xD;
      carcinological response rate at 6 months. However, these data are based on populations that&#xD;
      are heterogeneous in terms of carcinology and the position prior to or concomitant with other&#xD;
      antineoplastic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the evaluation of arterial stiffness in the same patient population would&#xD;
      make it possible to better define the involvement of the conductive arteries in a clearly&#xD;
      defined clinical situation. Joint measurements of the plasma concentration of the treatment&#xD;
      as well as those of factors derived from the endothelium and circulating tumor markers which,&#xD;
      to our knowledge, have never been carried out in these patients, would make it possible to&#xD;
      better specify the mechanisms of involvement and the links between exposure, arterial&#xD;
      toxicity and carcinologic efficacy of bevacizumab. Of course, in order to assess more&#xD;
      precisely the inherent impact of chemotherapy on the conductance arteries, the evolution of&#xD;
      arterial stiffness must take into account the possible effects in patients receiving, for&#xD;
      essentially clinical and biological reasons, systemic treatment without antiangiogenic.&#xD;
