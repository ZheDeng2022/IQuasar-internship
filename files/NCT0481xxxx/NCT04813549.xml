  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, autoimmune, systemic inflammatory disease with a&#xD;
      prevalence of approximately 1%. With a lifetime development rate of 3.6%, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis is seen 1.7% more in women than in men. Although there are no diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      for rheumatoid arthritis, ACR / EULAR 2010 classification criteria are frequently used in&#xD;
      diagnosis. Symptom duration, number of swollen joints, acute phase reactants and serology are&#xD;
      used in these criteria. Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic widespread pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, exercise disorders and cognitive impairment. Although the prevalence of fibromyalgia&#xD;
      syndrome in the general population is between 2-4%, it is one of the most common conditions&#xD;
      encountered by rheumatologists. A treat to target strategy is recommended in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis disease management. This approach suggests close monitoring of disease activity and&#xD;
      treatment change in cases where the goal is not achieved. The prevalence of fibromyalgia in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis patients was found to be 5-52% in meta-analyzes due to the heterogeneity&#xD;
      of fibromyalgia criteria used in studies. This study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      secondary fibromyalgia syndrome, which is frequently found in rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      characterized by symptoms such as fatigue and widespread pain, on rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      disease activation and patients' quality of life.&#xD;

      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, autoimmune, systemic inflammatory disease with a&#xD;
      prevalence of approximately 1%. With a lifetime development rate of 3.6%, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis is seen 1.7% more in women than in men. Synovial joints are the primary involvement&#xD;
      site of the disease, and due to insufficient control of the disease, irreversible joint&#xD;
      damage and disability may develop. Although there are no diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, ACR / EULAR 2010 classification criteria are frequently used in diagnosis. Symptom&#xD;
      duration, number of swollen joints, acute phase reactants and serology are used in these&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, exercise&#xD;
      disorders and cognitive impairment. Although the prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome in the&#xD;
      general population is between 2-4%, it is one of the most common conditions encountered by&#xD;
      rheumatologists. The prevalence of fibromyalgia increases with age and is more common in&#xD;
      women, with a female: the male ratio between 2:1 to 30:1, depending on which diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria are applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first approved classification criteria for fibromyalgia syndrome was developed in 1990 by&#xD;
      the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). These criteria include chronic widespread pain&#xD;
      for more than 3 months and evaluation of 18 sensitive points. Although it was developed for&#xD;
      classification, it was also used as a diagnostic criterion by most rheumatologists. Updated&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria excluding sensitive point evaluation were published by ACR in 2010.&#xD;
      Common pain index and symptom severity score were used in these criteria. In 2011, these&#xD;
      criteria were modified with criteria including the physician's assessment of somatic&#xD;
      symptoms. The 2010 and 2011 criteria evaluate symptom severity and 'being fibromyalgia' using&#xD;
      the common pain index and symptom severity scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 main groups in fibromyalgia, these are; primary fibromyalgia and secondary&#xD;
      fibromyalgia due to a comorbid disease. Primary fibromyalgia is more common and characterized&#xD;
      by local pain that initially spreads later. Differential diagnosis is difficult in these&#xD;
      individuals because of the common symptoms of rheumatological diseases such as pain and&#xD;
      fatigue. Centralized pain may develop with inflammatory arthritis or as a result of the&#xD;
      disease. Chronic inflammation can mediate central pain from peripheral pain that can cause&#xD;
      symptoms in fibromyalgia. In animal models, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis&#xD;
      Factor and Interleukin-6 have been associated with abnormal central pain processing and&#xD;
      widespread pain sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Rheumatoid Arthritis(RA) patients, the presence of fibromyalgia syndrome was found 2.1&#xD;
      times more frequently in patients who were Rheumatoid Factor negative than those who were&#xD;
      positive, and 3.0 times more frequently in patients who were positive in anti-citrullinated&#xD;
      protein antibody (ACPA) seronegative. It is thought that in seronegative patients, clinicians&#xD;
      may be less likely to diagnose RA or attribute the RA prodroma symptom as fibromyalgia&#xD;
      syndrome. Also alternatively, fibromyalgia syndrome may be the underlying diagnosis in some&#xD;
      seronegative cases. In another study investigating the presence of secondary fibromyalgia&#xD;
      syndrome in patients with early inflammatory arthritis; it was found that ACPA negative&#xD;
      patients had fibromyalgia syndrome more frequently than seropositive patients. The authors&#xD;
      hypothesized that this might be caused by ACPA-positive patients were treated more&#xD;
      aggressively and disease control was reached earlier, or clinicians were more likely to&#xD;
      diagnose fibromyalgia in ACPA-negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treat to target strategy is recommended in RA disease management. This approach suggests&#xD;
      close monitoring of disease activity and treatment change in cases where the goal is not&#xD;
      achieved. In randomized studies, with a treat to target strategy, patients have been found to&#xD;
      have a decrease in radiological progression, in disease activity, an increase in physical&#xD;
      function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of fibromyalgia in rheumatoid arthritis patients was found to be 5-52% in&#xD;
      meta-analyzes due to the heterogeneity of fibromyalgia criteria used in studies.When the&#xD;
      2010/2011 criterion was used, the prevalence was found to be higher than the 1990 criteria.&#xD;
      (24% vs 18%)Despite this heterogeneity, a strong relationship was found between DAS28 and&#xD;
      comorbid fibromyalgia. As DAS28, disease activity index such as SDAI( simplified disease&#xD;
      activity index) and CDAI (clinical disease activity index) were found to be correlated with&#xD;
      comorbid fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of secondary fibromyalgia syndrome, which is&#xD;
      frequently found in rheumatoid arthritis and characterized by symptoms such as fatigue and&#xD;
      widespread pain, on rheumatoid arthritis disease activation and patients' quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>For the diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome, &quot;Widespread Pain Index and Symptom Severity Scale&quot;, which are the ACR criteria published in 2010, will be used.Widespread Pain Index; The number of painful areas is calculated in the last 1 week. How many areas has the patient had will be calculated. Scoring is between 0-19. Symptom Severity Scale; Scoring is between 0-12. The presence of fatigue, tired awakening, cognitive symptoms, and somatic symptoms will be evaluated by the clinician, and the level of each in the last 1 week will be recorded as (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).&#xD;
A patient satisfies diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia if the following 3 conditions are met:&#xD;
Widespread Pain Index ≥7 and Symptom Severity Scale ≥5 or Widespread Pain Index 3-6 and Symptom Severity Scale ≥9&#xD;
Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months.&#xD;
