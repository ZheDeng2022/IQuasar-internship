  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Keratinocyte skin cancer is known to influence the HRQoL in a specific way.&#xD;
      Derived utility values are required for cost-effectiveness analyses of new interventions.&#xD;
      However there is no sensitive tool to capture HRQoL that translates into utilities available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To document the exact HRQoL in patients with in KC using the generic EQ-5D-5L&#xD;
      questionnaire, as well as the TTO, 15D and the BaSQoL questionnaire, and to develop health&#xD;
      utilities based on these tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Longitudinal observational study (at time 0 and time 0 +12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients aged â‰¥18 years consulting a dermatologist or their GP for&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment or follow-up of a (pre)malignant skin lesion(s).&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D-5L questionnaire questioning their overall health on five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). In addition patients will have to fill in the generic 15D questioning 15 specific dimensions on 5 levels as well as the BaSQoL, which is a disease specific questionnaire for patients with KC. The Time-trade off task is the final question.</description>
