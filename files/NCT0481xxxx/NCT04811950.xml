      The biological rationale in calculating PLR stems from the increase in the lymphocyte count&#xD;
      and reduction in the platelet count often encountered in the advances stages of CLL .NMR&#xD;
      median value was significantly higher in untreated patients than in patients who received&#xD;
      treatment strengthening the hypothesis that this ratio is associated with a more indolent&#xD;
      form of disease&#xD;

      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia in the western world.&#xD;
      In Egypt, CLL is the most common subtype of leukemias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the National Cancer Registry reported over 80% of lymphoid leukemias are CLL . It is the&#xD;
           most common types of leukemia diagnosed in adult.&#xD;
           ChroniclymphocyticleukemialymphocytesareclonalCD19-positiveBcells characterized by the&#xD;
           accumulation of CD5 positive monoclonal B cells in peripheral blood. Bone marrow&#xD;
           aspiration shows lymphocytic replacement of normal marrow elements, lymphocytes comprise&#xD;
           25-95% .Trephine biopsy reveals nodular, diffuse or interstitial involvement by&#xD;
           lymphocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) and European&#xD;
           Society of Medical Oncology guidelines also require persistence of lymphocytosis for&#xD;
           longer than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important prognostic factors in CLL are clinical staging systems developed by Rai&#xD;
      and Binet&#xD;
&#xD;
      . These systems based on clinical examination e.g. lymphadenopathy and organomegaly,&#xD;
      peripheral blood findings (platelet&#xD;
      andhaemoglobinvalues),markersoftumorload(thymidinekinaseand B2-microglobulin), expression of&#xD;
      specific proteins in CLL cells; CD38, CD49d &amp; ZAP-70, genetic abnormalities quantified by&#xD;
      FISH which include del(13q), tri12, del(11q), &amp; del(17p) and genetic parameters.including&#xD;
      immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene segment (IGHV) mutational status. Finally,&#xD;
      prognostication in patients with CLL should not only address disease progression and overall&#xD;
      survival, but also response to therapy. The biological rationale in calculating PLR stems&#xD;
      from the increase in the lymphocyte count and reduction in the platelet count often&#xD;
      encountered in the advanced stages of CLL. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ratio using&#xD;
      both the platelet and lymphocyte counts may have a prognostic role in patients with CLL.&#xD;
      Neutrophil-monocyte ratio(NMR) was found to be higher in untreated patients than in patients&#xD;
      who received treatment . and therefore it will be used to prove its relation with disease&#xD;
      severity and itsprognosticvalues. It is important to highlight that using these indices, is&#xD;
      simple, cheap, easily measured and reproducible and can be integrated into our daily clinical&#xD;
      practice as prognostic marker of CLL&#xD;
