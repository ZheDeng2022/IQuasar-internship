  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The genetics has been shown as one of the most important factor influencing the growth and&#xD;
      development of the dentofacial complex. Dental development, one of the most reliable&#xD;
      indicators of chronological age (CA), has been believed to be fundamentally influenced by&#xD;
      genetics rather than environmental factors. As twins share genetic variation (100% for&#xD;
      monozygotic and 50% for dizygotic twins) and were subjected to the similar environmental&#xD;
      factors, the twin studies have been presented useful and effective method to researchers for&#xD;
      investigating the influence of heredity on dental development and observing the similarities&#xD;
      and differences among twin pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of dental development is among the most commonly used and reliable method for&#xD;
      dental age determination using the morphological parameters of teeth on dental radiographs.&#xD;
      Dental maturity, defined as a dental age (DA), is very important in forensic anthropology to&#xD;
      identify cases and in dentistry for planning pedodontic and orthodontic treatment, and also&#xD;
      determining a child's growth and developmental status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many dental age estimation methods which are mostly based on the morphological&#xD;
      evaluation of dental growth observed from dental radiographs in children In order to estimate&#xD;
      dental age, Demirjian's, Willems' and Nolla's methods were used. All panoramic radiographs&#xD;
      were scored by one observer to eliminate the inter-observer error.&#xD;
