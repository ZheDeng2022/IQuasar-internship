      BACKGROUND: The spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria represents a well-known problem, which&#xD;
      must be face up by optimizing antibiotic therapy both in terms of choosing the most&#xD;
      appropriate drug and of an adequate treatment duration. The method of administration is also&#xD;
      a critical element. There are data relating to the maximization of the efficacy of&#xD;
      Carbapenems and Piperacillin/Tazobactam by continuous infusion, able to constantly maintain&#xD;
      adequate drug concentrations. Several studies, conducted comparing a standard administration&#xD;
      of Carbapenem or Piperacillin/Tazobactam to an extended administration or continuous&#xD;
      perfusion to evaluate safety and efficacy in terms of mortality reduction, have been&#xD;
      documented. The achievement of optimal serum concentrations during continuous infusion has&#xD;
      been documented both for Carbapenems and Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and for other types of&#xD;
      antibiotics such as Cefepime and Vancomycin. The duration of antibiotic treatment is a&#xD;
      critical factor for the prevention of relapses as well as the onset of resistance. The&#xD;
      recommended duration of antibiotic treatment varies according to the site of infection and&#xD;
      the type of pathogen and is generally between 7 and 14 days, however, in particular cases it&#xD;
      is possible that the administration of antibiotics must be longer than one month. In general,&#xD;
      the length of hospitalization is associated with a greater likelihood of complications for&#xD;
      patients, with a substantial increase in the risk of developing multiple types of&#xD;
      complications, such nosocomial infections, bed rest, bedsores, falls, malnutrition and&#xD;
      disorientation. It should also be noted that prolonged hospitalization leads to a substantial&#xD;
      increase in care costs. The advantage in terms of greater therapeutic success linked to the&#xD;
      continuous infusion of some types of antibiotics has been used for the development of home&#xD;
      infusion protocols for antibiotic therapy. There are numerous studies that show the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of home infusion antibiotic therapy using elastomeric devices,&#xD;
      documenting its substantial equivalence with respect to hospital treatment. The antibiotics&#xD;
      for which there is evidence of feasibility are various, including Cefepime, Vancomycin and&#xD;
      Piperacillin/Tazobactam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: The study is aimed to patients with severe bacterial infections who have&#xD;
      started an antibiotic treatment and are benefiting from such therapy. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to move the continuation of antibiotic therapy to the home setting once its efficacy&#xD;
      and tolerability during hospitalization have been documented, in order to allow the patient a&#xD;
      potentially eradicating treatment, of adequate duration without the need of hospitalization.&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled when the efficacy and tolerability of the ongoing antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      based on Cefepime, Meropenem, Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Vancomycin has been documented. The&#xD;
      protocol requires that the patient go to the hospital every morning to replace the elastomer&#xD;
      and to carry out a medical examination. Blood chemistry tests, which include at least blood&#xD;
      counts, electrolytes, renal function, liver function and inflammation indices are scheduled&#xD;
      to be performed at least once a week. Exams can also be done more frequently based on&#xD;
      clinical needs. Antibiotic therapy should be carried out until the infection is cured, as per&#xD;
      current clinical practice. For the purposes of the study, the patient remains under&#xD;
      observation for 30 days after enrollment. Blood samples for the assessment of antibiotic&#xD;
      concentrations will be performed in correspondence with the blood chemistry tests performed&#xD;
      routinely for patient assessment. In any case, for each patient, a sample is taken for the&#xD;
      dosage of the antibiotic used, which will be a single sample in the event of a continuous&#xD;
      infusion, or a downstream sample (within one hour of the new antibiotic administration) and&#xD;
      peak (30 minutes after the end of the infusion). The pharmacokinetic sampling relating to the&#xD;
      outpatient phase will be carried out on the third or fourth day of continuous infusion&#xD;
      therapy at the time of the elastomer change.&#xD;

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: This is an interventional monocentric study. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      the study is a reduction in hospitalization days. The study population is divided into 4&#xD;
      treatment arms: assuming that the average length of hospitalization for the standard&#xD;
      treatment of a severe infection, for each of the types of antibiotic studied, is 14 days,&#xD;
      with the treatment envisaged by the study it is assumed to reduce this duration,for all 4&#xD;
      treatment arms, to a number equal to or less than 12 days. With these premises, applying the&#xD;
      One sample t-test design method, assuming α = 0.05 and β = 0.1, the number of patients&#xD;
      expected is 9 for each treatment arm. Considering a 30% dropout, the total population to be&#xD;
      enrolled for each type of antibiotic is 12 patients. In total, the study will enroll 48&#xD;
      patients. The study provides for an observation period of 30 days from enrollment. During&#xD;
      this period, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic data will be collected for each treatment&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
