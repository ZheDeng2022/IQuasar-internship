  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that approximately 30% of child and adolescents manifest subthreshold&#xD;
      depression, which can further develop into major depression with as high as 25%-50% within&#xD;
      one year. The main aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of long-term exercise on&#xD;
      preventing major depression and depressive symptoms in young people (aged 10-17 years old).&#xD;
      Other aims include the underlying mechanisms of how aerobic exercise works and predictors for&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is multi-center, psycho-education randomized controlled trial, consisting of two periods&#xD;
      with each of 6 months (i.e supervised and maintenance period). In the exercise intervention&#xD;
      arm, during the first 6 months, participants will be asked to do moderate-intensity aerobic&#xD;
      exercise 3-4 times a week, which will be supervised in person by physical&#xD;
      educators/professionals. In the next 6-month maintenance period, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to continue doing aerobic exercise at the same intensity and frequency, which will not be&#xD;
      supervised in person by educators/professionals, but they will be sent reminders and report&#xD;
      adherence weekly. All of the physical activity will be recorded by accelerometer at scheduled&#xD;
      time points (e.g. the first week, 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 12 month).&#xD;
      Psycho-education group will be given 6 sections of general psycho-education onsite and/or&#xD;
      virtually dependent on the surroundings with regards to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
      The main aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of long-term aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      prevention depression in young people with subthreshold depression.&#xD;

    <description>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) is a self rating scale and has been shown to be effective in groups aged 6-23. CES-DC is used to measure the depressive severity；its measured time range is within the past week. In this study, version of 20-items is used. The higher the score indicates the more severe the depression symptoms, the scale author recommends 15 points as the screening demarcation value.</description>

    <description>The whole exercise lasts for 12 months, consisted of 6-month supervised exercise and 6-month maintenance period. It is moderate -intensity exercise (60-80% Maximum heart rate), each time last for 30 mins (plus 10-minutes for warm-up and cool-down), 3-4 times a week, for the first six months, which will be supervised in person by physical educators and/or physical professionals. In the maintenance period, participants are asked to exercise at the same intensity and frequency, but will not be supervised in person by physical educators/professionals. They will receive reminder on a weekly basis and their physical activities be recorded by accelerometer. Types of exercise will be chosen according to individual school's facility and feasibility, including jogging, fast walking, badminton, running, football etc.</description>
