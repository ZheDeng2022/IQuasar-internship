    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this proposed research are (1) to investigate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      structured and interdisciplinary progressive EM protocol for critically ill patients with&#xD;
      trauma in a trauma ICU and (2) to determine the effectiveness of the progressive EM protocol,&#xD;
      which is designed for implementation with trauma patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Trauma is often accompanied by injury-related neurological impairments, early&#xD;
      physiological instabilities, and the use of high numbers of invasive catheters. Relatedly,&#xD;
      patients with trauma have high rates of major disability and frequently require protracted&#xD;
      rehabilitation with prolonged periods of recovery. Recently, it has been found that the use&#xD;
      of progressive early mobilization (EM) protocols may minimize the functional declines&#xD;
      experienced by patients in general during intensive care unit (ICU) stays, but few studies&#xD;
      have investigated the effects of such protocols on trauma patients in particular. In&#xD;
      addition, prior early mobilization studies have found that the survivors of trauma often&#xD;
      experience a greater incidence of neurological injuries than other critical care patients.&#xD;
      However, no randomized controlled trials thus far have utilized objective evaluations to&#xD;
      measure the influence or effect of progressive EM protocols on the functional recovery of&#xD;
      trauma patients. Therefore, we aim to explore the effects of using a progressive EM protocol&#xD;
      in a trauma ICU on the functional mobility of trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The goals of this proposed research study are (1) to investigate the feasibility&#xD;
      of using a structured progressive EM protocol for patients with trauma in a trauma ICU and&#xD;
      (2) to determine the effectiveness of the progressive EM protocol, which is designed for&#xD;
      implementation with trauma patients, on the functional and in-body outcomes of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods: The study will be a single-blind, randomized controlled trial with a&#xD;
      blinded assessment at the end of the follow-up period.&#xD;
