      MoviS is a randomized controlled trial on the effect of aerobic exercise training on quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) among breast cancer (BC) survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive lifestyle recommendations (nutrition&#xD;
      and exercise) and will undergo the MoviS Training program, whereas control arm patients will&#xD;
      receive lifestyle recommendations. The MoviS Training program consists of 3 months, 3 times&#xD;
      per week, aerobic exercise, which will be supervised both directly (2 days each week) and&#xD;
      remotely (1 day each week). Exercise intensity (40% to 70% of heart rate reserve) and&#xD;
      duration (20 to 60 mins) will be gradually increased throughout the training period. Both&#xD;
      arms will receive counseling on psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the improvement of QoL. The secondary outcome is the improvement of&#xD;
      the health-related parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables will be sampled and compared between and within groups at the baseline, after&#xD;
      the 3 month intervention period, ad interim in the short term (6 months) and long term (12&#xD;
      and 24 months).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND BC is the most common invasive cancer in women and evidence has shown that&#xD;
      exercise can significantly improve the outcomes of BC survivors. MoviS (Movement and Health&#xD;
      Beyond Care) is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the potential health&#xD;
      benefits of exercise and proper nutritional habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The present research study aims to assess the efficacy of aerobic exercise training on&#xD;
      the QoL of high-risk BC survivors and the improvement of health-related factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods BC patients (sample size n=172), age 30-70 years, non-metastatic, stage 0-III,&#xD;
      non-physically active, 6-12 months post-surgery, and post chemo- or radio-therapy, with a&#xD;
      high risk of recurrence defined by one or more of the following criteria: BMI â‰¥ 25, diagnosis&#xD;
      of metabolic syndrome, increased level of blood testosterone and insulin will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the interventional arm (lifestyle recommendations and MoviS Training) or control&#xD;
      arm (lifestyle recommendations). The MoviS Training consists of 3 months of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training (2 d/week of directly supervised and 1 d/week of remotely supervised exercise) with&#xD;
      a progressive increase in exercise intensity (40-70% of heart rate reserve) and duration&#xD;
      (20-60 min). Both arms will receive counseling on healthy lifestyle habits (nutrition and&#xD;
      exercise) based on the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2018 guidelines through the&#xD;
      DIANA-Web platform. All patients will also undergo psychological well-being counseling, which&#xD;
      comprises evaluation for anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the improvement of the QoL assessed by the European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome is the improvement of health-related parameters such as: fatigue;&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements and body composition; cardiac function indexes and heart rate&#xD;
      variability; functional parameters (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle flexibility and&#xD;
      strength, coordination and posture variability, upper limb muscle viscoelastic&#xD;
      characteristics); psychological well-being; metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory risk&#xD;
      factors; gut microbiota; osteoporosis level; recurrences. Diet habits, physical activity&#xD;
      level, pharmacological treatments and comorbidity will be recorded as confounding factors and&#xD;
      covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that supervised exercise may improve QoL and health-related factors of BC&#xD;
      survivors with a high risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline and after the 3 month intervention period, ad interim in&#xD;
      the short term (6 months) and long term (12 and 24 months).&#xD;
