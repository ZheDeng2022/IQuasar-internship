      Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. The management of asthma attacks at&#xD;
      home is based on asthma action plans that are very heterogeneous and reflect the diversity of&#xD;
      recommendations on this subject. The purpose of this study is to observe using smartinhalers&#xD;
      how children and their families use their emergency treatment at home in case of asthma&#xD;
      symptoms and asthma attacks, to allow building new recommendations based not only on the&#xD;
      literature, but also on real-world data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Asthma exacerbations are responsible&#xD;
      for many unscheduled consultations by paediatricians and general practitioners, numerous&#xD;
      emergency room visits and frequent hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma action plans are documents given to families and schools to give the actions to be&#xD;
      taken in the event of an asthma attack occurring in the family or school environment. They&#xD;
      are recommended by all learned societies, because, combined with patient education and&#xD;
      regular consultations, they reduce the need for unscheduled care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main drug in the action plan is the emergency treatment, i.e. a short-acting&#xD;
      bronchodilator (SABA). However, the doses of SABA to be used vary widely depending on the&#xD;
      recommendations. For children up to 5 years of age, the international board of the Global&#xD;
      Initiative for Asthma (GINA) suggests limiting the home dose to 2 puffs of 100μg every 20&#xD;
      minutes, to be repeated twice before consulting a physician if there is no improvement. This&#xD;
      dose is increased to 4-10 puffs every 20 minutes in children 6 years and older. The British&#xD;
      Thoracic Society in the United Kingdom advises administering salbutamol puffs one at a time,&#xD;
      30 to 60 seconds apart, until symptoms improve, with a maximum of 10 puffs. In France, the&#xD;
      Groupe de Recherche sur les Avancées en PneumoPédiatrie (GRAPP) recommends to administer&#xD;
      higher doses of salbutamol at home, up to one puff per 2 kg of weight, with a maximum of 10&#xD;
      to 15 puffs, to be repeated every 20 minutes for one hour, before giving oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids. These very heterogeneous protocols reflect the diversity of doses proposed&#xD;
      in the literature, and the paucity of clinical research data that makes it impossible to&#xD;
      determine whether one approach is better than another. A study that looked at the goals of&#xD;
      parents of children with asthma highlighted that this heterogeneity of practices is a source&#xD;
      of stress for families: &quot;I would like one plan and not ten&quot; explained one parent; &quot;I would&#xD;
      like a plan that doesn't change all the time&quot; reported another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harmonization of practices is necessary in order to provide families and school physicians&#xD;
      nurses with a consistent approach..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to observe, using inhalers connected to salbutamol&#xD;
      inhalers (smart inhalers), how families manage an asthma exacerbation at home, and to&#xD;
      integrate these data into the establishment of future recommendations.&#xD;
