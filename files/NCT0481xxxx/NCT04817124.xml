      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a tDCS-accompanied intensive cognitive&#xD;
      training is feasible as a home-based intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to assess feasibility (primary) and cognitive training and&#xD;
      transfer effects of a home-based multi-session cognitive training combined with transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS, particularly in combination with cognitive training,&#xD;
      represents a promising approach to counteract cognitive decline and restore impaired&#xD;
      functions. However, combined interventions of cognitive training and tDCS involve frequent&#xD;
      visits to the facility, which leads to the need of space, time and personnel, and imposes&#xD;
      strains on the participants. This study will elucidate the feasibility of tDCS and cognitive&#xD;
      training in a home-based context. Healthy older adults will participate in a two-week&#xD;
      cognitive training with concurrent online tDCS application in their own homes. Feasibility,&#xD;
      as well as cognitive performance will be examined before, during and after the intervention.&#xD;
      In order to draw conclusions about the effect of tDCS in addition to cognitive training, a&#xD;
      control group, receiving sham stimulation during training, will be assessed. A Follow-up&#xD;
      session to assess long-term effects is planned four weeks after the post assessment. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that with appropriate training of the participants and close supervision the use&#xD;
      of combined tDCS and cognitive training in an ecologically valid environment by the&#xD;
      participants themselves is feasible. In addition, we hypothesize this protocol will lead to&#xD;
      improved performance on the trained tasks in both experimental groups. We expect increased&#xD;
      performance on transfer tasks and long-term maintenance of the effects after anodal compared&#xD;
      to sham stimulation. A successful implementation of the intervention in the home-based&#xD;
      setting will contribute to the development of home-based tDCS as a widely available therapy&#xD;
      option in clinical populations.&#xD;
