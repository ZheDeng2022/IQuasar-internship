  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), uremic toxins accumulate when kidney function&#xD;
      declines. Those uremic toxins had a greater affinity to circulating proteins are called&#xD;
      &quot;protein bound uremic toxins, PBUT.&quot; Apart from traditional small or middle molecule uremic&#xD;
      toxins, the PBUTs can be rarely eliminated using traditional renal replacement therapy, even&#xD;
      using high flux dialysis modalities. Among these molecules identified, indoxyl sulfate (IS),&#xD;
      and p-cresol (PC) are mostly studied. Both in vitro and in vivo study, IS and PC are&#xD;
      associated with endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and increased&#xD;
      risk for CV outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uremic toxins (IS and PC) are originated in the endogenous environment, mainly from the&#xD;
      protein metabolism, food intake, or produced by gut microbiota. Prevention of IS or PC&#xD;
      precursors from being absorbed across the intestinal tract has been extensively studied in&#xD;
      the renal literature by use of oral adsorbents. In animal models, activated charcoal reduces&#xD;
      the serum concentration of creatinine (cre) and may delay CKD progression by alleviating IS&#xD;
      overload. An oral form of non-absorbable surface-modified activated bamboo charcoal (ABC),&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to effectively reduce circulating and renal IS levels in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics have been reported to reduce inflammation,&#xD;
      improve kidney function and retard progression of CKD by restoring the symbiosis of gut&#xD;
      microflora in patients with CKD. A randomized trial found synbiotics decreased serum PCS&#xD;
      without reducing serum IS in non-dialysis CKD. Another study found that synbiotics delayed&#xD;
      CKD progression. A systematic review found prebiotic and probiotic therapies reduced IS and&#xD;
      PCS in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) on haemodialysis. However, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether the results hold true for other patients with CKD. Based on these previous findings,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) study to&#xD;
      see if oral uremic toxin absorbent + probiotics prevent CKD progression. Also, a panel of&#xD;
      clinical and biochemical profiles will be checked to investigate possible link between&#xD;
      several biomarkers and clinical response.&#xD;

      During this 6 months' trial, eligible 120 patients with eGFR 15 &lt; eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1.73m2 and&#xD;
      UACR &gt; 100 mg/g will be enrolled and randomized into 4 groups. The patients in group 1 will&#xD;
      receive CharXenPlus 4g (with ABC 2g) thrice daily + CharXprob 0.8 g once daily in the initial&#xD;
      3 months. Group 2 will receive CharXenPlus 4g thrice daily in the initial 3 months, and&#xD;
      CharXprob 0.8 g once daily in the last 3 months. Group 3 will receive CharXprob 0.8 g once&#xD;
      daily in the initial 3 months, and CharXenPlus 4g thrice daily in the last 3 months. Group 4&#xD;
      will only receive CharXprob 0.8 g once daily in the last 3 months. In addition to demographic&#xD;
      data, the degrees of proteinuria (UACR), serum albumin, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine, Na, K, Cl,&#xD;
      Ca, P, Mg, uric acid, IS, PC, TMAO, FGF-23, klotho, KIM-1, NGAL, metabolomics, lcnRNA, and&#xD;
      fecal microbiota will be assessed at the baseline, 3rd and 6th month of the trial.&#xD;
