        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Greater than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Spanish or English speaker with ability to read one of these languages&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer .&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willingness to be assessed at diagnosis, during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (if&#xD;
             applicable), preoperatively (if applicable - unless time of diagnosis is preoperative&#xD;
             visit), and postoperatively for up to two years following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients unable to read Spanish or English, as they will be unable to complete&#xD;
             surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of previous invasive cancer or treatment with chemotherapy, as they may have a&#xD;
             different baseline functional status, quality of life, and gastrointestinal function&#xD;
             compared to the normal healthy population, per principal investigator discretion,&#xD;
             based on a case-by-case review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior inpatient psychiatric treatment for severe mental illness or overt signs of&#xD;
             severe psychopathology (e.g., psychosis) within the past six months as these&#xD;
             conditions can interfere with adequate participation in assessments, per principal&#xD;
             investigator discretion, based on a case-by-case review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the&#xD;
             well-being of the patient or the study or prevent the patient from meeting or&#xD;
             performing study requirements.&#xD;
