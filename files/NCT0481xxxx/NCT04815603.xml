  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      BGE-117 in the treatment of anemia of aging in participants ≥ 65 years of age.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double- blind study of BGE-117&#xD;
      administered PO in participants ≥ 65 years of age for the treatment of anemia of aging.&#xD;
      Anemia of aging accounts for approximately one-third of anemia in patients over 65 years of&#xD;
      age, defined as a suboptimal hemoglobin level due to different underlying characteristics.&#xD;
      This study's planned size is 160 evaluable subjects (80 subjects randomized to BGE-117 and 80&#xD;
      subjects randomized to placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, participants may be Pre-screened for hemoglobin using&#xD;
      HemoCue, and subsequently will be screened for study eligibility. Screening will include full&#xD;
      physical examination, vital signs, safety and study-related laboratory evaluation, ophthalmic&#xD;
      exam, ECG, Wells score for DVT, and clinical outcome assessment. If confirmed that the&#xD;
      participant qualifies for this protocol according to listed inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to BGE-117 or placebo, PO, once per day, for a treatment&#xD;
      period duration of approximately 12 weeks. Dose adjustments for study medication during the&#xD;
      treatment period are made according to a dosing algorithm to achieve and maintain hemoglobin&#xD;
      (Hb) within the target range (12.5-13.0 g/dL). Study procedures and assessments are performed&#xD;
      at various timepoints during the treatment period per the schedule outlined in the study&#xD;
      protocol. Participants will undergo follow-up assessments for approximately 4 weeks after&#xD;
      administration of the last dose.&#xD;
