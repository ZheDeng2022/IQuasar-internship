      This trial is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and biomarker response of APL-1202&#xD;
      in combination with tislelizumab as neoadjuvant therapy for patients with MIBC who are&#xD;
      cisplatin ineligible or refuse cisplatin-based chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, multi-center clinical study consisting of two periods: Phase Ⅰ&#xD;
      and Phase Ⅱ. Phase I is a dose escalation study to determine MTD (maximum tolerated dose)&#xD;
      and/or RP2D. Phase II is an expanded proof of concept (POC) study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of APL-1202 in combination with tislelizumab compared to tislelizumab alone as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy for MIBC as measured by pCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ⅰ and Phase Ⅱ both are divided into 3 periods: screening period, neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      and follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The screening period is up to 4 weeks before the first doses of study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the neoadjuvant therapy, each patient will receive the combined treatment of&#xD;
           tislelizumab and APL-1202 or tislelizumab alone, every 21 days as a dosing cycle for a&#xD;
           total of 3 cycles of treatment prior to radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follow-up period includes a safety follow-up at 4 weeks after radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ⅰ: Dose-Escalation The dose escalation phase will assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of APL-1202 in combination with tislelizumab in MIBC patients. Results from&#xD;
      this period will determine the RP2D of APL-1202 in combination with tislelizumab as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy for MIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this phase must meet the following criteria: those with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      MIBC for whom RC is planned, and who are cisplatin ineligible or refuse to receive cisplatin&#xD;
      based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and with calculated CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
      equation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used. The dose of APL-1202 will start at 375 mg&#xD;
      (125 mg, TID) and increase sequentially to 750 mg (250 mg, TID) and 1,125 mg (375 mg, TID).&#xD;
      For more information on the dose escalation design, please see the Dose Escalation Criteria&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Dose-Escalation plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level Tislelizumab APL-1202 Patients (n)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 200 mg, IV, Q3w 125 mg, PO, TID ≥ 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 200 mg, IV, Q3w 250 mg, PO, TID ≥ 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 200 mg, IV, Q3w 375 mg, PO, TID ≥ 3 Patients will be assigned to one of three APL-1202&#xD;
           dose levels. Each patient will receive 3 cycles of treatment prior to RC and each cycle&#xD;
           is 3 weeks. On day 1 of each cycle, a single dose of 200 mg tislelizumab will be&#xD;
           administered intravenously and APL-1202 will be administered orally TID daily for 3&#xD;
           weeks. If the dose level 1 is determined to be safe and tolerable, 3 patients will be&#xD;
           enrolled to Dose Level 2 and will receive their treatments in 3-week treatment cycles&#xD;
           and safety will be assessed. This process is repeated one more time for the Dose Level&#xD;
           3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DLT observation window for any dose level will be treatment cycle 1 (1-21 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not complete the DLT observation period (cycle 1) will be replaced unless the&#xD;
      discontinuation of treatment is DLT-related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT assessment will be performed during the first cycle (1-21 days) of study treatments. An&#xD;
      evaluable patient is defined as a patient who has received at least 75% of planned APL-1202&#xD;
      doses during the first cycle of treatment and completed all the safety evaluations required&#xD;
      for the first cycle, or any patient who has DLT during the first cycle. If a patient receives&#xD;
      less than 75% of planned APL-1202 doses during the first cycle or withdraws from the study&#xD;
      due to reasons other than DLT, the patient will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no intra-patient dose escalation. A patient will receive treatments of cycle 2&#xD;
      and cycle 3 or until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or discontinuation for any&#xD;
      other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ⅱ: Proof of Concept (POC) The primary objective of this phase is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of APL-1202 in combination with tislelizumab compared to tislelizumab alone as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy for MIBC as measured by pathologic complete response (pCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this phase must meet the following criteria: those with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      MIBC for whom RC is planned, and who are cisplatin ineligible or refuse to receive cisplatin&#xD;
      based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As shown in Figure 1 below, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to group 1 or group&#xD;
      2, with PD-L1expression level as a stratification factor. For those assigned to group 1, each&#xD;
      patient will receive 3 cycles of treatment prior to RC and each cycle is 3 weeks. On day 1 of&#xD;
      each cycle, a single dose of 200 mg tislelizumab will be administered intravenously. APL-1202&#xD;
      will be administered orally TID daily for 3 weeks at the RP2D defined from Phase I. For&#xD;
      patients assigned to group 2, each patient will receive 3 cycles of treatments with a single&#xD;
      dose of 200 mg tislelizumab administered on day 1 of each cycle, followed by RC. A patient&#xD;
      will stay on treatment until completion of planned treatments, unacceptable toxicity, disease&#xD;
      progression, or discontinuation for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this period, patients with renal function with calculated CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min (by&#xD;
      Cockcroft-Gault equation) will be recruited. if patients with CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min, start dose of&#xD;
      APL-1202 is recommended to be RP2D defined from Phase I; for patients with CrCl 30-50 mL/min,&#xD;
      the dose of APL-1202 is recommended to be reduced by 1 dose level from RP2D defined from&#xD;
      Phase I (from 1125 mg/day to 750 mg/day, or from 750 mg/day to 375 mg/day).&#xD;
