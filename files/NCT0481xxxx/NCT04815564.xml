  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Misalignment of teeth and jaws (also called malocclusion) is a common life altering problem&#xD;
      facing many individuals with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). The presence of Dentinogenesis&#xD;
      Imperfecta in teeth of OI individuals makes the use of conventional orthodontics in the form&#xD;
      of braces very challenging. Clear aligners are newer form of orthodontic treatment and is&#xD;
      less invasive than braces. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate the efficiency and&#xD;
      safety of using Invisalign clear aligners for orthodontic treatment in individuals with&#xD;
      Osteogenesis Imperfecta. We seek individual with Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type III or IV, with&#xD;
      mild to moderate malocclusion and no prior history of orthodontic treatment. This study will&#xD;
      be held at three sites - University of Michigan Kansas City, University of California Los&#xD;
      Angeles and National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial research. This study will for the&#xD;
      first time, help define guidelines for safe and efficient orthodontic treatment using clear&#xD;
      aligners in individuals with Osteogenesis Imperfecta. If successful, this approach can&#xD;
      rapidly be implemented into clinical practice, as the Invisalign system is readily available&#xD;
      to orthodontists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable connective tissue disorder leading to frequent&#xD;
      fractures and bone deformities. In about 90% of individuals with OI, the disease is caused by&#xD;
      dominant mutations in one of the two genes coding for collagen type I, COL1A1 and COL1A2. The&#xD;
      phenotype of OI ranges widely, which is captured by the Sillence classification of OI into&#xD;
      clinical types I through IV. Individuals who have bone disease that is severe enough to lead&#xD;
      to long-bone deformities, such as bowing of femurs and tibias, are usually diagnosed with OI&#xD;
      type III (severe bone fragility) or IV (moderate bone fragility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the well-known features of OI in the extracranial skeleton, OI is frequently&#xD;
      associated with dental and craniofacial issues. These abnormalities are a source of major&#xD;
      concern to patients. Misalignment of the jaws is a common problem in individuals with OI Type&#xD;
      III and IV. Malocclusion associated with OI types III and IV differs markedly from the types&#xD;
      of malocclusion commonly observed in the general population. Malocclusion in the general&#xD;
      population is predominantly class II, however, OI types III and IV are commonly associated&#xD;
      with class III malocclusion. The InvisalignÂ® system (Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA) is a&#xD;
      personalized and FDA-approved (Class II device; 510(k) number: K143630) approach to treat&#xD;
      malocclusion. It involves incrementally moving teeth with a series of removable, custom-made&#xD;
      clear polyurethane trays (aligners) that exert forces on teeth. The aligners are transparent&#xD;
      ('clear aligners') and therefore are less visible than traditional braces that are made of&#xD;
      metal. An important consideration in the treatment of patients with OI is that Invisalign&#xD;
      does not require surface etching and cement bonding of metal braces to the tooth surface,&#xD;
      which is difficult in the presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta. In this study, we will&#xD;
      therefore use the Invisalign system to treat malocclusion associated with OI. This study will&#xD;
      directly inform clinical orthodontic practice in an area of unmet clinical need and utilizes&#xD;
      a treatment method that may be immediately implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will be able to enroll in the intervention arm&#xD;
      of the study to undergo orthodontic treatment. Participants who fail to meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be offered to participate in the study for observation purposes (natural&#xD;
      history arm) without undergoing treatment. Participants in the intervention arm will need to&#xD;
      visit the study site every two months for the study duration (28 months). Initial four months&#xD;
      will involve observation period followed by two years of orthodontic treatment. Participants&#xD;
      in the natural history arm will visit the study site every six months for a period of two&#xD;
      years (4 visits). A complete oral exam, craniofacial evaluation, intra-oral photos,&#xD;
      intra-oral scans, face photos, masticatory test, cone-beam CT and self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires will be done during the visits.&#xD;
