  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic database of our tertiary obstetrics and gynecology clinic was searched for&#xD;
      patients who were treated for tub-ovarian abscess during the last 10 years (January 2010-&#xD;
      November 2020). Patients' biometric data, admission date and duration, medical and surgical&#xD;
      treatment modalities were recorded using an Excel sheet. Patients will be evaluated on the&#xD;
      basis of the treatment they receive, length of treatment, if surgically treatment the type of&#xD;
      surgery performed. Hospitalization length, readmission, recurrence will be compared between&#xD;
      treatment modalities.&#xD;

    <description>Patients' demographics data (age, gravity, parity, presence of additional comorbidities and BMI) will be recorded. Their laboratory assessment of infection prior to treatment begin such as CRP an procalcitonin will be recorded. Their treatment modalities in terms of surgery or antibiothepry, duration of hospitalization and recurrence will be recorded. Statistical analysis will be done using SPSS. Student's t test will be used for comparison where necessary. Significance will be evaluated using p-value.</description>
