  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether early nutritional intervention with oral nutrition supplements in&#xD;
      patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma undergoing chemoradiotherapy will improve nutritional&#xD;
      status, quality of life and treatment tolerance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma (NPC). During chemoradiotherapy, malnutrition is present in 44-88% patients which&#xD;
      is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Although patients receive conventional&#xD;
      nutritional intervention recommended by The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and&#xD;
      Metabolism guidelines, there are still 35% NPC patients suffering from malnutrition during&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that early nutritional intervention before radiotherapy reduced the&#xD;
      prevalence of malnutrition. However, there are few randomized controlled clinical studies&#xD;
      comparing early oral nutritional supplements (ONS) intervention to conventional nutritional&#xD;
      intervention in NPC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether early ONS intervention compared to conventional nutritional intervention&#xD;
      improves nutritional status, treatment tolerance and quality of life, and decreases the&#xD;
      incidence of grade 3-4 treatment related side-effects in NPC patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
