  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether ketamine is a safe sedative-analgesic agent to be used in an intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) setting as compared to traditionally used agents such as propofol, opioids,&#xD;
      and midazolam&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the prevention and management of pain,&#xD;
      agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU), nonbenzodiazepine sedatives (such as propofol and dexmedetomidine)&#xD;
      are preferable to benzodiazepine sedatives (such as midazolam and lorazepam) in critically&#xD;
      ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Moreover, continuous use of benzodiazepine (more than&#xD;
      48 hours) has been associated with a risk of prolonged sedation and delirium. On the other&#xD;
      hand, though propofol has a remarkable safety profile, it carries unfavorable side effects&#xD;
      such as dose-dependent hypotension, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, and propofol syndrome&#xD;
      (which is a rare but potentially fatal complication, associated with high-dose propofol&#xD;
      infusions, and characterized by severe metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an enormous number of patients&#xD;
      required mechanical ventilation, which led to the shortage of traditional sedatives such as&#xD;
      propofol, dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and lorazepam in the hospitals. In this challenging&#xD;
      time, ketamine was used as an alternative sedative infusion. This study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether ketamine is safer compared to other sedatives in severe COVID related ARDS patients.&#xD;
