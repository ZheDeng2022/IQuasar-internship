  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the sensory return of DIEP flaps with nerve&#xD;
      connection to DIEP flaps with no nerve connection to see which is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done because the presence of sensation in a reconstructed breast has&#xD;
      been shown to improve patient-related quality of life following mastectomy reconstruction and&#xD;
      is an important safety factor for prevention of burns and other flap injuries. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      women who have breast skin excised during mastectomy are reconstructed with a traditional&#xD;
      DIEP flap that does not restore sensation to the skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap is the current standard of care in breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. The DIEP flap does not normally have sensation restored. The presence of&#xD;
      sensation in a reconstructed breast has been shown to improve patient-rated quality of life&#xD;
      following mastectomy and reconstruction and is an important safety factor for prevention of&#xD;
      burns and other flap injuries. Unfortunately, women who have breast skin excised during&#xD;
      mastectomy are reconstructed with a traditional DIEP flap that does not restore sensation to&#xD;
      the skin. As such, the investigators aim to perform a prospective randomized single-blinded&#xD;
      trial to evaluate sensory return to DIEP flaps following nerve coaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded, prospective study will be performed involving Manitoban women over 18 years&#xD;
      undergoing bilateral breast reconstruction with DIEP flaps. The women will have one breast&#xD;
      reconstructed in the standard of care (DIEP flap with no nerve coaptation) and one breast&#xD;
      reconstructed with both DIEP flap and sensory nerve coaptation; the side of coaptation will&#xD;
      be randomized. Objective sensibility to the breast will be tested pre- and post-operatively&#xD;
      (3, 6, 12 months) using the Pressure Specified Sensory Device (PSSD). Patients will also&#xD;
      complete the Breast Q questionnaire postoperatively.&#xD;

    <description>The donor nerve is a cutaneous nerve that is identified with the most inferior lateral perforator vessels. The nerve is then dissected for neurotization and divided at the level of the fascia where it is a pure sensory nerve. The recipient intercostal nerve is usually easily identified in the third intercostal space during the dissection of the internal mammary artery and vein. The anterior branch of the third intercostal nerve can usually be found at the junction of the inferior portion of the third rib and the sternum, approximately 80% of the time. The nerve is dissected and transected medially. It is then mobilized to give it the longest length possible in preparation for neurotization. Neurotization is performed by coapting the donor nerve to the third anterior intercostal nerve directly with a 9-0 nylon suture in standard fashion.</description>
