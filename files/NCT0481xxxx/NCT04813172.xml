      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multidimensional symptom assessment&#xD;
      intervention on identifying symptoms and alerting care team of changes, and thus reducing&#xD;
      hospital utilization, in patients undergoing radiation with or without chemotherapy for head&#xD;
      and neck cancer. This is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is being conducted to 1) examine the symptomatology of head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients undergoing treatment that includes radiation, 2) determine the hospital admission&#xD;
      rates of this patient population before, during and post treatment, 3) compare the admission&#xD;
      rates of this patient population to historical controls and 4) to examine overall patient&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;

    <measure>M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory for Head and Neck Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of treatment to 3 month post treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory for Head and neck Cancer is to assess the severity of symptoms experienced by patients with cancer and the interference with daily living caused by these symptoms.&#xD;
It uses a 0-10 scale &quot;0&quot; (the symptom was &quot;NOT present&quot;) to &quot;10&quot; (the symptom was &quot;As bad as you can imagine&quot;). Higher score is worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Index (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of treatment to 3 month post treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning in the past 24 hours.&#xD;
It uses a 0-10 scale &quot;0&quot; (the symptom was &quot;NOT present&quot;) to &quot;10&quot; (the symptom was &quot;As bad as you can imagine&quot;).&#xD;
The higher the score is worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Head and neck Cancer assesses 5 domains Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being over the past 7 days.&#xD;
It uses a 5 point Likert Scale: Not at all, A little bit, Somewhat, Quite a bit, Very much to rate functioning in the 5 domains.&#xD;
The higher the score, the better the outcome/quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Start of treatment to 3 month post treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>This self-assessment tool is designed to assess the effects of hearing loss and impairment while going through radiation treatment.&#xD;
It is a 10 item instrument that patients select YES, SOMETIMES or NO for each question.&#xD;
A total possible score ranges from minimum score of 0 to maximum score of 40.&#xD;
The higher the score, the more handicap they have due to hearing loss and impairment.</description>

    <description>Examine the symptomatology of head and neck cancer patients undergoing treatment that includes radiation by completing the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory for Head and Neck Cancer (MDASI-HN), the Brief Pain Index (BPI)and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer (FACT-H&amp;N). They will also be asked to complete the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults - Screening (HHIA-S) and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory - Screening (THI-S) as well as the Flourishing Measure.&#xD;
Each patient enrolled will be followed by a nurse and speech-language pathologist, twice a week, throughout their treatment (from start until 3-month post completion) All assessments are collected on a secure Ipad through REDcap database. If any significant changes occur, within 2 points from their last assessment, the nurse will notify the oncology physician and provide plan of care to avoid emergency room or hospital visit.</description>
