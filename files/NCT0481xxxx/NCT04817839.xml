  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare postoperative outcomes and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      between 3 and 6-week postoperative restrictions after a midurethral sling procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients undergoing midurethral sling&#xD;
      placement for stress urinary incontinence will be asked to participate in the study. If&#xD;
      eligible and willing to participate, patients will be randomized to a &quot;3 weeks post-operative&#xD;
      restriction&quot; or &quot;6-week post-operative restriction&quot; of activities group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, pelvic surgeons' recommendations for activity and lifting restrictions during&#xD;
      post-operative period vary widely from 1 to 50 pounds (10). Given variation in literature and&#xD;
      reasonable expectations for lifting restrictions, 20-pound lifting restriction was considered&#xD;
      to be a reasonable and attainable expectation from patients. Both groups will be given an&#xD;
      identical set of postoperative instructions which include refrainment from lifting anything&#xD;
      over 20 pounds, avoid strenuous exercise, running, or perform high-impact aerobic activities&#xD;
      during the restricted activity period. Depending on their random allocation, patients will&#xD;
      follow these instructions either for 3 or 6 postoperative weeks. The activities which all&#xD;
      patients will be allowed to do during their postoperative recovery include walking, using&#xD;
      stairs and showering in both groups. All patient will be asked to refrain from sexual&#xD;
      intercourse for 6 weeks consistent with current routine post op recommendations (6). Other&#xD;
      than the time of activity restriction post op (heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, running,&#xD;
      high impact exercise), patients will receive identical postoperative instructions otherwise.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in urogenital distress inventory (UDI) stress score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>UDI form calculator assesses life quality and symptom distress in women suffering from urinary incontinence. The range is 0 to 70, higher means worse, lowers means better (higher is more symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) is a global index that may be used to rate the response of a condition to a therapy (transition scale). The PGI-I is a transition scale that is a single question asking the patient to rate their urinary tract condition now, as compared with how it was prior to before beginning treatment on a scale from 1 (Very much better) to 7 (Very much worse)</description>

    <measure>Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ) short form at 6 months. The IIQ-7 has 7 questions that evaluate quality of life related to urinary symptoms. Item responses are assigned values of 0 for &quot;not at all,&quot; 1 for &quot;slightly,&quot; 2 for &quot;moderately,&quot; and 3 for &quot;greatly.&quot; The average score of items responded to is calculated. The average, which ranges from 0 to 3, is multiplied by 33 1/3 to put scores on a scale of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate worse quality of life .</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Satisfaction Post-Operative Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire that will evaluate patient's satisfaction. Assessed on a 5-point Likert scale with question &quot;How satisfied are you with the result of your incontinence surgery.&quot; Range is 0-5. Higher number means more satisfied.</description>

    <measure>Activity Assessment Scale (AAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a 13-item postoperative functional activity scale. The AAS is scored from zero to 100 (higher scores=better activity function).</description>
