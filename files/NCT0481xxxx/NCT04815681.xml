  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are evaluating the effects of an online single-session mental health&#xD;
      intervention (the Common Elements Toolbox; COMET). To evaluate COMET, the investigators are&#xD;
      conducting a randomized controlled trial with Greek adolescents attending high school in the&#xD;
      Attica region in Greece. Students will be randomized to the COMET condition or to an active&#xD;
      control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, subjective well-being) will&#xD;
      be measured at two weeks post-intervention and four weeks post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate COMET as a universal intervention (using the full sample) and&#xD;
      as a targeted intervention (analyzing those who reported elevated depressive symptoms or&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms at baseline).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Depression questionnaire. Scores range from 0 to 24. Lower scores indicate less depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety questionnaire. Total scores range from 0-21. Lower scores indicate less anxiety.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Well-being questionnaire. Total scores range from 7 to 35. Higher values indicate higher well-being scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings on the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring the acceptability of an intervention. Acceptability refers to the perception that a given treatment is agreeable or satisfactory. The total score ranges from 4 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher acceptability ratings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings on the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring the appropriateness of an intervention. Appropriateness refers to the perceived fit or relevance of an intervention. The total score ranges from 4 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher appropriateness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask participants three items to assess secondary control (Weisz et al., 2010). The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;Very false&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Very true&quot;). The three items are: When something bad happens, I can find a way to think about it that makes me feel better. After a really hard day, I can make myself feel better by remembering some good things that happened. When bad things happen to me that I can't control, there are lots of things I can do to feel better. Higher scores indicate greater secondary control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Utility</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate three items relating to the perceived utility of each module. Specifically, the investigators asked participants: How helpful the module was; How engaging the module was; How much they will continue applying content from the module. If items are at least moderately correlated (r &gt; .5) the investigators will combine them in a single measure of perceived utility. Higher scores indicate greater perceived utility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring positive affect and negative affect. Scores on the positive affect subscale range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect. Scores on the negative affect subscale range from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>
