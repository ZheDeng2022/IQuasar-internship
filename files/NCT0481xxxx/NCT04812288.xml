      The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between oxygenation of calf muscles&#xD;
      and physical performance including balance, gait speed, and endurance in older adults by&#xD;
      utilizing the NIRS device. The investigators want to determine the relationship between&#xD;
      different types of tests and oxygenation for older adults with 4 levels of physical activity.&#xD;
      This study will help towards identifying possible short and effective exercises for older&#xD;
      adults with different activity levels.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>time to reach the minimum muscular oxygenation level (Only measure one time at a single time point, does not measure changes)</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>recovery of muscular oxygenation (Only measure one time at a single time point, does not measure changes)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1</time_frame>
    <description>the muscular oxygenation difference in percentage between the first second and the last second after finishing the bilateral heel raise test for 1 minute</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>time to finish the Timed Up and Go test (Only measure one time at a single time point, does not measure changes)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures time in seconds to finish the Timed Up and Go test from standing from a chair, walking for 3-meter distance, turning around, going back and sitting down. Less seconds means higher mobility. Higher than 12 seconds indicates risk of falls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery score (Only measure one time at a single time point, does not measure changes)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1</time_frame>
    <description>Three parts including balance, gait speed, and chair stand test are measured. Full points of each part is 4. The score range is from 0 to 12 points. Higher score means higher physical function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>distance finished in the 2-Minute Walking test (Only measure one time at a single time point, does not measure changes)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the maximum distance in meters covered in 2 minutes. Longer distance means better endurance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the number of heel raise finished within one minute (Only measure one time at a single time point, does not measure changes)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the number of heel raise that participants can complete within one minute. More heel raise times means more endurance at the calf muscle.</description>
