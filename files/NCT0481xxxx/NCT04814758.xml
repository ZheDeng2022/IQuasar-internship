  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initially, or after preoperative chemotherapy, patients with a kidney tumor are examined on&#xD;
      3T MR scanner or 1.5T MR scanner. A standard MRI study of the abdomen with contrast&#xD;
      enhancement is performed. DWI (diffusion weighted) images are included in the standard&#xD;
      investigation package and consist of diffusion maps. Then, using Philips workstation (ISP&#xD;
      9.0, Philips, Netherlands), DWI mapping and ADC values collection (mm2/s) are performed. The&#xD;
      placement of region of interest (ROI) is selected in the kidney mass in a solid and cystic&#xD;
      area with a size up to 100 mm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the preoperative abdomen MRI, a surgical treatment is performed. Histological material&#xD;
      is directed to the pathologist, who carried out the histological staging by the malignancy&#xD;
      degree (low, intermediate, high). The data is entered into the database and the relationship&#xD;
      between ADC values and histological degrees of malignancy of nephroblastoma is investigated&#xD;

      Initially, or after preoperative chemotherapy, patients with a kidney tumor are examined on&#xD;
      3T MR scanner or 1.5T MR scanner, using 8-channel body coil. A standard MRI study of the&#xD;
      abdomen with contrast enhancement is performed. DWI (diffusion weighted) images are included&#xD;
      in the standard investigation package and consist of diffusion maps (DWI 3b) with 3 b-factors&#xD;
      (50; 600; 800 or others, optional). Then, using Philips workstation (ISP 9.0, Philips,&#xD;
      Netherlands), DWI mapping and ADC values collection (mm2/s) are performed. The placement of&#xD;
      region of interest (ROI) is selected in the kidney mass in a solid and cystic area with a&#xD;
      size up to 100 mm2. The values are entered in the table due to the stage of the chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the preoperative abdomen MRI, a surgical treatment is performed. Histological material&#xD;
      is directed to the pathologist, who carried out the histological staging by the malignancy&#xD;
      degree (low, intermediate, high). The data is entered into the database and the relationship&#xD;
      between ADC values and histological degrees of malignancy of nephroblastoma is investigated.&#xD;
