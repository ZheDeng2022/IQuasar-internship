  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to collect clinical data on the performance of MonoPlus®&#xD;
      suture applied in routine clinical practice. Diverse parameters are to be used to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of MonoPlus® suture for gastrointestinal anastomosis construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to implement an action within the framework of a proactive Post&#xD;
      Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF) activity.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by respondents and it takes only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages - descriptive system and the EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondents self rated health on a 20 cm vertical , visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;</description>
