  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, single centre study of investigational drug selinexor in&#xD;
      participants with soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be treated with standard therapies.&#xD;
      Selinexor has been given to 3111 participants with cancer to date including 142 sarcoma&#xD;
      patients. Early findings have shown that selinexor is effective in multiple cancer types. The&#xD;
      current study is being done to test low doses and different dosing schedules of selinexor to&#xD;
      find out if it reduces the side effects without compromising the benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 groups or Arms: Arm A and Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (Dose escalation Arm): Participants will receive selinexor by mouth 4 days a week to&#xD;
      find out the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor effect of low doses of Selinexor in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST),&#xD;
      endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS). Participants will continue on&#xD;
      study until disease progression or unacceptable side effects. Up to 36 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this Arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Participants with any soft tissue sarcoma subtypes will be enrolled in this Arm. They&#xD;
      will receive flat doses of Selinexor by mouth once weekly, 3 times a day. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be assessed in this Arm. Up to 20 participants will be enrolled and they&#xD;
      will continue to receive selinexor until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of human cells. One of the ways cancers cells continue to&#xD;
      grow is by getting rid of proteins called &quot;tumor suppressor proteins&quot; that would normally&#xD;
      cause cancer cells to die. The study drug works by trapping &quot;tumor suppressor proteins&quot;&#xD;
      within the cell, causing the cancer cells to die or stop growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises 3 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Study Drug (until disease&#xD;
      progression), and Survival Follow-Up (once every 3 months). Procedures for research purposes&#xD;
      only will include blood collection and study questionnaire.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue sarcomas (STS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      STS are a group of heterogeneous mesenchymal derived tumors with many histological types that&#xD;
      account for approximately 1% of adult tumors and 15% of pediatric tumors. STS can be divided&#xD;
      into those with simple genetic alterations (e.g. translocations or activating mutations) or&#xD;
      karyotypic complex lesions. However, most subclasses are treated in the same manner. Surgery&#xD;
      is the primary treatment for localized STS, with or without radiation therapy (RT), but&#xD;
      approximately 10% of patients will present with metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who present with metastatic disease, or those with locally advanced/unresectable&#xD;
      or have failed primary therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy is usually the treatment of choice&#xD;
      which may provide meaningful palliation or prolong survival. Traditionally, doxorubicin&#xD;
      containing regimens, in combination with ifosfamide or as a single agent are standard first&#xD;
      line therapies. Combination based doxorubicin containing regimens have shown higher response&#xD;
      rates and progression free survival at the expense of more toxicity when compared to&#xD;
      doxorubicin alone. However, no combination regimen has been associated with increased overall&#xD;
      survival compared to doxorubicin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the metastatic setting, STS carry a poor prognosis related to a lack of chemo-sensitivity&#xD;
      and a lack of systemic therapeutic options. Exportin 1 (XPO1 or chromosome region maintenance&#xD;
      1 [CRM1]) is the sole nuclear exporter of some tumor suppressor proteins (TSP). XPO1 is&#xD;
      over-expressed 2-4 fold in a variety of solid and hematological tumors with higher levels&#xD;
      correlating with poorer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selinexor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selinexor is a novel, oral, small-molecule XPO1 inhibitor which forces reactivation of TSPs&#xD;
      and thus leads to apoptosis of tumor cells. Preclinical data of Selinexor has shown promising&#xD;
      in-vitro tumor regression in sarcoma. In two phase I studies, single agent clinical activity&#xD;
      in the form of prolonged stable disease was seen in STS. Twice weekly dosing aided&#xD;
      tolerability with a MTD declared at 65mg/m2 for solid tumors and 60mg flat dosing was the&#xD;
      RP2D based on better tolerability given problems related to gastrointestinal toxicity however&#xD;
      these doses were still difficult for patients to take due to the toxicity profile. A Phase 1b&#xD;
      study has been performed combining Selinexor once weekly oral dosing with doxorubicin given&#xD;
      at the standard 3 weekly dose in advanced soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have provided a signal of increased likelihood of benefit to particular&#xD;
      subtypes including metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) and&#xD;
      endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS). In the early phase studies, objective responses or&#xD;
      prolonged stable disease were demonstrated (n=3 for both MPNST and ESS). In this study, the&#xD;
      investigator also plans to include leiomyosarcoma (LMS) - such strategy will allow not only&#xD;
      seamless recruitment, but also generate treatment efficacy data for other rare types of&#xD;
      sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, preclinical data has shown efficacy in using metronomic dosing of Selinexor.&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesizes that low dose Selinexor will improve tolerability of the drug&#xD;
      without impacting the clinical benefit that has been seen in other studies for patients with&#xD;
      particular histological subtypes of STS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 2500 patients with advanced cancers have received Selinexor orally in Phase 1 and&#xD;
      Phase 2-3 studies as of 31 May 2019. Based on the preclinical and clinical findings to date,&#xD;
      Selinexor dosing is limited to ≤70 mg/m2 (≤120 mg) maximum dose in adults. The plan going&#xD;
      forward is that Selinexor will be administered primarily as fixed milligram doses, as&#xD;
      analyses of Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) data indicated that exposure is not strongly&#xD;
      correlated with Body Surface Area (BSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of preliminary results was performed to determine the RP2D for future&#xD;
      studies. The results of this analysis suggest that, overall, Selinexor doses &gt; 65 mg do not&#xD;
      appear to provide additional efficacy responses beyond those seen with the 60 mg dose&#xD;
      (described herein as 45-65 mg dose level, median 60 mg) with the exception of activity in&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma (MM), where the RP2D is Selinexor 80 mg in combination with 20mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone. Importantly, response results with Selinexor 45-65 mg twice weekly were&#xD;
      comparable for both hematologic malignancies (excluding MM) and solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently available selinexor formulation (20 mg tablet) and dosage is quite toxic&#xD;
      particularly in terms of gastrointestinal disturbance, particularly nausea and vomiting. As a&#xD;
      result of these difficulties it might be beneficial to investigate alternate formulations of&#xD;
      selinexor or a different dosing schedule of the currently available selinexor formulation. A&#xD;
      PK study in male Beagle dogs has been completed by Karyopharm investigating a new extended&#xD;
      release (ER) formulation of Selinexor 20 mg tablets showing favorable results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Schedule Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, Selinexor will be given using two different schedules according to&#xD;
      Schema for Arm A (metronomic) and Schema for Arm B (split dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm A Selinexor will be administered at a fixed oral dose as per dose level (starting at&#xD;
      2.5mg PO 4 days on, 3 days off repeated weekly) of each 4-week (28-day) cycle a total of 16&#xD;
      doses per cycle. The maximum dose for Selinexor in this study will be 17.5mg PO flat dosing 4&#xD;
      days on, 3 days off, weekly. This arm of the study will be aimed at identifying the RP2D and&#xD;
      toxicity profile of this new selinexor dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm B patients will be treated with Selinexor 40mg in the morning, 20mg in the afternoon&#xD;
      and 20mg at night on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. The hope is that this alternate&#xD;
      dosing schedule will improve the tolerability of this formulation of selinexor without&#xD;
      impacting its clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and mode of delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm A patients will receive Selinexor orally as described above. The initial 3 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to the first Selinexor dose level of 2.5mg (DL1). Three patients will be&#xD;
      assessed per cohort for at least 1 cycle and dose escalation or de-escalation rules will&#xD;
      follow 3+3 dosing. The first dose of study treatment for the first two patients will be&#xD;
      staggered by 7 days. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted at any time during the&#xD;
      treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm B also patients will receive selinexor orally as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Intervention and Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in both arms with Selinexor will be repeated on a 28-day cycle until radiographic&#xD;
      or symptomatic progression on imaging or the development of unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      will be restaged every 2 cycles until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
      Subsequent follow-up for disease progression will continue by telephone or review of patient&#xD;
      medical records for up to 2 years after the completion of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 36 patients will be accrued in Arm A. Up to 20 patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Arm B with an anticipated accrual period of 12 to 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of dose limiting toxicity (DLT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT is defined as any of the following occurring in the first 28 days of each dose level that&#xD;
      is considered at least possibly related to drug administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ≥ 4 missed doses (out of 16) due to a toxicity that is at least possibly study drug related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of a patient due a toxicity that is at least possibly study drug related&#xD;
      before completing cycle 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Hematologic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade ≥ 3 nausea/vomiting, dehydration or diarrhea while taking optimal supportive&#xD;
      medications Grade 3 fatigue lasting for ≥ 7 days while taking optimal supportive care and&#xD;
      with correction of dehydration, anorexia, anemia, endocrine, or electrolyte abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation lasting longer than 7 days OR Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation in&#xD;
      the setting of bilirubin elevation &gt; 2x ULN (&gt; 2X baseline for patients with Gilbert's&#xD;
      syndrome) OR any grade 4 AST or ALT elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any other clinically significant Grade ≥ 3 non-hematological toxicity except alopecia or&#xD;
      electrolyte abnormalities correctable with supportive therapy Any cardiac disorder ≥ CTCAE&#xD;
      Grade 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematologic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 4 neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 0.5x109/L] on Cycle 2 Day 1 that does&#xD;
      not resolve to G1 within 7 days Grade 4 neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;&#xD;
      0.5x109/L] within the first 28 days lasting ≥ 7 days Grade 3 Febrile neutropenia Grade ≥ 3&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding Grade 4 thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      within the first 28 days (platelets &lt; 25x109/L) lasting &gt; 7days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity that results in the inability to administer day 1&#xD;
      of the next planned cycle within 14 days of the planned end of the previous cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment related death During the dose escalation portion of the study, patients who missed&#xD;
      &gt;1 dose of Selinexor during Cycle 1 for reasons unrelated to study drug are not evaluable for&#xD;
      DLT and will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Discontinuation Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression Noncompliance with protocol Need for treatment with medications not&#xD;
      allowed by the study protocol Consent withdrawal Intercurrent illness Incidence or severity&#xD;
      of AEs Investigator discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period for an individual patient is expected to be approximately between 2 and&#xD;
      12 months, however there is no maximum treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm A the starting dose of Selinexor will be 2.5mg given 4 days on 3 days off on a weekly&#xD;
      basis as part of a 28-day cycle. For Arm B patients will receive oral Selinexor 40 mg in the&#xD;
      morning, 20 mg in the afternoon, 20 mg in the evening. Patients will be assessed for response&#xD;
      after ever 2 cycles. Treatment will be given until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall safety profile as per NCI CTCAE version 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive best supportive care, including anti-emetics, appetite stimulants and&#xD;
      growth factors, blood product transfusions, antimicrobials and (as appropriate) granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) for neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection,&#xD;
      erythropoietin for anemia, and/or platelet-stimulating factors for thrombocytopenia. Patients&#xD;
      will not be dosed with G-CSF in the first cycle for primary prophylaxis of febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If clinically indicated and as required by protocol, patients may receive red blood cell or&#xD;
      platelet transfusions, acetaminophen, serotonin (5-HT3) receptor subtype antagonists (e.g.,&#xD;
      ondansetron) megestrol acetate, and olanzapine in addition to ondansetron. Patients&#xD;
      intolerant to 5-HT3 antagonists may receive D2-antagonists instead. Additional anti-nausea&#xD;
      and anti-anorexia agents may be given as needed. Patients may continue to receive baseline&#xD;
      medication(s), and may receive concomitant medications that are medically necessary as&#xD;
      standard care to treat co-morbid diseases, AEs, and intercurrent illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent therapy with any other approved or investigative anticancer therapy is not&#xD;
      allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK will be determined at various times following administration of Selinexor in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the metronomic arm for the first 3 patients in each dose level, blood samples just before&#xD;
      Selinexor administration (C1D1), and at 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 24hr and a trough level pre C2 will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective disease response assessment will be made according to standard, international&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria for solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Variables and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of Selinexor will be evaluated by means of drug related DLT, AE&#xD;
      reports, physical examinations, and clinically significant laboratory safety evaluations. NCI&#xD;
      CTCAE version 5.0 will be used for grading of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will provide their assessment of causality as: unrelated, possibly related, or&#xD;
      probably or definitely related for all AEs.&#xD;

    <description>This Arm is an open-label, non-randomized, phase 1 study of metronomic dosing of selinexor in patients with locally advanced or metastatic MPNST, ESS, LMS. Up to seven dose levels of Selinexor will be investigated.&#xD;
Patients will undergo 3+3 based dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Selinexor.&#xD;
Escalating doses of selinexor will be given starting with 2.5 mg (taken orally 4 days in a row followed by 3 days break from treatment, repeating this weekly as part of a 28-day cycle). The first dose for the first 2 patients at each dose level will be staggered by 7 days. Minimum number of patients treated in this trial arm is 18 patients, and maximum 36 patients.&#xD;
Schedule:&#xD;
Selinexor flat dosing with dose levels (DLs) of 2.5mg (DL1), 5mg (DL2), 7.5mg (DL3), 10mg (DL4), 12.5mg (DL5), 15mg (DL6), 17.5mg (DL7). A DL-1 (1.25 mg) is also incorporated.</description>
