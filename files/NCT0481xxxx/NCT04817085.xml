  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility and safety of the Visant&#xD;
      Medical Canalicular Plug compared to a commercially available canalicular plug over 6 months&#xD;
      of subject follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects who are eligible for enrollment and have provided written informed consent&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (i.e., 2 subjects randomized to the Visant Medical&#xD;
      Canalicular Plug for every 1 subject randomized to a commercially available canalicular&#xD;
      plug). All study subjects will be treated bilaterally with plugs placed in the inferior&#xD;
      canaliculi.&#xD;
