  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been suggested as a useful tool in&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) for diagnosis and treatment of reversible causes.&#xD;
      However, in prehospital emergency medicine performing ultrasound and the translation of the&#xD;
      findings can be challenging. As new prehospital ultrasound devices offer the possibility for&#xD;
      remote supervision, the impact of tele-supervision on the performance of POCUS during OHCA is&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This prospective observational study aims to evaluate if POCUS with tele-supervision&#xD;
      can be performed during CPR without any additional hands-off periods longer than 5 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In total 30 patients with OHCA, where POCUS is considered, will be included in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
