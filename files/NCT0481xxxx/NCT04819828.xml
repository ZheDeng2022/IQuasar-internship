      Urolithiasis is a common health problem worldwide affecting approximately 10% of the&#xD;
      population at some stage in their lives. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment with tamsulosin for improving the stone-free rate after a single session&#xD;
      of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in the treatment of radiopaque kidney stones.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urolithiasis is a common health problem worldwide affecting ∼10% of the population at some&#xD;
      stage in their lives. It affects approximately 5% of women and 12% of men in the United&#xD;
      States, and it has been suggested that the incidence is increasing. Because of its efficacy&#xD;
      and low morbidity, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      kidney stones smaller than 20 mm in diameter. The objective of this therapy is to achieve an&#xD;
      adequate fragmentation of the calculus that allows a spontaneous expulsion of the fragments,&#xD;
      and finally, a stone-free state, which is not always possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of adrenergic receptors in the ureter has suggested the involvement of the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system in its peristaltic activity. It has also been shown that alpha 1&#xD;
      adrenergic antagonist medications such as tamsulosin are capable of inhibiting the basal tone&#xD;
      and the ureteral peristalsis, causing dilation and facilitating the migration of stones. Some&#xD;
      authors have reported the efficacy of this type of medication for spontaneous calculus&#xD;
      expulsion, but there is no conclusive evidence of the adjuvant effectiveness of tamsulosin&#xD;
      after ESWL for stone clearance and even less among a Mexican population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, non-placebo-controlled study with a sample of adults&#xD;
      (men and women ≥18 years old) with a single radiopaque kidney stone (5-20 mm) in diameter.&#xD;
      Post-ESWL session, the patients will be randomly divided into two groups (the control group&#xD;
      and the tamsulosin group). After discharge, all patients will be instructed to drink a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 L water daily. The control group will receive standard treatment for analgesia&#xD;
      consisting of oral diclofenac (75 mg/12 h) as needed. The tamsulosin group will receive&#xD;
      standard treatment for analgesia plus oral tamsulosin (0.4 mg/day) for eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend follow-up visits every two weeks during the first month of treatment and&#xD;
      a final visit at the end of the second month. During each visit, vital signs will be taken, a&#xD;
      physical examination will be conducted, and possible adverse effects will be monitored;&#xD;
      additionally, a plain X-ray of the kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) will be taken at two and&#xD;
      four weeks for evaluating possible complications associated with residual fragments, as well&#xD;
      as an abdominal CT scan at eight weeks after the ESWL in order to determine stone-free&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using R Statistical Software. Descriptive statistics will be determined&#xD;
      for the patients' clinical characteristics, grouped by the treatment assigned (control group&#xD;
      and tamsulosin group) and will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test or the chi-square&#xD;
      test depending on the variable type. The strength of the association between the ESWL&#xD;
      treatment with adjuvant tamsulosin and the stone-free rate will be evaluated by calculating&#xD;
      the relative risk (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT). In all cases, an alpha=0.05 was&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
