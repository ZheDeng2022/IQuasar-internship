    <textblock>
      This study intends to perform high-intensity focused ultrasound combined with REGOTORI in&#xD;
      patients with multiline drug-resistant metastatic colorectal cancer to explore the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of patients. Patients receive HIFU local treatment combined with REGOTORI treatment,&#xD;
      and receive corresponding clinical data collection at different follow-up points, including&#xD;
      necessary data from various laboratories, CT/MRI, and immune function tests that are exactly&#xD;
      the same as before surgery collection.&#xD;
