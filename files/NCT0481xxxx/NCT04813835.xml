      evaluation whether suicidal major depressive disorder patients show a specific pattern of&#xD;
      cognitive, sleep and neurophysiologic impairment as compared to non- suicidal major&#xD;
      depressive disorder patient, and studying the correlation between the cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      the sleep disturbance and the neurophysiologic impairment and suicidal behaviour Studying the&#xD;
      cognitive profile in suicidal patient including studying, Comprehension, Attention, language&#xD;

      Suicide defined as when a person killing himself directly or indirectly act, with knowing&#xD;
      that will produce this result carried out by the victim himself .Suicide is 14th leading&#xD;
      cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1.5% of all mortality .suicide is the cause of&#xD;
      death most directly affected by psychological factors. There is other stressors such as&#xD;
      financial troubles, poverty, unemployment, homelessness and war may cause suicide. About&#xD;
      (15-40%) of people leave a suicide note. Genetics appear to account for between 38% and 55%&#xD;
      of suicidal behaviors . Suicide rates differ significantly between countries and over time.&#xD;
      Percentage of death in 2013 in Africa was 1% Canada 11.1% china 12.7% India 23.2% and united&#xD;
      states 14%. suicide is ranked as 10th leading cause of death in the united states. In china&#xD;
      suicide is 5th leading cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of all the psychiatric disorders. major depressive disorder in associated with the highest&#xD;
      life time risk of suicide attempt and completion. Indeed. the life time risk of completing&#xD;
      suicide in patient with (MDD) range from (35- 40 %, )in the world. Also in patient of mood&#xD;
      disorder (MD) range about (8-15 %) of patient attempt suicide In an suicide attempt must be&#xD;
      understand how and why some people's thought process lead them to decide to end their lives,&#xD;
      there is several different cognitive impairment factors that seem to increase the risk of&#xD;
      suicidal behavior such as cognitive rigidity, thought suppression. Agitation. Future thinking&#xD;
      and goal adjustment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding from studies in which behavioral test of cognitive rigidity are administrated to&#xD;
      suicide attempter and clinical controls have support this notion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      studies illustrate the importance of control the sleep disorders as there is relationship&#xD;
      between sleep disorders and suicidal behavior and subsequent suicidal thoughts and either&#xD;
      self-harm behaviors or suicide attempt after controlling depressive symptoms Some studies&#xD;
      have shown neurophysiologic aspects of suicidal behavior. An attempt has been made to reveal&#xD;
      a correlation of results obtained in calculating the entropy and information Saturation of&#xD;
      EEG with signs of dysontogenesis in patients with depression with- or without suicidal signs&#xD;

    <description>to determine the cognitive impairment among depressed suicidal patient compared to not depressed persons and to depressed non suicidal patients by 1-Mini-mental state examination: It as a basic tool used to assess the cognitive function; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills&#xD;
Montreal cognitive assessment scale:&#xD;
The test is a one-page 30-point test administered in approximately 10 minutes. Each participant had the test individually. it was used to assess several domains of cognition such as the short term memory recall task (5 points) involves two learning trials of five nouns and delayed recall after approximately 5minutes</description>
