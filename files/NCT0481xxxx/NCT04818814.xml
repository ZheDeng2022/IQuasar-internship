  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if using an app is a feasible and acceptable&#xD;
      treatment for chronic pain in persons with spinal cord injury. Participants will have a 50%&#xD;
      chance of being asked to listen to 10 minutes of audio-guided meditations using an app each&#xD;
      day for six weeks, and a 50% chance of being asked to listen to 10 minutes of engaging and&#xD;
      distracting presentations about topics of interest to the individual (TED Talks) for six&#xD;
      weeks. All participants will be asked to complete three online surveys about their emotional&#xD;
      and physical health lasting 20-30 minutes (one when the participant first enters the study,&#xD;
      one six weeks later, and another six weeks later). Additionally, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete brief (&lt;5 minute) online surveys once a week during the first six weeks of their&#xD;
      participation. Participation in this study is very low risk, and participants may not&#xD;
      experience any personal benefit from their participation. Participation in this study is&#xD;
      entirely voluntary.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the MM condition will be asked to download and use the free Mindfulness Coach app (available for iOS and Android platforms) developed by the Veteran Affairs National Center for PTSD. The app offers written information about mindfulness as well as 12 audio-guided meditations each lasting 8-13 minutes. Participants will attend a live videochat orientation to the study with the research coordinator (RC) to receive assistance in downloading and using the app. Participants will be asked to listen to at least one, and ideally two, audio-guided meditation exercises using the app daily for six weeks. The RC will ask participants to complete weekly logs of their MM app use via a Qualtrics survey sent via email.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the Engagement and Distraction condition will be asked to download and use the free TED Talk app (available for iOS and Android platforms). The app offers many videos of engaging and distracting presentations about technology, entertainment, and design. The research coordinator will work with the participant to create a customized list of Ted Talk videos, each lasting 6-12 minutes, based on participants' personal interests. Participants will be asked to listen to or watch at least one, and ideally two, presentations using the app daily for six weeks. The research coordinator will ask participants to complete weekly logs of their TED Talk app use via a Qualtrics survey sent via email.</description>
