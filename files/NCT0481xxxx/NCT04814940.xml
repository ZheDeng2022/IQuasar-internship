  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to describe the treatment patterns&#xD;
      with MENOPUR and to understand the clinical impact for patients that underwent infertility&#xD;
      treatment under real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to describe the treatment patterns for the general population and&#xD;
      for selected patient profiles.&#xD;
