  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are the firt cause of congenital malformations (8 for 1000&#xD;
      births). Since the 90's, great advances in prenatal diagnosis, pediatric cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      intensive care, and cardiac catheterization have reduced morbidity and early mortality in&#xD;
      this population. Nowadays, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment of this&#xD;
      population is in the foreground. Our team is a tertiary care center for management of&#xD;
      patients with CHD, from the fetal period to adulthood. The investigators have been conducting&#xD;
      a clinical research program on HRQoL in pediatric and CHD. The investigators thus&#xD;
      demonstrated the link between cardiopulmonary fitness and HRQoL in children with CHD aged 8&#xD;
      to 18 years, the correlation between functional class and HRQoL in adults with CHD, the&#xD;
      impact of therapeutic education on HRQoL in children under anticoagulants and the lack of&#xD;
      difference between the HRQoL of children CHD aged 5 to 7 years old and that of control&#xD;
      children. Currently, no controlled cross-sectional quality of life study assessment has been&#xD;
      leded in the youngest children with CHD. This present study therefore extends our work in&#xD;
      younger children aged 2 to 4 years.&#xD;

      248 patients will be enrolled in this study (124 children in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from group 1 will be included during their annual medical check-up. HRQoL&#xD;
      questionnaire, neurodevelopmental status scale and clinical status will be assessed during&#xD;
      this site visit. No supplementary visit, directly related to the research, will be necessary.&#xD;
      Three sites will participate to the study, members of he French national network for complex&#xD;
      congenital heart diseases (M3C) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (healthy children) from group 2 will be included from kindergartens and schools.&#xD;
      The prior agreement of the Ministry of National Education will be obtained before any&#xD;
      procedure related to this study.&#xD;
