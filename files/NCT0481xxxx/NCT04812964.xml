  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test and determine whether a high protein diet induces&#xD;
      weight loss by modulating the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome in&#xD;
      obesity. This will be investigated in a randomized clinical study comparing the effect of&#xD;
      isocaloric high and normal protein diets on the intestinal microbiome composition, gene&#xD;
      content, and metabolome of obese subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high protein diet has been shown in preclinical rodent models and clinical trials to be an&#xD;
      effective obesity treatment that is associated with greater loss of body weight and fat mass&#xD;
      and increased satiety compared to isocaloric standard protein diets. However, the mechanisms&#xD;
      of this response have not been fully elucidated. The investigators recently demonstrated in a&#xD;
      rodent model that a high protein diet induces shifts in the intestinal microbiome including a&#xD;
      bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, a microbe reported to have an anti-obesity effect. Based on&#xD;
      these preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that a high protein diet induces&#xD;
      alterations in the intestinal microbiome that mediate its clinical efficacy for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than three quarters of Veterans are overweight or obese, making obesity a public health&#xD;
      problem of tremendous importance to the VA medical system. The results of the proposed study&#xD;
      will provide insight into the specific microbes that drive the clinical response to a high&#xD;
      protein diet and may identify candidate anti-obesity microbes that could be further developed&#xD;
      into novel microbial therapeutics. More broadly, establishing a microbiome-dependent&#xD;
      mechanism for the efficacy of a dietary intervention would be a breakthrough in the&#xD;
      investigators' understanding of obesity treatment. It would pave the way for larger scale&#xD;
      clinical and translational studies investigating the role of the microbiota in other diets&#xD;
      and for the development of microbial therapeutics used alone or in combination with dietary&#xD;
      intervention to treat obese Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the role of the intestinal microbiome in mediating the effect of a high&#xD;
      protein diet, the investigators will study 216 overweight and obese Veterans (BMI 27) who&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to isocaloric high protein (30%) or normal protein (15%) 1500 calorie&#xD;
      diets for 16 weeks utilizing existing clinical infrastructure at the West Los Angeles VA&#xD;
      Medical Center established for a recently completed clinical trial of a high protein diet. In&#xD;
      Aim 1, the effect of a high protein diet on the composition and function of the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome will be assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics.&#xD;
      In Aim 2, bioinformatics analysis will be performed to identify fecal microbes, bacterial&#xD;
      genes, and metabolites that are associated with weight loss, reduced body fat, decreased&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis, altered lipid profiles, reduced hemoglobin A1c, decreased high sensitivity&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, increased satiety, and circulating levels of hormones affecting satiety&#xD;
      (leptin, ghrelin glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY).&#xD;
