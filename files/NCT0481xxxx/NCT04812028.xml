      To use magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia by implementing a treatment protocol in order&#xD;
      to determine whether can benefit pediatric pain in post-operative transplanted patients and&#xD;

      The post-operative ICU course for children receiving liver transplants and TPIAT (total&#xD;
      pancreatectomy with islet cell autotransplantation) includes a number of different&#xD;
      challenges, one of which includes pain. Pain is treated with both medications and approaches&#xD;
      without medications (such as music and other distraction techniques). Opioids are one such&#xD;
      effective pain medication which is universally used, however like all medications has risks&#xD;
      of certain side effects (such as nausea, constipation, itching, and others). Modern research&#xD;
      has searched for other medications and methods to treat pain in both children and adults. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators aim to apply one of these methods that has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in certain operative populations through a medicine called Magnesium-Sulfate, which&#xD;
      may be a safe way to decrease the use of other pain medications (specifically opioids).&#xD;
      Magnesium is already a physiologic electrolyte the body uses, which are consumed from certain&#xD;
      foods. Used as an IV medication to reach higher levels of magnesium can work to decrease pain&#xD;
      via its action on specific nerve receptors. Magnesium-Sulfate will be given at the beginning&#xD;
      of transplant surgery for consented liver and TPIAT transplant patients, and continue an&#xD;
      infusion for 48 hours into their ICU course. The investigators will monitor side effects and&#xD;
      treat pain the same way otherwise the care team would without magnesium to determine whether&#xD;
      there is any beneficial effect that can be applied to children in the future.&#xD;
