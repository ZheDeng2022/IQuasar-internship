  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is currently one of the most substantial health burdens. Due to the production of&#xD;
      marked and sustained weight loss, bariatric surgery is an increasingly used therapeutic&#xD;
      modality to combat obesity and its comorbidities. Surgical rearrangement of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract dramatically alters metabolism and hormones, and results in changes in&#xD;
      neurological and hypothalamic signalling, including affected gut-brain axis, which coalesce&#xD;
      to exert a profound influence on eating behaviour. In this context, many patients self-report&#xD;
      changes in appetite, satiety and food preferences. However, the mechanisms of such functional&#xD;
      changes, and how they relate to food decision-making remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot proof-of-concept study, the investigators propose a novel approach to unravel&#xD;
      the effect of bariatric surgery on the neural coding of nutritional attributes and its impact&#xD;
      on dietary choices using a combination of brain imaging, neurobehavioural tasks and&#xD;
      computational modelling of food behaviour.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to elucidate the changes in food behaviour among obese&#xD;
      adults undergoing bariatric surgery. To this end, the study consists of an experimental&#xD;
      setting combining neurobehavioural tasks, computational modelling and functional brain&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess changes in neural coding and food behaviour in obese adults&#xD;
      undergoing bariatric surgery. The investigators hypothesize that changes in the subjective&#xD;
      neural processes of nutritional food attributes are related to changes in the respective&#xD;
      neural coding structure. More specifically, if a given attribute has a more precise (i.e.,&#xD;
      more structured) neural representation after bariatric surgery, then these attributes should&#xD;
      exert more weight during dietary choices (and vice versa for more imprecise representations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The further objective is to elucidate if neural coding and food behaviour differ between&#xD;
      obese adults and lean adults, and to see whether these differences tend to be reduced&#xD;
      post-surgery among obese participants. The investigators hypothesize that subjective neural&#xD;
      processes of nutritional food attributes differ between the obese and control participants,&#xD;
      showing an unhealthier pattern among obese participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this aim, the outcomes will be compared between groups (surgery group and control group)&#xD;
      and the changes pre- and post- surgery will be assessed for the surgery group.&#xD;

    <description>Representational similarity analysis is used to analyse the correlation between a voxel-wise representational dissimilarity matrix and a behavioural representational dissimilarity matrix. The correlation of the activity of each voxel for each pair of food items is used to define the voxel-wise representational dissimilarity matrix. Similarly, the correlation of the subjective ratings for each pair of food items is used to define the behavioural representational dissimilarity matrix. The correlation between the voxel-wise representational dissimilarity matrix and the behavioural representational dissimilarity matrix is then assessed to determine if the voxels are encoding the food attributes.</description>
