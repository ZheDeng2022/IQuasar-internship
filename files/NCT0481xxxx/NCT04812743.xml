    <description>20 Colorectal Health Research Champions will be recruited from Danville, Emporia, Lawrenceville, Richmond, and Petersburg.&#xD;
The Colorectal Health Research Champions will receive training in four specific areas during group educational sessions.&#xD;
Colorectal Health Research Champions will be asked to disseminate the four defined messages on at least two occasions to small groups in their social network in a venue of their choice (house chats, faith-based, social gatherings, family gatherings, etc.). We ask that each CHRC participant host 2 chats with 5-10 people in attendance at each chat. We expect that at least 200 participants will be invited to chats through 10 CHRCs.</description>
