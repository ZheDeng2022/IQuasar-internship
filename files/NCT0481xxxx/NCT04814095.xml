    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial aims to assess the real world quality of life and survival of&#xD;
      patients treated with targeted therapy that has preliminary evidence of efficacy in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced rare cancers or cancer harbouring rare molecular aberrations. The treatment has&#xD;
      been granted conditional or full approved by Health Canada (HC) as effective and safe. Due to&#xD;
      the rarity of the cancer or molecular aberration the uncertainty level of the health&#xD;
      technology assessment (HTA) by the pan Canadian Oncology Review (pCODR) was too high for&#xD;
      consideration of funding or it was not submitted for consideration. Consequently, the goal of&#xD;
      this study is to generate real world evidence to support HTA decision making throughout the&#xD;
      life cycle of the product.&#xD;

      In Canada, adoption of new systemic therapies for cancer treatment is a multi-step process.&#xD;
      After completion of clinical trials, pharmaceutical companies submit a request for a new drug&#xD;
      approval to Health Canada. Therapies undergo rigorous review at Health Canada to confirm&#xD;
      safety and efficacy before a Notice of Compliance (NOC) or NOC conditional (NOC/c) is issued&#xD;
      that allows sale of the new medication in Canada. An additional layer of evaluation, a health&#xD;
      technology assessment (HTA), is undertaken through the pan Canadian Oncology Drug Review&#xD;
      (pCODR). A positive recommendation from pCODR is required for national price negotiations&#xD;
      through the pan Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA). Once this step is completed,&#xD;
      provincial pharmacies establish local contracts to permit local implementation of the new&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As our understanding of pathogenesis evolves and next generation sequencing becomes more&#xD;
      affordable, rare molecular entities amenable to treatment with targeted or selected&#xD;
      therapies, like immunotherapy, are being increasingly identified. These molecular aberrations&#xD;
      can occur with frequencies of 1-2% making it unfeasible to conduct large randomized trials to&#xD;
      establish benefit. Determination of the added value of these new therapies in terms of&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life is challenging in the absence of comparators in trials resulting&#xD;
      in increased uncertainty in terms of outcomes, quality of life (QOL) and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
      To address the uncertainty, pharmaceutical companies and the pCODR economic guidance panel&#xD;
      create economic models with sensitivity analyses to try to estimate the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      therapy. These models however, are dependent on the nature and quality of available data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to use real world data to generate evidence to assist in evaluate new&#xD;
      therapies in rare molecular entities. The key components include regular interval&#xD;
      radiographic imaging and collection of patient reported outcomes using standardized QOL&#xD;
      questionnaires. The aim is to provide high quality real world evidence for assessment and&#xD;
      economic modelling to reduce uncertainty and facilitate HTA decision-making.&#xD;
