  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease and myocardial ischemia are among the leading causes of death and&#xD;
      disability in the Westerns countries. Timely and accurate diagnosis of myocardial ischemia at&#xD;
      the moment of symptom onset is crucial and often delayed. Portable smart medical devices&#xD;
      nowadays offers the possibility of ubiquitous self multi-parametric monitoring. Application&#xD;
      of such technologies to timely and autonomous detection of myocardial ischemia could be an&#xD;
      effective strategy to an earlier and better treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the changes in recorded by the SmartCardia patch&#xD;
      (respiratory rate, pulse transit time, heart rate and single ECG trace) during induced&#xD;
      ischemia during elective coronary angioplasty procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to asses whether myocardial ischemia can be predicted and&#xD;
      quantified by changes in the parameters recorded by SmartCardia patch (respiratory rate,&#xD;
      pulse transit time, heart rate and single ECG trace).&#xD;

      Coronary artery disease and myocardial ischemia are among the leading causes of death and&#xD;
      disability in the Westerns countries. Timely and accurate diagnosis of myocardial ischemia at&#xD;
      the moment of symptom onset is crucial and often delayed. Portable smart medical devices&#xD;

      of such technologies to timely and autonomous detection of myocardial ischemia could be an&#xD;
      effective strategy to an earlier and better treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the changes in recorded by the SmartCardia patch&#xD;
      (respiratory rate, pulse transit time, heart rate and single ECG trace) during induced&#xD;
      ischemia during elective coronary angioplasty procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to asses whether myocardial ischemia can be predicted and&#xD;
      quantified by changes in the parameters recorded by SmartCardia patch (respiratory rate,&#xD;
      pulse transit time, heart rate and single ECG trace).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SmartWearable devices will be applied 30 minutes before coronary angiography (2/3 devices&#xD;
      per-patients would be applied). Percutaneous coronary intervention will be conducted&#xD;
      following a given protocol (not influencing patient's treatement):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Myocardial ischemia will be measured with the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) wire during&#xD;
           stent expansion (total artery occlusion caused by balloon inflation). This will have no&#xD;
           impact on patients' management as the wire will already have been inserted for the&#xD;
           diagnostic procedure and will not have an impact on procedure duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recording of a 6 leads electrocardiogram during the ischemia phase, which is anyway&#xD;
           always available as part of our routine monitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients will systematically be asked for any chest pain or discomfort during ischemia&#xD;
           (step which is anyway frequently done in standard procedures), to differentiate between&#xD;
           clinical and subclinical ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the device will be kept during 30 supplementary minutes while&#xD;
      the patient is on standard post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) surveillance, thus&#xD;
      offering measurements during recovery from ischemia.&#xD;
