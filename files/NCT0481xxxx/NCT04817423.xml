      This study aims to develop and validate machine learning model in ICD-10 coding of primary&#xD;
      diagnosis related to cardiovascular diseases in Chinese corpus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The accuracy and productivity of ICD coding has always been a concern of clinical practice.&#xD;
      Errors of ICD codes may result in claim denials and missed revenue. However, ICD coding&#xD;
      process is complex, time-consuming and error-prone. More experienced coders are in need, but&#xD;
      there is an increasing lack of supply. Automated ICD coding has potential to facilitate&#xD;
      clinical coders for improved efficiency and quality. Model performance of related studies is&#xD;
      still far below coders and both the accuracy and interpretability need to be improved in&#xD;
      great demand. Besides, studies in Chinese corpus are not sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will implement automated ICD coding study based on&#xD;
      inpatient' data collected from electronic medical records from Fuwai Hospital, the world's&#xD;
      largest medical center for cardiovascular disease. Feature engineering and machine learning&#xD;
      methods will be used to develop classification models with good performance, interpretability&#xD;
      and practicability for ICD codes of primary diagnosis.&#xD;
