    <textblock>
      Larotrectinib, a selective TRK inhibitor has showed marked and durable antitumor activity in&#xD;
      patients with NTRK gene-fusion-positive tumors regardless of the tumor type, gene partner and&#xD;
      patient's age. Because of this and the lack of alternative therapy in this rare but severe&#xD;
      disease, the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) granted&#xD;
      in April 2019, a &quot;cohort&quot; Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU) in the&#xD;
      indication:&quot;Larotrectinib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult and&#xD;
      paediatric patients from one month, with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours with a&#xD;
      Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) fusion, refractory to standard treatments or in&#xD;
      the absence of appropriate therapeutic alternative.&quot; Despite the potential benefit of&#xD;
      identifying these fusions, the clinicopathologic features of NTRK fusion-positive tumors&#xD;
      which are treated with Larotrectinib, are not well characterized. This study will provide&#xD;
      information about the diagnosis and management of patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic NTRK fusion cancer treated with Larotrectinib under real-world treatment&#xD;
      conditions in France, and describes the dosing patterns, safety and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) are a family of tyrosine kinases that bind neurotrophins,&#xD;
      a family of growth factors important to the formation and function of the nervous system. In&#xD;
      cancer, the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK)1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, which&#xD;
      encode for the TRKA, TRKB and TRKC proteins, respectively, are subject to gene-arrangements&#xD;
      that lead to kinase domain expression and constitutive downstream pathway activation. In&#xD;
      preclinical models, NTRK gene fusions have transformative oncogenic potential, and they&#xD;
      appear to be widely distributed across histologically diverse adult and pediatric cancers.&#xD;
      Hence, these genetic abnormalities, observed in both children and adults, have recently&#xD;
      emerged as targets for cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Larotrectinib, a selective TRK inhibitor has showed marked and durable antitumor activity in&#xD;
      patients with NTRK gene-fusion-positive tumors regardless of the tumor type, gene partner and&#xD;
      patient's age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of this and the lack of alternative therapy in this rare but severe disease, the&#xD;
      French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) granted in April 2019,&#xD;
      a &quot;cohort&quot; Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU) in the indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Larotrectinib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients&#xD;
      from one month, with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours with a Neurotrophic&#xD;
      Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) fusion, refractory to standard treatments or in the absence&#xD;
      of appropriate therapeutic alternative.&quot; Despite the potential benefit of identifying these&#xD;
      fusions, the clinicopathologic features of NTRK fusion-positive tumors which are treated with&#xD;
      Larotrectinib, are not well characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information about the diagnosis and management of patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic NTRK fusion cancer treated with Larotrectinib under real-world&#xD;
      treatment conditions in France, and describes the dosing patterns, safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of this agent.&#xD;
