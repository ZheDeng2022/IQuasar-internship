  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-intestinal perforation is a condition that can become life-threatening in case of&#xD;
      appearance of systemic symptoms, sepsis-related peripheral hypoperfusion and single or&#xD;
      multiple organ failure needing a prompt intervention in Emergency Department (ED) setting.&#xD;
      Literature reports disagreeing data about the effect of surgical timing on mortality and&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes: Buck et al. described a 2.4 % of decreased survival every hour of&#xD;
      surgical delay in case of perforated peptic ulcers. Other authors documented significantly&#xD;
      longer postoperative hospital stay, greater health costs and a significant increase of&#xD;
      postoperative complication and mortality rates when surgery is delayed in high-risk patients&#xD;
      with comorbidities or age &gt; 65 years. Azuhata described a highly significant relationship&#xD;
      between delayed surgery and patients' survival: after 6 hours from admission to ED, patients&#xD;
      with gastrointestinal perforation and associated septic shock don't survive to surgery. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to assess the impact of delay of time between patient admission to ED&#xD;
      and surgery for source control on 30-d mortality and postoperative outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal perforation with or without septic shock. Furthermore, we want to define the&#xD;
      time threshold within which surgery can affect patients' survival.&#xD;

      This is an Italian National multicenter study composed by a retrospective phase of data&#xD;
      collection from patients of past ten years and a perspective one of next two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA We include in our analysis all patients with more than 18&#xD;
      years old undergoing emergency surgery for gastro-intestinal perforations, with or without&#xD;
      signs of septic shock. All patients with covered perforations or abdominal perivisceral free&#xD;
      air bubbles treated with non- operative management or delayed surgery will be excluded. An&#xD;
      online Case Report Form (CRF) will be filled out by every participating Italian participating&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS Primary outcome analyzed is in-hospital Clavien-Dindo &gt; 3 complication rate [12].&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are 60-d mortality rate, total length of stay (LOS), LOS in Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (ICU), days of mechanical ventilation, re-intervention rate and 30-d readmission rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyzed variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital characteristics; teaching/non-teaching setting; I/II level ED; emergency&#xD;
           surgery/volume x year; 24H/on-call radiology and surgery team; presence of a dedicated&#xD;
           OR in ED;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographics (gender, age, Body Mass Index (BMI) and American Society of&#xD;
           Anaesthesiologists' (ASA) classification of Physical Health, medical history of past&#xD;
           abdominal surgical operations and comorbidities according to Charlson Comorbidity Index&#xD;
           (CCI), mainly related to corticosteroids therapy and immunosuppressive conditions),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient management in ED: admission date and time; Priority code at admission; time of&#xD;
           abdominal x-Ray; time of CT-scan; Time of patient evaluation by surgeon on- call;&#xD;
           Preoperative resuscitation management (Y/N, type, time of beginning); presence of Sepsis&#xD;
           (infection documented or suspected + SOFA &gt;=2) and of septic shock (sepsis + persistent&#xD;
           hypotension needing vasopressors to maintain a Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg;&#xD;
           serum values of lactates &gt; 18 mg/dL (or 2 mmol/L) with an adequate volume resuscitation&#xD;
           measures) at admission or during patient stay in ED; SOFA score at admission; Emergency&#xD;
           surgery score; ACS NSQIP® Surgical Risk score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological findings: CT-scan reports of patients selected will be analyzed by site&#xD;
           data-collection centers with the aim to identify typical and atypical radiological&#xD;
           findings (subdiaphragmatic free gas, free peritoneal fluid, bowel wall discontinuity,&#xD;
           extraluminal oral contrast, extraluminal abscess, abdominal collections, fat stranding,&#xD;
           portal venous gas, wall bowel thickening, pneumatosis and mucosal hyperenhancement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Time of skin incision; Type and duration of surgery; source control surgery,&#xD;
           Open Abdomen; surgical approach; site and cause of perforation; pathologic data;&#xD;
           Emergency surgery score; ACS NSQIP® Surgical Risk score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative Course: Preoperative mortality (patients die before surgery); Medical and&#xD;
           Surgical complications (Clavien-Dindo score); total LOS; LOS in ICU; days of Mechanical&#xD;
           Ventilation; Re-intervention rate; 90-d mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE With a binary response variable, β=0·95, α=0·05, an anticipated small&#xD;
      effect size and an allocation ratio 1:10 (Early treatment Yes vs. No), it has been calculated&#xD;
      that 3276 patients are required to detect an association between the variables and the&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED ANALYSES Time between patient admission to ED and surgery will be analyzed as a&#xD;
      continuous variable with t-Student's tests, comparing means between the different outcomes&#xD;
      (primary and secondary). Different cut-off will be tested to define a significant time&#xD;
      threshold correlating with outcomes. If necessary, more time intervals will be evaluated to&#xD;
      evaluate correlations between the variables collected and the time.&#xD;
