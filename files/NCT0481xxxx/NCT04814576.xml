      OBJECTIVES: 1. To evaluate the impact of an intervention based on collaborative nursing care&#xD;
      in terms of the changes produced in the recovery process, in positive mental health and in&#xD;
      the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship among users of mental health day hospitals. To&#xD;
      explore the changes produced in the recovery process of users who receive collaborative&#xD;
      nursing care through the co-design and implementation of group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: A sequential and transformative mixed methods design is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS. The study is structured in three phases. In phase one (baseline) and phase three&#xD;
      (follow-up), quantitative data will be collected from patients at a mental health day&#xD;
      hospitals based on a two-armed, parallel-design, non-randomized trial. In phase two, two&#xD;
      groups will be established: an intervention group (GI) in which the intervention based on&#xD;
      collaborative nursing care will be carried out through the co-design and implementation of&#xD;
      activities through Participatory Action Research, and a control group (CG) in which the usual&#xD;
      care dynamics will be continued. All the users of three mental health day hospitals who agree&#xD;
      to participate in the study will be studied consecutively until the necessary sample size is&#xD;
      reached. The outcomes used to evaluate the impact of the intervention will be the stage of&#xD;
      the recovery process, the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the patient's level of&#xD;
      positive mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION: Very few collaborative nursing care interventions have been studied and shown to&#xD;
      be effective in the context of the paradigm shift toward recovery in mental health nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT: Understanding the changes produced in the recovery process, as well as in the quality&#xD;
      of the therapeutic relationship and in the maintenance and/or increase of the levels of&#xD;
      positive mental health of people with mental health problems, can contribute to the design&#xD;
      and implementation of new methodologies to offer effective and person- centered care.&#xD;

      1. Aims A.evaluate the impact of a collaborative nursing care intervention through the&#xD;
           co-design and implementation of group activities, in mental health day hospital users,&#xD;
           in terms of the changes produced in the state of the recovery process, in the level of&#xD;
           positive mental health and in the level of therapeutic relationship with the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. explore the changes produced in the recovery process of mental health day hospital&#xD;
           users who receive collaborative nursing care through the co-design and implementation of&#xD;
           group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research hypotheses to be tested in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. day hospital users who receive an intervention based on collaborative nursing care&#xD;
           through the co-design and implementation of group activities will report improved&#xD;
           changes in: i) recovery status, ii) level of Positive Mental Health and iii) quality of&#xD;
           the therapeutic relationship at the end of the intervention, than users receiving usual&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. the effects of the intervention based on collaborative nursing care through the&#xD;
           co-design and implementation of group activities on the changes in the level of recovery&#xD;
           are mediated by the changes produced in the quality of the therapeutic relationship and&#xD;
           the changes in the positive mental health of the users.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Design In order to meet the main objectives, a sequential and transformative mixed&#xD;
           methods design is proposed through three phases. On the one hand, in phases 1 and 3, a&#xD;
           two-armed, parallel-design, non-randomized trial is proposed. And in phase 2, the&#xD;
           intervention will be carried out based on collaborative nursing care through the&#xD;
           co-design and implementation of group activities using the qualitative Participatory&#xD;
           Action Research (PAR) method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. The Participatory-Action Research In order to carry out the intervention of&#xD;
           co-design and implementation of activities through collaborative nursing care, PAR is a&#xD;
           method that provides a suitable framework for implementation and evaluation, since it is&#xD;
           a method that makes it possible to extract knowledge in a democratic, cooperative,&#xD;
           transparent and effective way, as well as to intervene in changes in people's daily&#xD;
           lives. It is about unveiling the complexity of problems through dialogue and&#xD;
           collaboration, as well as acting as a tool to promote change . The PAR process is&#xD;
           considered open, holistic and egalitarian, i.e. it equates the researcher with those&#xD;
           being researched and requires collaboration between researcher and researched . In&#xD;
           general, the PAR consists of four stages that follow each other in a cyclical manner.&#xD;
           The cycle begins in the first stage, where a situation or problem is analyzed, and then&#xD;
           in the second stage the elements that facilitate its resolution and those that hinder it&#xD;
           are identified. Once these factors have been identified, a plan of action or change is&#xD;
           developed and implemented. Finally, the effect of this change will be evaluated, thus&#xD;
           completing the cycle. All these stages should be evaluated in a reflective manner to&#xD;
           improve the rationality, justification and understanding of the changes that occur in&#xD;
           the process. In other words, in this PAR process, theory and practice are combined,&#xD;
           bringing theoretical constructs into reality and analyzing them simultaneously. Among&#xD;
           the different PAR modalities, we will use the one described by Susman and Evered where a&#xD;
           process of constant cycles of action research takes place, since it is the one that best&#xD;
           adapts to the actual practice of care in the mental health day hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study setting and participants The scope of the study will be three adult mental health&#xD;
           day hospitals in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain). The three centers belong to&#xD;
           the same institution and are part of the public mental health network of Catalonia.&#xD;
           These centers have the same management, and therefore develop the same care program. The&#xD;
           study population will be the users requiring treatment in the mental health day&#xD;
           hospitals included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for selection and recruitment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The criteria for inclusion in the study of participating users will be: A) Users over 18&#xD;
      years of age of the selected day hospitals. B) Acceptance of the study conditions and&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The exclusion criteria for participating users will be: A) Hospital admission for a period&#xD;
      of less than one week. B) Physical or psychological conditions that do not allow&#xD;
      collaborative nursing care through co-design of group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All persons who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be invited. Participants will be incorporated consecutively as they are&#xD;
      hospitalized in the three units that form part of the study. To calculate the sample size&#xD;
      necessary to have sufficient statistical power for the quantitative part and based on the&#xD;
      results of Lemos-Giráldez, accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a&#xD;
      bilateral contrast, 76 participants would be required in the first group receiving the&#xD;
      intervention and 76 in the second group, in order to detect a difference equal to or greater&#xD;
      than 5 units. It is assumed that the common standard deviation is 11 and the correlation&#xD;
      coefficient between the initial and final measurement is 0.6. A 20% loss-to-follow-up rate&#xD;
      was estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Procedure, techniques and analysis for the qualitative part or intervention: 4.1 The&#xD;
      intervention Given the clinical practice conditions of the study, the intervention will be&#xD;
      carried out in the selected hospital using the Participatory Action Research method and will&#xD;
      be implemented through a cycle of four well-defined stages which will be repeated&#xD;
      continuously throughout the process . Thus, for each user who joins the study, a minimum of&#xD;
      one complete cycle will be performed before the user is discharged. The start of the cycle&#xD;
      will begin with stage 1 or diagnosis, which will be performed at the time of admission to the&#xD;
      day hospital. The nurse, through an individual semi-structured interview, will explore the&#xD;
      meaning for the user of the concept of recovery together with the individual perception of&#xD;
      the facilitating and limiting elements of this process. Subsequently, in the second stage or&#xD;
      planning stage, through a discussion group with other users, the meaning of recovery, as well&#xD;
      as its limitations and facilitators will be discussed collectively, whereby individual or&#xD;
      collective action plans will be shared by the users in order to work and improve their level&#xD;
      of recovery in stage 3 or the action stage. Once the action plan agreed upon by the users and&#xD;
      the nurse has been carried out, the cycle will conclude with stage 4 or evaluation, where an&#xD;
      individual intervention in the form of a semi-structured interview will be carried out again&#xD;
      to assess the recovery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Qualitative data collection techniques Semi-structured interview The conversation will be&#xD;
      recorded with the prior consent of the participant and then a written transcript will be&#xD;
      prepared, which requires validation by the user to avoid possible biases. The interview&#xD;
      should take place in a room, if possible without interruptions and with an approximate&#xD;
      duration of 40 minutes. The user will be given the possibility of ending the interview at any&#xD;
      time as desired. A script will be used to conduct the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups These will also be recorded, thanks to the prior consent given by the users. A&#xD;
      weekly group will be held at the day hospital's facilities, during the day hospital's hours&#xD;
      of operation. It will last approximately 45 minutes. There will be the possibility of leaving&#xD;
      the group if the user wishes to do so. To carry out the group, a support script will be&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher's diary As a reflective tool and in order to monitor the research process, a field&#xD;
      diary written by the principal investigator will be kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Qualitative data analysis The qualitative content analysis method will be used. The data&#xD;
      obtained from both the focus groups and the interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Then,&#xD;
      once the authenticity of the transcripts has been verified by the participants (content&#xD;
      validation), the text will be broken down into descriptive codes assigned on the basis of&#xD;
      their purely semantic content. In a second stage, such codes will be grouped into more&#xD;
      analytical subcategories, in such a way that the initial codes are grouped according to the&#xD;
      meaning of the linguistic units and their combinations. This will lead to a third&#xD;
      hierarchical stage, where, taking into account the semantic analysis of the previous&#xD;
      subcategories, they will be categorized according to the objectives of the study. It is worth&#xD;
      mentioning that the data analysis will be performed by two researchers, jointly in the first&#xD;
      stage of data coding, and independently during the subsequent analytical process and again&#xD;
      together in the comparison of their results. The analysis of these data will be carried out&#xD;
      through the QRS Nvivo v12 program. It should be noted that data will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed qualitatively until the moment when the team considers that no new meanings are&#xD;
      found and considers that data saturation has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Outcome measures, data collection procedure and data analysis for quantitative phases 4.1&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary outcome Changes in the users' recovery process will be evaluated with The&#xD;
      Stages of Recovery Instrument (STORI), validated in the Spanish population by Lemos-Giráldez.&#xD;
      It is a self-report questionnaire of 50 items grouped into 5 dimensions of 10 items. Each&#xD;
      dimension is related to one of the recovery processes (moratorium, awareness, preparation,&#xD;
      rebuilding and growth). The items are scored from 0 &quot;not true at all at this time&quot; to 5&#xD;
      &quot;completely true at this time&quot;, resulting in a score for each stage, ranging from 0 to 50.&#xD;
      The participant is assigned to the stage with the highest score. The questionnaire has been&#xD;
      validated in the Spanish population, obtaining a Cronbach's alpha of 0.86 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes The quality of the therapeutic relationship between nurses and users will&#xD;
      be evaluated with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short (WAI-S) scale. The short version of&#xD;
      this scale contains 12 items, and each item is assessed by the health professional based on a&#xD;
      scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always). The scoring range of the overall WAI-S is 12-84&#xD;
      points. The higher the score, the higher the therapeutic relationship. This questionnaire has&#xD;
      three dimensions: (i) bond: the bond between patient and nurse, which includes aspects such&#xD;
      as empathy, mutual trust and acceptance; (ii) objectives: the agreement between patient and&#xD;
      nurse on the goals of therapy (i.e. mutual acceptance of what the intervention aims to&#xD;
      achieve); and (iii) tasks or activities: the agreement between patient and nurse on the tasks&#xD;
      or activities to be carried out. The Spanish version of the WAI-S has good reliability and&#xD;
      validity, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.93 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of positive mental health will be assessed with the Salud Mental Positiva (SMP)&#xD;
      scale (Positive Mental Health), developed and validated by Lluch which studies the level of&#xD;
      positive mental health, a concept previously developed by Jahoda. The scale consists of 39&#xD;
      scorable items, for which the lowest value is &quot;always or almost always&quot; and the highest value&#xD;
      is &quot;never or almost never&quot;. The items belong to six dimensions (personal satisfaction,&#xD;
      prosocial attitude, self-control, autonomy, problem solving and self-actualization, and&#xD;
      interpersonal relationship skills). The questionnaire has shown adequate internal consistency&#xD;
      values in different populations with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.89 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcomes Sociodemographic variables were gathered, including age, sex, educational&#xD;
      level, employment status and marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical variables consisted of the main diagnosis described by ICD10 criteria, years of&#xD;
      evolution of the disorder, referral unit, number of previous admissions to mental health&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Data collection procedure Users who agree to participate in the study and have signed the&#xD;
      informed consent form, both in the case of the intervention and control groups, will be given&#xD;
      a form containing a questionnaire with sociodemographic and clinical data and the three&#xD;
      evaluation instruments by a member of the research team who is not directly involved in the&#xD;
      care of the users. Participants will not receive any information about their inclusion in the&#xD;
      intervention or control group. Each user will be assigned a participant code to ensure the&#xD;
      anonymity of the participating users. When the user is discharged, a person from the research&#xD;
      team will collect the follow-up data in the same way by means of a new form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Quantitative data analysis The principal investigator will construct a database using the&#xD;
      IBM SPSS v25 program ECPHDSM, the data obtained from the forms will be incorporated into the&#xD;
      database by two members of the research team to minimize error. The analysis will focus on&#xD;
      the numerical differences obtained through the STORI, WAI-S and SMP questionnaires before and&#xD;
      after the intervention. In order to describe the characteristics of the participants and the&#xD;
      scores obtained on the scales, descriptive statistics will be used, using the arithmetic mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation for quantitative variables, and the frequency and percentage for&#xD;
      qualitative variables. The differences between the baseline scores obtained and the follow-up&#xD;
      assessment will be estimated thanks to the application of parametric tests (Student's t-test&#xD;
      in paired data) in the case of quantitative variables, first verifying the assumptions of&#xD;
      normality and homogeneity of their variances. When the opposite is true, nonparametric tests&#xD;
      will be used, using the Wilcoxon test for quantitative variables and Chi-square tests or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables. In addition, to analyze the impact of changes&#xD;
      on the dependent variable adjusted for the remainder of the secondary outcomes, multiple&#xD;
      linear regression models will be used. A significance level of p&lt;0.05 will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Ethical considerations Authorization has been obtained from the management of the centers&#xD;
      and approval for the project has been granted by the Ethics Committee of the institution&#xD;
      where the study will be carried out. In relation to the current law on personal data&#xD;
      protection and guarantee of digital rights, the authorization of all users will be requested&#xD;
      for the public dissemination of the data, preserving the confidentiality and anonymity of&#xD;
      their identity at all times. This will be achieved by anonymizing the names or any sign of&#xD;
      identity by assigning a user code. All participants will be able to voluntarily withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time. For this reason, users will be given a sheet with all the precise&#xD;
      information about the study to be carried out and written consent will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Validity and reliability / Rigor To ensure the validity and rigor of the study, appropriate&#xD;
      strategies will be used for each phase of the research. In phases 1 and 3, the selection of&#xD;
      participants and recruitment of an appropriate sample size together with the validity and&#xD;
      reliability of the instruments used will guarantee validity and reliability. For phase 2,&#xD;
      reliability, authenticity and ethical criteria will be addressed. Within the framework of&#xD;
      reliability, the credibility of the study is based on the use of triangulation of techniques&#xD;
      and researchers. Likewise, the criterion of dependence will be obtained through the constant&#xD;
      auditing and transfer of external reports throughout the procedure. Likewise, the dynamics of&#xD;
      the process, which will involve a constant interaction between the realities of researchers&#xD;
      and participants, will provide authenticity to the data obtained. The treatment of&#xD;
      confidentiality, privacy and participant consent will guarantee the ethical rigor criteria of&#xD;
      the project. In addition, reflexivity, understood as a process of critically reflecting on&#xD;
      what is taking place during the research study, will be the key quality criterion upon which&#xD;
      the project will be based.&#xD;
