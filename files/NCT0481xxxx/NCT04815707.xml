  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernias are a common surgical problem. Best management of occult inguinal hernias,&#xD;
      defined as hernias unable to be felt on physical exam, is unknown. From prior studies we know&#xD;
      that most inguinal hernias will eventually become symptomatic and require surgery (70%).&#xD;
      However, doing a repair on a very small, occult hernia may open the patient up to surgical&#xD;
      complications, like chronic pain, earlier than necessary. This will be a multi-center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of surgical repair versus expectant management of occult inguinal&#xD;
      hernias. Patients undergoing laparoscopic unilateral inguinal hernia repair will be included.&#xD;
      At the time of surgery, the surgeon will determine if there is an occult hernia contralateral&#xD;
      side. If present, patients will be randomized to repair of the occult side or expectant&#xD;
      management of the occult side. After 1 year post-operative data has been assessed, a decision&#xD;
      tool will be created and administered to patients to aid in their decision making about&#xD;
      treatments for their hernia.&#xD;
