  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide data in adult participants with mild to moderate asthma to assist&#xD;
      healthcare professionals (HCPs) in assessing various attributes of ELLIPTA and BREEZHALER&#xD;
      DPIs, by comparing the incidence of critical and overall errors, participant preference,&#xD;
      willingness to continue with the inhaler and time to correct use. ELLIPTA® is a registered&#xD;
      trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and BREEZHALER® is a registered trademark of Novartis.&#xD;
