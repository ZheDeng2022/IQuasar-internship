      This observational study will describe the incidence and risk factors of perioperative&#xD;
      cardiac complications (PCCs) in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in Tibet Autonomous&#xD;
      Region. And perioperative troponin monitoring will be implemented in these population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Worldwide, more than 300 million major noncardiac surgeries are performed every&#xD;
      year and the number is increasing continuously. Perioperative cardiac complications (PCCs)&#xD;
      are the first causes of morbidity and mortality within 30 days after noncardiac surgery which&#xD;
      result in prolonged length of stay, increased health care costs and poorer prognosis. Several&#xD;
      preoperative factors such as advanced age, obesity, coronary artery disease, heart failure&#xD;
      (HF), cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction has been confirmed&#xD;
      strongly associated with PCCs, as well as some intraoperative factors (hypotension and&#xD;
      hypoxemia), and postoperative factors (pain and bleeding). And more than 3% patients&#xD;
      undergoing noncardiac surgery are estimated to suffer a myocardial injury after noncardiac&#xD;
      surgery (MINS), defined as elevated postoperative troponin measurement without the&#xD;
      requirement of an ischemic feature. Many of the patients with MINS does not fulfill the&#xD;
      conventional clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction (e.g., ischemic symptom, ischemic&#xD;
      electrocardiography finding). However, the prognosis of MINS is very poor. Therefore, cardiac&#xD;
      troponin levels need to be monitored in high-risk patients to avoid misdiagnosis and taking&#xD;
      the opportunity of secondary prophylactic measures and following-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibet Autonomous Region in China is located in a low-oxygen, low-pressure area, with the&#xD;
      average altitude of more than 4000 meters. Polycythemia and hyperlipemia are common in native&#xD;
      patients there, with increased prostaglandin, faster basal heart rate, higher blood pressure&#xD;
      and higher myocardial oxygen consumption and restricted cardiac reserve function comparing to&#xD;
      patients from plains areas. The mismatch between oxygen supply and demand could aggravate in&#xD;
      the perioperative period, which is the prominent pathogenesis on PCCs. Accordingly, the risk&#xD;
      of PCCs may rise remarkably in the high-altitude and hypoxia region. Not only that, the&#xD;
      incidence characteristics and risk factors of PCCs in noncardiac surgery could be also&#xD;
      partially different from those in flat area in China. However, the relevant data are&#xD;
      currently blank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the incidence of PCCs, the risk indicators and the value of cardiac troponin&#xD;
      monitoring for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in Tibet Autonomous Region in China,&#xD;
      allowing a better assessment and optimizing of the patients there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study consists of two sub studies. Sub study A: Risk factors of PCCs in&#xD;
      patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in Tibet Autonomous Region. Sub study B: Implement&#xD;
      perioperative cardiac troponin I (cTnI) monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A: 600 patients over 50 years old undergoing elective major noncardiac surgery in Tibet&#xD;
      Autonomous Region People's Hospital will be included and followed for 30 days after surgery&#xD;
      for the occurrence of PCCs and other major adverse events. Patients will receive a&#xD;
      standardized evaluation, including preoperative historical, laboratory, and physiologic&#xD;
      assessment. Perioperative information will also be collected, including type of surgery,&#xD;
      anesthetic management, intraoperative transfusion, postoperative complications, etc. PCCs are&#xD;
      defined as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), HF, new-onset severe arrhythmia, nonfatal cardiac&#xD;
      arrest, and cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: 100 patients over 50 years old undergoing major noncardiac surgery in Tibet&#xD;
      Autonomous Region People's Hospital will be included. Clinical data including demographics,&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation, surgical invasiveness, ASA grade, anesthetic management, and other&#xD;
      relevant perioperative information. The investigators will measure cTnI at baseline prior to&#xD;
      surgery, as well as on 1h,12h, 24h and 72h after surgery for each patient. MINS will be&#xD;
      defined if a rise of cTnI with an absolute value above the 99th percentile upper reference is&#xD;
      detected, and then a clinical evaluation, 12-lead ECG and even coronary angiography (if&#xD;
      needed) will be performed to adjudicate the occurrence of PCCs. The incident of MINS and the&#xD;
      value of cTnI monitoring for early diagnosis of PCCs will be assessed for patients undergoing&#xD;
      noncardiac surgery in Tibet Autonomous Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance: This study will generate major scientific implications by&#xD;
      contributing to closing current knowledge gaps concerning the incidence and risk factors of&#xD;
      PCCs, as well as the value of cTnI monitoring for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in&#xD;
      Tibet Autonomous Region. This knowledge will have important clinical implications in the&#xD;
      high-attitude area leading to a better optimization of the perioperative management.&#xD;

    <description>Perioperative cardiac complications are defined as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), heart failure, new-onset severe arrhythmia, nonfatal cardiac arrest, and cardiac death. ACS included ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). NSTE-ACS could be further subdivided into non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina according to the cardiac biomarkers.</description>
