  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of vortioxetine, once daily (QD), on&#xD;
      mood disorders and cognitive dysfunction in patients with head and neck cancers undergoing&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world, especially in South&#xD;
      China. The incidence of depression and anxiety in HNC patients after radiotherapy is as high&#xD;
      as 12% - 45% due to appearance changes, decreased swallowing function, dry mouth, pain and&#xD;
      other discomfort. At the same time, radiotherapy, as mainstay of therapy for HNC, also causes&#xD;
      different degrees of damage to the brain around the tumor, leading to secondary cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment seriously affect the quality of&#xD;
      life of HNC patients after radiotherapy. Recent studies have found that votioxetine has&#xD;
      multimodal pharmacodynamic activity, which can not only improve symptoms of depression, but&#xD;
      also significantly improve the cognitive function of patients. In this study, investigators&#xD;
      will discuss the therapeutic effect of vortioxetine on the depression after radiotherapy in&#xD;
      HNC patients through a multi-center, randomized and double-blind comparative clinical trial.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a 10-item clinician rated scale to measure overall severity of depressive symptoms with a total possible score range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The DSST assesses relative contributions of speed, memory, executive function and visual scanning. Higher scores-correct number of symbols reflects greater objective cognitive functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 8 weeks in Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the RAVLT is to assess verbal learning and memory. Specifically, it assesses immediate memory span, new learning, susceptibility to interference, and recognition memory.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the Trail Making Test (TMT-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>TMT-A assesses cognitive processing speed and consists of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. Lower scores represent better speed of processing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with MADRS response at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS response was defined as a ≥50% decrease in MADRS total score from baseline</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 8 weeks in the HAM-A (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-A is a widely used and well-validated tool for measuring the severity of a patient's anxiety, Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in the quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to 8 weeks and endpoint mean scores in FACT-H&amp;N (the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck) Scale，Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in CGI-S (the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S assesses the clinician's impression of the subject's current state of mental illness and consists of one question for the investigator: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; which is rated on a seven-point scale (1=normal, not ill at all; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill).</description>
