  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Down syndrome often present with problems of posture &amp; balance and mobility.&#xD;
      Balance training is an important component of physical activity interventions, with growing&#xD;
      evidence that it can be beneficial for children with DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the effect core stability exercises and balance training in postural&#xD;
      control among Down syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized clinical trail. Children with Down Syndrome were determined on&#xD;
      inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria. Children with Down syndrome were arbitrarily allocated into&#xD;
      two groups with ages ranged from 5 to 17 years. The sample size was 20 patients. They were&#xD;
      assigned randomly into two groups. Group 1 received balance training and Group 2 received&#xD;
      core stability exercises. The duration of treatment was 6 weeks. Data is collected from&#xD;
      Comprehensive Rehabilitation center Chakwal Postural stability was evaluated pre and post&#xD;
      treatment by pediatric berg balance scale. Values which were obtained after this intervention&#xD;
      were analyzed for any change using SPSS&#xD;

    <description>The Pediatric Balance Scale is a modified version of the Berg Balance Scale that is used to assess functional balance skills in CP children . The scale consists of 14 items that are scored from 0 points (lowest function) to 4 points (highest function) with a maximum score of 56 points.</description>
