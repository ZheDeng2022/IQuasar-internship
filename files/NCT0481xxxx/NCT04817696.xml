  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-intensive care syndrome is an entity of cognitive, physical and mental health disorders&#xD;
      occurring and persisting after ICU discharge and responsible of disabilities and decrease of&#xD;
      quality of life. Nowadays mental and cognitive health impairments appear to be well known but&#xD;
      few data are available about chronic pain after a critical care illness. The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to determine the incidence and the risks factors of chronic pain after ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-intensive care syndrome is receiving growing interest because of the chronic health&#xD;
      issues secondary to a critical care admission: neurocognitive impairment, motor sequelae,&#xD;
      mood disturbances. These chronic health issues bear tremendous burden for patients and&#xD;
      next-of-kin. Among these chronic health issues, chronic pain symptoms could have major&#xD;
      consequences on the patient's quality of life. In the local single-center follow-up&#xD;
      experience, 6 months after a patient's admission in the critical care unit, around 20% of&#xD;
      patients displayed chronic pain symptoms. The investigators have addressed these patients to&#xD;
      pain care specialists, with successful treatment success. However, the evaluation of pain&#xD;
      symptoms remains simplistic; moreover, the incidence of chronic pain symptoms in patients&#xD;
      after critical care unit admission, receives little attention in the literature although&#xD;
      these symptoms may literally blunt out all other health issues. The incidence and type of&#xD;
      chronic pain symptoms has been poorly described, to the best of knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform a multi-center nationwide epidemiologic study of chronic&#xD;
      pain symptoms after a critical care unit admission. The investigators intend to describe the&#xD;
      incidence of chronic pain assessed with a Simple Verbal Score ≥ 3, 3 months after the ICU&#xD;
      admission. The investigators also intend to describe the incidence of painful symptoms, at&#xD;
      ICU discharge as well as the type of pain symptoms (ie neuropathic pain) at discharge and at&#xD;
      3 months using the ID-Pain scale. The evaluation at 3 months will be performed during a&#xD;
      physical follow-up or self-assessed by the patient. The investigators intend to explore the&#xD;
      risk factors associated with chronic pain, as an exploratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are performing a nation-wide multicentric study. At this point 24 centers&#xD;
      are participating to this study and the investigators expect to include 700 patients with a 3&#xD;
      months follow-up.&#xD;

The ID-Pain is a 6-item scores that characterizes pain.The score ranges from 0 to 5. A score of 2-3 is predictive of a probable neuropathic pain and a score of 4-5 is highly associated with a neuropathic pain. Pain assessment tools require an auto-evaluation, performed by the patient</description>
