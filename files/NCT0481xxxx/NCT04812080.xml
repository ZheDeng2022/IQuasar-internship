    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to collect preliminary data using total body scans on a&#xD;
      new, first of its kind, FDA 510k-cleared positron emission tomography/computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) scanner, called EXPLORER. The study will aim to recruit healthy individuals from&#xD;
      racial/ethnic minority populations.&#xD;

      The aim of this pilot study is to increase the number of healthy individuals from&#xD;
      racial/ethnic minority populations. This will advance research being conducted at EMIC by&#xD;
      providing &quot;controls&quot; or comparisons to differentiate between images from patients with cancer&#xD;
      versus healthy people of the same racial/ethnic ancestry. In addition, blood samples from&#xD;
      participants to this study will be utilized for quantitative, genetics-based estimates of&#xD;
      ancestry (e.g., African, Chinese, Colombian, Western European, Mexican, Vietnamese, etc.),&#xD;
      which is especially valuable in the case of admixed individuals.&#xD;

    <description>Study participants will be injected with 10 +/- 2 mCi of 18F-FDG using and IV line and a 60 minute PET scan will begin on EXPLORER. Prior to the PET scan, an ultra-low-dose CT scan (less than 1 minute ) will be acquired for attenuation correction purposes only. Ninety (90) minutes after being injected with FDG, participants will have another ultra-low dose CT scan (less than 1 minute) which will be acquired for attenuation correction purposes only. This will be followed by a 20 minute PET scan on EXPLORER. One-hundred and twenty (120) minutes after being injected with FDG, participants will be positioned supine on the scanner table for the last time. At this time, a low dose CT scan (less than 1 minute) will be acquired once again for attenuation correction purposes. This will be followed by one last 20 minute PET scan on EXPLORER. The IV line will be removed after completion of the study.</description>
