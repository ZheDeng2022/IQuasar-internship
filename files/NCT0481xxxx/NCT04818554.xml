  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement in ARDS mortality over the last 20 years seems to be largely explained by the&#xD;
      reduction of mechanical ventilation-induced injury (VILI). VILI is essentially related to&#xD;
      volotrauma closely associated with &quot;strain&quot; and &quot;stress&quot;. The pulmonary stress corresponds to&#xD;
      the transpulmonary pressure (alveolar pressure - pleural pressure), and the strain to the&#xD;
      change in lung volume related to the functional residual capacity (FRC) of the injured lung&#xD;
      at PEEP = 0. The volotrauma corresponds therefore to the generalized excess of stress and&#xD;
      strain on the injured lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial therapeutic strategy consists in protective ventilation with a tidal volume of 6&#xD;
      ml/kg of theoretical ideal weight (predicted by height), associated with a high respiratory&#xD;
      rate between 25 and 30 cycles per minute to control PaCO2 (&lt; 50 mmHg), apply a high positive&#xD;
      expiratory pressure PEEP according to FiO2, maintain a plateau pressure (PP) lower than 30&#xD;
      cmH20, reduce instrumental dead space, use curarization, recruitment maneuvers such as&#xD;
      alternate prone, improve ventilation-perfusion adequacy using inhaled NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a last resort, extracorporeal oxygenation by veno-venous ECMO is a device to supplement&#xD;
      respiratory function by improving oxygenation and ensuring decarboxylation. Veno-venous ECMO&#xD;
      is indicated in severe ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 80 mmHg and/or when mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      becomes unsafe due to increased plateau pressure despite optimized ARDS management including&#xD;
      high PEEP levels, curarization and prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After lung resection surgery, the incidence of ARDS is 2-8% and its prognosis remains more&#xD;
      poor, despite advances in management, with a mortality of up to 60%. Risk factors include&#xD;
      intraoperative vascular filling, type of pulmonary resection, and predicted postoperative&#xD;
      respiratory function. Early support with VV ECMO is vital in some patients to treat severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia, due to variable surgical reduction of lung parenchyma depending on carcinological&#xD;
      involvement or initial lung pathology. ). There are very few data concerning these patients&#xD;
      with pulmonary resection. The primary objective of this study is to describe the prevalence&#xD;
      of ARDS and the risk factors for its occurrence after pulmonary resection surgery. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to compare the ventilation parameters (especially motor pressure) in&#xD;
      patients with reduced lung parenchyma in ARDS under VV ECMO with those who did not use VV&#xD;
      ECMO assistance.&#xD;
