  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a Marine Lipid Oil&#xD;
      Concentrate formulation on inflammation/discomfort and overall well-being in male and female&#xD;
      subjects who are generally healthy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm remote study to evaluate the effects of a Marine Lipid Oil&#xD;
      Concentrate formulation on inflammation/discomfort and overall well-being in individuals who&#xD;
      are generally healthy. Each subject will receive a specific dose of the study products to be&#xD;
      taken once daily for a total of 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete assessments and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is the evaluation of the change in the responses to the SF-36&#xD;
      (Short-Form-36) Health Survey, Medical Symptoms questionnaire, Pain questionnaire and&#xD;
      responses on an assessment form relative to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through receipt of documentation and responses from&#xD;
      the telephone contacts/emails as per protocol.&#xD;
