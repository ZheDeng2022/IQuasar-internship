  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Delirium is a cognitive disturbance characterized by acute and fluctuating impairment in&#xD;
           attention and awareness. Although its incidence in the general surgical population is&#xD;
           2-3%, it has been reported to occur in up to 10-80% of high-risk patient groups. In&#xD;
           addition, the occurrence of postoperative delirium is associated with considerably&#xD;
           raised morbidity and mortality and increased healthcare resource expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the general patient population, no prophylactic pharmacologic treatment has shown&#xD;
           widespread effectiveness in preventing delirium. Several studies have failed to find a&#xD;
           magic pharmacologic bullet for preventing delirium-ketamine, haloperidol, propofol,&#xD;
           antipsychotic and benzodiazepine drugs have recently tested without a clear result of&#xD;
           its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexmedetomidine is an attractive pharmacologic option because of its biological&#xD;
           plausibility in modifying several known contributors to delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to investigators' knowledge, there is no study done to compare the effect of infusion&#xD;
           of dexmedetomidine and ketofol mixture as prophylactic agents for high-risk patients as&#xD;
           elderly patients who undergoing high-risk surgery such as intestinal obstruction surgery&#xD;
           against postoperative delirium occurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is one of the most frequent causes of general emergency surgery&#xD;
      in elderly patients, approximately 10-12% of adult patients above 65 years presenting with&#xD;
      acute abdominal pain at the emergency department (ED) is diagnosed as SBO. Small bowel&#xD;
      obstruction is complicated with dehydration, malnutrition, electrolyte and acid-base&#xD;
      disturbance, as well as insertion of many catheters as nasogastric tube, triple-lumen tube,&#xD;
      and foley's catheter, besides multiple drugs intake due to the associated comorbidities; all&#xD;
      of these factors increase the risk of developing POD ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is defined as acute onset of fluctuating disturbance of consciousness with reduced&#xD;
      ability to focus, alteration of attention, perceptual abnormalities, circadian disruption, a&#xD;
      decline in cognitive function (orientation, memory speech, thinking), and psychomotor&#xD;
      disturbances. POD commonly occurs between postoperative days 2-5, and it may be hypoactive,&#xD;
      hyperactive, or mixed, based on psychomotor clinical features. The incidence rate of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium(POD) varies between 9% and 87% in elderly patients, depending on the&#xD;
      patients' population and degree of operative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative delirium develops in the elderly due to multiple risk factors that can be&#xD;
      separated into patient-related and operation-related risk factors. Established&#xD;
      patient-specific risk factors include pre-existing dementia (appears to be the strongest&#xD;
      predictor for the occurrence of POD), older age, functional impairment, greater&#xD;
      co-morbidities, and psychopathological symptoms. Operation-specific risk factors for POD are&#xD;
      based on the degree of operative stress, any type of iatrogenic event including medication&#xD;
      adverse effects (Common drugs that may precipitate delirium in the elderly include&#xD;
      antihistamines, anticholinergics, chemotherapeutic agents, dopamine agonists,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics, steroids, and psychostimulants), physical restraint,&#xD;
      urinary catheterization, hospital-acquired infection, dehydration and malnutrition, and&#xD;
      admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The risk factors for developing POD are additive&#xD;
      therefore, recognizing those with multiple risk factors should trigger environmental and&#xD;
      supportive measures implementation that have been proven to prevent the onset and shorten the&#xD;
      duration of POD because POD is associated with poor outcomes such as functional decline,&#xD;
      longer hospitalization, greater costs, a greater need for rehabilitation and home healthcare&#xD;
      services after discharge and higher mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketofol which is a mixture of ketamine and propofol gains increasing interest as an agent for&#xD;
      procedural sedation and analgesia for producing a more stable hemodynamic and respiratory&#xD;
      profile as Ketamine and propofol appear to counter each other's adverse effects;&#xD;
      sympathomimetic effects of ketamine and dose-dependent hypotension and respiratory depression&#xD;
      of propofol. Ketofol has been used in different mixed ratios (1:1-1:10) and has proven&#xD;
      effective in reducing postoperative agitation in children in several studies as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor (α2) agonist, has been widely used&#xD;
      in surgical patients and has positive sedation, anti-anxiety, and analgesic effects. The&#xD;
      mechanism of action of dexmedetomidine is unique compared with traditionally administered&#xD;
      sedative agents due to its lack of activity at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor&#xD;
      and missing anticholinergic activity.1that may contribute to pathophysiological explanations&#xD;
      of the development of delirium 'neurotransmitter hypothesis' and include dysfunction of&#xD;
      cholinergic transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that administration of ketofol following induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia, would reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and postoperative delirium, and&#xD;
      has a comparable effect to dexmedetomidine on investigators' groups of high-risk elderly&#xD;
      patients undergoing urgent exploration of intestinal obstruction.&#xD;
