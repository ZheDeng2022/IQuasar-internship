    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing disease that involves the colorectal mucosa.&#xD;
      Over the years, the therapeutic target has been upgraded from the resolution of symptoms to&#xD;
      deep remission to prevent relapses and complications. The primary therapeutic target to be&#xD;
      achieved in patients with UC is both clinical and endoscopic remission . The assessment of&#xD;
      histological inflammation has emerged as a promising endpoint in UC . However, the link&#xD;
      between histological disease activity and other measures of clinical disease activity is not&#xD;
      yet well established . Some authors suggest that the presence of histological inflammation is&#xD;
      a better predictor of future clinical relapse than endoscopic activity . Several studies&#xD;
      showed that patients with residual microscopic active inflammation seem to be more prone to&#xD;
      relapse when compared with patients with normal histology .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calprotectin is a 36-kDa calcium- and zinc-binding protein, which represents approximately&#xD;
      60% of soluble proteins of granulocyte cytoplasm . Fecal calprotectin (FC) is strongly&#xD;
      correlated with both MES and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Score (9, 10). In previous&#xD;
      studies, FC was shown to be helpful in predicting sustained clinical remission and mucosal&#xD;
      healing during anti-TNF treatment, particularly with IFX and ADA. However, no investigations&#xD;
      have been performed to evaluate the predictive value of FC in terms of mucosal healing in a&#xD;
      prospective cohort of patients with UC treated with biological therapy. Based on the above&#xD;
      background, the aim of the present prospective study is to identify a reliable biomarker able&#xD;
      to predict therapeutic effectiveness in UC .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing disease characterized by a neutrophil-mediated&#xD;
      inflammation of the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, European Crohn and Colitis Organization guidelines have highlighted how the grade of&#xD;
      neutrophilic infiltration is necessary for the diagnosis of this pathological condition and&#xD;
      for the evaluation of histological activity. Thus, colonoscopy is necessary to collect&#xD;
      mucosal biopsies and assess neutrophilic infiltration for the diagnosis and during follow-up&#xD;
      to evaluate treatment response and predict long-term outcome, although histological healing&#xD;
      is still debated. However, colonoscopy is an invasive, costly, and not always well-tolerated&#xD;
      examination for patients. Apart from endoscopic interventions, disease severity can be also&#xD;
      assessed using less-invasive biomarkers, including blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these regard the investigators aimed to investigate the ability of prediction of&#xD;
      hematological indices including (PLR, NLR and MLR) and fecal calprotectin to predict&#xD;
      histological remission in ulcerative colitis patients receiving biological therapy .&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of histological remission by using Geboes score index Histological remission was defined as Geboes index ≤ 3.0.15 .The Geboes index consists of a scoring system with five distinctive grades [each with subgrades], corresponding to different aspects of inflammatory activity in the mucosa. Grade 0 corresponds to structural [architectural] change, grade 1 to chronic inflammatory infiltrate, grade 2 to lamina propria eosinophils [2A] and neutrophils [2B], grade 3 to neutrophils in the epithelium, grade 4 to crypt destruction, and grade 5 to erosion or ulceration. Higher subgrade scores reflect a more severe condition.</description>
