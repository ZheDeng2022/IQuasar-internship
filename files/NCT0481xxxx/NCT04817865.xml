  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective record review to determine whether a novel multiplex PCR assay&#xD;
      can be utilized as a screening method for UTI in patients receiving Botox injection to treat&#xD;
      overactive bladder (OAB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel multiplex real-time PCR assay with mixed floral antibiotic resistance profiling&#xD;
      offers a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity than conventional culture methods in&#xD;
      the identification of UTI pathogens as determined by a previous prospective comparison study.&#xD;
      This is a retrospective record review comparing PCR and culture-based assessments for UTI in&#xD;
      patients receiving Botox injection to treat overactive bladder (OAB). Investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine whether M-PCR/P-AST can be utilized as a screening method for UTI in these patients&#xD;
      and whether whether antibiotic prophylaxis, peri-procedural antibiotics, and post-injection&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy based on patients' pre-procedural M-PCR/P-AST results in improved response&#xD;
      to Botox injection compared to standard of care. The attributes and advantages of PCR testing&#xD;
      over the use of traditional urine cultures, and the potential identification of polymicrobial&#xD;
      infections with complicated resistance sharing mechanisms, may significantly improve patient&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
