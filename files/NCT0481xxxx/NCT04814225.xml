  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, triple-blind, comparator controlled, parallel clinical&#xD;
      trial is to investigate the functional equivalence of three test products compared to whey&#xD;
      protein on muscular performance in a healthy, sedentary adult population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whey, a by-product of cheese manufacturing, is commonly used as an ingredient in meat&#xD;
      products, dairy products, baked goods, snacks, beverages, and infant formula. Its widespread&#xD;
      use is due to its advantageous effects on health, economics, and high nutritional value by&#xD;
      containing lactose, minerals, vitamins, and soluble proteins. Due to allergies, dietary&#xD;
      restrictions and/or personal dietary choices there is a need for an alternative protein&#xD;
      source(s), and plant-based protein options are in demand for these reasons. Roquette produces&#xD;
      the NUTRALYS® Pea Protein family of ingredients, supplying the widest range of pea protein&#xD;
      ingredients to the food industry suitable for use in a plethora of plant-based foods. Few&#xD;
      studies have examined the equivalence between pea protein and whey on muscle performance in&#xD;
      sedentary adults. The objective of this randomized, triple-blind, comparator controlled,&#xD;
      parallel clinical trial is to investigate the functional equivalence of three test products&#xD;
      compared to whey protein on muscular performance in a healthy, sedentary adult population.&#xD;
