  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to investigate the effectiveness of somatosensory input in robot-assisted hand&#xD;
      motor rehabilitation after stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From previous studies, we learnt that stroke survivor with impaired finger proprioception did&#xD;
      not achieve a functional benefit from robotic finger training. For this study, we would like&#xD;
      to determine if and the extent of finger proprioception can be improved through targeted&#xD;
      robotic proprioceptive training and the response to subsequent robotic finger movement&#xD;
      training. We would also include imagining studies via MRI/fMRI/EEG to provide more insights&#xD;
      to determine who responds best to proprioceptive training.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Box and Blocks Test</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We compare the change of Box and Block Test scores from baseline evaluation to 1-month post intervention. Participants are instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment in a box to a second compartment over a divider for a period of 60 seconds; each block that is moved is counted, and multiple blocks moved at the same time are counted as a single block. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment of the Upper Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the change of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment scores from the baseline evaluation to 1-month post intervention. Fugl-Meyer is a 66-point scale measuring the movement pattern of upper extremities. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the change of the Motor Activity Log (MAL) mean scores from the baseline evaluation to 1-month post intervention. The Motor Activity Log is a 30 questionnaire that collect subjective measure of an individual's real life functional upper limb performance. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in finger proprioception measured using the Crisscross Assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the change in finger proprioception scores from the baseline evaluation to 1-month post intervention. Finger proprioception is measured by using the FINGER Crisscross Assessment which we slowly move the index and middle fingers with the FINGER robot past each other without any visual input. We then ask study participants to press a key when they feel the fingers are overlapped. Finger proprioception is measured by the error which will be quantified as the mean magnitude of finger separation error at the metacarpal joint when the key is pressed. The lower scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
