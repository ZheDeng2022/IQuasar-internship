      The Young Survivors at Kantonsspital Aarau project assesses the prevalence and severity of&#xD;
      late effects in survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer according to the modified CTCAE&#xD;
      criteria prospectively. The clinical data are generated during regular follow-up care visits,&#xD;
      the collection starts directly after completion of treatment and is longitudinally.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 250-300 children and adolescents below the age of 21 years are newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      cancer in Switzerland every year. Research led to remarkable progress in survival in the last&#xD;
      decades. The 10-year survival rate in Switzerland is currently 87%. Previous research showed&#xD;
      that, depending on the treatment exposure, a high proportion of these survivors suffer from&#xD;
      chronic medical conditions, so called late effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies on late effects in former childhood cancer patients are based on retrospective&#xD;
      data. However, this type of study design has unavoidable limitations, such as missing data,&#xD;
      different coding and grading of severity of late effects, and the assessment at different&#xD;
      time points. Therefore, we need prospectively collected data, including severity coding in a&#xD;
      standardized way, to overcome these limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of &quot;Young Survivors at Kantonsspital Aarau, Switzerland&quot; is to assess&#xD;
      late effects in childhood cancer survivors prospectively and in a standardized way. These&#xD;
      data will contribute to the increasing knowledge on long-term outcomes and late effects in&#xD;
      the future. This new knowledge is important in order to be able to adapt and improve&#xD;
      long-term follow-up care. In the longer term, survivors will benefit from this extensive and&#xD;
      prospective data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Young Survivors at Kantonsspital Aarau&quot; has a registry-like design. Data produced during&#xD;
      regular follow-up visits are collected in a comprehensive database and in a standardized way.&#xD;
      We collect all information generated prospectively from start of the study onwards and&#xD;
      retrospectively until January 2016. From 2016 onward, all medical records are kept&#xD;
      electronically. We classify and grade the severity of late effects according to the modified&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE&#xD;
      v4.03). The outcome variables correspond to results from risk-stratified organ examinations,&#xD;
      which are performed according to the Children's Oncology Group guidelines v5.0. The exposure&#xD;
      variables correspond to information from the patients' medical history, including detailed&#xD;
      information on cancer diagnosis and treatment. The data will be analyzed in an exposure- or&#xD;
      organ system-driven approach. We start recruitment with patients diagnosed and treated at the&#xD;
      Kantonsspital Aarau. The design of the study allows the inclusion of other clinics in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research and significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on late effects of former childhood cancer patients often relies on retrospective&#xD;
      data collection, which is associated with unpreventable limitations. &quot;Young Survivors at&#xD;
      Kantonsspital Aarau&quot; overcomes these limitations and additionally grades the severity of late&#xD;
      effects in a standardized way. This allows us to analyze changes in severity of late effects&#xD;
      over time, within and between survivors. This information will increase our knowledge on late&#xD;
      effects and contribute to long-term follow-up care.&#xD;
