  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to characterize the disease impact, the disease management&#xD;
      and resource utilization, and provide benefits to the LC-FAOD community, by use of a&#xD;
      convenient online platform for participants (or caregivers) to self-report information.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The online LC-FAOD DMP is a non-interventional, prospective, observational disease-monitoring&#xD;
      program conducted through a mobile/web-based application developed by the Sponsor.&#xD;
      Participant data will be captured via the mobile/web-based application and entered into the&#xD;
      database designed and maintained by the Sponsor and/or its designee. Additional objectives of&#xD;
      the study are to benefit the LC-FAOD community by developing a comprehensive database for use&#xD;
      by the LC-FAOD community to characterize patient experience, inform disease management, and&#xD;
      enable further research, utilize the digital platform to notify patients, caregivers, and&#xD;
      relevant patient advocacy groups of research studies and clinical trials and share aggregated&#xD;
      and de-identified outputs to facilitate the exchange of information with patients and/or&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can be on any treatment in order to participate. Medical management of the&#xD;
      disease should continue as directed by the patient's physician(s). Specifically, no&#xD;
      treatments, investigational agents, or experimental interventions will be provided as part of&#xD;
      this online LC-FAOD DMP.&#xD;
