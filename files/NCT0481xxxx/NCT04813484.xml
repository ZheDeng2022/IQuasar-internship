  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to adapt and pilot a trauma-informed combination intervention named&#xD;
      'Kickin' it with the Gurlz' that was designed with, for, and by transgender women of color to&#xD;
      improve HIV care continuum outcomes. The intervention components include a violence and&#xD;
      gender affirmation screening tool, a peer-led adaptation of Seeking Safety, and&#xD;
      individual-level peer navigation sessions. The project will examine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary promise of the multicomponent by conducting a one-arm pilot&#xD;
      with 30 transgender women of color who have a history of trauma. Participants will complete&#xD;
      baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3-month follow up assessments.&#xD;

      This project seeks to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the trauma-informed&#xD;
      combination care intervention to improve HIV care continuum outcomes including the&#xD;
      development of community-informed strategies for subsequent RCTs. We will conduct a one-arm&#xD;
      pilot of the adapted multicomponent trauma-informed intervention named &quot;Kickin it with the&#xD;
      Gurlz.&quot; This project will collect feasibility and acceptability data related to identifying,&#xD;
      recruiting, enrolling, intervening with, and retaining participants (i.e. recruitment length,&#xD;
      screening procedures, feasibility of conducting sessions, intervention acceptability,&#xD;
      retention rates, feasibility of verifying self-reported and medical chart review data on&#xD;
      viral load and exit interviews with participants and staff at program conclusion). The study&#xD;
      will recruit 30 participants into the pilot study. Participants will complete baseline, end&#xD;
      of program, and 3-month post-intervention follow-up surveys. Exit interviews and interviews&#xD;
      with key stakeholders will identify strategies for implementing trauma-informed HIV treatment&#xD;
      efficacy trials with transgender women of color within close-knit communities, such as&#xD;
      acceptable and feasible control conditions, acceptable and feasible violence and gender&#xD;
      affirmation screening, biomedical confirmation methods, contamination concerns, and potential&#xD;
      changes needed within existing health care systems.&#xD;
