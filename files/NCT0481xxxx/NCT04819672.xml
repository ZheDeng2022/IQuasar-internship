  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative infection that presents clinical features such&#xD;
      as pain and limited range of motion. A weakness of the quadriceps makes this joint more&#xD;
      susceptible to wear and tear to the articular cartilage, especially in the medial compartment&#xD;
      of the knee. As a result, it is necessary to promote an increase of at least 30% in&#xD;
      quadriceps strength for a beneficial effect on pain and 40% in functional capacity.&#xD;
      Therapeutic exercises are used to increase strength muscle, in addition to high intensity&#xD;
      exercises, to decrease joint pain, low to moderate intensity resistance training has been&#xD;
      included, with the new approach of using partial blood flow restriction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical therapy sessions will be individual and supervised, will last 30-40 minutes, twice a&#xD;
      week, for eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will warm up with a walk or bike for 5 minutes. Then, a single series of&#xD;
      sustained stretching will be performed for a period of 40 seconds for the following muscle&#xD;
      groups: hamstrings, quadriceps femoris, hip abductors, hip adductors and gastrocnemius. After&#xD;
      the stretches, active muscle strengthening exercises will be performed focusing on the&#xD;
      quadriceps femoris muscle. The knee extension and squat exercises will be performed in four&#xD;
      sets, with the first set being thirty repetitions or even volitional fatigue, and the&#xD;
      following three sets will be fifteen to twenty-four repetitions, with 90 seconds of rest&#xD;
      between each series, and two minutes of rest at the end of the four series. Both groups will&#xD;
      perform these exercises with 30% of 1RM. The maximum load that will be lifted until&#xD;
      volitional fatigue between 7 to 10 repetitions will be used instead of direct 1RM&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the intensity of the exercises, this will be monitored by the physical therapist&#xD;
      according to the perception of the level of effort and difficulty reported by the participant&#xD;
      when completing the series of knee extension and squat, according to the specifications of&#xD;
      the modified Borg scale (CR-10) . The exercises will be carried out with a load between&#xD;
      60-80% of the capacity and level of effort reported by the participant. The load will be&#xD;
      increased by 2-10% when the patient is able to perform 24 complete repetitions in the last&#xD;
      series of the exercise with perceived effort &lt;60%. During the exercises, a metronome will be&#xD;
      used for the time under tension, 2 seconds for the eccentric and concentric phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial blood flow restriction will be used during knee extension and squat exercises as&#xD;
      follows: Arterial occlusion pressure will be measured by placing a cuff on the proximal thigh&#xD;
      in a standing position. The measurement of insufflation for each patient will be established&#xD;
      as follows: with the participant in the supine position, the pulse of the pedal will be&#xD;
      located with the LOGIQ e (GE Healthcare) Ultrasound. The cuff pressure will be increased&#xD;
      until the pedal pulse can no longer be identified, and then the arterial occlusion pressure&#xD;
      will be recorded when the pulse is restored. The RPFS will be performed at 60% of the&#xD;
      arterial occlusion pressure for the experimental group and there will be no arterial&#xD;
      occlusion pressure for the sham group.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4- and 8-weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Strength assessment will be measured by the Isokinetic Dynamometer by a blind assessor. The positioning will be carried out as follows: when seated in the chair, the popliteal fossa will be positioned 2 cm from the end of the seat, the hip positioned at 85 ° of flexion, the axis of movement of the device was aligned with the intercondylar line of the knee, and the lever arm kept 2 cm above the lateral malleolus. Belts will be placed to stabilize the trunk, abdomen and thigh of the evaluated member. After that, the limits of maximum range of motion and flexion will be established, the adequacy of the initial knee position at 90° of flexion and the weighing of the lower limb to be evaluated. The participant will be registered in the device system, with information such as dominance and limb injury. The protocol that will be used involves five concentric repetitions with maximum intensity at 60 °/s for strength assessment.</description>
