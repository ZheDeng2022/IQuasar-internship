    <textblock>
      BDB001-201 is a multi-center, open-label, Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of BDB001 in the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors that have&#xD;
      progressed on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAb treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BDB001-201 is a multi-center, open-label, multi-arm Phase II study evaluating an experimental&#xD;
      immunotherapy drug called BDB001. BDB001 is a Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist&#xD;
      delivered intravenously to systemically activate the innate and adaptive immunity in the&#xD;
      treatment of various tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      intravenous BDB001 administered as monotherapy in subjects with histologically-confirmed&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have progressed on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAb&#xD;
      treatment either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tumor types may be included in the trial: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC);&#xD;
      Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC); Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC);&#xD;
      Melanoma; Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC); Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC); Urothelial Carcinoma;&#xD;
      other types of solid tumors at the discretion of the Sponsor. Each tumor type will be&#xD;
      analyzed independently&#xD;
