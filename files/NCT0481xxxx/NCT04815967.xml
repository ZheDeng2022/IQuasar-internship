    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      a single-dose of MYOBLOC over a 1-year duration in adult subjects with upper limb monoplegia&#xD;
      or hemiplegia spasticity due to stroke or TBI, followed by an open-label extension safety&#xD;
      study of multiple doses. The primary goal is to assess the efficacy of MYOBLOC versus placebo&#xD;
      in the treatment of adult upper limb spasticity. The secondary goals are: to establish a safe&#xD;
      and efficacious dose of MYOBLOC (administered intramuscularly as a single total dose, to&#xD;
      assess the duration of therapeutic response of MYOBLOC after a single administration, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of MYOBLOC after multiple administrations at&#xD;
      13-week intervals over a minimum duration of 1 year.&#xD;

             failure to wean the subject from the ventilator while hospitalized in the intensive&#xD;
             care unit or respiratory care center). Subjects who use oxygen on an as needed basis&#xD;
