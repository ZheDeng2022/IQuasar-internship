      IMPRESS-Norway is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial evaluating efficacy of&#xD;
      commercially available, anti-cancer drugs prescribed for patients with advanced cancer&#xD;
      diagnosed with potentially actionable alterations as revealed by molecular diagnostics.&#xD;
      IMPRESS-Norway is a nation-wide study and all hospitals with an oncology and / or hematology&#xD;
      department will be invited to participate in the study. The study will use a combined&#xD;
      umbrella and basket design and a Simon two-stage model of expanding cohorts to follow up&#xD;
      potentially effective combinations of biomarker and drug on specific indications. Sampling of&#xD;
      biological material will be performed at presentation, during treatment and upon progression.&#xD;
      Additional biomarker and translational analyses including whole genome sequencing (WGS) on&#xD;
      tumour material and liquid biopsies, identifying mechanisms underlying drug sensitivity&#xD;
      versus resistance will be performed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients have an advanced malignancy already treated with standard treatment,&#xD;
      acceptable performance status and organ function, with no other suitable clinical trial&#xD;
      available in Norway. A molecular test performed at a study specific reference laboratory has&#xD;
      identified a potentially targetable molecular profile. Next, a suitable drug should be&#xD;
      available from the trial drug armamentarium. Finally, if the patient fulfils the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and is accepted for the trial, a second tumour biopsy (snap-frozen)/ tumour material&#xD;
      for WGS will be sampled. Patients enrolled in the study will enter an existing cohort, or, in&#xD;
      case a suitable cohort does not exist, a new cohort can be opened. One cohort will consist of&#xD;
      one diagnostic subgroup, one drug (or one drug-combination) and one molecular marker. The&#xD;
      choice of drug(s) will be supported by a list of potential profiles. In addition, available&#xD;
      knowledge from the literature will be used to prepare discussion in a national molecular&#xD;
      tumour board, which will provide a treatment recommendation to the treating physician and the&#xD;
      study doctors . The protocol-specified treatment may be administered to the patient once&#xD;
      drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is&#xD;
      performed for future biomarker studies and research on responders versus non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be monitored&#xD;
      for standard efficacy outcomes including tumour response, progression-free and overall&#xD;
      survival as well as study specific measures as duration of treatment. Patients that are&#xD;
      screened, but not included into any cohorts will be followed for 16 weeks for survival and&#xD;
      clinical course of disease. Treatment-related toxicities (CTCAE grade 3-5) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Study-specific treatment and outcome data including results from the molecular screening will&#xD;
      be reported to the Cancer Registry of Norway. Long-term follow up data using the Cancer&#xD;
      Registry of Norway and information from The Norwegian Patient Registry, The Norwegian&#xD;
      Prescription Database and Primary patient- and user Register (KPR) will be collected on all&#xD;
      patients screened.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type of Participant and Health status&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patient with a pathology-proven locally advanced or metastatic malignant disease&#xD;
                  who is no longer benefitting from standard anti-cancer treatment or for whom, in&#xD;
                  the opinion of the investigator, no such treatment is available or indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate&#xD;
                  oral medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below. However, as noted&#xD;
                  above, drug-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the drug-specific&#xD;
                  study manuals for each agent will take precedence for this and all inclusion&#xD;
                  criteria (exceptions for haematological diagnoses):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x109 / L&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Platelets &gt; 75,000/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. AST (SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
                       (or &lt; 5 x ULN in patients with known hepatic metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    6. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. RECIST v1.1 (10, 18) will be&#xD;
                  used for patients with solid tumours. For patients with multiple myeloma or&#xD;
                  non-Hodgkin lymphoma, IMWG response criteria (19) and CHESON/Lugano guidelines&#xD;
                  (20) will be used, resp. For glioblastoma patients, RANO criteria will be used&#xD;
                  (21). iRECIST will be used for immunotherapy-cohorts. IWG response criteria will&#xD;
                  be used for haematological cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Patients whose disease cannot be objectively measured by physical or radiographic&#xD;
                  examination (e.g., elevated serum tumour marker only) are NOT eligible, with the&#xD;
                  exception of CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Results must be available from a genomic / molecular test performed in a&#xD;
                  preapproved laboratory (Section 10.15). The test used to qualify a patient for&#xD;
                  participation in IMPRESS-Norway may have been performed on any specimen of the&#xD;
                  patient's tumour obtained at any point during the patient's care at the&#xD;
                  discretion of the patient's treating physician. Genomic assays performed on&#xD;
                  cell-free DNA in plasma (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) will also be acceptable if the&#xD;
                  genomic analysis is performed as defined in Section 10.5. NGS analyses will be&#xD;
                  performed on a newly sampled biopsy if possible. Information from these analyses&#xD;
                  might be used upon progression, for evaluation of possible new cohort-inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Have a genomic profile for which treatment with one of the approved targeted&#xD;
                  anti-cancer therapies included in this study has potential clinical benefit see&#xD;
                  Section 4.3.5&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Eligible genomic tests may include any of the following technologies and&#xD;
                  equivalent techniques: Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ&#xD;
                  hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (incl nanostring),&#xD;
                  array-based copy number analysis (CNV), sanger sequencing (SS), RNA sequencing,&#xD;
                  gene panels or whole exome sequencing (WES) by next generation sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
                  The test may have been performed on a fresh (frozen or in RNA-later) or&#xD;
                  paraffin-embedded specimen of the primary tumour or a metastatic deposit or on&#xD;
                  cell-free DNA derived from liquid biopsies (like for instance peripheral blood&#xD;
                  plasma), as determined by the treating physician, and must reveal a potentially&#xD;
                  actionable genomic variant or protein overexpression as defined in Section 4.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Patients must meet drug-specific eligibility requirements for the drug selected&#xD;
                  by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements 9.8. Because of the risks of drug treatment to&#xD;
        the developing fetus, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
        highly effective methods of contraception for the duration of study participation, and for&#xD;
        4 to 24 months following completion of study therapy as defined in Section 11.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10.9. Female participants must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test &lt;1 month&#xD;
        prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11.10. Male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. Male study patients must&#xD;
        agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier contraception as described under&#xD;
        sec. 11.4 during the entire study treatment period and through a certain time after the&#xD;
        last dose of study drug. Details are given in the &quot;Drug specific amendment&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed Consent 12.11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
        informed consent/assent document as described in Appendix 1 which includes compliance with&#xD;
        the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
        protocol. Guardians / parents can act on behalf of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Diagnostic assessments 11. If the patient's tumour has a genomic variant known to confer&#xD;
        resistance to an anti-cancer agent available in this study, the patient will not be&#xD;
        eligible to receive that agent but will be eligible to receive other drugs available in&#xD;
        this study if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met for that drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other Exclusions 12. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing 13. Patients who do not&#xD;
        meet drug-specific eligibility requirements for the drug selected by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: For each drug included in this protocol, specific inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
        (based on the Summary of Product Characterics (SPC) or manufacturer's recommendations) may&#xD;
        also apply. These can be found in the supplemental information about each agent included in&#xD;
        the appendices. Drug-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will take precedence over&#xD;
        the general inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
