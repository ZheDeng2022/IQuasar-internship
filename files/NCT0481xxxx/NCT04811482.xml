  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot will be used for academic research, in hopes of developing effective treatments&#xD;
      for early childhood anxiety. The intervention is an adaptation of Parent-Child Interaction&#xD;
      Therapy (PCIT). PCIT is an evidence-based intervention, rooted in attachment and social&#xD;
      learning theory. In recent years, researchers have successfully adapted PCIT to address&#xD;
      anxiety in a clinical setting (PCIT-CALM). In this pilot study, we will be applying the&#xD;
      PCIT-CALM intervention in the school setting, emphasizing teachers as a therapeutic agent of&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCIT is unique because the child's caregiver is trained on how to use therapeutic techniques,&#xD;
      and then receives live coaching via a &quot;bug in the ear&quot; as they learn to implement the new&#xD;
      skills. In this pilot study, both parents and teachers will be taught skills to create a&#xD;
      therapeutic relationship and address anxiety. After these teaching sessions, the child's&#xD;
      teacher will receive coaching in the classroom to implement the skills. The intervention will&#xD;
      last approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention is designed to treat early childhood anxiety. It is an adaptation of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), in which teachers rather than parents are targeted as the therapeutic agent of change. The intervention follows the procedures of the CALM protocol, in which caregivers are taught play therapy skills to support and address anxious behaviors and avoidance.</description>
