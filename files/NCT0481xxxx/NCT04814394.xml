      autoimmune hemolytic anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an acquired autoimmune disease resulting in the&#xD;
      production of antibodies directed against the patient's red blood cells (RBCs) causing&#xD;
      shortened erythrocyte lifespan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main pathogensis of the disease is autoantibodies (Ab) that directed against&#xD;
      erythrocytes, with or without complement (C) activation. The most common form of AIHA is warm&#xD;
      AIHA characterized by the presence of warm-type autoantibodies-immunoglobulin G (IgG) which&#xD;
      reacts optimally at 37 °C, causing RBC extravascular destruction by tissue macrophages .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of the etiology and pathogenesis of AIHA have focused on the autoreactive B&#xD;
      cells that have escaped tolerance mechanisms and regulatory T cells (Treg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main treatment of AIHA includes RBC transfusion and immune system inhibitors such as&#xD;
      corticosteroids. During an immune response, CD4 Th cells can differentiate into several&#xD;
      unique effector lineages that promote different immune responses via the secretion of&#xD;
      distinct types of cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a CD4 T cell lineage whose major function is to help B&#xD;
      cells form germinal centers (GCs) and produce high-affinity antibodies(6). Tfh cells are&#xD;
      characterized by expression of the CXCR5, the transcriptional repressor B cell lymphoma 6&#xD;
      (Bcl-6), programmed death 1 (PD-1), and inducible costimulator (ICOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells are a newly identified subset of Treg cells that&#xD;
      coexpress markers of both Treg cells and Tfh cells. In addition to expressing Tfh-related&#xD;
      markers, Tfr cells also express regulatory markers, such as FoxP3, CD25, CTLA-4, IL-10, and&#xD;
      transforming growth factor β (TGFβ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TFR cells represent a highly specialized subpopulation of Foxp3+ Tregs that co-express&#xD;
      TFHfeatures, such as Bcl-6, CXCR5, ICOS, PD-1 and Treg features CD25 and Foxp3. TFR cells&#xD;
      have the ability to inhibit TFH activation and cytokines production and suppress B cell GL7&#xD;
      and B7-1 expression and limited class switch recombination occurring in the GC via high&#xD;
      expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and production of&#xD;
      inhibitory cytokine- interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ)(5). The&#xD;
      involvement of TFR cells in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases remains&#xD;
      speculative, but an alteration of the TFR:TFH ratio is observed in the blood of patients&#xD;
      suffering from several autoimmune diseases, such as child immune thrombocytopenia, and&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
