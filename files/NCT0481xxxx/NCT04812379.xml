  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety for an observation period of 52 weeks with use of Abilify prolonged&#xD;
      release aqueous suspension for intramuscular (IM) injection in patients with bipolar I&#xD;
      disorder for prevention of recurrence/relapse of mood episodes in the routine clinical&#xD;
      setting. The early stage safety after the switching from oral aripiprazole to this IM&#xD;
      injection is investigated including extrapyramidal syndrome and malignant syndrome.&#xD;
      Information regarding efficacy is collected as well.&#xD;

    <description>Any untoward medicinal occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a Medicinal Product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment (ICH-E2A Guideline).&#xD;
An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a Medicinal Product (Abilify Prolonged Release Aqueous Suspension), whether or not it is considered causally related to the Medicinal Product.</description>

Maternal (pregnancy and breastfeeding) or paternal (via semen) exposure;&#xD;
Exposure during breastfeeding;&#xD;
Overdose/Incorrect dosage, misuse, abuse (e.g. patient sharing products);&#xD;
Medication errors (e.g. patient took wrong dose);&#xD;
Lack of therapeutic efficacy (e.g. the product doesn't work);&#xD;
Occupational exposure (e.g.: nurse administering the product is exposed);&#xD;
Cases of suspected transmission of infectious agents;&#xD;
Use of suspected or confirmed falsified product(s) or quality defect of the product(s);&#xD;
Withdrawal reactions;&#xD;
Accidental exposure (e.g.: child takes parent's product);&#xD;
