      The primary objective of this study is to assess the presence of a correlation between the&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound score (LUSS) and PaO2/FiO2 in patient presenting with interstitial syndrome&#xD;
      (IS) in the ED. The primary end point considers the null hypothesis to be a negative linear&#xD;
      distribution for LUSS and PaO2/FiO2 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and secondary end points One of the secondary objectives is to assess&#xD;
      the correlation between the LUSS and PaCO2 in patient presenting with IS in the ED. The end&#xD;
      point of this secondary outcome considers the null hypothesis to be a positive linear&#xD;
      distribution for the LUSS and PaCO2 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another secondary objective is to determine the influence of the presence of unilateral or&#xD;
      bilateral pleural effusion on the correlation between LUSS and PaO2/FiO2. The end point of&#xD;
      this secondary outcome considers the null hypothesis to be a negative linear distribution for&#xD;
      LUSS and PaO2/FiO in those three sub-groups: absence of pleural effusion group, unilateral&#xD;
      pleural effusion group and bilateral pleural effusion group.&#xD;

      Justification for the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstial lung disease (ILD) is characterized by a diffuse affection of the lung&#xD;
      interstitial tissue. It can be secondary to acute conditions such as pneumonia or pulmonary&#xD;
      oedema either of haemodynamic aetiology either permeability induced. ILD can also result from&#xD;
      chronic diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). It is admitted that acute ILD leads to&#xD;
      decreased pulmonary aeration and therefore to hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In front of a patient presenting in Emergency Department (ED) with altered oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      arterial blood is classically sampled. Arterial Blood Gases (ABG) procedure, in addition to&#xD;
      be painful for the patient, is invasive. ABG however gives access, among other results, to&#xD;
      the Arterial Pressure in Oxygen (PaO2), which evaluates the level of hypoxemia. Although the&#xD;
      correlation between ABG results and prognosis hasn't been widely evaluated, a rather recent&#xD;
      study supported the absence of correlation between those for Acute Heart Failure (AHF).&#xD;
      Authors however did not report the correlation between severity of symptoms at patient's&#xD;
      hospital admission and hypoxemia. Yet, according to the Berlin definition, hypoxemia&#xD;
      represented by the ratio PaO2/FiO2 is a severity indicator in Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound is a simple tool, non-invasive, non-irradiating, low cost and easily&#xD;
      available at the patient's bedside. In addition, ultrasound equipment has become wildly&#xD;
      available in the ED and more and more portable. Simultaneously, the interest of lung&#xD;
      ultrasound for critically ill patient has been demonstrated. The ILD ultrasonographic&#xD;
      diagnosis is based on the presence of multiple ultrasound artefacts called B-lines. B-lines&#xD;
      appear when the ratio between air and water is abnormal. Different anatomic substrates have&#xD;
      been recognized as being at the origin of this ultrasound pattern. In acute pulmonary oedema&#xD;
      the presence of B-lines is related to the presence of extra-vascular water. B-lines presence&#xD;
      is also attributed to the thickening of sub-pleural interlobular septa. B-lines are therefore&#xD;
      a representation of ILD and accessible using ultrasound. Additionally, more and more&#xD;
      ultrasound machines are provided with options to quantify the number of B-lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the importance of B-lines and their interconnection to ILD, a score has been&#xD;
      created to evaluate ILD. The Lung Ultrasound Score (LUSS) is based on B-lines quantitative&#xD;
      assessment. The B-lines detection is performed in six thoracic zones bilaterally. In each&#xD;
      zone, ultrasound lung aeration status is determined scoring from zero to four. A normal&#xD;
      aeration of the lung with presence of A lines, persistent pleural sliding and less than three&#xD;
      B-lines scores zero point. An ILD, resulting in moderate loss of aeration with more than&#xD;
      three spaced B-lines, 7mm apart, scores one point. An alveolar-interstitial syndrome meaning&#xD;
      a severe loss of aeration with coalescent B-lines, less then 3mm apart, scores two. An&#xD;
      alveolar consolidation leading to a complete loss of aeration with an ultrasonographic tissue&#xD;
      like pattern, scores three. A total score over thirty-six can be calculated using this&#xD;
      method. Initially developed on an experimental model resembling various pathological&#xD;
      conditions encountered in the critically ill, LLUS proved to be correlated to the different&#xD;
      states of aeration of the lung. Literature findings are consistent with LUSS being an&#xD;
      efficient tool to measure lung aeration in different intensive care situations: re-aeration&#xD;
      antibiotics-induced in Ventilator Associated Pneumonia, assessment of PEEP-induced lung&#xD;
      recruitment. LUSS realized during weaning trial has been showed to be able to predict of&#xD;
      post-extubation distress. In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), LUSS is efficient to quantify&#xD;
      lesions and predict mortality associated with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing LUSS has a good correlation to the lung aeration, the present physiological study is&#xD;
      meant to highlight a potential negative linear correlation between PaO2/FiO2 values and LUSS.&#xD;
      If this hypothesis is confirmed, the LUSS could eventually be a tooltool indirectly assessing&#xD;
      the impact of an ILD on haematosis and correlating the potential degree of hypoxemia in the&#xD;
      emergency room for patients with this acute pathology. This could secondary increase&#xD;
      patient's comfort by reducing ABG realization for follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention description&#xD;
&#xD;
      A LUSS will be realized by an investigator trained for lung ultrasound (LUS) and considering&#xD;
      him/herself confident for its use. A five-point Likert scale will be filled. To the statement&#xD;
      &quot;I am qualified to realize a LUSS&quot;, only emergency doctors answering &quot;I strongly agree&quot; or &quot;I&#xD;
      agree&quot; will be eligible for inclusion and added to investigators list using an amendment to&#xD;
      this protocol. The ultrasound machines operated for LUS belong to each ED meaning the&#xD;
      investigators are familiar to its use. To standardize the results, settings of the ultrasound&#xD;
      machines will be standardized. To allow the exploration of the pulmonary parenchyma a low&#xD;
      frequency curvilinear transducer will be used and evaluation of B-lines will be performed&#xD;
      using a depth of at least 12cm as commonly recommended1. In this SARS-COV-2 pandemic context,&#xD;
      patients affected with this condition having a pulmonary involvement could reach our&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. Therefore, special precautions, such as a single protection cover of&#xD;
      the ultrasound machine and proper use of disinfectant for probes will be recommended between&#xD;
      patients. Those measures will follow institutional procedures of ultrasound use during&#xD;
      COVID19 pandemic. LUS will take place within 10 minutes of ABG analysis. LUS will be&#xD;
      performed at the patient's bedside. The investigator will be blinded to any other procedure&#xD;
      made by treating physician for diagnostic purpose. The LUSS procedure will be used as&#xD;
      validated for ARDS15. For that matter, the thorax is virtually divided in six thoracic zones&#xD;
      bilaterally, comporting two anterior zones, two lateral zones and two posterior zones. The&#xD;
      anterior and lateral zones will be evaluated in strict dorsal decubitus and the posterior&#xD;
      zones will be evaluated with a light contro-lateral decubitus allowed, if necessary because&#xD;
      of patient morphotype. For each zone a score from zero to three will be determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0: A normal aeration of the lung with presence of A lines, persistent pleural sliding&#xD;
           and less than three B-lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1: Interstitial syndrome, resulting in moderate loss of aeration with more than three&#xD;
           spaced B-lines, 7mm apart, scores one point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: Alveolar-interstitial syndrome meaning a severe loss of aeration with coalescent&#xD;
           B-lines, less then 3mm apart, scores two.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3: An alveolar consolidation leading to a complete loss of aeration with an&#xD;
           ultrasonographic tissue like pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LUSS will be calculated by adding the score given to each 12 zones, with a maximum of&#xD;
      thirty-six. Patients scoring less than two, will be considered empirically with no&#xD;
      interstitial syndrome and will be secondary excluded of the study. Investigators will also&#xD;
      report the presence of pleural effusion allowing to classify the patient in one of these&#xD;
      three subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of pleural effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unilateral pleural effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bilateral pleural effusion In order to collect those results, a template with a reminder&#xD;
           about how to calculate the LUSS will be joined to the Case Report Form (CRF). The result&#xD;
           of LUSS won't be communicated to the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study flow chart is displayed in Figure 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study launching, the investigator will be recruited using a five-point Likert&#xD;
      scale as previously described. A presentation of the study and the procedure will be&#xD;
      organized by the coordinating investigators in each including ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible patients will be identified by the treating ED physician. Patients admitted to&#xD;
      ED with dyspnea, without taking account of any dyspnea classification, and for which the ED&#xD;
      physician decide on the basis of his clinical judgment the realization of an ABG, will be&#xD;
      considered for inclusion. The decision of the realization of an ABG being left to the ED&#xD;
      physician, ABG is not considered as an intervention. Patients less than eighteen years old,&#xD;
      patients presenting with a known chronic IS, COPD or patients for which LUS is not feasible&#xD;
      will be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will undergo a LUSS after having given an informed consent to the&#xD;
      investigator. The target population will include patients temporary not able to give a&#xD;
      written and informed consent due to their acute condition. Therefore, the consent will either&#xD;
      be written or verbal with secondary signature as soon as possible. Any legal representative&#xD;
      will also be given the possibility to sign consent. Only patients with written consent will&#xD;
      be included for data analysis. In Belgium, LUS isn't recognized as standard of care giving to&#xD;
      this study an interventional character. The result of the LUSS will not be communicated to&#xD;
      the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary exclusion Patients with a LUSS of less than 2 will not be considered as affected&#xD;
      with IS and be secondary excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and Data treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LUSS will be reported on a template included in the CFR. It will be filled out by the&#xD;
      investigator and joined to the signed consent. Name, first name, date of birth and hospital&#xD;
      administrative number of the included patients will be recorded on the CFR. Investigators&#xD;
      will only access personal data of the patient they have personally included; principal&#xD;
      investigators will have access to all personal data in order to be able to collect missing&#xD;
      data. Data will secondary be replaced by neutral identifier for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software IBM SPSS statistics 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) will be used to analyse&#xD;
      our data. Since LUSS will be considered as a continuous value for all of our analysis,&#xD;
      Pearson formula was used to calculate the patient sample. For the description of our&#xD;
      population, the continuous values will be expressed in mean with a minimal and maximal values&#xD;
      and standard deviations while discrete values will be reported by categories and expressed in&#xD;
      numbers and percentage. Comparison between quantitative data will be realized with a&#xD;
      Chi2-test and comparison between continuous data with a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
      Significance threshold will be set with a p-value at &lt;0.05. Confidence intervals will be 95%&#xD;
      and calculate using &quot; Mid-P exact value &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data circuit and confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paper CRFs will be collected in each centre by the principal investigators and&#xD;
      hand-delivered to the study promoter. Patients will initially be identified on the CRF by&#xD;
      their last name, first name, date of birth, file's number from the institution where they&#xD;
      have been included and an identification's number from the study. This identification's&#xD;
      number will include a reference for the inclusion centre, a number of inclusions, the first&#xD;
      letter of the patient name and month and year of birth. After completion of the collection of&#xD;
      missing data by principal investigators, patients will only be identified by their study&#xD;
      identification number in order to be anonymised. A list of correspondence between study&#xD;
      identification number and the other identifying data initially collected will be kept under&#xD;
      the responsibility of the promoter. This list is kept for the statutory period of time&#xD;
      provided for this type of research. The protection of the patient's personal data will be&#xD;
      guaranteed according to the European General Data Protection Regulation of 27 April 2016 (in&#xD;
      application since 25 May 2018), to the Belgian Law of 30 July 2018 on the protection of&#xD;
      privacy with regard to the processing of personal data and to the Belgian Law of 22 August&#xD;
      2002 on the rights of the patient.&#xD;
