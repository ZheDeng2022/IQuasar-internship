  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TX200-TR101 and its&#xD;
      effects on the donated kidney in living donor kidney transplant recipients. TX200-TR101 is a&#xD;
      product made from a kidney transplant recipient's own immune cells, which are genetically&#xD;
      modified and designed to help the transplant recipient's body accept their donated kidney and&#xD;
      prevent their immune system from rejecting it.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, first-in-human, open-label, single ascending dose, dose-ranging study&#xD;
      of autologous, chimeric antigen receptor T regulatory cells (CAR-Treg) in HLA-A2 mismatched&#xD;
      living donor kidney transplant recipients, with a control cohort of mismatched kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients of similar immunological risk.The aim is for the CAR-Tregs to recognise&#xD;
      the HLA-A2 molecule present on the donated kidney and subsequently induce and maintain&#xD;
      immunological tolerance to the organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study requires three different types of participants - transplant recipients who will&#xD;
      receive the study treatment TX200-TR101; control participants, who are transplant recipients&#xD;
      who will not receive the study treatment; and transplant donors, who will donate their kidney&#xD;
      to the transplant recipients.&#xD;

    <description>TX200-TR101 is an autologous gene therapy medicinal product composed of Treg cells (CD4+/CD45RA+/CD25+/CD127low/neg) that have been ex vivo expanded and transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding for a CAR to recognize HLA-A*02. Treatment will be given via an IV infusion at a pre-defined timepoint several weeks after transplant. Three, single ascending dose cohorts of TX200-TR101 are planned and an additional expansion cohort.</description>
