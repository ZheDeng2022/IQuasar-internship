  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with degenerative joint disease can effectively be treated with a primary total knee&#xD;
      replacement to reduce pain and improve function in their daily lives. Theoretically,&#xD;
      achievement of normal knee motion using a medial pivot design in total knee replacements can&#xD;
      be recreated in comparison to single radius designs, which could lead to an improvement in&#xD;
      post-surgical outcomes and satisfaction with the procedure. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare two types of implant designs (medial pivot and single radius) in a total knee&#xD;
      replacement using clinical outcomes, patient reported outcomes, and overall function assessed&#xD;
      by a specialized gait laboratory.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, cohort study in 100 adult subjects undergoing primary total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty that will receive one of the two total knee device systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary total knee replacement is an effective treatment for relieving pain and improving&#xD;
      function for patients with degenerative joint disease. Recently, design of knee implants in a&#xD;
      total knee replacement have received increased interest, particularly the medial pivot&#xD;
      designs. Single-radius implants are designed to minimize instability throughout the&#xD;
      functional range of movement. Medial pivot total knee designs theoretically recreate more&#xD;
      normal knee motion when compared to single radius designs. Both implant designs are commonly&#xD;
      used for total knee replacements. Outcomes of TKA are evaluated by multiple methods including&#xD;
      implant/device survivorship, radiographic assessments, clinical examinations, and patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures (PROMS). Laboratory based gait analysis performed at a specialized&#xD;
      research facility is not commonly conducted in patients with positive outcomes post-surgery&#xD;
      as this is associated with high cost. There is currently not enough research comparing these&#xD;
      two designs directly. Research is required to determine which design may provide better&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and satisfaction with the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to your normal standard clinical care, there will be scheduled pre-operative,&#xD;
      operative, 6-week, 6 month, 12 month, 24 month, 36 month, and 60 month follow-up visits.&#xD;
