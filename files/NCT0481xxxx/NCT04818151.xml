  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are at significantly increased risk of&#xD;
      thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function which makes&#xD;
      anticoagulation particularly challenging. Further, ESRD patients undergoing initiation of&#xD;
      anticoagulation for acute VTE are often kept in the hospital for heparin &quot;bridging&quot; which may&#xD;
      lead to a protracted length-of-stay (LOS) and may place patients at risk for&#xD;
      hospital-associated complications. The advent of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has&#xD;
      offered physicians choices in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However,&#xD;
      evidence suggests that rivaroxaban and dabigatran are associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
      bleeding in ESRD patients. In contrast, research suggests that apixaban may be safer in&#xD;
      patients with ESRD, and recent evidence suggests lower bleeding rates in ESRD patients&#xD;
      treated for atrial fibrillation with apixaban compared to those treated with warfarin.&#xD;
      However, to date, no large national cohort studies have examined the safety, effectiveness,&#xD;
      and healthcare utilization of apixaban in patients with ESRD who have acute VTE. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to use the Standard Analytic Files from the United States Renal Data&#xD;
      System (USRDS) for years 2014 through 2018 to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization of ESRD patients initiated on apixaban compared to those initiated on&#xD;
      warfarin (following heparin) to treat acute VTE.&#xD;

      The investigators will perform a retrospective cohort analysis using USRDS data from 2014&#xD;
      through 2018 and a descriptive serial cross-sectional analysis using USRDS data from 2009&#xD;
      through 2018 to evaluate the investigators' aims. USRDS data will be utilized to address all&#xD;
      the research aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To compare rates of major bleeding attributable to initiation of treatment&#xD;
      with apixaban relative to warfarin among patients with ESRD and acute VTE The primary safety&#xD;
      outcome will be rates of major bleeding within 6 months of VTE diagnosis as defined by&#xD;
      Cunningham, which is a standardized definition of major bleeding that can be derived from&#xD;
      administrative data and is based on clinical bleeding definitions from a number of clinical&#xD;
      trials. A secondary safety outcome will be gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months of VTE&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To describe contemporary anticoagulation strategies to treat acute VTE&#xD;
      in ESRD patients and changes over the last decade The investigators will report rates of use&#xD;
      of anticoagulation strategies [warfarin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and DOACs&#xD;
      (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran)] in this ESRD population. The investigators&#xD;
      will examine rates of these strategies by year to examine changes in adoption of various&#xD;
      strategies over time as DOACs have become available for VTE treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare rates of recurrent VTE attributable to initiation of treatment with apixaban&#xD;
      relative to warfarin among patients with ESRD and acute VTE The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      recurrent VTE within 6 months of VTE diagnosis. All-cause mortality within 6 months of VTE&#xD;
      diagnosis will be evaluated as an exploratory endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare healthcare resource utilization from 15 days before to 90 days after first&#xD;
      prescription date attributable to initiation of treatment with apixaban relative to warfarin&#xD;
      among patients with ESRD and acute VTE The primary outcome will be total inpatient days from&#xD;
      15 days before to 90 days after first prescription date. In addition to total inpatient days,&#xD;
      the investigators will also compare emergency department (ED) utilization after initiation of&#xD;
      anticoagulation across treatment strategies. By incorporating 15 days prior to first&#xD;
      prescription date, the investigators will capture hospitalization days that were associated&#xD;
      with the index VTE diagnosis, given that the first anticoagulation prescription would likely&#xD;
      be written at the time of hospital discharge for those patients who are hospitalized.&#xD;
