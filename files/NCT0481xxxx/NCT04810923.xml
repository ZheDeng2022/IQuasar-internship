  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The authors designed a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial after the ethical&#xD;
      approval by the University Ethics Committee. The patients with temporomandibular joint&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA) randomly assigned one of the two treatment groups: intra-articular&#xD;
      injection of injectable platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) after arthrocentesis procedure as i-PRF&#xD;
      group and arthrocentesis procedure alone as control group. The primary outcome variable was&#xD;
      pain levels at preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 12th month. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome variables included maximum mouth opening (MMO), lateral and protrusive&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;

      The authors designed a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial after the ethical&#xD;
      approval by the University Ethics Committee. The patients with TMJ-OA randomly assigned one&#xD;
      of the two treatment groups: intra-articular injection of i-PRF after arthrocentesis&#xD;
      procedure as i-PRF group and arthrocentesis procedure alone as control group. All treatment&#xD;
      procedures were completed by the same experienced surgeon under the local anesthesia. The&#xD;
      procedure of arthrocentesis was performed using the standard technique and after&#xD;
      arthrocentesis procedure, the i-PRF injection was performed in the test group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable was pain levels at preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1st,&#xD;
      2nd, 3rd, 6th and 12th month. The secondary outcome variables included maximum mouth opening&#xD;
      (MMO), lateral and protrusive movements.&#xD;
