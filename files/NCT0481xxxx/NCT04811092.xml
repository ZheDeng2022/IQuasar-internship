  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of sotatercept treatment (plus&#xD;
      background PAH therapy) versus placebo (plus background PAH therapy) on time to clinical&#xD;
      worsening (TTCW) in participants who are newly diagnosed with PAH and are at intermediate or&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study A011-13 is Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      sotatercept when added to background PAH therapy in newly diagnosed intermediate- or high&#xD;
      risk PAH patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the study will have a diagnosis within 6 months of study screening&#xD;
      of symptomatic PAH (WHO Group 1, classified as FC II or III) and presentation of idiopathic&#xD;
      or heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD), drug- or toxin-&#xD;
      induced PAH, post shunt correction PAH, or PAH presenting at least 1 year following the&#xD;
      correction of congenital heart defects.&#xD;
