      This study aims to determine the effect of immersion bathing and showering on comfort levels&#xD;
      and physiological parameters of newborns in neonatal intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled experimental study. The sample consisted of a total of 69&#xD;
      newborns who were born at the 37th gestational week and above, were referred to the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit of a training and research hospital, and met the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Study groups were determined through randomization by throwing a dice (immersion&#xD;
      bathing group:35, showering group:34). Environmental variables were kept the same for both&#xD;
      groups. Physiological parameters (respiration, high heart rate, oxygen saturation, body&#xD;
      temperature) and comfort levels of newborns in both groups were compared before, just after&#xD;
      and 15 minutes after the bath. Their comfort levels were measured using the Newborn Comfort&#xD;
      Behavior Scale (NCBS).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A power analysis was performed to determine the sample size, which was calculated to include 31 newborns for each study group under the conditions of 0.05 significance level, 0.95 confidence interval and 0.95 power. Due to possible missing data, the sample size was increased by 10%, and the study was completed with a total of 69 newborns, including 35 in the immersion bathing group and 34 in the showering group.In this study, randomization by throwing a dice was used to allocate newborns into study groups. A dice was rolled for each newborn who met the study inclusion criteria, whereby the newborn was assigned to the immersion bathing group when an even number was observed, and to the showering group when an odd number was observed.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale (NCBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed by Dijk et al. (2009), and its Turkish validity and reliability study was performed by Kahraman et al. (2014). This is a five-point Likert type scale with six factors: alertness, calmness/agitation, respiratory response, physical movement, crying, muscle tone, and facial tension. The NCBS is used by nurses to assess the baby's comfort, pain and distress. Total score ranges from 6 to 30. A lower score indicates a higher newborn comfort level. A total score between 9-13 indicates that the baby is &quot;comfortable&quot;, whereas a total score between 14-30 indicates that the baby has pain and distress, that is, is &quot;uncomfortable&quot; and needs comfort enhancing interventions.</description>

    <description>Immersion bathing was started by placing the baby's whole body, except for the head and neck, into a bathtub of warm water with a depth of 13-14 cm. The baby was shampooed and cleaned in the tub. Then, the baby was taken out of the water and rinsed over the tub. Finally, the baby was wrapped with a towel, taken to the radiant and dried, thus the process of bathing was completed.</description>

    <description>Shower was started by keeping the baby's face down and firmly gripping the baby from his/her armpit and head by one of the nurse's hands. The baby was washed under running water with the other hand. The second nurse assisted to ensure the flow of water. After the baby was rinsed, he/she was wrapped with a towel, taken to the radiant and dried, thus the process of bathing was completed.</description>
