  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide prevention is the top clinical priority for VA/DoD. Suicide is one of the leading&#xD;
      causes of death in the United States and worldwide with suicide rates among U.S. military&#xD;
      Veterans doubling (27.7 per 100,000) the rate of civilian levels. Despite a rise in&#xD;
      prevention efforts, rates have continued to increase. Theories of suicide and rehabilitation&#xD;
      psychology stress the importance of the person-environment interaction in contributing to&#xD;
      one's disability experience. Several studies have found that the most frequent situation&#xD;
      precipitating suicide was a problem with a romantic partner. In contrast, people with higher&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction are less likely to have suicidal thoughts. Prevention of suicide in&#xD;
      high risk Veterans is of vital importance and the quality of one's intimate relationship is&#xD;
      an understudied intervention target for suicide prevention. Despite the fact that VA/DoD&#xD;
      recommend and Veterans desire treatments that involve family members, currently no&#xD;
      couple-based suicide-specific interventions exist. The goals of this CDA-II proposal are to&#xD;
      refine and pilot a novel suicide-specific couple-based intervention: Treatment for&#xD;
      Relationships and Safety Together (TR&amp;ST). TR&amp;ST adapts an evidence-based intervention for&#xD;
      suicide, Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (BCBT) for Suicide, to be dyadically focused and&#xD;
      integrates Cognitive Behavioral Couple Therapy (CBCT) skills. The proposed 5-year study&#xD;
      consists of two phases. Phase 1: treatment refinement with 10 couples (N=20) and Phase 2:&#xD;
      pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of TR&amp;ST compared to VA Standard Suicide&#xD;
      Intervention, which will involve suicide risk assessment, VA safety planning, Suicide&#xD;
      Prevention Coordinator (SPC) follow-up, and referral to outpatient mental health with 60&#xD;
      couples (N=120). The intervention period is 12-weeks and the entire study period is&#xD;
      approximately 7 months. Couples in both phases will be quantitatively assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-months post-treatment. The primary outcome to be&#xD;
      evaluated is change in severity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcomes concern changes in&#xD;
      interpersonal functioning theorized to influence suicidal thoughts and behavior.&#xD;

      Suicide prevention is the top clinical priority for VA/DoD. Suicide is one of the leading&#xD;
      causes of death in the United States and worldwide with suicide rates among U.S. military&#xD;
      Veterans doubling (27.7 per 100,000) the rate of civilian levels. Despite a rise in&#xD;
      prevention efforts, rates have continued to increase. Theories of suicide and rehabilitation&#xD;
      psychology stress the importance of the person-environment interaction in contributing to&#xD;
      one's disability experience. Several studies have found that the most frequent situation&#xD;
      precipitating suicide was a problem with a romantic partner. In contrast, people with higher&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction are less likely to have suicidal thoughts. The International&#xD;
      Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) identifies social engagement and&#xD;
      communication as important components of functioning. Prevention of suicide in at-risk&#xD;
      Veterans is of vital importance and the quality of one's intimate relationship is an&#xD;
      understudied intervention target for suicide prevention. The importance of including family&#xD;
      members in Veterans' suicide related care is a critical component of the National Strategy&#xD;
      for Preventing Veteran Suicides 2018-2028, the National Action Alliance on Suicide&#xD;
      Prevention, and a key finding from VA/DoD patient focus groups conducted for the 2019 VA/DoD&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of Patients at Risk for&#xD;
      Suicide. Despite the fact that VA/DoD recommend and Veterans desire treatments that involve&#xD;
      family members, currently no couple-based suicide-specific interventions exist. The goals of&#xD;
      this CDA-II are to refine and pilot a novel suicide-specific couple-based&#xD;
      intervention-Treatment for Relationships and Safety Together (TR&amp;ST). TR&amp;ST adapts an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention for suicide, Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (BCBT) for&#xD;
      Suicide, to be dyadically focused and integrates Cognitive Behavioral Couple Therapy (CBCT)&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed 5-year study consists of two phases. Phase 1: treatment refinement with 10&#xD;
      couples (N=20) and Phase 2: pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of TR&amp;ST compared to VA&#xD;
      Standard Suicide Intervention, which will involve suicide risk assessment, VA safety&#xD;
      planning, Suicide Prevention Coordinator (SPC) follow-up, and referral to outpatient mental&#xD;
      health with 60 couples (N=120). The intervention period is 12-weeks and the entire study&#xD;
      period is approximately 7 months. Couples in both phases will be quantitatively assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-months post-treatment. The primary outcome to&#xD;
      be evaluated is change in severity of suicidal ideation. Secondary outcomes concern changes&#xD;
      in interpersonal functioning theorized to influence suicidal ideation and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Phase 1): refine TR&amp;ST in a population of Veterans with active suicidal ideation Aim 2&#xD;
      (Phase 2): evaluate feasibility and acceptability of TR&amp;ST Hypothesis 1 is that TR&amp;ST will be&#xD;
      feasible to deliver, as evidenced by attainment of recruitment goals, retention rates 70%,&#xD;
      and high credibility and expectancy ratings and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Phase 2): estimate the preliminary impact of TR&amp;ST vs. VA Standard Suicide&#xD;
      Intervention on suicidal ideation severity and proximal targets of interpersonal functioning&#xD;
      over 7 months to determine if a future efficacy trial is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a is that Veterans engaged in TR&amp;ST (vs. VA Standard Suicide Intervention) will&#xD;
      have greater reduction in suicidal ideation severity (primary outcome) Hypothesis 2b is that&#xD;
      Veterans and partners engaged in TR&amp;ST (vs. VA Standard Suicide Intervention) will have&#xD;
      improved interpersonal functioning (i.e., communication, bonding, relationship satisfaction)&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c is that the effect of TR&amp;ST on Veteran's reduced suicidal ideation will be&#xD;
      mediated by improvements in Veteran and partner interpersonal functioning Exploratory Aim 1:&#xD;
      examine rates of suicide related behavior for Veterans in TR&amp;ST (vs. VA Standard Suicide&#xD;
      Intervention) Exploratory Aim 2: examine links between weekly changes in suicidal ideation&#xD;
      and relationship quality Exploratory Aim 3: examine the impact of TR&amp;ST on depression, PTSD,&#xD;
      and relationship conflict&#xD;

    <description>TR&amp;ST consists of twelve 90-minute sessions delivered in four phases. During phase one, couples receive a tailored cognitive-behavioral conceptualization of suicide and relationship distress based on clinical interview, as well as psychoeducation about their bidirectional influences. They also engage in behavioral activation focused on positive couple activities, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and conflict management strategies. In phase two, couples learn communication skills and discuss suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as their relationship challenges that interact with suicidal thoughts and behavior. Phase three is focused on conjoint thought challenging to shift dysfunctional cognitions related to suicide and relationship problems. Finally, in phase four, couples engage in relapse prevention exercises and outline individual and couple values in order to create a &quot;life worth living&quot; moving forward.</description>
