  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that addition of the Monocyte Width Distribution&#xD;
      (MDW) parameter to current standard of care improves a clinician's ability to recognize&#xD;
      sepsis in the Emergency Department, resulting in earlier decision to administer antibiotics&#xD;
      from time of ED presentation for sepsis patients (simulated primary endpoint), with&#xD;
      concomitant reductions in length of stay and in-hospital mortality for those patients&#xD;
      (secondary endpoints).&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to develop a method for identifying sepsis patients from&#xD;
      electronic health records (EHR) based on Sepsis-2 criteria. Sepsis patients will be&#xD;
      identified using a Sepsis Definition which includes meeting SIRS score of â‰¥2 within 12 hours&#xD;
      of ED presentation and any microbial testing ordered within 24 hours of ED presentation. The&#xD;
      patient will be enrolled if it meets the Sepsis Definition and additional EMR data elements&#xD;
      will be extracted to complete case report form. Furthermore, objectives include to confirm&#xD;
      the clinical validity and performance of MDW in a control population of sepsis patients where&#xD;
      MDW is measured but not reported to physicians. This study is an observational study which&#xD;
      will simulate the decision impact of MDW on sepsis identification and patient management&#xD;
