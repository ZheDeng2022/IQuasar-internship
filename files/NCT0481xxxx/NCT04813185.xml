  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a hospital-based violence intervention&#xD;
      (Bridging the Gap) is effective for reducing violence. The researchers think that adults who&#xD;
      receive Bridging the Gap will see greater improvements than those who do not receive the&#xD;
      intervention. This study will allow them to learn more about the intervention's&#xD;
      effectiveness. The study will also help them understand if the violence intervention affects&#xD;
      other behaviors, such as firearm use, drug use, aggression, risky behaviors, and rates of&#xD;
      violent re-injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 616 patients will enroll in this study. Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      sessions about behavior, personality, and experiences. Participants will be randomized into a&#xD;
      study group (either Bridging the Gap or Treatment as Usual) by drawing a number. If patients&#xD;
      agree to the study but do not like the group they are assigned to, they can request to switch&#xD;
      groups. Participants assigned to the Treatment as Usual intervention will receive a brief&#xD;
      violence awareness brochure during your hospital stay. Participants assigned to the Bridging&#xD;
      the Gap intervention will receive an in-hospital intervention and, once released from the&#xD;
      hospital, will receive 6-months of community case management services. The study team thinks&#xD;
      that adults who receive the Bridging the Gap intervention will see greater improvements than&#xD;
      adults who do not receive the intervention. This study will allow them to learn more about&#xD;
      the intervention's effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these study sessions participants will complete questionnaires about exposure to&#xD;
      traumatic events, symptoms of trauma, history of suicide, aggression and violence, antisocial&#xD;
      personality traits, illegal behaviors, substance use, and mental health. Participants will&#xD;
      complete several tasks which measure cognitive ability, such as problem-solving,&#xD;
      attention/concentration, and decision-making. They will also complete a clinical interview&#xD;
      that covers antisocial personality traits and behaviors, including history of aggressive&#xD;
      behavior and substance use. These interviews will be video recorded. These recordings will be&#xD;
      used to help score the interviews and for training purposes. Information will also be&#xD;
      collected from participant's medical records, including demographic information, history and&#xD;
      reason for past hospitalizations, mental health history, and substance use reports, as well&#xD;
      as a criminal background check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surveys take about 2 hours to complete. Participants will complete these questionnaires&#xD;
      again 6 and 12 months later. Participation in this study will last up to 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Bridging the Gap Bridging the Gap is a hybrid model for violence prevention which integrates a hospital-based brief violence intervention (BVI) delivered to the patient while in hospital with a wrap-around community case management prevention strategy.&#xD;
Firearm Counseling Program The firearm counseling program was developed to be administered in the hospital alongside the 6-step intervention program, as well as in the patient's home after hospital discharge. The firearm safety counseling program includes 3 components aimed at understanding patient risk, reducing firearm-related violence risk-factors, and helping patients increase firearm safety practices.</description>
