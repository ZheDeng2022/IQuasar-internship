  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single ascending dose, first in human, open-label, non-controlled,&#xD;
      dose-escalation trial that will investigate intravenous infusions of Umbilical cord lining&#xD;
      stem cells (UCLSCs) in Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients from the Advanced Heart Failure and LVAD Clinic at the&#xD;
      University of Florida, including recently implanted patients, as well as patients on chronic&#xD;
      long-term support, with the goal of enrolling up to 9 subjects to participate in the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be entered into a 3+3 dose escalation study, a standard design for initial&#xD;
      trials to evaluate tolerability of a therapeutic agent and identify a maximal tolerated dose&#xD;
      if indeed toxicities are identified in the pre-specified dosing range. The first 3 subjects&#xD;
      will be administered 50 x 10^6 ULSCs reconstituted in PBS with 1% human serum albumin in a&#xD;
      volume of 250 ml, and monitored for adverse events or toxicities, immediately following&#xD;
      dosing, and again at 30 days. Safety endpoints will be reviewed by the DSMB and depending on&#xD;
      the response, the dose will be escalated to 100 x 10^6 and 200 x 10^6 ULSC in a constant 250&#xD;
      ml volume. We will enroll only 9 subjects in the case that no subject experiences toxicity,&#xD;
      only expanding the cohort in the event that a subject experiences toxicity at a particular&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This specific dose escalation approach is based on the following considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not yet a standard dosing regimen for cell therapy in heart failure patients. The&#xD;
      previous MSC trial in LVAD patients provided 150 million cells. The RIMECARD trial&#xD;
      (Bartolucci et al, Circ Res 2017 Oct 27;121(10):1192-1204. PMID 28974553) provided umbilical&#xD;
      cord-derived MSC for patients with heart failure via intravenous infusions of 1x106 cells/kg.&#xD;
      Similarly, another Phase IIa trial of MSCs in HFrEF used 1.5x106 cells/kg (Butler et al.,&#xD;
      Circ Res 2017 Jan 20;120(2):332-340. PMID 27856497). Since our LVAD patients range in size&#xD;
      from 50 to &gt; 100kg, we believe the selected range of doses is reasonable for this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in ongoing studies in COVID 19 ARDS, IND# 19979, we have provided 100 x 106&#xD;
      ULSCs with no adverse safety signals. Moreover, in our non-clinical animal models, we&#xD;
      demonstrated safety at doses ranging from a high dose of 1 x 106 cells/mouse, which is&#xD;
      equivalent to approximately 5 x 107 cells/kg in humans and a low dose of 5 x 104 cells/mouse&#xD;
      which is equivalent to approximately 2.5 x 106 cells/kg in humans. The dose tested in the&#xD;
      high dose preclinical study would scale to administration of over 2.5 billion cells in an&#xD;
      individual weighing 100 pounds.&#xD;
