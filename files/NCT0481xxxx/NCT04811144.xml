      There are four indications will be included in this plan. They are Cavity, Sensitive Teeth,&#xD;
      Abnormal Frenum Attachment and Peri-implantitis. Each indication has different procedures&#xD;
      which are listed as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cavity: history records, affected range check, X-ray&amp;photo, treatment, pain index check,&#xD;
      return visit check after two weeks. Sensitive Teeth: history records, sensitive check,&#xD;
      X-ray&amp;photo, treatment, pain index and effectiveness check, return visit check after two&#xD;
      weeks. Abnormal Frenum Attachment: history records, abnormal position check, photo, cutting,&#xD;
      pain index check, return visit check after three, five and seven days. Peri-implantitis:&#xD;
      History records, measure periodontal pocket depth, anaerobes collect, X-ray, photo, CT,&#xD;
      treatment, pain index check, return visit check after one week, two weeks, four weeks and&#xD;
      three months, six months check the effectiveness and collect anaerobes during every return&#xD;
