      Objective: Fever of unknown (FUO) origin remains challenging in geriatric patients. Geriatric&#xD;
      patients have a blunted immune response responsible for altered fever mechanisms and immune&#xD;
      cells responses. Consequently, FUO could be inappropriately named and could be changed in&#xD;
      Inflammation of unknown origin (IUO) in this specific population. Furthermore, the studies of&#xD;
      FUO in this group are (out)dated and the diagnostic methods have evolved achieving a better&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity. The aim of our study is to assess the spectrum of diseases&#xD;
      responsible of FUO or IUO in elderly patients compared to younger patients and to define the&#xD;
      diagnostic approach using new diagnostic investigations. The second aim of our study is to&#xD;
      assess the usefulness of inflammatory markers, demographic data and comorbidity to&#xD;
      differentiate the cause of FUO/IUO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Patients with FUO or IUO will prospectively be recruited at the geriatric unit and&#xD;
      the internal medicine unit of the UZ hospital during four years. The demographic, social and&#xD;
      medical data will be screened. All diagnostic methods will be described.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until today, diagnose of fever of unknown origin remains challenging in elderly patients. The&#xD;
      presentation of the disease is often atypical and this can delay diagnose and treatment.&#xD;
      Geriatric patients have a blunted immune response responsible for altered fever mechanisms.&#xD;
      For example, thirty-two percent of geriatric patients presented an infection at the emergency&#xD;
      service having no pyrexia or increased white blood cell count in the presence of an&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the definition of FUO in older patients is different from younger patients. FUO&#xD;
      in older patients is defined as tympanic or axillar fever &gt; 37.2.0C, a rectal fever more than&#xD;
      37.50C or a change of &gt; 1.3 centigrade from basal temperature during more than 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the name FUO is probably not appropriate in this population and should be&#xD;
      replaced with inflammation of unknown origin. However, Unger et al also proposed inflammation&#xD;
      of unknown origin in a younger population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knockaert et al have shown that the causes of FUO are different in older patients compared to&#xD;
      young patients. The causes of FUO are more frequently found in older patients (&gt; 65 years&#xD;
      old) compared to younger patients (87-95% and 79% respectively). One explanation is the&#xD;
      atypical presentation of classic diseases in geriatric patients. Infection, multi-system&#xD;
      diseases and neoplasms were the most prevalent causes. These studies are old and the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic methods used presently, such as FDG-Pet-CT,&#xD;
      have changed. The spectrum of diseases responsible of FUO or IUO in older patients could&#xD;
      therefore have changed since the Knockaert studies. These new diagnostic methods allow better&#xD;
      diagnose but also faster diagnose. Consequently the definition of FUO can become obsolete in&#xD;
      the field of the duration of the fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the study is an observational prospective study which will start in juli 2021&#xD;
      until open date in function of the number of included patient (at least 50 patients in both&#xD;
      groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at the geriatric unit and internal medicine unit or geriatric&#xD;
      outpatient clinic or internal medicine outpatient clinic of UZ Brussel and will be followed&#xD;
      during one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient clinic patients will be recruited during the consultation; the patients who&#xD;
      are hospitalized will be recruited during the first week of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are the impossibility to have an informed consent from the patient of&#xD;
      a representative of the patient. Neutropenia, HIV or nosocomial fever of unknown origins are&#xD;
      excluded. Immunodepressed patients are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be screened for underlying illnesses by direct questioning, medical&#xD;
      archives and blood sampling. Social evaluation will include determination of age, gender,&#xD;
      home (private versus institution), and marital status. Clinical data will comprise: smoking&#xD;
      and alcohol habits, old work, hobbies, travel, animal's owner, pneumococcal and influenza&#xD;
      vaccine status, allergy, Body mass index (BMI), medical history, current treatment and&#xD;
      reasons for hospitalization, recent antibiotic or corticoid treatment. For the older patients&#xD;
      (&gt; 70 years old) we will perform a CGA to identify comorbidity and common geriatric&#xD;
      conditions. The polypathology and the severity of the medical problems will be scored using&#xD;
      the &quot;Charlson comorbidity Index&quot;15 and &quot;Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric&quot; (CIRS-G).&#xD;
      It is an instrument to quantify disease burden. It comprises a comprehensive review of&#xD;
      medical problems of 14 organ systems. It is based on a 0 to 4 rating of each organ system.&#xD;
      The &quot;Geriatric Depression Scale&quot; will be used to assess the probability of depressed mood&#xD;
      (GDS-15) in 15 questions. The assessment of &quot;Activities of Daily Living&quot; (ADL) will be made&#xD;
      by using Katz's scale. It includes the following items: bathing, dressing, transfer, toilet,&#xD;
      continence and eating. Each task is graded on a 3-level scale (1 to 3 for Katz's scale),&#xD;
      where lower levels represent the absence of dependence and upper level the maximal dependence&#xD;
      for the task. Cognitive functions will be assessed using the &quot;Mini Mental State Examination&quot;&#xD;
      (MMSE). Possible scores range from 0 to 30 points, with lower scores indicating impaired&#xD;
      cognitive function. Nutritional status was assessed using the &quot;Mini Nutritional Assessment&quot;&#xD;
      (MNA). A score ≥ 24 identifies patients with a good nutritional status. Scores between 17 and&#xD;
      23.5 identify patients at risk of malnutrition. These latter patients have not yet started to&#xD;
      lose weight and do not show low plasma albumin levels but have lower protein-caloric intakes&#xD;
      than recommended. A score &lt; 17 indicates protein-caloric malnutrition. Pain will be assess&#xD;
      using a visual analogical scale from 0 to 10 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diagnostic method means from the standard care of the patients during the hospital stay&#xD;
      performed for the assessment of the fever or inflammatory syndrome will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biological analyses, (such as CRP, renal function, lever function, electrolytes,&#xD;
           sedimentation rates, uric acid, TSH, vitamin B12, folic acid, 25(OH) vitamin D,&#xD;
           hemoglobin, hematocrit, proteins, albumin, white blood cells and formula, creatinine&#xD;
           clearance (Cockcroft and de Gault formula), autoimmune assessment, viral or bacterial&#xD;
           serology,…&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urine analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bacterial culture or PCR, viral PCR test in body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pleural puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body sonography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body X-rays and tomography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pet Ct&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temporal artery biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ….&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description statistics will be used such as means, medians, standard deviation and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality All data will be collected by the investigators. The data will be collected&#xD;
      in a way that patient names will not appear in the database (Redcap) and that individual&#xD;
      patients will not be recognized by the examination of the collected data. Each patients will&#xD;
      receive a code to preserve the anonymization. This code is a nummer that will be record on a&#xD;
      listing of patients participating to the study in KWS. The listing in KWS is recorded in the&#xD;
      worklisting CGER and is named FUO. Each investigator will be responsible of the anonymization&#xD;
      of his/her recruiting. The database will only be accessible by the investigators and&#xD;
      protected in Redcap by a password. The database (Excel) will be saved on UZBrussel server&#xD;
      (CGER) in a folder named FUO.&#xD;
