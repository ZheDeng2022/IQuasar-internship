      To evaluate the clinical performance of the restorations by applying the universal adhesive&#xD;
      in different modes under the influence of different surface treatments, with Erbium&#xD;
      Chromium:Yttrium-Scandium-Gallium-Garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser and acid etching in non-carious&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-one patients (at least five non-carious cervical lesions) have participated in this&#xD;
      study. The non-carious cervical lesions in each patient were divided into five groups&#xD;
      (total-etch mode with phosphoric acid, selective-etch mode with phosphoric acid, total-etch&#xD;
      mode with laser, selective-etch mode with laser and self-etch mode) according to different&#xD;
      modes and application methods of universal adhesive (Clearfil Universal Bond Quick, Kuraray).&#xD;
      Lesions were restored with a resin composite, Clearfil Majesty ES-2 (Kuraray). All&#xD;
      restorative procedures were performed by a single operator. Restorations were evaluated at&#xD;
      one week (baseline), at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month according to modified USPHS criteria&#xD;
      (retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, color match, postoperative&#xD;
      sensitivity, and secondary caries) by two experienced and calibrated investigators.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study was carried out to investigate different etching methods used for application modes of universal adhesive on clinical performance of non-carious cervical lesions. The 35% phosphoric acid (K-ETCHANT) or Er,Cr:YSGG laser (2780 nm, Waterlase MD, BioLase Technology, Inc.) etching was applied to the tooth before these application modes in order to bond the universal adhesive, Clearfil Universal Bond Quick. Accordingly, the restorations were completed with 5 different application methods to five different teeth. The allocation of etching method and application mode on each tooth was determined in an order that was assigned by Biostatistics Department. This randomization was blinded to participants and evaluators. It was not known which etching method and application mode was applied to which teeth of the participants.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention,</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 year the change of restorations was evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>The retention criterion determines how long a restorative material functions in the oral environment, it is the most important criterion that shows the success of the material.&#xD;
Alpha: The restoration is present. Charlie: The restoration is absent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Marginal Discoloration</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 year the change of restorations was evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>The marginal discoloration that occur at the edge staining restoration boundaries are generally thought to be due to microleakage.&#xD;
Alpha: No discoloration at margins. Bravo: Shallow discoloration, clinically acceptable. Charlie: Deep discoloration clinically unacceptable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Marginal Adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 year the change of restorations was evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal adaptation is achieved by fully ensuring the integrity of the tooth-restoration joint border.&#xD;
Alpha: Restoration is closely adapted to the tooth. Bravo: Visible evidence of a crevice along the margin, dentin not exposed, clinically acceptable.&#xD;
Charlie: Explorer penetrates into crevice, dentin is exposed; clinically unacceptable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Color match</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 year the change of restorations was evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Color match is the evaluation of the restoration according to the darkening or lightening of the color, taking into account the tooth tissue surrounding restoration.&#xD;
Alpha:Matches tooth. Bravo: Acceptable mismatch. Charlie:Unacceptable mismatch.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-op Hypersensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 year the change of restorations was evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of sensitivity after restorations are placed. Alpha: Absent. Charlie: Present; clinically unacceptable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Caries</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 year the change of restorations was evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary caries is the progression of caries in the tooth tissue adjacent to the restorations. Caries formation means restoration failure.&#xD;
Alpha: Absent. Charlie: Present; clinically unacceptable.</description>
