      INTRODUCTION: Core strengthening, balance, and flexibility programs such as Pilates have been&#xD;
      advocated to affect running mechanics and prevent lower extremity injuries positively. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 12-week mat-based Pilates exercise&#xD;
      program on dynamic knee valgus alignment in runners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Thirty-four young male and female adults performed a running protocol at baseline.&#xD;
      The protocol consisted of the participants running on a treadmill at a constant five miles&#xD;
      per hour (mph) for four minutes. Post-examination, participants were randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      Pilates or control group (n=16 and n=18, respectively). A certified Pilates instructor gave&#xD;
      the Pilates group a 12-week home-based program. To ensure participants in the Pilates group&#xD;
      performed exercises correctly, the Pilates instructor conducted the first session, and&#xD;
      provided feedback to each participant. Participants in both groups performed the same running&#xD;
      testing protocol every four weeks. Knee valgus was measured as the medial displacement of the&#xD;
      knee joint center during the running stance phase. Repeated measures Analysis of Variance&#xD;
      (RepANOVA) was calculated at baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks post examinations to compare&#xD;
      knee valgus during running.&#xD;

      Study Design and Participants A 12-week randomized controlled trial using a mat-based Pilates&#xD;
      core-strengthening exercise program was conducted involving thirty-four young, healthy&#xD;
      adults. Twenty men (mean ± SD; height: 171.77 ± 9.42 cm; weight: 72.59 ± 8.99 kg; BMI: 24.99&#xD;
      ± 2.10 kg/m2) and fourteen women (mean ± SD; height: 158.46 ± 2.96 cm; weight: 53.70 ± 2.45&#xD;
      kg; BMI: 21.81 ± 1.37 kg/m2) completed this study. All participants were over 18 and signed a&#xD;
      written informed consent document approved by the Institutional Review Board. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria included no history of injury in the preceding six months, no history of lower&#xD;
      extremity surgeries, and a generally healthy state. Before involvement in the main trials,&#xD;
      each participant's height, body mass, leg length, pelvis, knee, and ankle width were measured&#xD;
      according to the motion analysis software computerized model (Vicon Plugin Gait Model, Vicon&#xD;
      Motion Inc., Denver, CO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Participants reported to the laboratory having refrained from strenuous exercise&#xD;
      during the preceding 48 hours. A running protocol was conducted four times during this study:&#xD;
      at baseline, and at the fourth, eighth, and twelfth weeks. Participants underwent a&#xD;
      standardized warm-up session running at four miles per hour (mph) on a treadmill for five&#xD;
      minutes before progressively increasing the intensity to five mph without any inclination for&#xD;
      another four minutes. To measure dynamic knee valgus during each session, a 3-dimensional&#xD;
      high-speed (240 Hz) system (Vicon Motion Inc., Denver, CO) was used during the running&#xD;
      protocol, emphasizing the running cycle's stance phase to measure medial knee displacement.&#xD;
      For each participant, 3D kinematics were recorded for the dominant leg throughout the stance&#xD;
      phase during the running protocol execution. The dominant leg was defined as the preferred&#xD;
      leg to perform a single leg jump. Medial knee displacement was defined as the medial&#xD;
      trajectory difference traveled by the knee joint center from initial contact to push-off,&#xD;
      identified by two footswitches (500Hz; Delsys, Inc, Boston, MA) placed on the plantar aspect&#xD;
      of the calcaneus and hallux. Three-dimensional data and pressure from the footswitches were&#xD;
      real-timed synchronized in the motion analysis software (Vicon Nexus software, Vicon Motion&#xD;
      Inc., Denver, CO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once baseline measurements were recorded, the participants were randomly assigned to either a&#xD;
      home-based Pilates intervention or a control group. The Pilates intervention consisted of a&#xD;
      warm-up, seven strengthening exercises, and a cool-down. The frequency of the program was&#xD;
      three times a week, performing each exercise once for 15 repetitions. Participants in the&#xD;
      Pilates group performed their first session with a certified Pilates instructor to ensure&#xD;
      appropriate technique was performed. The control group was encouraged to continue their daily&#xD;
      routine and not engage in additional physical activity or exercise. At the fourth and eighth&#xD;
      weeks, the Pilates program's difficulty level increased by progressing to more challenging&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis T-tests were performed at baseline for anthropometrics and valgus variables to&#xD;
      ensure both groups were homogenous. A 2 x 4 (group x time) repeated measures ANOVA (RepANOVA)&#xD;
      was used to evaluate dynamic knee valgus changes. Group by time interaction and within and&#xD;
      between main effects were separately assessed regardless of the interaction being significant&#xD;
      based on recommendations by Wei et al. 2012 (Wei et al., 2012). Given the pilot nature of&#xD;
      this investigation, an alpha level of p ≥ 0.05 was considered statistically significant for&#xD;
      all analyses. SPSS version 26 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, New York) was used for statistical analyses.&#xD;
