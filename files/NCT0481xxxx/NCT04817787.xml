      Arterial disease is the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in Metabolic syndrome (MetS).&#xD;
      This occurs early as evidenced by arterial dysfunction that, in turn, raises blood pressure&#xD;
      and glucose. Health organizations recommend exercise in an intensity based manner to promote&#xD;
      cardiovascular adaptation and prevent disease. Metformin is a common anti-diabetes medication&#xD;
      that reduces future type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk. However, the optimal exercise&#xD;
      dose to be combined with metformin for additive effects on vascular function is unknown.&#xD;
      Based on the investigator's preliminary work, the overall hypothesis is that metformin blunts&#xD;
      adaptation following high intensity exercise training (HiEx) by lowering mitochondrial&#xD;
      derived oxidative stress signaling. The investigators further hypothesize that low intensity&#xD;
      exercise (LoEx) training combined with metformin will promote additive effects on vascular&#xD;
      function compared to LoEx or HiEx+metformin, and maintain/improve non-exercise physical&#xD;
      activity patterns. In this double-blind trial, obese 30-60y MetS participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to: 1) LoEx+placebo; 2) LoEx+metformin, 3) HiEx+placebo; or 4) HiEx+metformin for&#xD;
      16 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether combining different intensities of exercise&#xD;
      (specifically low and high-intensity) with the drug metformin has the potential to outperform&#xD;
      either exercise intensity alone and improve blood flow in individuals with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Metformin is a commonly used drug to help manage blood sugar. This study is being&#xD;
      done because of the high prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in the&#xD;
      United States. Metabolic syndrome refers to a group of risk factors that raises an&#xD;
      individual's risk for heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems.&#xD;
      These risk factors include a large waistline, high levels of fat in the blood, high blood&#xD;
      pressure and high fasting blood sugars. By adding manageable amounts of physical activity and&#xD;
      taking the drug metformin, it is conceivable that individuals could greatly reduce their risk&#xD;
      of developing type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the objective of the&#xD;
      investigator's research is to understand how metformin effects both vascular (related to&#xD;
      blood flow) and metabolic (related to the body's normal biochemical processes)insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in adults with metabolic syndrome and the role of training intensity on these&#xD;
      factors. The term insulin sensitivity refers to how the body's cells react to glucose, also&#xD;
      known as blood sugar. In individuals that are insulin sensitive, their cells are better able&#xD;
      to process the glucose to use for energy and other metabolic processes. In individuals that&#xD;
      are insulin resistant, or who have a lower sensitivity, their cells are not able to&#xD;
      efficiently use the available blood glucose, which results in higher blood glucose levels&#xD;
      that can lead to negative health outcomes, including the development of type 2 diabetes. The&#xD;
      overarching hypothesis is that metformin may blunt the adaptation following high intensity&#xD;
      exercise by lowering the amount of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance&#xD;
      of the body's reactive oxygen species and the body's ability to detoxify these chemical&#xD;
      molecules to reduce inflammation and damage. Thus, compared with high intensity exercise plus&#xD;
      metformin, low intensity exercise plus metformin will produce greater vascular and metabolic&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity changes following 16 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators anticipate that high intensity exercise based training alone&#xD;
      will produce greater effects than low intensity exercise. Lastly, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that these changes in metabolic and insulin sensitivity will correlate with&#xD;
      glycemic control (the ability to control blood sugar) and blood pressure changes.&#xD;
