  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects an estimated 350 million people worldwide and is a&#xD;
      leading contributor to global disease burden. Commonly used monoamine reuptake-inhibiting&#xD;
      treatments for depression are suboptimal, resulting in only 30% of patients achieving&#xD;
      remission. This may be because monoamine dysfunction is not the primary pathophysiology in&#xD;
      all MDD patients. One avenue for the development of novel MDD treatments is through&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs; MDD is linked to a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by&#xD;
      microglial activation, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulation&#xD;
      of cellular markers including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and translocator protein (TSPO; a&#xD;
      protein located on the outer membrane of microglia). Relevant to this proposal, TSPO can&#xD;
      serve as an in vivo marker of neuroinflammation using the newly developed positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) tracer for TSPO, [18F]FEPPA. In support of this, a recent [18F]FEPPA PET&#xD;
      study found that MDD patients in a current major depressive episode (MDE) had significantly&#xD;
      higher TSPO binding in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and&#xD;
      insula, relative to healthy controls. The prefrontal cortex and ACC are both implicated in&#xD;
      mood regulation whereas the insula is involved in interoceptive signaling, which is known to&#xD;
      be abnormal in MDD. Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),&#xD;
      is a promising new treatment for neuroinflammation in MDD. Clinical studies have observed&#xD;
      that, in a subset of depressed patients, celecoxib treatment reduced depression severity as&#xD;
      assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). While these findings demonstrate&#xD;
      that celecoxib reduces symptom severity, PET imaging technology is critical for understanding&#xD;
      how celecoxib affects the underlying pathophysiology of depression. Here, the team will&#xD;
      investigate neuroinflammation as an underlying pathology in depression and test whether&#xD;
      neuroinflammation is reduced by celecoxib in MDD patients. Specifically, in the proposed&#xD;
      pilot study, MDD patients in a current MDE will receive [18F]FEPPA PET scans prior to and&#xD;
      following 8 weeks of treatment with 800mg/day of celecoxib, with HDRS scores obtained at each&#xD;
      time point. The investigators hypothesize that following celecoxib treatment, patients will&#xD;
      show a significant reduction in neuroinflammation in the PFC, ACC and insula, which will&#xD;
      correlate positively with the reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by the HDRS. The&#xD;
      proposed study will use novel imaging technology, [18F]FEPPA PET, to measure the effects of&#xD;
      celecoxib on neuroinflammation in MDD patients. Our results will help to 1) identify&#xD;
      neuroinflammation as an underlying pathology in MDD and 2) test whether reduction of&#xD;
      inflammation is the mechanism of action of celecoxib. As such, the results of this study will&#xD;
      aid in the development of targeted clinical treatments to improve remission rates in MDD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
