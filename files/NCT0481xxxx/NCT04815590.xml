    <measure>Proportion of treatment-engaged visits per participant</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of opioid free weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Suppression of illicit opioid use will be measured as the percentage of opioid-free weeks during the active treatment period (Visit 2 to Visit 8), using a combination of Urine Drug Test (UDT) results and self-reported illicit opioid use.</description>

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used for all safety analysis variables. No formal inferential tests will be performed on safety data.&#xD;
The incidence of all AEs will be summarized by body system, severity, seriousness, and relationship to the study drug using MedDRA. SAEs will be tabulated by patient.&#xD;
Descriptive statistics will be reported for injection site grading. Descriptive summaries will be provided for vital signs based on the change from baseline.</description>
