  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal insufficiency is common in participants with blood cancers. The main objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate adverse events and movement of oral venetoclax tablets through the body&#xD;
      of female participants with severe normal renal function and those with end stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of various&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. Study doctors put the participants in 1 of 2 groups, called&#xD;
      treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. Approximately 12 female&#xD;
      participants between 18 and 75 years, with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 to 42 kg/m2 will&#xD;
      be enrolled in approximately 4 sites across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with normal renal function will receive single dose of oral venetoclax tablet.&#xD;
      Participants with ESRD will receive oral venetoclax tablets just prior to hemodialysis&#xD;
      (Period 1 Day 1) and between dialysis days (Period 2 Day 1), doses in the two periods will be&#xD;
      separated by at least 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, checking for side effects.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.</description>
