  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will consist of a clinical series of up to 50 children with Global Developmental&#xD;
      Delay and concomitant microcephaly or hyperkinetic movements. All children will be assessed&#xD;
      for psychomotor function using standardized assessments, goal specific assessments, with the&#xD;
      potential addition of neuroimaging assessment, prior to and after receiving an intensive&#xD;
      burst of neuromotor therapy. The interventional effects will be explored by comparing the pre&#xD;
      and post interventional assessments and neuroimaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50 children between the ages of 6 months and 15 years will be recruited to participate&#xD;
      in a burst of intensive neuromotor intervention in the form of Acquire therapy, delivered by&#xD;
      the treatment team at Virginia Tech's Neuromotor Research Clinic. All children will have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Global Developmental Delay, with concomitant microcephaly or hyperkinetic&#xD;
      movements. The children will be assessed for psychomotor function prior to and after the&#xD;
      treatment intervention, using a series of standardized and goal specific assessments, with&#xD;
      the possibility of additional neuroimaging assessments when possible. Acquire therapy is an&#xD;
      intensive intervention in that it is delivered with high intensity, wherein goal directed&#xD;
      behaviors are promoted at high levels of repetition and delivered at a high dose (4-6 hours a&#xD;
      day) in an intensive burst of 3-4 weeks of 5 day a week treatment. Acquire therapy is an&#xD;
      operant conditioning based intervention delivered in a cycle of refinement, reinforcement and&#xD;
      repetition. It is play-based with activities selected to drive behavior toward goals that are&#xD;
      specific to each child and selected based on each child's interests and needs. As such a&#xD;
      specific protocol cannot be outlined. However, all goal directed activities are designed to&#xD;
      promote awareness of and engagement with others and the environment.&#xD;

The higher the percent change the more the child changed on that particular goal.</description>
