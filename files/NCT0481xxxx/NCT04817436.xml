  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical hyperactivity is often associated to anorexia nervosa (AN). Data suggest common&#xD;
      central pathways between hyperactivity and anorexia. Maintaining adapted physical activity&#xD;
      (APA) during refeeding in AN is controversial. Many studies suggest beneficits of APA in AN&#xD;
      on body composition (increase fat free mass and better distribution of fat mass), mood&#xD;
      regulation, bone metabolism. We recently reported benefits of maintaining physical activity&#xD;
      during refeeding in a mice model of anorexia (activity-based anorexia model). These benefits&#xD;
      involved the tryptophan-kynurenin pathway. Thus, we aim in the APANOR study to assess effects&#xD;
      of APA during refeeding in AN on kynurenin metabolism.&#xD;
