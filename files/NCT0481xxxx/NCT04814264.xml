  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion is common for patients in hospital, especially for those in intensive care.&#xD;
      Patients receive blood that is matched to them based on their blood group (A, B, AB, O), but&#xD;
      not based on sex. This means male or female patients may receive male or female blood. There&#xD;
      is some evidence to suggest that giving male patients female blood and female patients male&#xD;
      blood (sex-mismatched blood) may be harmful. The investigators think giving males only male&#xD;
      blood and females only female blood (sex-matched blood) will be better for the patients and&#xD;
      improve their survival. To test this, the study team will randomly give 50% of intensive care&#xD;
      patients who require blood only sex-mismatched blood and 50% of intensive care patients only&#xD;
      sex-matched blood for their entire hospital stay. Then, health data of patients will be&#xD;
      collected to see if either group does better after transfusion. Before this is done as a&#xD;
      large study with thousands of patients, it will be attempted as a smaller pilot study with a&#xD;
      few hundred patients to be sure the processes suggested make sense and are possible for&#xD;
      hospitals and for the blood supplier to follow.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion is one of the most common procedures performed during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Approximately 85 million red blood cell (RBC) units are transfused globally each year. RBC&#xD;
      units are matched for blood groups but matching for other donor characteristics such as sex,&#xD;
      is not considered. By the current standard of care, female or male patients can receive RBCs&#xD;
      from male or female donors. However, accumulating data suggests that sex-mismatched&#xD;
      transfusions may be harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sex-mismatched transfusions and transplantations have been associated with poor outcomes.&#xD;
      Plasma from female donors is associated with an increased risk of transfusion related acute&#xD;
      lung injury (TRALI); sex-mismatched heart transplantation is associated with increased&#xD;
      transplant-associated mortality; and stem cell transplants from female donors are associated&#xD;
      with worse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia is common during critical illness and 20-40% of critically ill patients require a mean&#xD;
      of two to five RBC units during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Once a patient&#xD;
      receives more than six RBC units, virtually all patients (&gt;97%) will have received at least&#xD;
      one sex-mismatched RBC. The population of transfused ICU adult patients is already at high&#xD;
      risk of death, with a demonstrated 90-day all-cause mortality of 35-37% based on the ABLE&#xD;
      study, and in-hospital mortality of 24-34% (institutional data). Thus, new supportive care&#xD;
      strategies are needed to improve outcomes of this highly vulnerable patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion data linked to donor sex spanning a 6-year period was previously analyzed. Using&#xD;
      a careful analysis that controlled for covariates and stratified on time-dependent and fixed&#xD;
      variables, 25,219 transfusion recipients were retrospectively analyzed and a significant&#xD;
      association between male to female RBC transfusions and death [hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.69] was found. A trend towards higher mortality was also&#xD;
      noted with female to male RBCs (HR 1.13: 95% CI 0.92-1.39), and with sex-mismatched vs.&#xD;
      sex-matched RBCs overall (HR 1.23: 95% CI 1.04-1.45). These findings suggest that matching&#xD;
      RBC transfusions for sex can reduce mortality in ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that donor-recipient sex-matched RBC transfusions are&#xD;
      associated with improved survival in hospital compared to sex-mismatched RBC transfusions.&#xD;
      Sex-matched RBC transfusions may represent an important, readily implementable advance in&#xD;
      supportive care of critically ill patients.&#xD;
