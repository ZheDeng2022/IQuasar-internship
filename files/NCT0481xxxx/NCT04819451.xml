  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the common fatal types of cerebral apoplexy with&#xD;
      high mortality and disability rates. Hematoma volume and complications of intracerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage are major predictors of early death and poor prognosis. The hematoma and its&#xD;
      metabolites are key therapeutic targets. At present, in order to improve the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients, cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) replacement with normal saline(NS) is commonly used in&#xD;
      clinical practice to clear the bloody components, which shows a good clinical effect.&#xD;
      However, due to the large difference between NS and CSF composition, it is easy to cause&#xD;
      secondary injury of brain tissue. Therefore, the replacement of artificial CSF with similar&#xD;
      CSF composition will be more effective in reducing the incidence of complications and improve&#xD;
      the prognosis of neurological function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Magnesium-rich Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid(MACSF) designed and developed in the early&#xD;
      stage of this project which has similar physical and chemical properties to physiological&#xD;
      CSF, such as ion species, concentration, potential of hydrogen (pH) value and osmotic&#xD;
      pressure. Animal experiments has confirmed its safety and effectiveness. In this study,&#xD;
      patients with basal ganglia intracerebral hemorrhage ruptured into the ventricle or&#xD;
      nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were stratified randomly divided into MACSF group and&#xD;
      NS group. MACSF and NS were used as replacement fluid for lumbar puncture CSF replacement,&#xD;
      respectively. By observing and compare two groups of patients of the Modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
      (mRS) in the day of 14, 30, 60, 90 days after onset; hematoma absorption rate, hemorrhagic&#xD;
      CSF removal rate; changes of cerebral autoregulation； incidence of complications, such as&#xD;
      acute obstructive hydrocephalus (AOH) and cerebral vasospasm (CVS); the changes of scores and&#xD;
      scales about imaging; assessment of neurological function recovery, such as the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) during&#xD;
      hospitalization, headache duration and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), vomiting duration,&#xD;
      duration of meningeal irritant, ICU hospitalization duration, total hospitalization duration;&#xD;
      change of CSF and peripheral blood biochemical indicators. Objective to evaluate MACSF&#xD;
      replacement therapy in patients with basal ganglia cerebral hemorrhage broken into ventricles&#xD;
      and nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage of the influence of absorption rate and prognosis.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, interventional and double-blind randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. After approval of the clinical registry, patients who meet the standards of inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be recruited to this study, if they and their relatives are&#xD;
      willing to join in the study. According to the clinical manifestations of the patients at&#xD;
      admission and the results of cranial imaging, the patients' conditions were evaluated using&#xD;
      the modified Fisher score, the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Scale (WFNSS), the&#xD;
      max-ICH score (max-ICH), the IVH score (IVHs), the Hijdra Sum Score (Hijdra), the Modified&#xD;
      Graeb Score (mGS) and other grading criteria. Two groups (NS group and MACSF group) were&#xD;
      divided into groups using a completely stratified randomization method. This study was a&#xD;
      double-blind clinical study, and the grouping protocol was managed by the project research&#xD;
      assistant. After the subject or his/her family members sign the informed consent, the project&#xD;
      research assistant completed the grouping according to the randomly assigned sequence given&#xD;
      by the clinical research center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'anJiaotong University.&#xD;
      The project research assistant records the group and informs the specialist of the type of&#xD;
      replacement fluid required. The replacement fluid was sent into the ward in a special&#xD;
      container, and then lumbar puncture and CSF replacement were performed by the operator. The&#xD;
      replacement liquid used in both groups was identical in appearance, color, temperature, and&#xD;
      smell. During the whole study, the investigator did not participate in the preparation of the&#xD;
      replacement liquid, and the subjects and their family members were also unaware of the&#xD;
      grouping. After the case collection and electronic database records are completed, the&#xD;
      research assistant will inform the researcher of the group name under the supervision of the&#xD;
      third party to complete the unblinding, and the researcher shall inform the subjects of the&#xD;
      group name in written form. For the control group, patients were treated the normal saline&#xD;
      (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection) as the replacement fluid. For the intervention group, MACSF&#xD;
      will be used. The composition and concentration of MACSF is as follows:Na+: 146.2 mEq/L, K+:&#xD;
      2.7 mEq/L, Mg2+: 4.2 mEq/L, Cl-: 123 mEq/L, HCO3-:23.2 mEq/L, Glucose: 0.75 g/L. MACSF is&#xD;
      prepared by the staff of Pharmacy Intravenous Admixture Services of First Affiliated Hospital&#xD;
      of Xi'an Jiaotong University, according to a specific formula in the specific working area.&#xD;
      The whole procedure follow the aseptic principles strictly. Fresh-made MACSF will be placed&#xD;
      in a specific container and send to the the patient ward through specific channels.&#xD;
      Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured by non-invasive ICP test before lumbar puncture. If&#xD;
      it is higher than 350cmH2O, a lumbar puncture can be performed 30 minutes after intravenous&#xD;
      drip of 100ml 20% mannitol. Then, for the patients who signed the informed consent, a CSF&#xD;
      sample (3ml) was taken before each lumbar puncture CSF replacement and synchronous blood&#xD;
      samples (6ml) was taken. The blood samples should be drawn into a non-anticoagulant tube and&#xD;
      a heparin anticoagulant tube respectively. All the samples will be transferred to BioBank of&#xD;
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'anJiaotong University in a liquid nitrogen tank. After&#xD;
      re-melted in a water bath of 37°, the blood samples will be centrifuged at 4° for 15min at&#xD;
      3000r/min, the CSF samples will be centrifuged at 4° for 10min at 1000r/min and then the&#xD;
      supernatant will be collected and stored at -80°. At the end of this study, the contents of&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb), S100 calcium-binding protein β (S100β), neuron-specific enolase(NSE),&#xD;
      D-dimer (DD), matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), Mg2+, Ca2+ in the samples will be detected&#xD;
      by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or mass spectrometry. The total amount of&#xD;
      replacement was generally 30ml, and the replacement was performed once every 2 days. When the&#xD;
      red cell (RBC) count in CSF is less than 100×10^6/L, the CSF is considered to be cleared. CSF&#xD;
      replacement is performed up to four times. NIHSS and GCS scores were evaluated daily after&#xD;
      admission. Cerebral computerized tomography (CT) was performed at least every week after&#xD;
      admission. If there is new low-density lesions, delayed cerebral infarction (DCI) will be&#xD;
      diagnosed. Transcranial Doppler(TCD) examination was performed the first three days after&#xD;
      admission and after each replacement. Cerebral autoregulation (CA) was evaluated by transient&#xD;
      hyperemic response test (THRT), a transcranial Doppler (TCD)-based CA evaluation method,&#xD;
      which describes the changes in cerebral blood fow velocity after a brief compression of the&#xD;
      ipsilateral common carotid artery. The specific content is described later. CVS will be&#xD;
      diagnosed by TCD, the diagnostic criteria will be described later. All subjects were followed&#xD;
      up in the day of 14, 30, 60, 90 days after onset and the mRS was evaluated. Meanwhile, some&#xD;
      indicators will be used to evaluate the safety of MACSF application, which including&#xD;
      secondary infection, fluctuation of intracranial pressure and hypermagnesemia. For patients&#xD;
      or their family members who do not agree to do the CSF replacement, the sample collection can&#xD;
      be used as a supplementary analysis for this study after they sign the informed consent for&#xD;
      sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic criteria and the solutions will be described in the next part.&#xD;
