  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the treatment of subjects with type 1 diabetes with M1 Pram P037 as&#xD;
      co-formulation of pramlintide and A21G human insulin analogue product will be compared with a&#xD;
      current standard treatment, insulin lispro. During a four months treatment period doses in&#xD;
      both treatment arms may be adjusted and optimised under outpatient conditions to allow a&#xD;
      meaningful comparison of both treatments with respect to their effects on body weight,&#xD;
      achievable glycaemic control, safety and tolerability, treatment satisfaction and well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a run in period in case of basal insulin switch or Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)&#xD;
      initiation, eligible subjects will enter a 3 weeks baseline recording period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomized to either M1 Pram P037 treatment or active comparator&#xD;
      treatment (insulin lispro). Both investigator and enrolled subjects will be unblinded to&#xD;
      treatment. Study participants will use CGM until follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period will last 16 weeks. Throughout the 4-month treatment period, basal insulin&#xD;
      and investigational products administration will be individually adjusted. Treatment&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire and WHO-5 well-being index will be completed by subjects at day 0&#xD;
      and after 2 months (Visit 9) and 4 months (Visit 11) of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety follow-up visit, 7 to 14 days after the last administration of IMP, will mark the&#xD;
      end of the clinical trial for the subjects.&#xD;
