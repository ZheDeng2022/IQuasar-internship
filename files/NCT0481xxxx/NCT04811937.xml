  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality components of colonoscopy include the detection and complete removal of colorectal&#xD;
      polyps, which are precursors to CRC. However, endoscopic ablation may be incomplete, posing a&#xD;
      risk for the development of &quot;interval cancers&quot;. The investigator propose to develop a&#xD;
      solution based on artificial intelligence (AI) (CADp computer-aided decision support&#xD;
      polypectomy) to solve this problem.This research project aims to develop CADp, a computer&#xD;
      decision support solution (CDS) for the ablation of colorectal polyps from 1 to 20 mm.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>accuracy with which the CADp system predicts completeness of polypectomy in the test set with the reference standard for completeness being determined by the histology of post-polypectomy margin biopsies; if free from any polyp tissue (adenomatous, serrated or hyperplastic), the resection will be considered complete. If remnant polyp tissue is detected in any one or more of the margin biopsies the resection is deemed incomplete</description>

    <measure>Completeness of polypectomy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate the agreement between the different subjective and objective ways of assessing the completeness of the polypectomy : evaluation of margins (presence or not, measurement of margins) by endoscopists self-assessment, and by expert consensus.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the concordance of data on polyp size, extension of margins around the polyp, quality of resection between clinical data (endoscopists' self-assessment and experts' assessments) and CADp prediction.</description>

    <description>Based on the results and comparison of the different assessment methods, we will perform sensitivity analyses to assess the validity and robustness of the choice of primary outcome.</description>

    <description>A standard colonoscopy will be performed according to the standard of routine care. All optically diagnosed polyps will be removed and sent to the CHUM pathology laboratory for histopathological evaluation according to institutional standards. The AI system will capture video of the procedure in real time, and provide additional information about polypectomy procedures.</description>

    <intervention_name>Computer-aided polypectomy decision support by Artificial Intelligence</intervention_name>
    <description>The AI system will capture the live video of the procedure and the AI feedbackwill be shown on a second screen installed next to the regular endoscopy screen. Screen A will show the regular endoscopy image and screen B will show the regular endoscopy image together with the areas that might harbor a polyp and the information to help the polypectomy.</description>
