  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal iron deficiency anemia is associated with maternal and infant mortality, spontaneous&#xD;
      preterm birth, maternal postpartum hemorrhage, and neurocognitive defects in the neonate.&#xD;
      Therefore, preventing maternal iron deficiency anemia in at-risk women is critical. Obese&#xD;
      pregnant women have greater systemic inflammation and circulating hepcidin levels compared to&#xD;
      nonobese pregnant women. This phenotype implies obese pregnant women have decreased iron&#xD;
      bioavailability and may be less responsive to oral iron supplementation because hepcidin is a&#xD;
      negative regulator of dietary iron absorption, suggesting alternative interventions are&#xD;
      needed to optimize their iron status in pregnancy. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      consuming the oral bovine lactoferrin (bLf) can enhance dietary iron absorption by promoting&#xD;
      an anti-inflammatory immune response and hepcidin suppression, indicating this intervention&#xD;
      may be beneficial to pregnant obese women at risk for iron deficiency anemia. The primary&#xD;
      goal of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of this low-cost, safe,&#xD;
      innovative approach to optimizing maternal iron status in obese women at risk of iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia (Hb 11.0 - 12.0 g/dL (first trimester)/10.5 - 11.5 g/dL (second trimester)&#xD;
      for non-Black women and 10.2 - 11.2 g/dL (first trimester)/9.7 -- 10.7 g/dL (second&#xD;
      trimester) for Black women) from 15-20 weeks of gestation (WG) until the time of labor. The&#xD;
      investigators will explore effects on maternal and neonatal iron status and Hb and changes to&#xD;
      maternal systemic inflammation and circulating hepcidin. This study is an essential first&#xD;
      step toward evaluating if daily oral bLf is an efficacious, safe, inexpensive, and scalable&#xD;
      clinical strategy for the prevention of maternal iron deficiency anemia and its related&#xD;
      complications in at-risk women.&#xD;

    <measure>Understand feasibility via recruitment and retention rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Recruitment duration- approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will collect detailed records of the number of women eligible and then referred by Center for Women's Health clinical staff to the research team. We will also track the number of referred women approached (by phone &amp; in person) by our research team for enrollment and the number of women who decline and their reasons for non-enrollment. Once a woman is enrolled in the study, attendance at study visits, completeness of data, and overall and treatment specific loss to follow-up/withdrawal will be closely monitored. Women who voluntarily withdraw will be asked to provide reasons for revoking their enrollment. Rates of enrollment and retainment are key feasibility outcomes. To facilitate recruitment and retention, transportation and participation monetary incentives will be provided. Data will be evaluated to determine feasibility of this kind of reasearch</description>

    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>For both study arms, the Pillsy smart bottle, phone app, and researcher interface configured, tested and finalized in Aim 1 will be used to optimize adherence. The smart bottle will send reminders (i.e., the pill bottle rings and lights up) at a time selected by the participant congruent with their intervention arm assignment (e.g., at bedtime). Use of the Pillsy app will allow for &quot;real-time&quot; tracking of the participant's adherence through the HIPAA-compliant researcher interface. If a participant is non-adherent for two consecutive days additional alerts (e.g., text messages) will be triggered through the research interface two-way communication feature, and study staff will make contact (i.e., telephone/text/email). Hand pill counts will also be performed by UIC Investigational Drug Service. Smart bottles will generate individual reports detailing how many pills were taken and when. A report detailing dates and times of pills being taken will be used to measure adherence</description>

    <description>Once daily Oral Lf (250mg). Women assigned to this group will be instructed to consume an oral Lf capsule one hour prior to their afternoon meal and two prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement gummies without iron with omega-3 fatty acids before bed from early second trimester (15 - 20 WG) up through delivery. Women are advised to consume the Lf prior to meals, given our team member Valenti's unpublished work shows its superior efficacy for improving iron and hematological parameters among pregnant women with hereditary thrombophilia versus when consumed with meals. The prenatal vitamin/mineral gummies will be a commercially available product (One-a-Day Women's Prenatal Gummies with omega-3 fatty acids, Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ). Women in both groups will be advised to consume an iron-rich diet and provided a handout detailing foods rich in heme and non-heme iron.</description>

    <description>Women assigned to this group will be instructed to consume a commercially available prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement with iron and omega-3 fatty acids (Prenatal 1, Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ) before bed from early second trimester (15-20 WG) through delivery. To minimize variability in prenatal vitamin/supplement use across the participants, we have opted to standardize the prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement by providing women in the usual care arm a supplement that is nutritionally like what is prescribed by the Center for Women's Health providers. Women will be advised to consume an iron-rich diet and provided a handout describing foods rich in heme and non-heme iron.</description>
