  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves the 'first-in-human' evaluation of a novel optical sensor which uses&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology to assess oxygenation and hemodynamics of the&#xD;
      injured spinal cord. The NIRS sensor is laid on top of the dura, at the site of the SCI, and&#xD;
      emits near-infrared light signals into the cord to measure tissue oxygenation and tissue&#xD;
      hemodynamics in real-time. Our testing of this novel NIRS sensor in patients with acute SCI&#xD;
      represents the first step in translating this technology for human use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective observational study will enroll 10 patients admitted to&#xD;
      Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) for treatment of an acute traumatic spine injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising preclinical data demonstrates that the oxygenation and hemodynamic measures of our&#xD;
      Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) system closely match the invasive intraparenchymal&#xD;
      measures obtained within the injured spinal cord. Further, the NIRS sensor is responsive and&#xD;
      reflective of systemic hemodynamic changes. This clinical protocol represents the first&#xD;
      application of this novel NIRS sensor in human SCI. Following operative decompression of the&#xD;
      spinal cord via a posterior approach, the NIRS sensor will be placed over the dura for 7 days&#xD;
      to monitor spinal cord oxygenation and tissue hemodynamics. Patients will be followed for 6&#xD;
      months and data collection for safety, feasibly and efficacy of the NIRS System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of our NIRS system in monitoring tissue&#xD;
           oxygenation and hemodynamics of the injured spinal cord in human participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete the technical refinement of the NIRS system utilizing an iterative process&#xD;
           guided by participant recruitment and data accrual during the trial.&#xD;
