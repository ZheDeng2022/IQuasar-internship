  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cluster headache (CCH) is a rare primary headache disorder, defined by episodic&#xD;
      attacks that occur for more than one year with no remission period or with remission periods&#xD;
      lasting &lt; 3 months (ICHD-3 criteria). In certain cases, CCH patients become drug-resistant&#xD;
      and continue to suffer almost daily attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine appears to be effective in a variety of chronic pain conditions, such as refractory&#xD;
      headache, and can show an enhanced analgesic effect when combined with magnesium. A single&#xD;
      infusion of ketamine-magnesium combination has been described to reduce attacks in 17&#xD;
      patients with rCCH. The main outcome was a comparison of the number of daily attacks two&#xD;
      weeks prior to the infusion and one week after (days 7-8). The number of daily attacks&#xD;
      decreased from 4.3±2.4 before treatment to 1.3±1.0 after treatment (p&lt;0.001). 13/17 had at&#xD;
      least 50% response. Thus, the goal of this placebo-controlled study is to try to confirm&#xD;
      these findings.&#xD;
