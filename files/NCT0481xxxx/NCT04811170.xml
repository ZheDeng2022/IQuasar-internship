  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 120 ethnic minorities in Hong Kong from the Zubin Foundation (TZF) at&#xD;
      the Ethnic Minority Well-being Centre (EMWBC), which is a service provider of EM mental&#xD;
      health support in Hong Kong. This service provides counselling service and referrals to HA&#xD;
      via the Integrated Community Centre for Mental Wellness (ICCMW) to psychiatrists. The service&#xD;
      covers the South Asians population of approximately eighty-four thousands people in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. Participants will be recruited by the Zubin Foundation through outreach activities&#xD;
      screening and counselling will be conducted in partnering schools and NGOs (e.g., Yan Oi Tong&#xD;
      in Tuen Mun and Yew Chung College of Early Childhood Education in Aberdeen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of counselling service for improving mood&#xD;
      symptoms in EM, also to assess the effectiveness of counselling service in improving&#xD;
      psychological functioning (i.e. resilience and rumination, self-compassion, self-efficacy and&#xD;
      life satisfaction), social functioning and quality of life and to assess whether the&#xD;
      counselling service is cost-effective and offers good value for money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a wait-list RCT. Participants will be randomly assigned into either the&#xD;
      intervention group (n = 60) or the wait-list control group (n = 60) in a 1:1 ratio. Each&#xD;
      participant in the intervention group will be paired up with a participant from the control&#xD;
      group, the number of sessions and duration of waiting period varies depending on the severity&#xD;
      of mood symptoms. Participants with mild to moderate mood symptoms will receive a maximum of&#xD;
      6 counselling sessions and will be assessed at baseline (T0, W1), at post&#xD;
&#xD;
      -treatment for counselling group (T1, W8), and after 2 booster sessions. Participants in the&#xD;
      waiting list control group will receive the same counselling service after the counselling&#xD;
      group completed the intervention. Participants with severe mood symptoms will receive a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 counselling sessions and will be assessed at baseline (T0, W1), at&#xD;
      post-treatment for counselling group (T1, W12), and after 2 booster sessions. Participants in&#xD;
      the waiting list control group will receive the same counselling service after the&#xD;
      counselling group completed the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation study will provide data to inform the government in mental health policy&#xD;
      review and development.&#xD;
