  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 2.09 million cases in 2018&#xD;
      worldwide. There is a huge demand globally for sensitive and reliable assays to intercept&#xD;
      lung cancer at early stages when it can be cured. Past studies have shown that circulating&#xD;
      cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed from tumor cells contains the same mutations and methylation&#xD;
      patterns as the original tumor cells. Emerging evidence has indicated the presence of&#xD;
      systemic immune dysregulation in cancer patients, and that tumor-reactive T cells carry a&#xD;
      distinct molecular profile compared to other bystander cells. Thus, molecular abnormality of&#xD;
      ctDNA and tumor-reactive T cells may be one of the early signs that hint the presence of&#xD;
      malignancy, and it may serve as a promising target for development of blood-based assays in&#xD;
      early lung cancer for its convenience and non-invasiveness as opposed to invasive tumor&#xD;
      biopsy, or imaging-based methods that are limited by unsatisfactory sensitivity/specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to identify novel markers for early lung cancer detection as well as to&#xD;
      develop new technologies that are clinically applicable with high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity. The objectives of this proposal are multifaceted: (1) The investigators will&#xD;
      generate genome-wide methylation atlas of circulating cell free DNA and of circulating T&#xD;
      cells in lung cancer patients vs. non-cancer subjects. (2) The investigators will develop an&#xD;
      enriched method to enhance the performance of multiplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)&#xD;
      technology with increased sensitivity and decreased input DNA requirement. (Enriched&#xD;
      methylation-specific droplet digital PCR, EMS-ddPCR) (3) The investigators will develop a&#xD;
      single-cell, locus-specific DNA methylation detection system that is bisulfite-free and&#xD;
      non-PCR-based. The system can be coupled with flow cytometry or mass cytometry to enable&#xD;
      cell-type specific methylation detection. (single-cell, locus-specific methylation detection,&#xD;
      scLSM-FACS) (4) The investigators will identify a novel methylation signature consisting of&#xD;
      tumor-derived and immune-derived biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.&#xD;
