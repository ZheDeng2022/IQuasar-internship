      The study will be conducted to determine the difference on functional status, self-efficacy,&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When the literature is examined, in patients with osteoarthritis who receive face-to-face&#xD;
      training and intermittent telephone counseling; It is observed that the level of&#xD;
      self-efficacy, compliance with the disease and quality of life have increased. It is stated&#xD;
      that face-to-face training and telephone counseling services provided to participants on&#xD;
      disease management will increase the effectiveness of education and as a result; It is&#xD;
      thought that participants may have positive outcomes such as expressing their problems more&#xD;
      easily, feeling safer by communicating frequently, and developing methods of coping with&#xD;
      nurse-patient cooperation. When the studies conducted in our country are examined, while&#xD;
      there are studies examining the effect of non-pharmacological interventions such as&#xD;
      acupressor, hot-cold application, exercise training, mud pack treatment in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis; No study was found in the elderly patient group in which education and&#xD;
      telephone counseling were conducted. The results of the research are thought to be beneficial&#xD;
      in managing the disease in addition to in addition to pharmacological treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in functional status at 6 weeks and 12. weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>[Baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>After the training and counseling, the functional status scores of the patients are checked. The Western 45 Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scale has undergone several revisions. WOMAC; It consists of three subgroups: pain during various positions and movements, severity of joint stiffness, and difficulty in performing daily life activities. A total of 24 questions (pain 5, joint stiffness 2, physical function 17) and 5-point likert. In the evaluation, the questions are scored between 0 and 4 according to the Likert scale. The first option &quot;no pain&quot; is calculated as 0 points, the last option &quot;very severe pain&quot; is calculated as 4 points. Maximum scores of subgroups; 20 for pain, 8 for joint stiffness and 68 for physical function. The total score for each subgroup is the sum of the scores given to each item. As the scores get higher, symptoms worsen, restriction increases, and general health deteriorates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in self-efficacy at 6 weeks and 12. weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>[Baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>After the interventions, the patient's self-efficacy scores are checked. Self-Efficacy Scale in Arthritis; It consists of 20 expressions evaluated on a visual scale with 10 digits, whose starting point is &quot;I'm not sure = 1&quot; and the other end is &quot;I'm very sure = 10&quot;. It has four sub-dimensions: self-efficacy pain, self-efficacy hand and arm functions, self-efficacy foot leg functions and self-efficacy other symptoms. The first five statements are included in the self-efficacy pain sub-dimension and determine the level of pain coping in arthritis patients. The next nine statements are named self-efficacy hand-arm functions and self-efficacy foot leg functions, and are the two sub-dimensions of self-efficacy functions in the original. The minimum score of the scale is 20 and the maximum score is 200, and the higher the score is the indicator of the higher self-efficacy level.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in life quality at 6 weeks and 12. weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>[Baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>After the interventions, the patient's life quality scores are checked. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Elderly Module, the older module of World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale, Bullinger et al. developed by. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Elderly Module consists of 24 questions in six dimensions where the answers are determined with a five-point Likert scale. These six dimensions are: &quot;sensory functions&quot; (questions 1, 2, 10 and 20), &quot;Autonomy&quot; (questions 3, 4, 5 and 11), &quot;Past, Present, Future Activities&quot; (12, 13, 15). and questions 19), &quot;Social participation&quot; (questions 14,16, 17 and 18), &quot;death and dying&quot; (questions 6, 7, 8 and 9) and &quot;Intimacy&quot; (questions 21, 22, 23 and 24). questions). Possible dimension scores range from 4-20. Also, the &quot;total score&quot; can be calculated by adding up the individual point values. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
