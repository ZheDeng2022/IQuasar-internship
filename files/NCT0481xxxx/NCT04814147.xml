  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies show a very rapid increase in the epidemic of obesity in the&#xD;
      Caribbean population. 6 out of 10 adults are overweight and 1 out of 4 is obese. Most are&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequences : harm to health and possible reduction in life expectancy due to the&#xD;
      association with many cardiovascular comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of obesity on the cardiovascular and endocrine systems are attributed a&#xD;
      chronic low-grade inflammatory state in obese patients. Visceral adipose tissue is largely&#xD;
      responsible for the inflammatory syndrome. Obesity can also induce the formation of&#xD;
      multi-protein platforms called inflammasomes also activated by mitochondrial production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbid obesity treatment with sleeve gastrectomy is an effective long term therapeutic for&#xD;
      weight loss but also beneficial in terms of insulin resistance and cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients nevertheless remain resistant to the beneficial cardio-metabolic effects of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the mechanisms that regulate the extent of weight loss and its stabilization after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery are still poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to describe the evolution of postoperative weight loss and the place of&#xD;
      preoperative inflammation in its amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the level of inflammation in visceral fat before surgery determines&#xD;
      the extent of postoperative weight loss in obese women who have undergone sleeve gastrectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies show a very rapid increase in the epidemic of obesity in the&#xD;
      Caribbean population. The latest prevalence data in Martinique show that 6 out of 10 adults&#xD;
      are overweight and 1 out of 4 is obese (Body Mass Index, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Obesity with a BMI&#xD;
      ≥ 35 kg/m2 is said to be &quot;morbid&quot; because of its association with numerous cardiovascular&#xD;
      comorbidities. A balanced diet and physical activity are effective behavioural modalities for&#xD;
      weight loss, which, even at low intensity, can reduce cardiovascular complications and the&#xD;
      risk of death. However, many patients do not adhere to these constraints over a long period&#xD;
      of time and about 50% of them regain weight after the first year. These observations&#xD;
      highlight the value of alternative therapies with lasting effects on weight loss and the&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic comorbidities of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery with vertical calibrated vertical gastroplasty with gastric resection (or&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are therapeutic options that are not only&#xD;
      effective in the long term for weight loss but also beneficial in terms of insulin resistance&#xD;
      and cardiovascular complications. Bariatric surgery is currently indicated for the treatment&#xD;
      of morbid obesity with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 or a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 in the presence of complications.&#xD;
      Some patients nevertheless remain resistant to the beneficial cardio-metabolic effects of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. The reasons for this resistance are attributed to factors such as age &gt; 60&#xD;
      years, female sex, BMI &gt; 45 kg/m2, African-American or Hispanic origin, and history of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Regardless of these factors, several studies have pointed out that a chronic&#xD;
      low-grade inflammatory state reduces the magnitude of weight loss and thus counters the&#xD;
      beneficial cardio-metabolic effects of bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral adipose tissue is largely responsible for the inflammatory syndrome in obese&#xD;
      patients, via the activation of nuclear transcription factors (NFkB, in particular) that&#xD;
      stimulate the synthesis of numerous mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Obesity can&#xD;
      also induce the formation of multi-protein platforms called inflammasomes, including the&#xD;
      active assembly of inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, in particular) that cleave the&#xD;
      pro-interleukins IL1β and IL18 into mature pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1β and IL18. The role&#xD;
      of the inflammasome NLRP3 (&quot;NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3&quot;) in the&#xD;
      inflammatory response has been particularly studied in humans due to its association with&#xD;
      multiple chronic inflammatory, infectious and cardio-metabolic pathologies. Among the&#xD;
      biomolecules responsible for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during obesity are&#xD;
      palmitate, sphingolipids and cholesterol crystals. The NLRP3 inflammasome is also activated&#xD;
      by mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      released from mitochondria damaged by lipo-toxicity phenomena associated with obesity. More&#xD;
      generally, the mitochondrial dysfunction of the metabolic syndrome is considered to be the&#xD;
      causal intracellular event of the deregulation of the inflammatory response mediated by the&#xD;
      inflammasome.&#xD;

        gastrectomy will be included in the study, as this surgical procedure is performed on&#xD;
        approximately 9 out of 10 patients in the digestive surgery department of the CHU de&#xD;
        Martinique.&#xD;
