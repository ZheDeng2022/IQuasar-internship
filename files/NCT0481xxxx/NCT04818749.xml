  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate the beneficial and harmful effects of combining dexamethasone (12 mg) and&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine (1mcg/kg) as adjuncts to popliteal and saphenous nerve blocks in patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery of their foot or ankle.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for osseous surgery of their foot or ankle with general anaesthesia and&#xD;
      popliteal+saphenous nerve blocks will be randomised to dexamethasone (12 mg) versus&#xD;
      dexamethasone (12mg) + dexmedetomidine (1mcg/kg) versus placebo in order to assess the&#xD;
      beneficial and harmful effects of combining dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine as adjuncts to&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks. Patients will be centrally allocated according to a&#xD;
      computer-generated random allocation sequence with random, permuted blocks. The trial&#xD;
      medication will be prepared by an un-masked nurse not otherwise involved in the trial.&#xD;
      Participants, personnel, care givers, investigators, outcome assessors, and data analysts&#xD;
      will be masked to treatment allocation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to first pain (measured in minutes)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first pain will be recorded by the patient and measured in minutes as the time to first perceived pain in the surgical area. The patient will be asked to record the time and date of their first perceived pain in their trial log. This date and time will be compared to the date and time of block performance as recorded in the electronic Case Report Form. In the event of the patient not experiencing any pain, the time to first pain will be set to 72 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of the motor block (measured in minutes)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of the motor block will be recorded by the patient and measured in minutes as the time from removal of the needle to the first movement of their calf muscles, and not the first movement of their distal extremity. The patient will record the date and time of their time to first calf muscle movement on the operative side in their trial log. This date and time will be compared to the date and time of block performance as recorded in the electronic Case Report Form. In the event of the patient not regaining movement of their calf muscles, the duration of the motor block will be set to 72 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of sleep (measured on the Numerical Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of sleep will be measured on the Numerical Rating Scale (0 to 10) where '0' points correspond to the worst possible quality of sleep and '10' points correspond to the best possible quality of sleep. The outcome measure will be recorded by the patients in their trial log after the first, second, and third postoperative night.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events as defined by the ICH-GCP will be collected and reported as the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events. Furthermore, the individual serious adverse events will also be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with one or more adverse events not considered to be serious</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>We will record any adverse events not considered to be serious. We will report the proportion of participants with one or more adverse events not considered to be serious and all individual adverse events not considered to be serious.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative oxycodone consumption (measured in milligrams)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative oxycodone consumption will be recorded in the electronic medical files of the patients during hospitalisation and in their trial log at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours by the patient after discharge. The patient will be instructed to record whenever they ingest escape oxycodone, as well as record the total amount of ingested escape oxycodone at 72 hours postoperatively. The patient will be instructed to not count in any usual opioid consumption, but only the escape oxycodone provided by the investigators.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain (measured on the Numerical Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be recorded during rest and measured on the Numerical Rating Scale from '0' to '10' points where '0' points corresponds to no pain and '10' points corresponds to the worst possible pain. The patients will record their perceived pain during rest at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours in their trial log. The patient will also be asked to record their highest pain and average pain between 0 hours and 24 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours, and 48 hours and 72 hours postoperatively.</description>
