    <textblock>
      This study will be a multicenter, prospective, open label, one-arm study intended to assess&#xD;
      the clinical performance and safety of EX-02 in debridement of lower leg ulcers: Venous Leg&#xD;
      Ulcers (VLU) and Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU). In addition, the pharmacology effect of EX-02&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower leg ulcer size between 2 cm2 and 80 cm2 (surface area).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to fifteen (15) adult patients with &gt;50% non-viable tissue (necrotic/ slough/ fibrin) on&#xD;
      the ulcer will be enrolled from up to 3 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will go through the following steps during the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening and Inform Consent signing - screening visit duration will be up to 1 week and&#xD;
           will include: recording demographics, medical history and concomitant medications, vital&#xD;
           signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, wound photography and&#xD;
           assessments and pain assessment questionnaires. Wound fluid sampling and 3 mm punch&#xD;
           biopsy (from the wound edge area) will be taken during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Daily visits period (up to 8 daily site visits within up to 14 days), including an&#xD;
           additional visit, 48 hrs after last daily visit for wound fluid sampling. During the&#xD;
           Daily visits period, the patient will arrive daily to site visits. During each visit,&#xD;
           adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, vital signs, and pain will be assessed&#xD;
           and recorded, the wound will be washed, photographed and assessed for wound size and for&#xD;
           % of nonviable tissue by clinical assessment. During the daily visits period, the&#xD;
           peri-wound will be well protected with topical barrier (e.g zinc oxide paste). For VLU,&#xD;
           compression therapy must be used throughout daily visits period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will clinically assess complete debridement, upon achieving a viable&#xD;
           wound bed after removal of all non-viable tissue, suitable for initiation of the wound&#xD;
           healing stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be treated with EX-02 for up to 8 applications (up to 8 visits) or until&#xD;
           complete debridement is achieved, whichever occurs first. Duration of each application&#xD;
           will be 24±3 hours. On weekends occurring during the daily visits period the wound will&#xD;
           be dressed with a non-active dressing (e.g. foam).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hydrogels as well as methods of active debridement (either surgical, mechanical,&#xD;
           biological, enzymatic or other dressings), grafting and V.A.C are not allowed during&#xD;
           this period and while daily visits are ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluid samples will be taken from the EX-02 treated wound before the first treatment and&#xD;
           once the wound has reached complete debridement or daily visits completed, whichever&#xD;
           occurred first. Punch biopsies from the wound edge will be taken before and at the end&#xD;
           of the debridement to assess for biofilm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical lab tests and physical examination as well as pain assessments and vital signs&#xD;
           will be performed at the end of daily visits period (once the wound has reached complete&#xD;
           debridement or daily visits completed, whichever occurred first).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For patients who achieved complete debridement, wound closure could be considered using&#xD;
           grafting/autograft procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completion of the daily visits period (either if complete debridement was&#xD;
           achieved, or after 8 daily applications were performed) patients will start the weekly&#xD;
           follow- up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Weekly follow- up period (2 visits in 2 weeks) - the 2 weekly follow up period should be&#xD;
           performed at the clinical site. During each weekly visit, safety parameters will be&#xD;
           recorded (AEs, concomitant medications, pain, vital signs), the wound will be washed,&#xD;
           photographed and assessed for wound size and for % of nonviable tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For wounds which did not reach complete debridement during the daily visits period, the&#xD;
      investigator should continue to persue complete debridement using surgical or non- surgical&#xD;
      debridement tools (SOC), per the investigators discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression therapy must be used throughout this period for VLU patients and as determined by&#xD;
      investigator to be appropriate for DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall duration of the study for each patient will be approximately 4-5 weeks.&#xD;
