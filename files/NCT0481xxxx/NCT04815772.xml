    <textblock>
      The aim of present study was to evaluate how the 2018 classification reflects the severity,&#xD;
      extent and progression of the disease, taking into account the risk factors for periodontal&#xD;
      disease, smoking and diabetes, when compared with the 1999 classification.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The advantages of including the effect of diabetes and smoking on periodontal disease in the 2018 classification compared to the 1999 classification</measure>
    <time_frame>The present retrospective study included individuals who were examined and had periodontal measurements made and recorded at the Istanbul Okan University Periodontology Department between 09/01/2018 and 12/01/2019.</time_frame>
    <description>In our study, both classifications reflected the severity of periodontal disease differently. The 2018 classification outperformed the 1999 classification for staging and grading of periodontitis severity and progression. Consideration of the risk factors listed in the 2018 classification has been useful approach for correct diagnosis, evidence-based clinical decisions, prognosis of treatment, and periodontal disease prevention. The 2018 periodontal disease classification is more detailed and comprehensive than the 1999 classification, and this classification is thought to revise the criticisms of the 1999 classification.</description>
