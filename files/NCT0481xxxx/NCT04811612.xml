    <textblock>
      Newborn babies can develop low blood sugar (glucose) which can lead to brain injury and poor&#xD;
      developmental outcomes. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure the blood glucose in&#xD;
      babies. One way to measure the blood glucose is to test blood from the baby's heel with a&#xD;
      bedside device called a point of care glucometer. This method is very common and easy;&#xD;
      however, multiple factors can lead to an inaccurate reading. A false low reading may require&#xD;
      additional blood testing and admission to the NICU. A false high reading could result in the&#xD;
      medical provider missing the diagnosis of low blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team wants to know if there is a difference between blood glucose measurements taken from&#xD;
      warmed and un-warmed heels of infants. Blood flow farther away from the heart, such as in the&#xD;
      feet and heels, may be less than the rest of the body, and might move more slowly. This could&#xD;
      cause the glucose level to be lower in the feet and heels. Therefore, sampling blood from an&#xD;
      un-warmed heel may result in a falsely low glucose reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some research that suggests warming the heel increases blood flow to the area;&#xD;
      however, only one study that we know of has evaluated differences in blood glucose readings&#xD;
      from warmed and un-warmed heels. They found significantly higher blood glucose readings from&#xD;
      warmed heels compared to un-warmed heels in 57 babies. However, these babies were part of a&#xD;
      larger study comparing different diets on blood glucose levels, and the heels were warmed&#xD;
      using warm water which is no longer a current practice. The goal of this study is to compare&#xD;
      the capillary blood glucose levels from warmed and un-warmed heels in about 100 infants who&#xD;
      are breast and/or formula fed using the current practice of warming heels with gel heat&#xD;
      packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between capillary blood glucose&#xD;
      levels sampled from an infants warmed and un-warmed heel. The alternative hypothesis is that&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose levels sampled from warmed heels will be higher than those samples&#xD;
      from un-warmed heels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neonatal hypoglycemia is defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics as blood glucose level&#xD;
      less than 47 mg/dL and is one of the most common diagnoses requiring admission to the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).1,2 The incidence of hypoglycemia in healthy newborns is&#xD;
      approximately 5-15%, and as high as 51% in infants with risk factors.3 The cost of&#xD;
      hospitalization of neonatal hypoglycemia is estimated to range from $2,350-$12,755.4&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia in the newborn has been associated with permanent brain injury including&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental delay, learning difficulties and seizures.5 Clinically important&#xD;
      hypoglycemia is not always associated with clinical exam findings;6 therefore, accurate&#xD;
      measurement of blood glucose in the newborn is of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing of venous blood, typically plasma, is a widely accepted method of&#xD;
      diagnosing neonatal hypoglycemia.6 However, point of care (POC) testing of capillary blood&#xD;
      using a bedside glucometer is a common screening tool in newborn nurseries and NICUs. The POC&#xD;
      testing method provides real time results and is an easier, less invasive sampling&#xD;
      technique.6 Despite these conveniences, studies have found POC testing to be less accurate&#xD;
      than venous testing.7-9 POC testing is also less accurate at lower glucose levels and&#xD;
      readings are affected by polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia, common findings in newborn&#xD;
      babies.6,7,10 Inaccurate readings may result in unnecessary admissions to the NICU for&#xD;
      additional testing and management. Therefore, efforts to optimize the accuracy POC glucose&#xD;
      testing in screening for neonatal hypoglycemia is imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One common practice thought to increase the accuracy of capillary POC glucose testing is to&#xD;
      warm the infant's heel before blood sampling. It has been proposed that warming the heel will&#xD;
      increase blood flow to the capillary bed and improve peripheral blood stasis that may&#xD;
      otherwise result in a falsely low glucose reading.11,12 Current practice is to warm the heel&#xD;
      with a gel heat pack designed and marketed specifically for the purpose of warming the&#xD;
      infant's heel prior to blood collection. These gel heat packs are an additional cost to the&#xD;
      hospital, and currently it is unclear if there is any significant clinical benefit to warming&#xD;
      the infant's heel before obtaining capillary blood glucose measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies utilizing laser Doppler flowmetry have suggested that local warming results&#xD;
      in increased skin blood flow and perfusion in infants.13-15 This increase in blood flow is&#xD;
      thought to be reflected in the volume of blood collected and ease of collection. In practice,&#xD;
      however, the effect of local warming on capillary blood collection in neonates appears to be&#xD;
      minimal. One study found that heel warming in infants did not improve the volume of blood&#xD;
      collected or the ease of blood collection.16 A subsequent study found that warming the heel&#xD;
      decreased the need to squeeze the heel for blood collection, however, there was no difference&#xD;
      in volume of blood collected or collection time.17 To the best of our knowledge, the only&#xD;
      study that has directly compared the effect of warming the heel on capillary blood glucose in&#xD;
      infants was conducted by Russell and McKay in 1966.18 The study compared simultaneously&#xD;
      collected capillary blood glucose levels from a warmed and un-warmed heel in 57 infants.&#xD;
      Overall, glucose levels from the warmed and un-warmed heels were highly significantly&#xD;
      correlated. However, the mean glucose concentration from blood in warmed heels was 2.8 mg/dL&#xD;
      higher than that from un-warmed heels. Additionally, of the 57 infants, 13 had a&#xD;
      statistically significant higher glucose level measured in their warmed heel compared to&#xD;
      their un-warmed heel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Russell and McKay study suggested that the infant's heel must always be warmed before&#xD;
      collecting capillary blood for glucose measurement. However, the study included only 57&#xD;
      infants, a subset of which were also assigned to a low calorie, high calorie, or&#xD;
      hydrocortisone administration groups to determine the outcomes of these interventions on&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. Additionally, the infant's heels were warmed by soaking in warm water.&#xD;
      This is no longer the current practice as most institutions use gel heat packs designed&#xD;
      specifically for warming the heels of infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to simultaneously compare the capillary blood glucose levels from&#xD;
      warmed and un-warmed heels in approximately 100 infants who are being breast and/or formula&#xD;
      fed using the current practice of warming heels with gel heat packs. The null hypothesis is&#xD;
      that there will be no difference between capillary blood glucose levels sampled from an&#xD;
      infants warmed and un-warmed heel. It has been proposed that warming the heel will increase&#xD;
      blood flow to the capillary bed and improve peripheral blood stasis that may otherwise result&#xD;
      in a falsely low glucose reading. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is that capillary&#xD;
      blood glucose levels sampled from warmed heels will be higher than those samples from&#xD;
      un-warmed heels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After admission to the newborn nursery or NICU, the infant's mother will be approached&#xD;
      regarding her participation and of her newborn baby. If participation is desired, mom will&#xD;
      sign consent for herself and for the infant; PHI authorization will be obtained. Warmed and&#xD;
      un-warmed heel capillary blood glucose will be obtained from the infant at the time of a&#xD;
      clinically indicated point of care glucose check. A heating pad will be placed on one heel&#xD;
      for 10 minutes. The other heel will not be warmed. A lancet will be used to produce blood at&#xD;
      both heels, and blood glucose will be measured from both heels using the Nova Stat&#xD;
      glucometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the hospitalization will be extracted from the Electronic Health Record from both&#xD;
      mother and baby. Data will include demographic information, medications and health&#xD;
      conditions, delivery information, and anthropometric data. Data analysis will be done using&#xD;
      SPSS Statistic software to evaluate for differences between capillary blood glucose levels&#xD;
      from warmed and unwarmed heels.&#xD;
