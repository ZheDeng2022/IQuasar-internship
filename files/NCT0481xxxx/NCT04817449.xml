  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in the world. Advanced stage&#xD;
      at diagnosis is associated with lower survival rates, thus early detection appears to have an&#xD;
      important role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raman Spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique that uses the interaction of light to identify&#xD;
      the composition of the sample tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to explore the use of spectroscopic techniques in the detection of&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. There are two different assessments within the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify ovarian cancer in blood - Raman spectroscopic analysis will be performed on&#xD;
           blood plasma taken from patients with suspected ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detect active cancer within post chemotherapy fibrotic tissue - Ex vivo Raman&#xD;
           spectroscopic analysis of peritoneal, omental or ovarian tissues collected from patients&#xD;
           undergoing surgical treatment for ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the spectroscopy will be correlated to clinical outcome and histological&#xD;
      diagnosis respectively.&#xD;
