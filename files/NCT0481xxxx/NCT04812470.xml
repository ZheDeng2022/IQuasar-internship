&#xD;
          3. Patient must have a histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  stage IV cutaneous melanoma with confirmed progression following at least one or&#xD;
                  two prior systemic therapies including a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)&#xD;
                  inhibitor with or without a CTLA-4 inhibitor; and if BRAF V600 mutation-positive,&#xD;
                  also a BRAF inhibitor or a BRAF inhibitor in combination with a MEK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) per&#xD;
             RECIST 1.1 criteria with at least one target lesion identified in the liver and where&#xD;
             the distribution pattern of metastasis is predominantly engaging the liver as judged&#xD;
             by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least one resectable lesion in the liver (or aggregate of lesions resected) of a&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 - 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female patient of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first treatment. If the urine&#xD;
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;

             the last dose of study therapy. Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual&#xD;
             lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;

             prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study&#xD;
             drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt;10 mg&#xD;
             daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. A history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
