             less than the MR scanner limit of 55 cm. The participant may also be brought to the&#xD;
             MRI Center and the MRI technologist will assess whether the participant will be able&#xD;
             to fit into the MRI scanner. Metal screening and urine pregnancy testing will be done&#xD;
