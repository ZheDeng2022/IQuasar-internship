  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of natural products in the prevention or treatment of chronic diseases is an emerging&#xD;
      field in current medicine. And studying the mechanisms of actions by which natural products&#xD;
      act in our bodies contributes to the rational use of these products. And the combination of&#xD;
      different natural products such as prebiotics (FOS- fructooligosaccharides,&#xD;
      GOS-Galactooligosaccharides and beta-glucans derived from yeast), herbal medicine (Silybum&#xD;
      marianum), and minerals (Se-selenium, Zn-Zinc, and Mg-Magnesium), o which would result in a&#xD;
      synergistic association between them can contribute to achieving not only preventive effects&#xD;
      but treatment for chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. The present study aims to&#xD;
      study the effects of a composition containing natural products on factors and markers that&#xD;
      are part of mitochondrial biogenesis and the neuroimmune-endocrine system in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and that present grade 1 overweight/obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and diabetes are chronic diseases characterized by increased visceral adipose tissue&#xD;
      and sub-acute inflammation. These conditions can lead to insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      oxidative stress], and lipotoxicity, and lead to the development of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      Previous work has shown that these comorbidities, as well as high levels of glucocorticoids,&#xD;
      can modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and inflammatory response. In some&#xD;
      cases, these conditions and responses perturb neuroimmune endocrine system homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another potential outcome arising from inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and&#xD;
      lipotoxicity is a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a chronic liver disease that&#xD;
      often coexists with obesity-related type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      NAFLD compromises glycemic and lipid homeostasis. The hyperglycemia and the lipotoxicity&#xD;
      drive the metabolic pathways of the cell towards gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and de novo&#xD;
      lipogenesis, and the subsequent increase in free fatty acid (FFA) production can cause&#xD;
      oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that non-pharmacological interventions can be used as strategies&#xD;
      for treating and/or preventing inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Furthermore, exploiting&#xD;
      specific proteins and transcription factors that target the mitochondria represents potential&#xD;
      mechanisms for these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along these lines, natural products and derivatives thereof, often referred to as natural&#xD;
      medicines, have been gaining notoriety as sources of effective therapeutics. For example,&#xD;
      polyphenols present in plants can be metabolized to form propionic acid, which is later&#xD;
      transformed into another metabolite, butyrate. As reviewed by Juárez-Hernández et al.,&#xD;
      Na-butyrate and synthetic derivatives thereof increase prebiotic lactobacilli and&#xD;
      bifidobacteria growth in the colon, consequently improving thermogenesis and energy&#xD;
      expenditure, ultimately reducing hepatic lipid deposition, improving triacylglycerol content&#xD;
      and insulin resistance and protecting against metabolic impairment, as well as liver&#xD;
      inflammation and/or damage. Furthermore, butyrate can induce the expression of fibroblast&#xD;
      growth factor 21 (FGF-21), which plays a vital role in stimulating hepatic fatty acid&#xD;
      β-oxidation. In this sense, prebiotics may be a promising treatment for chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      and metabolic diseases in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of prebiotic compounds, such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS),&#xD;
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and yeast β-glucans, minerals including magnesium, zinc,&#xD;
      selenium, and plants like Silybum marianum (L.) Gaerth. (Silymarin), have been evaluated for&#xD;
      the treatment of specific diseases. However, most of these studies only describe the effects&#xD;
      of the supplements being administered alone. Thus, the present study monitored the synergic&#xD;
      effects of a novel supplement formulation containing prebiotics, yeast β-glucans, minerals,&#xD;
      and silymarin on lipid metabolism, inflammatory and mitochondrial proteins in eutrophic, and&#xD;
      overweight/obesity I volunteer.&#xD;

    <description>The first version of the Portuguese language questionnaire, &quot;Morningness-Eveningness-Stability Scale - improved by Horne e Ostberg&quot; (QMV-H&amp;O), had 20 items (19 items translated from English language questionnaire and a 20th added by us).&#xD;
The total of the items is divided in three subscales, each one composed of five items: Morning Affect, Eveningness, and Distinctness. The items related to the Morning Affect subscale measure morningness preferences (early schedules), whereas the items of the Eveningness subscale assess evening preferences (late schedules). The remaining five items constitute the Distinctness subscale, that is, the amplitude dimension of this instrument. Each item is responded using a 5-points Likert scale and scored with 1-5 points, although some of them are reverse coded. The previous validation studies mentioned in the Introduction have revealed good indexes, such as Cronbach' alpha values for the three subscales ranging between 0.69 to 0.87.</description>

    <description>One of the instruments that is regularly used to measure QOL, is the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument - 100 items (WHOQOL-100; WHOQOL Group, 1998b), a cross-culturally developed generic instrument. It was created by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Group (WHOQOL Group), that defined QOL as &quot;an individual's perception of his/her position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which he/she lives and in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards and concerns&quot; (WHOQOL group, 1995). The WHOQOL-BREF contains 26 items; one item from each of the 24 facets contained in the original WHOQOL-100 and two items were retrieved from the 'Overall QOL and General health' facet. The WHOQOL-BREF covers four domains: Physical health, Psychological health, Social relationships, and Environment.</description>

    <measure>Change Sleep Patterns Over time of Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep patterns will be evaluated using the Brazilian Portuguese Version of the Mini-Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ-BR).&#xD;
It is composed of a ten-item self-report scale that measures frequencies of sleep difficulty. Insomnia is evaluated by four questions which assess difficulty in falling asleep, mid-sleep awakenings, early awakening in the morning, and hypnotic medication use (MSQ-BR insomnia). For evaluation of hypersomnia, the questions include snoring, feeling tired upon awakening, excessive daytime sleepiness, and restless sleep (MSQ-BR hypersomnia). Answers are given on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always). The total sum of scores is divided into four levels of sleep difficulties: 10-24 points, good sleep quality; 25-27 points, mild sleep difficulties; 28-30 points, moderate sleep difficulties; and ≥31 points, severe sleep difficulties. The total score offers an estimate of sleep quality, with higher scores reflecting more sleeping problems.</description>

    <measure>Change Sleep Quality Over Time of Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assesses sleep quality over a 1-month period. The questionnaire consists of 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions that should be answered by bedmates or roommates. The latter questions are used only for clinical information. The 19 questions categorized into 7 components, graded on a score that ranges from 0 to 3. The PSQI components are as follows: subjective sleep quality (C1), sleep latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efficiency (C4), sleep disturbances (C5), use of sleeping medication(C6), and daytime dysfunction (C7). The sum of scores for these 7components yields one global score, which ranges from 0 to 21, where the highest score indicates the worst sleep quality. A global PSQIscore greater than 5 indicates major difficulties in at least 2 components or moderate difficulties in more than 3 components.</description>

    <measure>Change Sleepiness Patterns Over time of Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as an increased propensity to fall asleep under circumstances that the affected individual and others would consider inappropriate. A Portuguese-language version of the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) will be applied to volunteers.&#xD;
The ESS is based on questions referring to eight such situations, some known to be very soporific; others less so. The questionnaire, which is self-administered. Subjects are asked to rate on a scale of 0-3 how likely they would be to doze off or fall asleep in the eight situations, based on their usual way of life in recent times. A distinction is made between dozing off and simply feeling tired. If a subject has not been in some of the situations recently, he is asked, nonetheless, to estimate how each might affect him.</description>
