      This is a pragmatic trial of SHARING Choices. Components of SHARING Choices include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A letter from the clinic introducing an initiative to prepare persons and families for&#xD;
           Advance Care Planning (ACP);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Access to a facilitator trained to lead ACP discussions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient-family agenda-setting to align perspectives about the role of family and&#xD;
           stimulate discussion about ACP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Facilitated registration to the patient portal (for patient and family) as desired;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Education &amp; resources about Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) for clinic&#xD;
           staff.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Engaging family in primary care is particularly important in Alzheimer's Disease and Related&#xD;
      Dementias (ADRD) because of the important role assumed in medical decision-making, especially&#xD;
      at the end of life. The investigators, study seeks to improve communication in primary care&#xD;
      through methods to proactively engage family in ongoing interactions with primary care and&#xD;
      stimulate and support Advance Care Planning (ACP) for all older adults and attention to ADRD&#xD;
      in primary care throughout the ADRD disease trajectory. The investigators' premise is that&#xD;
      individuals and families appreciate primary care involvement in ACP and information and&#xD;
      referrals for ADRD needs, but that individual, family, and system factors including time,&#xD;
      knowledge, and resources often inhibit these conversations from occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHARING Choices integrates communication strategies that have been individually found to be&#xD;
      effective but have thus far been deployed in isolation of one another. The investigators&#xD;
      focus on all older primary care patients because of the importance of addressing ACP early,&#xD;
      the under-diagnosis of ADRD and the greater implementation potential of a protocol with broad&#xD;
      applicability.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>Advance directive will be defined as a durable power of attorney, living will, Maryland Medical Order for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), or District of Columbia Medical Order for Sustaining Treatment (MOST) based on information that is recorded in each care delivery system's electronic medical record 12 months after study entry. The initial visit date for each candidate patient after the inception of the trial serves as the beginning of the 12-month observation period and will be used to construct comparable observation periods for candidate patients at both intervention and control groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of potentially burdensome procedures reported within 6 months preceding death</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months preceding patient death</time_frame>
    <description>Potentially burdensome care will be measured as any (yes/no) procedures within the 6 months that precede death using dates and validated International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes for hospital services that will be extracted from CRISP, the regional health information exchange, which includes a repository of all hospital encounters in Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Specific procedures and codes that will be used to reflect burdensome care include intubation and mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, gastrostomy feeding tube placement, hemodialysis, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We limit our analysis of this measure to patients with diagnosis codes indicative of serious illness, for whom these procedures would be considered potentially burdensome, drawing from a list of ICD-10 codes.</description>
