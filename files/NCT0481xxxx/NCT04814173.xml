      Patients with class II division 1 malocclusion who have increased overjet will be treated in&#xD;
      this study. The efficacy of one-jaw and tow-jaw mechanics for mini-implants anchored&#xD;
      total-maxillary-arch-distalization in the treatment of class II division 1 malocclusion will&#xD;
      be assessed. The skeletal, dental and soft tissues changes resulted by these tow&#xD;
      interventions will be studied. As well as, the pain levels, oral-health related quality of&#xD;
      life during all stages of the treatment and the smile components will be explored and&#xD;
      compared with the traditional treatment results of this type of malocclusion (en-mass&#xD;
      retraction with first premolars extraction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a group of patients in which participants will be undergo to the one-jaw mechanic for&#xD;
           mini-implants anchored total-maxillary-arch-distalization (mini-implants in the&#xD;
           maxillary arch).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a group of patients in which participants will be undergo to the tow-jaw mechanic for&#xD;
           mini-implants anchored total-maxillary-arch-distalization (mini-implants in the&#xD;
           mandibular arch with class II elastics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a group of patients in which participants will be undergo to the en-mass retraction with&#xD;
           first premolars extraction with mini-implants in the maxillary arch.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of adults seeking active orthodontic treatment has been increasing over the past&#xD;
      several decades. Older patients tend to show a greater demand for esthetic considerations&#xD;
      during and after active treatment. Also, the preservation of existing dentoalveolar&#xD;
      structures becomes a more critical issue in their treatment, and this mandates vigilant&#xD;
      monitoring of the periodontal and occlusal statuses throughout the course of tooth movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the tendency towards choosing nonextraction approaches has been increasing because&#xD;
      of the availability of effective and minimally invasive treatment modalities. Several&#xD;
      strategies have been introduced to address the arch length discrepancy by gaining space&#xD;
      through enamel stripping, arch expansion, and distalization of dentition. Moreover, the&#xD;
      introduction of temporary anchorage devices (TADs) has enhanced the efficiency of&#xD;
      nonextraction therapies via improved anchorage management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total-maxillary-arch-distalization is a treatment modality respect the principle of&#xD;
      structures preservation and the esthetic demands of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the published literature were case reports or retrospective studies so, there is a&#xD;
      high need for a randomized controlled trial to assess some of these suggested approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will have three parallel arms as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: a group of patients in which participants will be undergo to the one-jaw&#xD;
           mechanic for mini-implants anchored total-maxillary-arch-distalization (the&#xD;
           mini-implants will be inserted in the maxillary arch between the roots of 2nd premolar&#xD;
           and 1st molar and closer to the molar, then a force of 250 g will be applied from the&#xD;
           TAD to a hook lateral to the laterals).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a group of patients in which participants will be undergo to the tow-jaw mechanic for&#xD;
           mini-implants anchored total-maxillary-arch-distalization (the mini-implants will be&#xD;
           inserted in the mandibular arch between the 2nd premolar and 1st molar, then, a class II&#xD;
           elastics 3/16 and 6.5oz will be use from the TAD to the hook of canines brackets).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a group of patients in which participants will be undergo to the en-mass retraction with&#xD;
           first premolars extraction with mini-implants in the maxillary arch inserted between the&#xD;
           2nd premolar and 1st molar, then a force of 250 g will be applied from the TAD to a hook&#xD;
           lateral to the laterals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment of each subject into the study, they will be examined completely to&#xD;
      determine the orthodontic treatment plan. The operator will inform them about the aim of the&#xD;
      study and ask them to provide a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fixed orthodontic appliance will be bonded ( MBT 0.022 inch prescription), the active&#xD;
      distalization or retraction will start when the rectangular stainless steel archwires (0.019&quot;&#xD;
      × 0.025&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the treatment will be determined clinically when a class I canine relationship&#xD;
      achieved with a good incisor relationship obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental casts will be used for the quantification of the anteroposterior movement of the&#xD;
      anterior teeth and the first molars before the beginning of the treatment and when a class I&#xD;
      canine relationship achieved with a good incisor relationship obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cephalograms will be taken 3 times: the first before the beginning treatment for diagnosis&#xD;
      purpose, the second: after the completion of leveling and alignment stage, the third: when a&#xD;
      class I canine relationship achieved with a good incisor relationship obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smile photographs will be taken in 2 times: the first before the beginning of the treatment,&#xD;
      the second: after the treatment&#xD;
