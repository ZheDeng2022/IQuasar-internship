  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous viral warts are very common and are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Most&#xD;
      people experience warts in one form or another at some point in their lives. Cutaneous warts&#xD;
      are related to different types of HPV. For the palms and soles, HPV 2 has been the most&#xD;
      frequently found but HPV 1, 4, 27, and 57 have also been described. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      vaccination by nonavalent vaccine against HPV could lead to a complete resolution of&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat palmo-plantar warts patients of more than 15 years and 3 months of age.&#xD;

      The qHPV and nHPV has been used as a therapeutic approached for the treatment of cutaneous&#xD;
      warts in case reports and some case series. Very recently, the Journal of the American&#xD;
      Academy of Dermatology (JAAD)-the journal with the highest impact factor in the&#xD;
      dermatological field- has published a review of all the cases reported in the scientific&#xD;
      literature. The authors were strongly in favor of the use of the vaccine in case of&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat warts and have highlighted the need for clinical trials. In the&#xD;
      literature, 80 patients have been described with cutaneous warts treated by qHPV or nHPV with&#xD;
      more than 50% of efficacy.Our hypothesis is that vaccination by nonavalent vaccine against&#xD;
      HPV could lead to a complete resolution of difficult-to-treat palmo-plantar warts patients of&#xD;
      more than 15 years and 3 months of age.&#xD;
