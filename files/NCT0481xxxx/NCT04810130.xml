  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing concern for the resulting neurological and physiological outcomes from&#xD;
      repeated head impacts in sports that do not manifest into traditional concussion symptoms.&#xD;
      Specifically, there is evidence of immediate physiological deficits following controlled&#xD;
      soccer heading. This study will compare the physiological changes of adolescents completing a&#xD;
      set of soccer headers to those randomized to a set of soccer kicks to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      repetitive head impacts.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited data relating head impact biomechanics to neurological outcomes in humans.&#xD;
      Concussion occurs from rotational loading of the head giving rise to diffuse stresses and&#xD;
      strains in the brain tissue leading to autonomic and physiological dysfunction. Repeated head&#xD;
      loading is common in contact sports and an integral part of soccer. It is unknown whether the&#xD;
      same biomechanical forces from lower severity head impacts such as typical soccer heading&#xD;
      cause temporary physiological deficits as well. Advancement of objective physiological&#xD;
      function assessment devices allow measurement of neurological effects in the absence of&#xD;
      diagnosed concussion. Recent soccer heading studies have evaluated neurophysiological changes&#xD;
      pre- and post-repetitive heading. These studies have found conflicting results for the effect&#xD;
      on neurocognitive performance immediately following a bout of heading, but consistent changes&#xD;
      were observed in measures of vestibular balance, ocular function, and neurochemical&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soccer heading biomechanics studies showed that females experienced higher severity head&#xD;
      loading, and in equivalent sports such as soccer and basketball, females have higher&#xD;
      concussion rates. This study will compare the physiological changes of male and female&#xD;
      adolescents completing one of two soccer heading paradigms to those randomized to kicking to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of repetitive head impacts. This study will relate biomechanical measures&#xD;
      of head loading with physiological function changes associated with repeated head impacts,&#xD;
      and compare sex-differences in biomechanical measures and physiological changes.&#xD;
