    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Internet-based&#xD;
      integrated-management Program on increasing coping strategies, medical adherence and HRQoL,&#xD;
      and reducing readmission in patients with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design a double-blind two-group longitudinal experimental study will be conducted to compare&#xD;
      the Internet-based integrated-management Program with a usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving informed consents, participants will be randomly assigned to two groups by&#xD;
      using a web-based system with blocked randomization. The intervention group will receive an&#xD;
      Internet-based integrated management Program, and control group will receive nurse&#xD;
      consultations and three times telephone coaching. Outcomes from three self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after initiating the intervention will be&#xD;
      compared to baseline assessments. Outcome measurements include the following parameters:&#xD;
      28-item Brief COPE, Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS), the 3-level version of EuroQol&#xD;
      five-dimension self-report questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), and readmission events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: The inclusion criteria are: (1) those who are â‰¥20 years old&#xD;
      and AF diagnosed by a cardiology specialist, (2) have clear consciousness, (3) are fluent in&#xD;
      Mandarin/Taiwanese, (4) are receiving anticoagulant treatment, (5) are able to use mobile&#xD;
      phone and compute. The exclusion criteria are: (1) diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder,&#xD;
      (2) are involved in other clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will be recruited from a cardiology outpatient clinic of a medical&#xD;
      center in northern Taiwan. The study design and protocols had been reviewed and approved by&#xD;
      the institutional review board of the participating hospital. At the content session, all&#xD;
      assessments and procedures will be fully explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of eligibility and randomization: Participants will be considered eligible if they&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria. All participants will be informed that they are able to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any time. Before randomization, participants will be asked to answer four&#xD;
      questionnaires. The questionnaires include demographic characteristics, 28-item Brief COPE,&#xD;
      Cardiac Symptom Survey (CSS), Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS), and the 3-level&#xD;
      version of EuroQol five-dimension self-report questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blinding is maintained because i) research nurse who is involved in the collection of&#xD;
      post-test data are not having any information of group assignment. ii) Participants do not&#xD;
      know their group assignment and receive corresponding interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Internet-based integrated management Program is conducted in the cardiology outpatient&#xD;
      department. Participants will have their own account and passwords to log in to the system&#xD;
      via mobile phones or computers. The system has five domains that included patient's&#xD;
      information collection, AF knowledge area, instructions on anticoagulation medicine,&#xD;
      self-monitoring of symptom area, and professional consultation. Everyone has their own area&#xD;
      to ensure the privacy of participants. The research nurse will have sent messages every day&#xD;
      to care about the participant's condition. In this area, when the participants have an&#xD;
      emergency, it will not only provide textual information, but also provide telephone coaching.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators also will instruct participants and provide the AF management&#xD;
      manual, which will include a description of the causes and predisposing risk factors of AF,&#xD;
      the symptoms of AF, the relationship between AF and stroke, stroke prevention measures for&#xD;
      patients with AF, and managing a healthy lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will receive standard nurse consultations. A manual of AF&#xD;
      management is provided and explained. In addition, the investigators will provide a&#xD;
      three-time telephone coaching, which will teach participants how to manage their disease and&#xD;
      associated disease knowledge at the 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after random assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coping strategies: The 28-item Brief COPE self-report questionnaire measure strategies&#xD;
      participants use for coping. The Brief-COPE is divided into approach coping, in which&#xD;
      individuals actively seek resources to deal with their health problems; and avoidance coping,&#xD;
      in which individuals attempt to divert attention away from events. Higher scores indicate&#xD;
      greater use of the specific coping strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicine adherence: This 10-items MARS scale has three domains: medication adherence&#xD;
      behavior, attitude toward taking medication, and negative side-effects and attitudes to&#xD;
      medication. The total possible score ranged from 0 to 10. A higher score indicates a better&#xD;
      medicine adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-Related Quality of Life: Participant's HRQoL was measured by the 3-level version of&#xD;
      EuroQol five-dimension self-report questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). The instrument has two&#xD;
      subscales: the EQ-5D descriptive system (5 items) and the EuroQol visual analog scale&#xD;
      (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system have five domains: mobility, self-care, usual&#xD;
      activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. EQ-VAS is an individual's&#xD;
      self-assessment of health status, with a vertical scale of 20 cm (visual analog scale). The&#xD;
      higher score indicates the best possible state of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readmission events: After inclusion in the study, the investigators will follow up&#xD;
      readmission events in all included participants. The readmission events are based on the&#xD;
      query of medical records in the research hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: the investigators will use descriptive statistics (mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, frequency and percentage) to analyze participant characteristics and outcomes. The&#xD;
      initial differences between groups for demographic characteristics, coping strategies,&#xD;
      medical adherence, and HRQoL will be examined with independent t-tests and Chi-square&#xD;
      analysis. Effects of the Internet-based integrated-management Program on coping strategies,&#xD;
      medical adherence, and HRQoL in patients with AF will be analyze using generalized estimating&#xD;
      equations (GEE). The significance will be defined as a two-tailed P-value of &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's characteristics will report as age, gender, type of AF, the class of mEHRA,&#xD;
      comorbidities and medication status are evaluated by the univariate logistic regression to&#xD;
      assess the association with the readmission events. Predictor variables with P value &lt;0.20&#xD;
      are eligible for inclusion in the multivariable logistic regression model for the outcome.&#xD;
      The continuous variables are converted to categorical variables in the multivariable logistic&#xD;
      model. In the multivariable logistic regression model, predictor variables with two-tailed P&#xD;
      value &lt;0.05 are considered significant.&#xD;
