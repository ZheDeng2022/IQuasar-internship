  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endurance exercise is often recommended to improve cardiometabolic health and maintain bone&#xD;
      health throughout life and to prevent osteoporotic fracture. However, there is evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that bone does not always adapt in the way that is expected, and that endurance&#xD;
      exercise may lead to bone loss under certain conditions. Disruptions in calcium homeostasis&#xD;
      during exercise may explain this observation, and preliminary data suggests that the mode of&#xD;
      exercise (i.e., cycling versus treadmill) may result in different magnitudes of change in&#xD;
      bone biomarkers. The purpose of this study is to determine if mode of exercise results in a&#xD;
      differential bone biomarker response to an acute exercise bout in older Veterans. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected before, during, and after 2 acute exercise bouts: 1) brisk&#xD;
      treadmill walking; and 2) vigorous stationary cycling. Bouts will be matched for relative&#xD;
      intensity and duration. This data will be used to develop future exercise interventions in&#xD;
      older Veterans aimed at preserving both cardiometabolic and bone health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endurance exercise is frequently recommended as a means to reduce the risk of cardiometabolic&#xD;
      diseases and to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture. However, bone does not always adapt&#xD;
      in the way that would be expected, and there is evidence that endurance exercise may lead to&#xD;
      bone loss under certain conditions. It is the investigators contention that disruptions in&#xD;
      calcium homeostasis during exercise, resulting in decreases in serum ionized calcium (iCa)&#xD;
      and increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and c-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX; a&#xD;
      marker of bone resorption) at the onset of exercise, may be responsible for the lack of&#xD;
      improvements in bone mineral density that are anticipated. Acute studies in this area have&#xD;
      predominantly focused on young, healthy adults, primarily men, during stationary cycling&#xD;
      exercise. Few studies have been conducted in older adults, but those studies have found that&#xD;
      older adults experience similar disruptions in calcium homeostasis in response to an acute&#xD;
      bout of endurance exercise. Preliminary comparisons of the investigators studies, as well as&#xD;
      research from other labs, also suggests that that mode of exercise conducted during these&#xD;
      acute exercise bouts may be an important determining factor in the catabolic bone response to&#xD;
      exercise. It appears that weight-bearing exercise (i.e., treadmill) results in smaller&#xD;
      increases in PTH and CTX compared to weight-supported exercise (i.e., stationary cycling).&#xD;
      This has never been tested using a within-subjects design, so it is unclear if these observed&#xD;
      differences are due to the mode of exercise, lab-to-lab differences, or other underlying&#xD;
      factors. To address this gap in knowledge, 30 Veterans (15 men, 15 women), aged 60+ years,&#xD;
      will complete two 1-hour acute exercise bouts: 1) brisk treadmill walking at 70-80% of&#xD;
      maximal heart rate; 2) vigorous stationary cycling at 70-80% maximal heart rate. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected to measure iCa, PTH, CTX and procollagen type I n-terminal&#xD;
      propeptide (P1NP) before, during, and after each exercise bout. The order of the exercise&#xD;
      bouts will be randomized and counter-balanced. The primary aim is to determine if mode of&#xD;
      exercise results in a differential bone biomarker response in older Veterans. This&#xD;
      information is essential for understanding how future exercise interventions should be&#xD;
      designed to benefit both cardiometabolic health and bone health. This is especially relevant&#xD;
      to Veteran health due to the high burden of both cardiometabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes,&#xD;
      heart disease) in the population, as well as evidence of increased osteoporotic fracture&#xD;
      risk. The proposed research is significant because it is addressing a knowledge gap that has&#xD;
      prevented the ability to design exercise and lifestyle interventions aimed at preserving&#xD;
      multiple components of Veteran health, which could have a lasting impact on Veteran quality&#xD;
      of life and functional independence. The proposed research is innovative because it is&#xD;
      testing a novel hypothesis, the mode of exercise on disruptions in calcium homeostasis, in a&#xD;
      population that could greatly benefit from the knowledge to be gained. While the proposed&#xD;
      research is an acute study, the results generated will be used to design future clinical&#xD;
      interventions for Veteran health. Long-term, information gained from this research will help&#xD;
      to define the optimal exercise prescription to improve cardiometabolic without compromising&#xD;
      bone health aging Veterans.&#xD;
