  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to investigate the dose-response relationship between load-induced muscle&#xD;
      activation (liMA) and load-induced glenohumeral translation (liTr) in patients with rotator&#xD;
      cuff tears and asymptomatic control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the study is to investigate the in vivo dose-response relationship between&#xD;
      additional weight and glenohumeral translation, to understand the biological variation in&#xD;
      liTr, the influence of disease pathology on the liTr, the potential compensation by muscle&#xD;
      activation and muscle size, and the influence of liTr on patient outcomes.&#xD;

      This project is to test the overall hypothesis that rotator cuff tear affects glenohumeral&#xD;
      translation and that this functional instability depends on additional load applied, on&#xD;
      anatomical and morphological variations, and on type and severity of the injury. The study is&#xD;
      to investigate the dose-response relationship between load-induced muscle activation (liMA)&#xD;
      and load-induced glenohumeral translation (liTr) in patients with rotator cuff tears and&#xD;
      asymptomatic control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the study is to investigate the in vivo dose-response relationship between&#xD;
      additional weight and glenohumeral translation, to understand the biological variation in&#xD;
      liTr, the influence of disease pathology on the liTr, the potential compensation by muscle&#xD;
      activation and muscle size, and the influence of liTr on patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study entails cross-sectional experimental multimodal (clinical, biomechanical,&#xD;
      radiological) data collection with multiple conditions and a control group.&#xD;

    <measure>Disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand (Quick DASH) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration for all questionnaires: 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>30-item questionnaire that looks at the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities. This questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire that patients can rate difficulty and interference with daily life on a 5 point Likert scale (1 being no difficulty, 5 being unable).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration for all questionnaires: 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function.</description>

    <description>The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) is a mixed outcome reporting measure, applicable for use in all patients with shoulder pathology regardless of their specific diagnosis. The ASES questionnaire is composed of both a physician-rated component and a patient-reported component. The patient questions focus on joint pain, instability, and activities of daily living. The pain and functional portions are summed to obtain the final ASES score with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>numerical pain rating scale (NRS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration for all questionnaires: 20 minutes)</time_frame>

    <measure>Glenohumeral translation from single plane fluoroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration for motion analysis: 50 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>the vertical distance of the glenohumeral joint centre (GHJC) and the radiopaque acromion marker will be measured.

    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration for motion analysis: 50 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The vertical distance of the GHJC to the acromion marker will be calculated for a neutral trial and with the arm in 30° shoulder abduction for each loading condition. Motion analysis (MA) based liTr will be calculated for each participant as the slope of the regression of the negative GHJC to acromion distance measurements on the load magnitude</description>

    <description>Subject's CSA will be measured on an anterior-posterior double-obliquity fluoroscopy image of the shoulder as the angle subtended by a line parallel to the glenoid and a line through the inferior-lateral edge of the glenoid and the inferior-lateral edge of the acromion. The CSA is reproducible and significantly greater in patients with rotator cuff tears than the general population. High angles (&gt;35°-38°) have been associated with rotator cuff tears and greater joint instability.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration for motion analysis: 50 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>GI will be measured on the fluoroscopy image as the angle between a line from the upper to the lower glenoid rim (glenoid plane) and a second line set on the floor of the supraspinous fossa. Abnormal GI might be associated with rotator cuff tears and superior humeral head migration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Greater tuberosity angle (GTA)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration for motion analysis: 50 minutes)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>at baseline (approximate duration: 40 minutes).</time_frame>
