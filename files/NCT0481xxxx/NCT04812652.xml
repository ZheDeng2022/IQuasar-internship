  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer disease in women. As the prevalence of fatigue is&#xD;
      high in this group it is motivated to find interventions that can reduce fatigue and render&#xD;
      in an increased level of physical activity both during and after treatment. Yoga have shown&#xD;
      effect on cancer related fatigue (CRF) and is a rehabilitation activity that is often&#xD;
      requested by breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients live in cites and small-towns as&#xD;
      well as in rural areas and therefore there is a need for accessible rehabilitation activities&#xD;
      for all patients despite place of residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A digitally distributed yoga class can potentially increase accessibility for those living in&#xD;
      rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a 10-weeks digitally&#xD;
      distributed yoga intervention for women treated for breastcancer, compared with a control&#xD;
      group receiving regular care, concerning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient reported outcomes, primary endpoint CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systemic inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  activity level&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate if there are differences during and after the intervention and if&#xD;
      those differences are sustained after 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives are to compare the two groups concerning completing oncologic&#xD;
      treatment, cost effectiveness, return to work and also to describe the patients experiences&#xD;
      of participating in a digitally distributed yoga class at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      If and how a digitally distributed yoga can influence cancer related fatigue, stress, health&#xD;
      related quality of life and level of physical activity compared to regular care? If and how a&#xD;
      digitally distributed yoga can have an effect on systemic inflammation? How is the&#xD;
      feasibility of digitally distributed yoga twice weekly at home? What is the breast cancer&#xD;
      patients' experience of participating in digitally distributed yoga clas?&#xD;

      Study design and Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled multi center study where the patients will be randomized to a&#xD;
      10-weeks internet based yoga intervention or regular care. Usual care includes standardized&#xD;
      information about the importance of physical activity in their personal care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four regions located in the middle of Sweden will constitute the participating study centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Adult women diagnosed with breast cancer, that have undergone breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery with curative intention without any signs of metastatic disease. They should&#xD;
      be Swedish speaking and literate. The patients will be informed about the study in connection&#xD;
      to surgery, and asked for participation at the first meeting with the oncologist about one&#xD;
      month after surgery. Informed written consent will be collected from all participants prior&#xD;
      to the entry into the study. The patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      point throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: If they received neoadjuvant treatment before surgery, have an advanced&#xD;
      recurrent disease, unstable cardiovascular disease, brain or bone metastasis or are unable to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires due to reduced physical or cognitive capacity. If they have any&#xD;
      physical condition that hinder participation in yoga or have an unstable medical condition&#xD;
      that might be aggravated by yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized after their first visit to the oncologist. In an web-based&#xD;
      digital portal, a digital randomization will be conducted. The stratified randomization will&#xD;
      be according to surgery, Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) versus mastectomy (ME), chemotherapy&#xD;
      versus no chemotherapy, radiation versus no radiation and hormonal treatment versus no&#xD;
      hormonal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the ambiguities in design found in previous studies, the yoga intervention is&#xD;
      designed according to Sherman's recommendations. The yoga postures and movements will be&#xD;
      chosen specifically to address this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of yoga: Physical yoga sequences that through scientific evaluation have proven to&#xD;
           be effective and relevant for the target group, ended by relaxation and time for&#xD;
           reflection. There are 3 different programs during the 10-week-intervention. Easy-access&#xD;
           sequences that can suit all (with modifications if needed), no progression but the&#xD;
           programs can offer a small variation of movements over the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose: twice weekly for 10 weeks; one yoga class live broadcasted and digitally&#xD;
           distributed to the patient's computer or mobile device, and one class pre-recorded video&#xD;
           for self-training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Components of yoga: The yoga class will follow a standardized program with yoga&#xD;
           sequences that is designed to increase calm, improve focus, acceptance and energy level&#xD;
           as well as reduce fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sequences: The yoga class will be 60 minutes including 10 minutes of final relaxation.&#xD;
           Thereafter, a 5 minutes reflection will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Modification: Modification of yoga movements will be offered by the instructors based on&#xD;
           the personal conditions of the participants. In the pre-recorded video the instructor&#xD;
           will give a number or alternatives when relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Selection of instructors: The yoga instructors have previous experience of teaching&#xD;
           yoga, ie is registered yoga teachers with 100 respectively 200-hour training. They will&#xD;
           attend a one-day course administered by the research team consisting of lectures and&#xD;
           seminars about cancer and cancer treatment, the aim and design of the study, theory, and&#xD;
           instructions regarding the yoga programs including modifications and technical aspects&#xD;
           regarding digital distribution of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Home Training: Instructions for yoga home practice will be standardized. The yoga&#xD;
           programs will be distributed in video-links for the participants to view at a time-point&#xD;
           that suits them during the week. The recommendation will be to yoga at home once a week&#xD;
           in addition to the digital yoga class in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Presence over time: Attendance will be noted through login data. Adherence to activity&#xD;
           will be calculated as the number of patients conducting 65% of the sessions, divided by&#xD;
           the total number of patients in the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical solution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are expected to use their own computer or mobile device. The streaming will be&#xD;
      arranged through Zoom® or other communication software. A portable audio and video device&#xD;
      (ConferenceCam Connect) will be offered that can be connected to the participant's own&#xD;
      computer, if Zoom or other communication tools are unstable. Written information as well as a&#xD;
      film showing how to connect will be sent to each participant. Equipment will be tested with&#xD;
      each participant before start. A telephone number for technical support will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technical solutions can be updated if the user-friendly approach needs improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All breast cancer patients receives written standardized information about the importance of&#xD;
      physical activity by their contact nurse or physiotherapist, when discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital accordingly to the routines at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the outcome fatigue. The target main effect size is&#xD;
      determined to be an improved fatigue score of 2 on a scale from 4 to 20. That is in&#xD;
      accordance with the clinical important difference. For two-sided test with α=0.05 and power&#xD;
      =80% to detect a factorial effect of 2 under the null hypothesis of no effect, 64 individuals&#xD;
      in each group are needed. In order to compensate for a potential 30% dropout, the sample size&#xD;
      will be increased with an additional 39 persons, giving a total sample size of 67 patients.&#xD;
      To detect interaction effects that is usually smaller than the main effect, the original&#xD;
      sample size was increased with 25% (~42 patients). This gives a total of 209 patients divided&#xD;
      into 2 arms; intervention and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected at baseline (one month after surgery) and 3, 6, 24 and 48 months after&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery. Self-reported data (questionnaires) are collected each time (5 times),&#xD;
      activity levels (accelerometer) at the first three follow-ups and at 12 months, blood samples&#xD;
      at the first three follow-ups, bodily measurements are made at baseline and after one year.&#xD;
      Diary of physical activity is reported in conjunction with the measurements with&#xD;
      accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health economic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health economic evaluation will be performed with a societal as well as a health care&#xD;
      perspective and consider time period from baseline to one year after the interventions had&#xD;
      ended. Cost effectiveness will be presented in costs per quality adjusted life years (QALY),&#xD;
      but also as a probability of cost-effectiveness compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main components in the analysis are extra costs of the interventions, changes in QALY and&#xD;
      savings of the interventions. Saving may be less time on sick leave (less production losses)&#xD;
      and less health care consumption. Complete costs of the interventions for the health care&#xD;
      provider and for patients will be measured. Further, QALY will be estimated using the&#xD;
      instrument EQ-5D-5L, time on sick leave will be collected in the questionnaire to&#xD;
      participants, and health care consumption will be retrieved from medical records.&#xD;
