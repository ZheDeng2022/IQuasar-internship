  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the side effects and possible benefits of operating on brain&#xD;
      tumors prior to the tumor coming back (recurrence). Understanding when surgery is most useful&#xD;
      to patients with brain tumors is important. Some patients may undergo chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiation but still have visible tumor remaining after treatment. The purpose of this&#xD;
      research is to compare outcomes of those who have surgery after chemotherapy or radiation,&#xD;
      but prior to tumor recurrence, to those who have surgery at a different time, or no surgery&#xD;
      at all.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of surgical resection for pre-recurrent brain&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether there are differences in overall survival for patients who receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive RT after surgery&#xD;
      or patients undergoing no further surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine for patients having pre-recurrent surgery whether there is a longer interval&#xD;
      to local/regional progression, any central nervous system (CNS) progression or need for&#xD;
      subsequent intracranial treatment compared to patients receiving post-operative RT, time to&#xD;
      each will be separately documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative fractionated&#xD;
      radiation for brain metastases (mets) whether there is a decreased rate of local recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative fractionated&#xD;
      radiation for brain mets whether there is a decreased rate of leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the genetic and molecular alterations occurring in radiated brain and&#xD;
      radiated tumor tissue compared to nonradiated tissue specimens (subjects will be matched to&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Neuro-Oncology Program Registry for the study of Nervous System&#xD;
      Tumors 12-003458).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the relative sensitivity of radiated human CNS tumors to senolytic or&#xD;
      other therapies in ex vivo assays targeting radiation-induced biology to promote synthetic&#xD;
      lethality using cryopreserved or fresh tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the availability and utility of candidate biomarkers reflective of tumor&#xD;
      burden and therapeutic susceptibility, from tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Patients self-reported outcomes may be obtained through the Neurosurgery Registry&#xD;
      program. As available, these data may be referenced as a screening tool for any impact on&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) associated with trial participation as compared to matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo surgery as indicated clinically when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of surgery, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months, and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
