  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus (PIEB) has become a standard technique for labour&#xD;
      analgesia in many departments of anesthesia. Advantages to the former standard of care,&#xD;
      continued epidural infusion (CEI), include reduced analgesic consumption , better maternal&#xD;
      satisfaction and less occurrence of motor block . At Mount Sinai Hospital, the introduction&#xD;
      of a bundle of changes in the management of labor analgesia including the use of PIEB, has&#xD;
      resulted in an improvement of the quality of labor analgesia. This bundle of changes included&#xD;
      labor catheter placement more often at L2/L3 interspace, more frequent use of fentanyl in the&#xD;
      epidural loading dose, the implementation of a PIEB regimen and an increase in hourly&#xD;
      baseline offer of local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent before-and-after study conducted by the investigators, comparing the current&#xD;
      practice with the previous practice, which was based on CEI, identified that the incidence of&#xD;
      women experiencing pain &gt;3 (scale 0-10) (40% vs 30%) and the number of nurse-administered&#xD;
      top-ups (24% vs 3%) were significantly reduced. However, despite that significant&#xD;
      improvement, some 30% of women undergoing epidural analgesia still experience pain NRS &gt;3&#xD;
      (NRS scale 0-10) during either first or second stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the health care team attempts to manage epidurals as standardized as possible, there&#xD;
      is some variation in practice resulting from the many stakeholders involved in the labor&#xD;
      analgesia management, including anesthesiologists, obstetricians, nurses and patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that our most recent results may be explained by the lack of&#xD;
      standardization of the management of epidural analgesia and that a standardized epidural&#xD;
      catheter placement and a management algorithm may improve the efficacy of our epidural&#xD;
      analgesia regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of the use of a&#xD;
      standardized algorithm for the management of labor epidural analgesia based on a PIEB&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score using verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) (0-10, where 0=no pain and 10=worst pain ever). This will be assessed hourly following epidural placement, as per institutional guidelines, until the patient delivers.&#xD;
The primary outcome of the study will be the presence of pain (NRS ≥ 3) at any time during the first and second stage of labor, after the establishment of an effective loading dose (pain NRS ≤ 1/10).</description>

    <measure>Upper sensory block level</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The upper sensory block level to ice is defined as the dermatome at which there is an altered cold perception without complete sensitivity loss. This will be assessed hourly following epidural placement, as per institutional guidelines, until the patient delivers.</description>

    <measure>Motor block score using Bromage score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Motor block will be assessed with the Bromage score: 0 = able to raise the extended leg; 1 = unable to raise the extended leg but able to flex knees; 2 = unable to flex knees, but able to flex ankle; 3 = unable to flex ankle. This will be assessed hourly following epidural placement, as per institutional guidelines, until the patient delivers.</description>
