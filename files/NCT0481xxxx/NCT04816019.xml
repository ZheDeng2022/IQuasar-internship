    <textblock>
      Open label, dose escalation study to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of one or two doses of intranasal ChAdOx1&#xD;
           nCOV-19, in vaccine naïve individuals, with randomisation between one and two dose&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of intranasal ChAdOx1 nCOV-19, given as a&#xD;
           booster dose in individuals who have had two intramuscular COVID-19 vaccinations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include up to 54 healthy adult participants, divided into five groups. Groups&#xD;
      1-3 will consist of vaccine-naïve volunteers and groups 4-5 will consist of volunteers who&#xD;
      have received 2 doses of IM COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1-3 will receive three vaccine dose levels (low i.e. 5x10^9vp, high i.e. 5x10^10 VP,&#xD;
      and moderate i.e. 2x10^10 VP ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 IN). The low and high dose groups will each have&#xD;
      safety lead-in subgroups. All volunteers will be consented for receipt of a booster vaccine&#xD;
      at approximately 4 weeks post first vaccine. All volunteers will be randomly allocated 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive an intranasal booster vaccine as indicated, stratified by first dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 will consist of volunteers who have received 2 intramuscular doses of ChAdOx1&#xD;
      nCoV-19, at least eight weeks apart, and group 5 will consist of volunteers who have received&#xD;
      2 intramuscular doses of BNT162b, at least three weeks apart. Both of these groups will&#xD;
      receive a single standard dose (5x1010vp) on intranasal ChAdOx1 nCOV-19.&#xD;
