  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STYLAGE® M Lidocaine is a hyaluronic acid injectable gel CE (conformité européenne)-marketed&#xD;
      since 2009 . It is indicated for the outline of the lips and/or for lips augmentation in lips&#xD;
      mucosa. It is also indicated to fill skin depressions on the face. Lidocaine is intended to&#xD;
      reduce the pain associated with the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of SMILE study is to demonstrate that STYLAGE® M Lidocaine is non-inferior to an&#xD;
      active comparator that has shown its effectiveness in lips' volume augmentation and&#xD;
      restoration in improving the aesthetic appearance of the lips evaluated by subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 92 healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years old, who expressed the wish for&#xD;
      augmentation or restoration of the volume of the lips and/or lips' outline redefinition,&#xD;
      confirmed by investigators at inclusion, who have given his/her informed consent and who met&#xD;
      all the eligibility criteria, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will randomly receive STYLAGE® M Lidocaïne or the active comparator (ratio 1:1)&#xD;
      injection in the lips at first visit on Day 0. At second visit, one month after Day 0, an&#xD;
      optional touch-up injection could be performed according to subject's and investigator's&#xD;
      opinions and if the subject is still eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a total of 6 visits over a 12 months follow-up period and a screening&#xD;
      visit prior to first injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of subjects having a global aesthetic improvement of their lips (blinded&#xD;
      self-evaluation), 3 months after treatment initiation will be assessed and compared between&#xD;
      the two groups. This will also be done during the other visits (1, 6, 9 and 12 months after&#xD;
      treatment initiation). Global aesthetic improvement according to blinded independent&#xD;
      evaluator, subjects' satisfaction, pain during injection and safety parameters will also be&#xD;
      assessed during the study period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double blinded, randomized, active controlled, multicenter study.&#xD;
      Subjects are randomly assigned to receive either STYLAGE® M Lidocaine or the active&#xD;
      comparator (ratio 1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety two subjects between 18 and 65 years old who expressed the wish for augmentation or&#xD;
      restoration of the volume of the lips and/or lips' outline redefinition, confirmed by&#xD;
      investigators at inclusion, who have given his/her informed consent and who met all the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria (especially according to the instructions for use of the devices), will&#xD;
      be include.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a screening visit for selection, each subject will be followed for 12 months after 1st&#xD;
      injection at Visit 1 (on Day 0). Five follow-up visits are scheduled 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      after initial injection (Visits 2 to 6). At 1 month (Visit 2), an optional touch-up injection&#xD;
      may be done (if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of STYLAGE® M Lidocaine versus the&#xD;
      active comparator in improving the aesthetic appearance of the lips. The comparison of&#xD;
      effectiveness between the devices will be done according to proportion of subjects having an&#xD;
      improvement on the 5-point Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) evaluated by the blinded&#xD;
      subject on the lips (after mirror self-examination), 3 months after treatment initiation&#xD;
      (V1). Improvement according to GAIS corresponds to one of these three categories: &quot;Very much&#xD;
      improved&quot;, &quot;Much improved&quot; or &quot;Improved&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include subjects' self-evaluation of their lips according to GAIS, at 1,&#xD;
      6, 9 and 12 months after treatment initiation. Global aesthetic improvement of the lips&#xD;
      according to blinded independent evaluator, subjects' satisfaction, subjects' self-evaluation&#xD;
      of pain during injection will also be measured and collected at each visit during the whole&#xD;
      study period. Study products tolerance will be assessed by collection of injection site&#xD;
      reactions after each injection session, and adverse events throughout the study.&#xD;

Live blinded independent evaluators will oversee the inclusions of subjects, the follow-up of subject's tolerance and the scoring in live of the GAIS (also using the photograph taken at V1 before first injection as a reference).

The FACE-Q© is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of outcomes of aesthetic facial procedures and products from the patient's perspective. The FACE-Q© &quot;satisfaction with lips&quot; is a scale that measures the appearance of the lips with items that ask about size, shape and fullness, as well as how their lips suit their face and how the lips look when smiling.&#xD;
For each of the 10 items, one of the following answer is selected: &quot;Very dissatisfied&quot;, &quot;Somewhat dissatisfied&quot;, &quot;Somewhat satisfied&quot;, &quot;Very satisfied&quot;.&#xD;
Patient responses to each item are graded on a four-point scale and then converted to a score on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A higher score means greater satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The first injection is performed at visit 1 (V1) on Day 0 (D0). D0 is considered as the baseline. The maximum volume to be injected is 2 mL in total for lower and upper lips. The exact volume per lip will be determined by the physician/injector in order to reach optimal volume correction and/or lips' redefinition, as well as the injection technique(s) to be used. Injection is done into and/or around the lip mucosa by linear threading injection, multipoint injection, or a combination of both techniques with needle or cannula.&#xD;
One optional touch-up injection is allowed at visit 2 (V2) on Month 1 (M1), with a maximum volume to be injected of 1 mL in total for lower and upper lips. No other touch-up injection is allowed until the end of the study.&#xD;
A total maximum volume of 2.5 mL is recommended for both initial and touch-up injections combined (upper and lower lips).</description>
