  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a topical bacteriophage therapy product (BACTELIDE) as an adjunct to&#xD;
      standard therapy for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers colonized with S.&#xD;
      aureus, P. aeruginosa, or K. pneumoniae species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the safety and efficacy of BACTELIDE in conjunction with standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC) versus a placebo in conjunction with standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central aim of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and indicative&#xD;
      efficacy of a single dose of a phage therapy combination product, BACTELIDE, as an adjunct to&#xD;
      standard therapy in participants presenting with a Stage II, III or IV pressure injuries with&#xD;
      positive wound cultures for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or K. pneumoniae at screening.&#xD;
