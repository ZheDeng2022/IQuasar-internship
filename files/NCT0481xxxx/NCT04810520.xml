  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been suggested as a useful tool in emergency&#xD;
      medicine for diagnosis and treatment of reversible causes. However, in prehospital setting&#xD;
      performing ultrasound and the translation of the findings can be challenging. As new&#xD;
      prehospital ultrasound devices offer the possibility for remote supervision, the impact of&#xD;
      tele-supervision on time to diagnosis of critically ill patients is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of tele-supervision on the time of&#xD;
      POCUS in prehospital critically ill patients by air rescue physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In total 100 critically ill patients suffering from acute dyspnoea, circulatory&#xD;
      failure or trauma, which are treated by air rescue physicians will be included in this study.&#xD;
      Duration of ultrasound performance as well as altered treatment strategies will be analyzed.&#xD;

        100 critically ill patients with acute dyspnoea, circulatory failure or trauma, will be&#xD;
        included in this study. In 50 patients POCUS with tele-supervision and in 50 patients POCUS&#xD;
        without tele-supervision will be performed. Tele-supervision is available in 50% of the&#xD;
        time. Allocation to one of the two groups depends on the availability of tele-supervision.&#xD;
