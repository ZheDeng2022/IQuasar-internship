      The aim of this study is to assess the liver and renal functions of individuals who are&#xD;
      occupationally exposed to petroleum products.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Certain peoples have a greater risk of exposure to gasoline vapors; these include&#xD;
      filling-station workers, service station attendants, drivers of gasoline trucks and refinery&#xD;
      workers.Benzene is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 to benzene oxide.&#xD;
      The metabolites undergo further metabolism through oxidation, dehydrogenation or conjugation&#xD;
      with sulfate or glucuronic acid . Activation of benzene and its reactive metabolites leads to&#xD;
      continuous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to lipid peroxidation and&#xD;
      damages DNA, RNA, leading to genetic modification and alterations in the functions of&#xD;
      important enzymes (i.e. liver) and proteins .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volatile organic compounds such as gasoline and other fuels are associated with a wide&#xD;
      variety of deleterious health effects including liver and kidney diseases. A comparative&#xD;
      cross sectional study was conducted from January 2018 to April 2018 at Mekelle city, Tigray&#xD;
      region, Northern Ethiopia among gasoline station workers and reporting that the mean level of&#xD;
      ALT, AST, Urea, creatinine, and uric acid was significantly higher among gasoline stations&#xD;
      workers when compared to control study participants and there was also a significant increase&#xD;
      in ALT, AST, Urea, creatinine and uric acid among gasoline stations with increase duration of&#xD;
      exposure .&#xD;
