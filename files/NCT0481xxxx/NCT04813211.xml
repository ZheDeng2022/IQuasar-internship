      The research team designed an artificial cervical joint prosthesis suitable for subtotal&#xD;
      resection of the lower cervical vertebral body. Previous studies regarding cadaver and animal&#xD;
      experiments have found that this artificial joint not only retains the normal range of&#xD;
      physiological motion of the joint, but also has good stability. Preliminary studies have&#xD;
      shown that the designed joints are sufficiently safe and stable. The titanium materials for&#xD;
      joints have been verified for their toxicology in long-term clinical trials and have been&#xD;
      monitored under relevant national testing agencies in China.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Artificial cervical disc technology has achieved certain clinical effects in the treatment of&#xD;
      single-segment lesions of the lower cervical spine. However, simple artificial cervical disc&#xD;
      replacement is only applicable for single-segment disc herniation, but not for two adjacent&#xD;
      cervical segmental lesions, concurrent with vertebral hyperplasia and ossification of the&#xD;
      posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical spine. Traditional vertebral corpectomy and&#xD;
      bone graft fusion can reduce the mobility of the cervical spine. Therefore, non-fusion&#xD;
      fixation for such diseases has been a key issue to improve the efficacy of surgical&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the research team designed an artificial cervical joint prosthesis suitable for&#xD;
      subtotal resection of the lower cervical vertebral body. Previous studies regarding cadaver&#xD;
      and animal experiments have found that this artificial joint not only retains the normal&#xD;
      range of physiological motion of the joint, but also has good stability. Preliminary studies&#xD;
      have shown that the designed joints are sufficiently safe and stable. The titanium materials&#xD;
      for joints have been verified for their toxicology in long-term clinical trials and have been&#xD;
      monitored under relevant national testing agencies in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To serve clinical patients faster and ensure that the trial design is safe, this study is&#xD;
      designed to observe the effectiveness and safety of mobile artificial cervical vertebrae&#xD;
      replacement for patients with cervical spondylosis.&#xD;

    <measure>Cervical joint range of motion at 6 months after operation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Testing methods for cervical joint mobility include: Cervical joint range of motion in all directions will be accurately obtained through an in vitro infrared measurement after artificial joint replacement (joint range in °).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical fusion rate at 3 to 6 months after operation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 6 months after operation</time_frame>
    <description>A successful fusion is assessed according to Brantigan and Steffee's imaging rating scale:&#xD;
Suspicious bone fusion: bone bridge formation in the entire fusion area with a density at least similar to postoperative data, and no light-transmitting band between the grafted bone and the vertebral body; Strong fusion: the fused bone in the fusion area is more mature and dense as shown on postoperative images. A sclerosis zone between the grafted bone and the vertebral body indicates the fusion, but there is no interface between the grafted bone and the vertebral body, and the mature bone trabecula forms a bone bridge. The bone spurs on the anterior side of the vertebral body will be absorbed, and the bone graft in the intervertebral space will move forward until the facet joints are fused. Fusion rate = (number of successfully fused patients/total number of patients) × 100% (Fusion rate in percentage).</description>

    <description>Position: The patient is in a supine position with the neck hyperextended, ensuring his/her neck and shoulders in a stable and neutral position before surgery and the cervical spine in a &quot;physiological&quot; curvature position.&#xD;
Anesthesia: General anesthesia via oral tracheal intubation.&#xD;
Surgical approach: Anterior cervical spine approach through the space between the visceral sheath and the vascular sheath.&#xD;
Surgical method: Two intervertebral discs with adjacent lesions and part of the vertebral body between them will be removed. A curette is used to carefully strike off the annulus fibrosus and cartilage on the surface of the adjacent upper and lower endplates. Intraoperatively, the midlines of the segment and the vertebra to be replaced should be mapped out. When decompression, the midline for decompression should not be deviated from the planned midlines.</description>
