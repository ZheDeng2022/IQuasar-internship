    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) is the standard treatment modality in locally&#xD;
      advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and patients achieving complete response to treatment (CR)&#xD;
      usually have a better prognosis in terms of local control (LC), metastases-free survival&#xD;
      (MFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an early tumour regression index (ERITCP) was introduced, to predict pathological&#xD;
      CR (pCR) after nCRT in LARC patients. In particular, the authors found that the patients with&#xD;
      ERITCP &lt;13.1 show a strong response during therapy and have a lower probability to experience&#xD;
      distant relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the impact of dose escalation in rectal cancer,&#xD;
      identifying the poor responder cases using the ERI index during the course of radiotherapy&#xD;
      and increasing the prescribed dose in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adopting this boosting protocol, an increase of 10% of CR (clinical and pathological) rate is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients enrolled in the trial, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) will be administered using the&#xD;
      MRI guided Radiotherapy (MRgRT) machine available in our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ERI will be inferior than 13.1 the patient will continue the original treatment. Patients&#xD;
      with complete clinical response will go through wait and see approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ERI will be higher than 13.1 the treatment plan will be reoptimized considering the&#xD;
      residual tumor at fraction 10 as new therapy volume, where the dose will be intensified to&#xD;
      reach 60.1 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of cases to be enrolled will be 63. The primary endpoints will be complete&#xD;
      response considered as: ypT0N0 in case of Total Mesorectal Excision (TME), ypT0ycN0 in case&#xD;
      of LE, ycT0N0 in case of WW; prospective validation of delta radiomics MR-guide Radiotherapy&#xD;
      model.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) is the standard treatment modality in locally&#xD;
      advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and patients achieving complete response to treatment (CR)&#xD;
      usually have a better prognosis in terms of local control (LC), metastases-free survival&#xD;
      (MFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since response to radiotherapy is dose dependent in rectal cancer, dose escalation may lead&#xD;
      to higher complete response rates. The possibility to predict patients who will achieve CR&#xD;
      before surgery or during nCRT is of crucial importance. Recently, an early tumour regression&#xD;
      index (ERITCP) was introduced, to predict pathological CR (pCR) after nCRT in LARC patients.&#xD;
      In particular, the authors found that the patients with ERITCP &lt;13.1 show a strong response&#xD;
      during therapy and have a lower probability to experience distant relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the impact of dose escalation in rectal cancer,&#xD;
      identifying the poor responder cases using the ERI index during the course of radiotherapy&#xD;
      and increasing the prescribed dose in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adopting this boosting protocol, an increase of 10% of CR (clinical and pathological) rate is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients enrolled in the trial, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) will be administered using the&#xD;
      MRI guided Radiotherapy (MRgRT) machine available in our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial radiotherapy treatment will consist in delivering 55 Gy in 25 fractions on Gross&#xD;
      Tumor Volume (GTV) plus the corresponding mesorectum of 45Gy in 25 fractions on the whole&#xD;
      pelvis. Chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) or oral capecitabine will be administered&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 0.35 Tesla Magnetic Resonance image will be acquired at simulation and every day during&#xD;
      MRgRT. At fraction 10, ERI will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ERI will be inferior than 13.1 the patient will continue the original treatment. Patients&#xD;
      with complete clinical response will go through wait and see approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ERI will be higher than 13.1 the treatment plan will be reoptimized considering the&#xD;
      residual tumor at fraction 10 as new therapy volume, where the dose will be intensified to&#xD;
      reach 60.1 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of CRT, the clinical response will be evaluated 8-10 weeks using high tesla MR&#xD;
      and CT images or FDGPET-CT image 8-10 weeks after the end of nCRT. Surgery will be performed&#xD;
      12-16 weeks after the end of the CRT in case of partial or stable or progression disease,&#xD;
      while in case of major or complete clinical response at restaging imaging, a Watch and Wait&#xD;
      (W&amp;W) or local excision (LE) approach should be followed. Late toxicity and quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) will be scored at first follow-up (FUP) and at 1 and 2 years of FUP according to Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 scale, functional scales and QoL&#xD;
      questionnaires (LARS and SEXUAL questionnaires, at the start of treatment, after surgery and&#xD;
      at 1 and 2 years of FUP), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of cases to be enrolled will be 63: all the patients will be treated at Fondazione&#xD;
      Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. All the cases will be discussed in weekly&#xD;
      multidisciplinary tumor board to share the best therapeutic options, both at the diagnosis&#xD;
      and at presurgical restaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The primary endpoints will be complete response considered as: ypT0N0 in case of Total&#xD;
      Mesorectal Excision (TME), ypT0ycN0 in case of LE, ycT0N0 in case of WW; prospective&#xD;
      validation of delta radiomics MR-guide Radiotherapy model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will be:3 years LC, MFS, Disease Free Survival (DFS), OS; R0&#xD;
      resection rate; Tumor Regression Grade (TRG) 1, TRG 2, Neoadjuvant Rectal (NAR) score;&#xD;
      Sphincter preservation rate; Organ preservation rate; Rectal and sexual functions.&#xD;
