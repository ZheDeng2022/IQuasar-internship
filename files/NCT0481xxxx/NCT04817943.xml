  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When using a breathing circuit with heated wire humidifier, investigators will check if the&#xD;
      temperature measured by the thermometer of the endotracheal tube is more than 0.25 degrees&#xD;
      apart from the temperature measured by the esophageal thermometer. Through this, in the case&#xD;
      of patients who need to use a breathing circuit with heated wire humidifier, investigators&#xD;
      will find out whether it is appropriate to use an esophageal or endotracheal thermometer.&#xD;

    <description>When the patient enters the operating room, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram are monitored, and general anesthesia is induced using 1-2 mg/kg of 1% propofol. 0.8 mg/kg of rocuronium, a neuromuscular blocker, is injected intravenously, and a human endotracheal tube is intubated. A thermometer is attached to the inside of the double-layered endotracheal tube cuff, which measures the temperature in the trachea. After the endotracheal intubation is performed, the esophageal thermometer is inserted, and from this point, the temperature measured by the esophageal thermometer and the thermometer of the endotracheal tube are recorded. The temperature immediately after insertion of the esophageal thermometer is set as Tbaseline, and the temperature of the esophagus and trachea, the temperature of the operating room, and the temperature of breathing circuit with heated wire humidifier are recorded every 5 minutes from thereafter until the end of the operation.</description>
