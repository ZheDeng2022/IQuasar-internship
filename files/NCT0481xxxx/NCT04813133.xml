    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder which influence about 8.3% of adult population&#xD;
      and is the fifth major cause of death globally. In Pakistan, prevalence of type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      16.98% according to recent survey held in 2019. DM is classified into type 1 and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, there is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion due to an&#xD;
      autoimmune pathologic process occurring in beta islets of pancreas. While Type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      characterized by a combination of insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion with&#xD;
      resultant hyperglycemia leading to micro and macrovascular complications. Macrovascular&#xD;
      complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease. Amongst&#xD;
      microvascular complications, Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common&#xD;
      complication in both developed and developing countries. DPN is a symmetrical,&#xD;
      length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy which is attributed to metabolic and micro&#xD;
      vessel alterations due to hyperglycemia and concomitant cardiovascular risk covariates. Major&#xD;
      risk factors for development of DPN include duration of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and age,&#xD;
      followed by prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. DPN can engender&#xD;
      disablement in touch sensation, vibration sense, lower limb proprioception, and kinesthesia&#xD;
      thus contributing to impaired balance, altered gait with increased risk of falling. DPN&#xD;
      occurs in more than 50% of people with type 2 diabetes. It is a salient risk factor for skin&#xD;
      breakdown, amputation, and reduced physical mobility consequently lowering the quality of&#xD;
      life Management of DPN is multifaceted and includes efforts to alter the natural history&#xD;
      (lifestyle changes) and symptomatic treatments through pharmacological interventions. Daily&#xD;
      habits and actions exert an enormous influence on short-term and long-term health and quality&#xD;
      of life. Importance of dietary modification is enhanced if it is synchronized with the&#xD;
      circadian rhythm of the body. Therefore, Synchronized Lifestyle modification program is a&#xD;
      personalized, homeostasis restoring, liver centric lifestyle modification program that works&#xD;
      through the correction of body clock rhythm. Lifestyle medicine comprises of cluster of&#xD;
      positive lifestyle practices including maintenance of a healthy body weight, regular physical&#xD;
      activity, cessation of cigarette smoking, stress reduction as well following a few&#xD;
      nutritional practices such as increasing whole grains and consuming more fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables. Lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, slow the progression of&#xD;
      neuropathy by promoting small nerve fiber regeneration. Dietary modifications include intake&#xD;
      of nutrient, such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, low-fat dairy, lean meats,&#xD;
      nuts, and seeds. These foods help to maintain body weight, attain individualized glycemic,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and lipid goals and prevent complications of diabetes. Exercise improves&#xD;
      three of the biggest risk factors for diabetic neuropathy including insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      glucose control, obesity, and dyslipidemia. These exercises include aerobic exercise that&#xD;
      improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in diabetics. Strength training exercise&#xD;
      improves postural sway during standing, and gait characteristics during level-ground walking.&#xD;
      While the flexibility exercise are suggested for refining distal joint mobility and plantar&#xD;
      pressure distribution during gait. Thus, Exercise is known to enhance multiple metabolic&#xD;
      factors that may affect nerve health and microvascular function, which may indirectly protect&#xD;
      against peripheral nerve damage.&#xD;
