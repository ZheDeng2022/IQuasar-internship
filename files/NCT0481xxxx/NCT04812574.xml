      The investigators aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of periurethral hypertonic&#xD;
      saline (10% NaCl) injection for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and&#xD;
      stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) in women.&#xD;

      This single-center prospective pre-post interventional study was conducted between January&#xD;
      2014 and April 2018 with 65 women (44 SUI, 21 MUI). Quality of life was evaluated with the&#xD;
      Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (I-QoL) and the lower urinary tract symptoms of women were&#xD;
      evaluated with the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Female Lower&#xD;
      Urinary Tract Symptoms Modules (ICIQ-FLUTS). Incontinence status was assessed via the Stamey&#xD;
      Incontinence Grade scale. Patients with MUI also were evaluated using the Urinary Distress&#xD;
      Inventory-6 (UDI-6). The need for additional treatment (re-injection, other surgical&#xD;
      approaches, etc.) was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were followed up to 24 months after intervention. All outcomes of interest and&#xD;
      complications were evaluated/recorded at six preplanned visits (postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th,&#xD;
      12th, 18th, 24th months).&#xD;

    <description>Patients were in the lithotomy position for the procedure. After preparation, topical Lidocaine gel was instilled around the meatus and a 16 F probe was attached. The catheter balloon was inflated to localize the bladder neck and to ensure that injections were performed in the correct anatomical plane. Hypertonic saline (10% NaCl) was injected to the alignment of the urethral meatus in the order of 3-6-9-12 hours of the clock (5 cc to each site, totaling 20 cc). Syringes with 27 Gauge (0.40 mm) outer diameter were used to ensure controlled injection. Since the female urethra is about 4 cm in length, the needle was advanced about 3 cm. Due to the possibility of significant pain with hypertonic saline, 2 cc of Lidocaine hydrochloride was added into the solution.</description>
