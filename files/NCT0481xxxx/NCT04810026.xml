      The purpose of this research is to understand the impact of medically tailored meals on&#xD;
      health-related biometrics (e.g., glucose time-in-range, waist-hip ratio, cholesterol) and how&#xD;
      providing medically tailored meals promotes engagement in diabetes education and drives&#xD;
      information-seeking behavior.&#xD;

      medically tailored meals promotes engagement in diabetes education and drives&#xD;
      information-seeking behavior. Secondary purposes are to characterize the relationship between&#xD;
      information-seeking behaviors and glycemic control; to characterize the relationship between&#xD;
      psychometric survey results and program engagement, biometrics, and information-seeking&#xD;
      behaviors; and to understand how meal provision and materials influence program satisfaction&#xD;
      and adherence to healthy diabetes-related behaviors.&#xD;
