  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 dosing&#xD;
      regimens of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy during the open-label treatment&#xD;
      period (OLTP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on the following parameters of&#xD;
           intravascular hemolysis: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) control, breakthrough hemolysis,&#xD;
           and inhibition of total complement hemolysis activity (CH50)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on hemoglobin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on red blood cell (RBC) transfusion&#xD;
           requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on clinical outcome assessments&#xD;
           (COAs) measuring fatigue and health related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the concentrations of total pozelimab in serum and total complement component&#xD;
           (C) 5 and cemdisiran in plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess immunogenicity to pozelimab and cemdisiran&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of pozelimab and cemdisiran in an optional&#xD;
           open-label extension period (OLEP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety after treatment intensification with pozelimab and cemdisiran&#xD;
