  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with history of tumor response insufficient to allow complete cytoreductive surgery&#xD;
      after three cycles of previous neoadjuvant systemic carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy will&#xD;
      be prospectively recruited in this trial. After signed consent and if unresectability is&#xD;
      confirmed, patients will undergo three cycles of doxorubicin-cisplatin PIPAC chemotherapy&#xD;
      associated with systemic carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy (alternating PIPAC and&#xD;
      intravenous chemotherapy sessions over 3 cycles of 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cycle 1, limiting dose toxicity must be collected in real time. Each patients will be&#xD;
      treated at the dose recommended by the CRM (Continual Reassessment Method ) algorithm&#xD;
      conditional on dose-limiting toxicity during Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation will be guided by CRM to determine the recommended dose of PIPAC&#xD;
      chemotherapy for phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the anatomopathological response, the radiologic tumoral response and the&#xD;
           evolution of the peritoneal cancer extent, to the combined chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to describe the pharmacokinetic of the PIPAC chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the KELIM parameter as a predictive marker in the response sensitivity of&#xD;
           the combined chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and to evaluate the safety of the combined chemotherapy. During the first day of the&#xD;
           first cycle, blood samples will be collected to measure doxorubicin and cisplatin&#xD;
           (pharmacokinetic study). Along these 3 cycles, the dose of antigen CA-125 will be&#xD;
           performed before each chemotherapies (intraperitoneal or intravenous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of combined chemotherapy treatment, patients will undergo radiologic tumoral&#xD;
      response by imaging assessment (scanner or MRI) and a last dosage of CA-125 will be&#xD;
      realized..&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a complete / partial response / stabilization (RECIST criteria v.1.) on the&#xD;
      imaging, re-evaluation for resectability will be done. If resectable disease, cytoreductive&#xD;
      surgery will be programmed and a post-operative visit 1 month later will be realized.&#xD;
      Otherwise for patients with progress disease or unresectable the participation in the study&#xD;
      will be finished.&#xD;

    <description>Dose-limiting toxicities will be defined as any of the following events observed during the first cycle of treatment and judged by the investigator to be possibly related to the treatment, based on the classification of the National Cancer Institute Common Criteria for Adverse Events Terminology (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0 :&#xD;

Neutropenia of grade ≥ 3 (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 /mm3 (or 1 109/L)) and temperature ≥ 38.5°C ;&#xD;
Thrombocytopenia grade 4 (&lt;25,000/mm3 platelets (or 25 109/L)) or grade 3 (&lt; 50,000/mm3 (or 50 109/L)) associated with bleeding ;&#xD;

Complete cytoreduction refers to a CC-0 or CC-1 score whereas a CC-2 or 3 score is classified as incomplete ; CC-0 score indicates no evidence of macroscopic disease after cytoreduction, a CC-1 score indicates persisting microscopic disease (tumour nodules are &lt; 2.5 mm), a CC-2 score indicates persisting macroscopic disease (residual tumour nodules between 2.5 mm and 2.5 cm) and finally a CC-3 score indicates tumour nodules &gt; 2.5 cm or a confluence of unresected tumour.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo 3 cycles of combined chemotherapy, consisting of PIPAC (cisplatin-doxorubicin, escalating doses) and systemic chemotherapy (paclitaxel-carboplatine, standard doses). First patient will be treated at the lowest dose: doxorubicin 2.1 mg/m² and cisplatin 10.5 mg/m². Subsequent patients will be treated at the dose recommended by the CRM algorithm in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 6 dose levels with a factor between 1 and 3 are considered. The maximum dose considered will be doxorubicin, 6.3 mg/m² and cisplatin, 31.5 mg/m². The doses of intravenous chemotherapy will be defined in a standard way, according to the habits of the investigating clinicians and in accordance with the doses received previously. Each cycle will last 28 days and will begin at day 1 with PIPAC procedure and will be completed at day 8 with systemic chemotherapy. Combined chemotherapy will be repeated every 4 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.</description>
