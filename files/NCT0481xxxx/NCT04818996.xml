    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of the Mediterranean diet on body&#xD;
      composition, oxidant stress and proinflammatory markers in overweight and obese breast cancer&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in both developed and developing&#xD;
      countries and is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Breast cancer is a&#xD;
      disease that can develop and progress for various reasons. In addition to unchangeable&#xD;
      factors such as increasing age and genotype, modifiable factors such as smoking, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, lack of physical activity, malnutrition, and obesity play a role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer risk increases with increasing body mass index (BMI) in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation in obesity is associated with an increase in the release of&#xD;
      proinflammatory factors (such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6). This situation; It is a risk factor for&#xD;
      many types of cancer such as colon, stomach, breast and prostate carcinomas and supports a&#xD;
      cause-effect relationship between obesity and cancer. These proinflammatory factors act as&#xD;
      signal converters for tumor growth and progression. Obese women have elevated levels of TNF-α&#xD;
      and IL-6 in the circulation, and this is associated with the development and progression of&#xD;
      breast tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mediterranean Diet, which consists of high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids,&#xD;
      fruits, vegetables and whole grains, has been widely evaluated and indicated as an important&#xD;
      factor in preventing tumor formation from inflammatory pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss improves the antitumor immune system, lowers estrogen levels, reduces the risk of&#xD;
      breast cancer and has been associated with better outcomes in obese patients. Lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention studies strongly suggest that weight loss is possible and observational studies&#xD;
      can actually improve breast cancer survival.In this regard, a healthy lifestyle and diet are&#xD;
      the first steps to prevent breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>While calculating the energy of the Mediterranean diet applied to the individuals participating in the study, Mifflin-St. Jeor equation is used. The macronutrient composition of the Mediterranean diet was calculated as 36-40% fat, 40-45% carbohydrate and 15-20% protein. This diet is enriched with natural foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grain foods, fish, olive oil and oilseeds such as walnuts and almonds).&#xD;
In addition, anthropometric measurements and body composition analysis of the participants were performed both at the beginning and at the end of the study, and some biochemical parameters (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, MDA, TAS, TOS and routine blood parameters) were evaluated.</description>
