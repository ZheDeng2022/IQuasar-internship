    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability to understand the requirements of the trial and provide written informed&#xD;
             consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related health&#xD;
             information), willing and able to comply with the trial protocol procedures (including&#xD;
             attending the required trial visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants enrolled in the ARGX-113-2004 trial who completed the 24-week trial&#xD;
             period. Note: If a participant has had an SAE during the ARGX-113-2004 trial, his/her&#xD;
             eligibility should be evaluated by the investigator and the sponsor's trial physician.&#xD;
             The decision of enrolling the participant will be evaluated case by case.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women of childbearing potential: • As defined in Woman of Childbearing Potential in&#xD;
             the protocol, women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test at baseline before trial medication can be administered • Must be on a stable&#xD;
             regimen for at least 1 month of a highly effective or acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception during the trial and for 90 days after the last administration of&#xD;
             efgartigimod PH20 SC&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-sterilized male participants who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception, ie, a condom&#xD;
             from signing the informed consent form (ICF) until the end of the trial. Male&#xD;
             participants are not allowed to donate sperm from signing the ICF until the end of the&#xD;
             trial. In addition to the above criteria, for participants who want to continue&#xD;
             receiving efgartigimod during an additional 52-week treatment period (only applicable&#xD;
             in case efgartigimod is not yet commercially available for patients with primary ITP&#xD;
             or available through another patient program for patients with primary ITP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to understand the requirements of the additional 52-week treatment period of&#xD;
             the trial, to provide written informed consent (including consent for the use and&#xD;
             disclosure of research-related health information), and to comply with the trial&#xD;
             protocol procedures (including required trial visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant has completed a 52-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Introduction or continuation of nonpermitted medications during the ARGX-113-2004&#xD;
             trial (such as anti-CD20 therapy, romiplostim, monoclonal antibodies, Fc fusion&#xD;
             proteins, or live/live-attenuated vaccines)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of any other investigational drug or participation in any other investigational&#xD;
             trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known hypersensitivity reaction to efgartigimod PH20 SC or any of its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant or lactating females and those who intend to become pregnant during the trial&#xD;
             or within 90 days after last dose of efgartigimod PH20 SC&#xD;
