    <textblock>
      A total of 68 women with pSS and 135 healthy female patients were included in the study. All&#xD;
      women in the study and control groups were evaluated gynecologically, and genital findings&#xD;
      during the examination and variables related to pSS were recorded. Women's sexual functions&#xD;
      were evaluated with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and quality of life was evaluated&#xD;
      using the Health Status Questionnaire-Short Form 36.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-center, cross-sectional case control study will include a total of&#xD;
      68 women with pSS who presented to the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary care&#xD;
      hospital and 135 healthy females who presented to the gynecology outpatient clinic for&#xD;
      reasons other than sexual dysfunction and had similar age and menopausal status to the pSS&#xD;
      group. The diagnosis of pSS was made according to the American-European Consensus Group&#xD;
      criteria. Age, gravity, parity, body mass index (BMI), education status, smoking status,&#xD;
      menarche age, and menopausal status and duration will be recorded for all participants.&#xD;
      Disease duration, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),&#xD;
      anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positivity, extractable nuclear antigen antibodies panel,&#xD;
      extraglandular involvement and salivary gland pathologies were recorded. Disease-related&#xD;
      variables (activity and function data, etc.), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)&#xD;
      Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity&#xD;
      Index (ESSDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28),&#xD;
      Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Visual Analog Scale-Pain (VAS-Pain) and fatigue scores&#xD;
      and medicines used for pSS will be evaluated and recorded only in the pSS group. A&#xD;
      gynecological examination will be performed in the lithotomy position in all participants in&#xD;
      both groups by the same gynecologist with at least 15 years of professional experience. In&#xD;
      order to determine vaginal atrophy, shrinkage and thinning of the mucosa, loss of rugae in&#xD;
      the vagina and introitus stenosis are taken into consideration. The reduction of subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat in the labia majora is evaluated as labial atrophy, and contraction in size and even&#xD;
      retraction of the clitoral prepuce is interpreted as clitoral atrophy. Pain sensation on&#xD;
      speculum examination will be assessed by VAS (rated from 0 to 10). Vaginal culture and&#xD;
      cervico-vaginal smear will be analyzed, and the findings will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women aged over 20 and under 70 years will be included in the study. Pregnant patients and&#xD;
      those with known hepatic, renal, interstitial lung, gynecological oncological diseases,&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, and communication impairment will be excluded from the study. The&#xD;
      Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Health Status Questionnaire [Short Form (SF)-36], and&#xD;
      Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS) will be administered to the women in both&#xD;
      groups, and their scores were recorded. The data obtained from the study and control groups&#xD;
      will be compared. The patients in the pSS group and healthy controls will be further divided&#xD;
      into two subgroups according to their menopause status, and statistical comparisons will also&#xD;
      be undertaken between these subgroups. A multivariate linear regression analysis will be&#xD;
      performed, and the correlation of sexual function with other parameters is examined.&#xD;
