  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of the monoclonal bispecific trifunctional antibody Catumaxomab in patients with non-muscle&#xD;
      invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present Phase I dose escalation study (CATUNIBLA) in patients with non-muscle invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer (NMIBC) of high and intermediate risk for progression aims at investigating&#xD;
      the therapeutic potential of Catumaxomab applied as intravesical instillation. Catumaxomab is&#xD;
      an intact trifunctional bispecific monoclonal antibody and has the molecular targets EpCAM&#xD;
      and CD3. It mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against human epithelial tumor&#xD;
      cells including bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts: Part I is dose finding and will investigate 3 sequential&#xD;
      cohorts consisting of 3 patients to be enrolled at the specified dose levels. After&#xD;
      determination of the dose for Part II an additional number (n=X) of patients will be included&#xD;
      at this dose level. Part I and part II have a screening period, 6 week treatment phase and a&#xD;
      follow-up phase.&#xD;
