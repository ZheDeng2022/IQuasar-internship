  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of riluzole after&#xD;
      replicate single dose of the novel orodispersible film test formulation and of the marketed&#xD;
      reference Rilutek® tablets and to evaluate their bioequivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will receive single oral doses of 50 mg of riluzole, as test orodispersible film&#xD;
      and reference film-coated tablets under fasting conditions, in each of 4 subsequent periods&#xD;
      separated by wash-out intervals of at least 7 days between consecutive administrations,&#xD;
      according to a 2-treatment, 4-period, replicate cross-over design.&#xD;
