  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular obstruction is the severe complication of percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Microvascular obstruction after PCI is often&#xD;
      association with poor prognosis. Current treatments do not show improvement in prognosis of&#xD;
      microvascular obstruction. Suxiao Jiuxin Pills (SXJX) was shown associated with a reduction&#xD;
      in MACE, and an improvement of heart function and quality of life in acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      (ACS) patients with early PCI. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SXJX in&#xD;
      microvascular obstruction after PCI, the investigators designed this study.&#xD;
