  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VIT-2763&#xD;
      for the treatment of sickle cell disease. It is a randomised, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group trial including a 4 week initial treatment period (Part&#xD;
      A), followed by an additional 4-week period (Part B) with either maintenance of the dose&#xD;
      level or a dose step-up. The study also includes a 4-week follow-up period after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At randomisation/baseline (Part A), subjects are randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio into 4 VIT&#xD;
      2763 dose groups to receive either 30 mg (Cohorts 1a and 1b) or 60 mg VIT-2763 (Cohorts 2a&#xD;
      and 2b) and 1 placebo group (Cohort 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part B, subjects in Cohort 1a (VIT-2763 30 mg) and Cohort 2a (VIT-2763 60 mg) remain&#xD;
      on the same VIT-2763 dose as in Part A; whereas, subjects in Cohort 1b and Cohort 2b continue&#xD;
      with an increased dose of VIT-2763, 60 mg and 120 mg, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomised to placebo during Part A (Cohort 3) continue unchanged during Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to explore the effect of VIT-2763 on markers of&#xD;
      haemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main exploratory objective is to explore the safety and tolerability of VIT-2763.&#xD;
