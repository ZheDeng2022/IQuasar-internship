  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training, delivered in a community-based setting, for improving cognitive function in&#xD;
      post-menopausal Breast Cancer Survivors (BCS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: This study will compare changes in cognitive function and brain health in&#xD;
      post-menopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS) randomized to either: 1) a community-based&#xD;
      aerobic exercise program; or 2) a health education program (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Gather information on the intervention's potential for scalability using the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible BCS (N=160) will be randomized to one of the following 6-month programs: Aerobic&#xD;
      Exercise Training (n=80; progressive moderate-intensity exercise delivered by community&#xD;
      fitness center personal trainers) or Health Education (n=80; attention control receiving&#xD;
      cancer support and education). To assess Aim 1, participants will complete measures at&#xD;
      baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (Month 6), and follow-up (Month 12; i.e., 6 months&#xD;
      after post-intervention). Aim 1 measures include: neurocognitive tasks, functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI; M0 and M6 only), graded exercise testing, physical activity&#xD;
      monitoring (i.e., accelerometry), and questionnaires. To assess Aim 2, outcomes defined by&#xD;
      the RE-AIM framework (a dissemination and implementation framework) will be measured,&#xD;
      including: study reach(e.g., participation rate), intervention effectiveness (i.e., Aim 1),&#xD;
      intervention adoption (e.g.,number of community sites invited that participate),&#xD;
      implementation (e.g., fidelity of intervention delivery, participant satisfaction), and&#xD;
      maintenance (e.g., Aim 1 maintenance of effects, participant retention). Findings of this&#xD;
      study will lay the groundwork toward our long-term goal of disseminating an evidence-based&#xD;
      program for managing cognitive impairment in individuals diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Breast cancer survivors in the intervention group will participate in a 24-week moderate intensity exercise program led by community-based fitness center personal trainers. Individually-tailored exercise prescriptions will be developed based upon each participant's baseline maximal graded exercise test (heart rate corresponding with %VO2 peak) and symptom limitation. Sessions will be progressive in nature such that the volume of exercise increases across weeks. Treadmill walking is the primary mode of exercise. However, participants will be permitted to use other cardiovascular equipment (e.g., elliptical machines, stationary bicycles) as prescribed by their exercise trainer. The trainer will supervise three weekly exercise sessions in Weeks 1-2, two in Weeks 3-4, one in Weeks 5-8, biweekly across weeks 9-16, and monthly in Weeks 17-24 (N=20 supervised sessions).</description>
