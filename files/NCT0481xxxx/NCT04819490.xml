  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) data from children and&#xD;
      adolescents with growing skeletons in the United Kingdom (UK), including those treated with&#xD;
      burosumab or alternative XLH treatment, as part of an updated submission to the SMC in early&#xD;
      2023. This study will utilise data from a subset of UK sites already within the XLH Registry&#xD;
      (including participating Scottish sites) and collect additional HRQoL data within these sites&#xD;
      (that are otherwise not included in the wider XLH Registry protocol). The HRQoL data will&#xD;
      enable the calculation of HRQoL to derive the HRQoL utility estimates in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with growing skeletons for the RSS health states, hence addressing an area of&#xD;
      uncertainty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, non-interventional HRQoL study of children and adolescents with&#xD;
      growing skeletons using routinely collected XLH Registry data and prospectively collected&#xD;
      HRQoL data. This study will aim to enrol approximately 50 patients from approximately 5 UK&#xD;
      centres (currently participating in the XLH Registry) over a 6-month period. Each patient&#xD;
      will be followed for up to 12 months after enrolment. As stipulated, the data collection&#xD;
      should not require additional patient visits or data collection within the health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of data will be used in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routinely collected data from the XLH Registry on patient demographics and clinical&#xD;
           data, as well as PedsQL HRQoL data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HRQoL data prospectively collected at enrolment, 6-month and 12-month follow-up by the&#xD;
           patient and/or their parent / legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RSS scores within the XLH Registry will be used where available, or RSS will be&#xD;
           centrally calculated retrospectively from radiographs of the affected wrist and/or knee.&#xD;
           All RSS calculations will be centrally reviewed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RSS is a quantitative method to assess rickets severity in the wrists and knees based on the degree of metaphyseal fraying, concavity, and the proportion of the growth plate affected. It is a 10-point scale, where 10 represents the most extreme degree of rickets severity. In nutritional rickets, RSS may range from 0.5 to 10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To derive health state utilities based on EQ-5D-Y in the study population</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-Y is a two-part instrument: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive system covers five health domains: mobility, looking after myself, doing usual activities, having pain or discomfort and feeling worried, sad or unhappy. Each domain has 3 response categories: no problems, some problems and a lot of problems. The response categories can be reflected by a 1-digit number (1-3) and combined for the five dimensions into a 5-digit number to describe the health state of the patient. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical VAS of 0-100 where 100=&quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and 0=&quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement; results can be presented as both a measure of the central tendency and a measure of dispersion.</description>

    <measure>To derive health state utilities based on Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions [CHU-9D], in the study population</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CHU-9D is a generic child HRQoL questionnaire consisting of nine items, each with five response categories. Each item covers a different domain: worry, sadness, pain, tiredness, annoyance, school, sleep, daily routine and activities.</description>
