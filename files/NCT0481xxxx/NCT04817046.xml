  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a lung cancer diagnosis tool using a multi-omics&#xD;
      approach based on liquid biopsy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a screening process to determine eligibility of study entry.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood, tissue sample and imaging examinations of eligible patients will be&#xD;
      collected for further analysis. Data collected will be used to develop a multi-omics lung&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis model.&#xD;
