  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to evaluate the safety and exploratory efficacy of transplantation therapy&#xD;
      using neural precursor cells (PSA-NCAM(+) NPC) derived from the human embryonic stem cell&#xD;
      line for the treatment of paralysis and other related symptoms from sub-acute spinal cord&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with damage to C4-C7 cords diagnosed as AIS-A are administered with PSA-NCAM(+) NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluation of safety and exploratory efficacy, 2 to 6 subjects will be enrolled depending&#xD;
      on the presentation of dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is not presented in the first three subjects&#xD;
      administered with PSA-NCAM(+) NPC, two additional patients are added to the clinical study.&#xD;
      When the DLT is presented in two or more of the first three patients, the clinical study is&#xD;
      discontinued; when the DLT is presented in one of the three patients, three additional new&#xD;
      patients are added. In case of presentation of the DLT in at least one of the three&#xD;
      additional patients, the study is discontinued; the clinical study is continued only when the&#xD;
      DLT is not presented in all three patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (Visit 1), surgery and recovery visit (Visit 2 to Visit 6), follow-up visit&#xD;
      (Visit 7 to Visit 8 + phone screening I, II, III), additional visit (Visit 9 to Visit 10),&#xD;
      and close-out visit (Visit 11) are conducted. A clinical study period of at least 68 weeks is&#xD;
      secured after Visit 6 (at least 5 visits and 3 phone screenings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are to be conducted of follow-up study of a period of 1 year and 5 months at&#xD;
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 after surgery.&#xD;
