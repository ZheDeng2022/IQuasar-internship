  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic, disease characterized by marked inflammation of the skin that&#xD;
      results in thick, red, scaly plaques and is associated with high burden of illness that&#xD;
      results in a negative impact on long-term health outcomes including quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to characterize the durability of response of&#xD;
      risankizumab compared to other biologics measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index&#xD;
      (PASI) 90 response in adult participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who&#xD;
      are either new or have used a biological treatment in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risankizumab is a drug approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
      Participants who are prescribed risankizumab or other comparator drugs in the real world&#xD;
      setting are enrolled in this study. Data from a total of approximately 240 participants; 160&#xD;
      using risankizumab and 80 using other biologics will be evaluated across Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive subcutaneous risankizumab injection or or other biologic as&#xD;
      prescribed by their physician. Data from these participants will be collected for&#xD;
      approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care.&#xD;
      Participants will attend regular visits per routine clinical practice. The effect of the&#xD;
      treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects, and by&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is defined based on the percent reduction from baseline, generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an 90% reduction. The PASI is used to evaluate a participant's overall psoriasis disease state that includes the percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of erythema, infiltration, and desquamation over four body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities). Scores range from 0 to 72, with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest degree.</description>
