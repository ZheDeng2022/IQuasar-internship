  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test for the first time the potential of a nicotinic agonist on cognitive symptoms in&#xD;
      people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease (PD), referred to as&#xD;
      PD-MCI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet clinical need to treat PD-MCI. As outlined previously, PD-MCI is common,&#xD;
      has important clinical consequences, and there is currently no available treatment. Moreover,&#xD;
      the underlying pathology of cognitive impairment in PD indicates that nicotinic agonists may&#xD;
      be particularly relevant for this condition. This is a randomised, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2a study of AZD0328, a selective α7 nicotinic&#xD;
      receptor agonist, in PD-MCI. The study is an international, multi-centre study, which will&#xD;
      take place across sites in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-MIND will for the first time test the potential of a nicotinic agonist on cognition in&#xD;
      PD-MCI. The primary outcome is attention, as it is a key cognitive domain in the PD-MCI&#xD;
      profile and most likely to be affected by a α7 nicotinic agonist. Exploratory outcome&#xD;
      measures will guide decisions on the design and conduct of future larger Phase 3 trials.&#xD;
      Qualifying participants will be randomly assigned at baseline to either receive 0.5mg twice a&#xD;
      day (bis in die, BID) of AZD0328 or placebo for 12 weeks. A total of 160 participants with&#xD;
      PD-MCI will be enrolled to the study: 80 in the active (AZD0328) group and 80 in the control&#xD;
      (placebo) group. Participants will undertake face-to-face assessments at screening, baseline,&#xD;
      and then 3- 6- and 12- weeks after beginning study treatment (see Figure 2 for trial design&#xD;
      overview). A subset of 90 participants will also undergo an MRI biomarker component prior to&#xD;
      study drug administration and at study end.&#xD;

    <description>Part III of the Movement Disorder Society's (MDS) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), is a motor examination and objective assessment of parkinsonism. This is based on 18 items assessed by the investigator, resulting in 33 scores by location and lateralization. These 33 scores are ratings on severity: from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe).The MDS-UPDRS-III total score ranges from 0 to 132, with higher scores indicative of more severe motor and functional impairment.</description>

Each item is scored on 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (never) - 4 (always), over the past month. The PDQ-39 total score is 156: the lower the score reflects a better health-related quality-of-life.</description>
