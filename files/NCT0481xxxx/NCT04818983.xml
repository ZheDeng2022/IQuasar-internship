      This study is implemented in association with the study &quot;J-TAIL-2&quot; ; prospective multicenter&#xD;
      observational study of atezolizumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, UMIN study ID: UMIN000041263, to evaluate biomarkers&#xD;
      for selection of appropriate patients in treatment with atezolizumab combination therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion/exclusion criteria of J-TAIL-2 study is to be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &lt;non-small cell lung cancer cohort&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients 20 years of age or older at the time of signed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with unresectable, advanced and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are scheduled to start atezolizumab combination therapy in clinical&#xD;
             practice, based on the atezolizumab package insert and the Optimal Clinical Use&#xD;
             Guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who signed informed consent form before enrolling the study. The consent from&#xD;
             a legally acceptable representative is required for the patients with uncertain&#xD;
             capacity of judgments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &lt;extensive disease small cell lung cancer cohort&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients 20 years of age or older at the time of signed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are scheduled to start atezolizumab combination therapy in clinical&#xD;

             Guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who signed informed consent form before enrolling the study. The consent from&#xD;
             a legally acceptable representative is required for the patients with uncertain&#xD;
             capacity of judgments. However, the samples of dead cases can be used for the analysis&#xD;
             of immune microenvironment of small cell lung cancer by disclosing information on this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
