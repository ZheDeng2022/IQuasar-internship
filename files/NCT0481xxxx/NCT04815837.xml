      The primary objective of this study is to investigate prevalence of uptake of Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination after exposure to health promotion among men who have sex&#xD;
      with men in Hong Kong within a 12-month project period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are Hong Kong Chinese speaking males aged 18-45 years old and&#xD;
      self-reported having had oral or anal intercourse with at least one man in the last six&#xD;
      months. Those who have ever received HPV vaccination are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited through outreaching in gay venues, online advertisement and&#xD;
      referral made by peers and non-governmental organization. With verbal informed consent,&#xD;
      participants completed a baseline survey through telephone. They are then exposed to online&#xD;
      interventions including: 1) watching an online video, 2) receiving a discount coupon to&#xD;
      receive HPV vaccination at collaborative private clinics, 3) visiting the project webpage,&#xD;
      and 4) receiving follow-up reminders 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 months after the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are followed up by telephone 12 months after the baseline survey to access&#xD;

    <description>Viewing a video promoting Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination: participants will watch a 5-minute online video promoting MSM's uptake of HPV vaccination.

He also demonstrated the procedures of taking up HPV vaccination in the collaborative private clinics, which portrayed caring, privacy guaranteed, and non-judgmental environment.&#xD;
Receiving the discount coupons: each participant will be given a discount coupon. By using the coupon, one can enjoy a 10% discount for taking up three doses of HPV vaccines at a collaborating private clinic.&#xD;
