      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) T cell therapy is a type of cancer treatment in which a&#xD;
      person s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in a laboratory to recognize and attack&#xD;
      cancer cells. Researchers want to see if this treatment can help people with hairy cell&#xD;
      leukemia (HCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether it is safe to give anti-CD22 CAR T cells to people with HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with HCL (classic or variant type) who have already had, are unable&#xD;
      to receive, or have refused other standard treatments for their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may need to have a catheter placed in a large vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a neurologic evaluation and fill out questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed from the participant. A machine&#xD;
      will divide whole blood into red cells, plasma, and lymphocytes. The lymphocytes will be&#xD;
      collected. The remaining blood will be returned to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get infusions of chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get an infusion of the anti-CD22 CAR T cells. They will stay at the&#xD;
      hospital for 14 days. Then they will have visits twice a week for 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will be followed closely for 6 months, and then less frequently&#xD;
      for at least 5 years. Then they will have long-term follow-up for 15 years.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent CD22+ B-cell leukemia comprising 2% of all&#xD;
      leukemias. Most cases of HCL respond well to purine analog chemotherapy and harbor BRAF V600E&#xD;
      mutation that can be considered for targeted treatment at the time of relapse. However, there&#xD;
      are patients with high-risk HCL such as patients with BRAF wild type IGHV4-34 unmutated HCL&#xD;
      who respond poorly to chemotherapy and have poor survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCL variant (HCLv), also brightly CD22+, resembles HCL morphologically but is more aggressive&#xD;
      and responds poorly to standard purine analog chemotherapy. Patients have fewer options of&#xD;
      targeted treatment partly due to wild type BRAF. We showed that the overall survival in&#xD;
      patients progressed after cladribine-rituximab is less than three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk is an anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin which in 2018 was&#xD;
      FDA-approved for adult patients with relapsed/refractory HCL. However, there are patients&#xD;
      with HCL and HCLv who progress after treatments with standard purine analog chemotherapy and&#xD;
      moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk, and in the case of classic HCL, even after BRAF +/- MEK&#xD;
      inhibition. There is still an unmet need for new treatment options for those with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoptive cellular therapy with T-cells genetically modified using viral-based vectors to&#xD;
      express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) targeting the CD22 molecule have demonstrated&#xD;
      dramatic clinical responses in patients with CD22+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk proved that CD22 is a potent target for HCL due to its ubiquitous&#xD;
      expression in HCL and HCLv, and cellular therapy represents a promising target for those&#xD;
      patients that have progressed after other treatments options with chemotherapy, immunotherapy&#xD;
      and targeted therapy. This will be the first trial of anti-CD22 CAR T-cell therapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL and HCLv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and feasibility of administering escalating doses of autologous&#xD;
      anti-CD22-CAR (M971BBz) engineered T-cells in subjects with HCL/HCLv following a&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore whether the administration of anti-CD22-CAR engineered T-cells can mediate antitumor&#xD;
      effects in HCL/HCLv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCL/HCLv, after prior treatment with, ineligible for, refusal of, or inability to obtain 1)&#xD;
      Rituximab given concurrently with or sequentially after purine analog, 2) moxetumomab&#xD;
      pasudotox-tdft, and 3) BRAF-inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for treatment, either 1) ANC &lt;1/nL, 2) Hgb &lt;10g/dL, 3) Plt &lt;100/nL, 4) HCL count &gt;5/nL,&#xD;
      5) HCLv count doubling time &lt;3 months, 6) symptomatic splenomegaly, 7) enlarging HCL mass &gt;&#xD;
      2cm in short axis, 8) increasing lytic or blastic bone lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &gt;= 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD22 expression must be detected on greater than 15% of the malignant cells by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry or greater than 80% by flow cytometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      No uncontrolled infection, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, or secondary malignancy requiring&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy less than or equal to 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
      apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBMC will be obtained by leukapheresis, CD3+ cells enriched and cultured in the presence of&#xD;
      anti-CD3/-CD28 beads followed by lentiviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CD22&#xD;
      (M971BBz) CAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -4 (cell infusion is Day 0), patients will begin induction chemotherapy comprising&#xD;
      fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on Days -4, -3 and -2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m^2 on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CD22-CAR T-cells will be infused on Day 0, with up to a 72h delay allowed for infusion of&#xD;
      fresh cells or a 7 day delay if cells are cryopreserved, if needed for resolution of clinical&#xD;
      toxicities, to generate adequate cell numbers, or to facilitate scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I cell dose escalation scheme will be performed primarily using 2 dose levels (1 x&#xD;
      10^5 transduced T-cells/kg; 3 x 10^5 transduced T-cells/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 2 of 2-6 participants at dose level 1 have DLT, safety will be evaluated in a de-escalated&#xD;
      dose of 3 x 10^4 transduced T-cells/kg (plus minus 20%). Once the maximum tolerated dose (or&#xD;
      highest level evaluated) is reached, with 0-1 out of 6 having DLT, an additional 4&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled to provide further assessment of DLTs and for determining a&#xD;
      preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the therapy in this participant population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for toxicity, response and T-cell persistence as well as other&#xD;
      biologic correlates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual ceiling will be set at 23 to allow for a few unevaluable participants and screen&#xD;
      failures.&#xD;
