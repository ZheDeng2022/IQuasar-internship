      The Houston Emergency Response Opioid Engagement System for Youths and Adolescents (Young&#xD;
      HEROES) is a community-based research program integrating assertive outreach, medication for&#xD;
      opioid use disorder (MOUD), behavioral counseling, and peer recovery support. The objective&#xD;
      is to compare differences in engagement and retention in treatment for individuals with&#xD;
      opioid use disorder. The investigators also intend to understand the prevalence of opioid&#xD;
      overdoses and OUD among youth in Houston.&#xD;

      The Houston Emergency Response Opioid Engagement System for Youths and Adolescents (Young&#xD;
      HEROES) is a non-randomized cohort study based at the University of Texas Health Science&#xD;
      Center of Houston. This study recruits participants through three avenues: assertive&#xD;
      community outreach with a peer coach and paramedic following and opioid overdose, community&#xD;
      referrals, and emergency department referrals. The study explores the effect of the&#xD;
      combination of assertive outreach, same-day induction into medication for opioid use&#xD;
      disorder, ongoing maintenance treatment, behavioral counseling, peer recovery support, and&#xD;
      paramedic follow-up on patient outcomes. The primary outcome is engagement and retention in&#xD;
      outpatient treatment. Secondary outcomes include quality of life assessment as well as&#xD;
      subsequent relapses and overdoses. The hypothesis is that patients with earlier induction&#xD;
      into MOUD treatment who receive routine follow-up, are more likely to engage and remain in&#xD;
      treatment long-term.&#xD;
