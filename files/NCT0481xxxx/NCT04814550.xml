  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, self-control clinical trial. 318 patients who need&#xD;
      selective operation to evaluate the function of coronary artery were selected and measured&#xD;
      with AccuFFRangio Plus and FFR. The data of the experimental group was defined as: FFR value&#xD;
      at the distal end of stenosis was obtained by calculating the original X-ray angiographic&#xD;
      images of the coronary arteries before operation with the non-invasive blood flow reserve&#xD;
      analysis software of Hangzhou ArteryFlow Technology Co., Ltd. The gold standard group data is&#xD;
      the clinical measured FFR (clinical gold standard) at the stenosis lesions. It is defined&#xD;
      that when the coronary artery reaches the maximum congestion state, the pressure value at the&#xD;
      distal end of the stenosis lesions is accurately measured by the guide wire with a pressure&#xD;
      sensor, and the ratio value with the coronary mouth pressure is the FFR. By comparing the&#xD;
      data of the experimental group and the data of the gold standard group, the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of the devices in the experimental group were evaluated.&#xD;
