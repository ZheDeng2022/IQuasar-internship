  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single ascending dose study to assess the PK,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of SYN-020 delayed release capsules administered orally to healthy&#xD;
      adult male and female subjects with a BMI of 18.5 to 27 kg/m2. Up to 36 subjects will&#xD;
      participate, in each of up to 6 sequential cohorts. Single doses of 5, 15, 45, and 150 mg&#xD;
      SYN-020 are planned in Cohorts 1 through 4, respectively. Cohorts 5 and 6, if enrolled, will&#xD;
      receive doses that were well tolerated in an earlier cohort to determine the effect of BMI&#xD;
      and/or a high-fat meal on the SYN-020 PK profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cohort, eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1, and receive&#xD;
      study drug in the morning of Day 1. For PK analysis, blood and feces will be collected before&#xD;
      dosing and for up to 96 hours (blood) or 120 hours (feces) after dosing. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged from the clinic after the End of Study procedures are completed on Day 6.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) is a naturally occurring enzyme produced by the small&#xD;
      intestine in all mammals, including humans, and is considered essential for promoting normal&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) function and maintaining proper gut homeostasis, as well as appearing&#xD;
      to play a pivotal role in the mediation of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SYN-020 is a recombinant bovine IAP isotype II being developed by Synthetic Biologics, Inc.&#xD;
      to reduce the cumulative GI toxicity and inflammation that can be associated with repeat&#xD;
      administration of radiation in patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single ascending dose study to assess the PK,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of SYN-020 delayed release capsules administered orally to healthy&#xD;
      adult male and female subjects with a BMI of 18.5 to 27 kg/m2. Up to 36 subjects will&#xD;
      participate, with 6 subjects (approximately equal numbers of male and females) in each of up&#xD;
      to 6 sequential cohorts. Single doses of 5, 15, 45, and 150 mg SYN-020 are planned in Cohorts&#xD;
      1 through 4, respectively. Cohorts 5 and 6, if enrolled, will receive doses that were well&#xD;
      tolerated in an earlier cohort to determine the effect of BMI and/or a high-fat meal on the&#xD;
      SYN-020 PK profile, and will be described fully in a protocol amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cohort, eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on&#xD;
      Day -1, and subjects who remain eligible will, after a minimum 10-hour overnight fast,&#xD;
      receive study drug in the morning of Day 1. For PK analysis, blood and feces will be&#xD;
      collected before dosing and for up to 96 hours (blood) or 120 hours (feces) after dosing.&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the CRU after the End of Study (EOS) procedures are&#xD;
      completed on Day 6.&#xD;
