      Prospective Cohort Study aims at elaborating the outcomes of the Tricuspid Reconstruction of&#xD;
      Aortic valve leaflets using autologous pericardium (Ozaki procedure) in the adult and&#xD;
      paediatric patients. A very promising technique with the potential benefits of dodging oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation, foreign material, and suitable for patients with small aortic annuli and in&#xD;
      infectious endocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing hemodynamic evaluation, assess the clinical implementation and report preliminary&#xD;
      results at follow up .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart valve disease signifies a severe growing public health problem in developing countries,&#xD;
      with aortic valve stenosis being the most common issue. Heart valve disease is commonly&#xD;
      initiated by atherosclerotic degenerative processes, congenital anomalies, or rheumatic&#xD;
      process. Aortic valve replacement is the gold standard in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      severe aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. Mechanical valves are favoured in younger&#xD;
      patients (&lt;60 years) owing to longer life-time, whereas biological valves are used for&#xD;
      elderly patients in order to evade oral anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Options for aortic valve disease have improved in the last era including replacement, repair,&#xD;
      and reconstructive options. A variety of creative techniques including leaflet extensions,&#xD;
      neo-leaflet creation, resuspension or plication of prolapsing leaflets, and commissuroplasty&#xD;
      to repair valves have been officially become skilled at, specially in pediatric population .&#xD;
      In adults, the introduction of trans-catheter aortic valve inserting now permits treatment of&#xD;
      degenerative aortic stenosis in the oldest and the highest risk patients. However, surgical&#xD;
      treatment choices for pediatric patients with complex congenital aortic valve disease stay&#xD;
      restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, much attention has been given to the Ozaki procedure, an alternative way of&#xD;
      repairing aortic valve, involving the use of autologous pericardium for the aortic leaflet&#xD;
      reconstruction. Diseased leaflets are removed carefully. The distance between each commissure&#xD;
      is measured with invented sizing apparatus. The new leaflet of the size corresponding to the&#xD;
      measured value is trimmed with an original template from glutaraldehyde-treated autologous&#xD;
      pericardium. Finally, the annular margin of the pericardial leaflet was running sutured with&#xD;
      each annulus. Commissural coaptation was secured with additional sutures. The coaptation of&#xD;
      three new leaflets were always insured with direct vision.&#xD;
