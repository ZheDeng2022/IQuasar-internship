  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion, Phase 1 study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity of CM313.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation part will determine the MTD of CM313 in subjects with relapsed and/or&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) or lymphoma based on a modified 3+3 dose escalation design&#xD;
      (an accelerated dose titration design followed by traditional 3+3 dose escalation design).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose expansion part includes two cohorts. Cohort 1 will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of CM313 in combination with Dexamethasone in subjects with&#xD;
      RRMM. Cohort 2 will evaluate the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of CM313 in&#xD;
      combination with Rd regimen (Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone) in subjects with RRMM or newly&#xD;
      diagnosed MM (NDMM).&#xD;
