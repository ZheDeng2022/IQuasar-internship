  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study conducted at the Bronx MWCCS Clinical Research Site in the Bronx, NY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 60 individuals with coexisting asthma and/or Type 2 DM from this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3 month study period, these 60 participants will receive a comprehensive mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) app, WELLXcel which includes: 1) guideline-based asthma and diabetes&#xD;
      education delivered through interactive features such as animated videos and tailored push&#xD;
      notifications; 2) the collection of PRO measures to enable patients symptom self-tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, we will evaluate the association between baseline digital health literacy&#xD;
      and favorable clinical outcomes related to the WELLXcel study intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1. To adapt (including a single platform for multiple chronic conditions) and&#xD;
      refine WELLXcel for adult women with and without HIV. Hypothesis 1: WELLXcel will be&#xD;
      associated with a high level of adoption and will be successfully refined based on patient&#xD;
      feedback. Objective 2. To conduct a pilot study to assess the impact of the adapted and&#xD;
      refined WELLXcel program on clinical and process outcomes among women with and without HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: WELLXcel will be associated with a high level of patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      usage, improved asthma and diabetes knowledge, improvements in health quality of life, and&#xD;
      improved self-reported asthma control and diabetes related quality of life compared to usual&#xD;
      care. Primary outcomes: Asthma control measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and diabetes&#xD;
      quality of life measured by the Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Process outcomes - patient satisfaction regarding the WELLXcel&#xD;
      intervention measured by the validated Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS)&#xD;
      and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) questionnaire; patient&#xD;
      usage of WELLXcel as determined by Google Analytics (integrated within the WELLXcel app) and&#xD;
      the WELLXcel backend administrative panel; asthma knowledge (measured by the Asthma Illness&#xD;
      Representation Scale and diabetes knowledge (measured by the Diabetes Knowledge&#xD;
      Questionnaire-24)[24] ; diabetes self-management and self-efficacy as measured by the&#xD;
      Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ) and Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form&#xD;
      (DES-SF), respectively. Clinical outcomes - Asthma quality of life measured by the&#xD;
      Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini- AQLQ); asthma and/or diabetes related&#xD;
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations; and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9&#xD;
      (PHQ-9) for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: English-speaking women &gt;18 years with: (a) persistent asthma (diagnosis&#xD;
      via self-report) on a daily controller medication and/or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosis&#xD;
      via self-report) on at least one oral hypoglycemic medication and/or Insulin; (b) able to&#xD;
      give informed consent; and (c) Smartphone (iOS or Android) access. Exclusion Criteria: (a)&#xD;
      use of oral corticosteroids in the 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit; (b) pregnancy; (c)&#xD;
      chronic illness with organ failure (heart failure, severe liver disease, chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease stage 3-4 or dialysis) or requiring chemotherapy or steroid use; (d) severe&#xD;
      psychiatric or cognitive problems that would prohibit an individual from understanding and&#xD;
      completing the protocol; and (e) patients that previously received the ASTHMAXcel&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit 30 HIV infected and 30 HIV uninfected adult women with persistent&#xD;
      asthma and/or Type 2 DM and fulfilling the study's inclusion criteria from the MWCCS cohort.&#xD;
      At each study site, patients will be prescreened for eligibility using data from WIHS&#xD;
      (Women's Interagency HIV Study) to identify those who meet the inclusion criteria. In&#xD;
      adapting with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and our existing AHRQ study protocols, patient&#xD;
      recruitment and study sessions will be conducted virtually to support physical distancing and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of contracting and transmitting COVID- 19 infection. The study coordinators&#xD;
      will call potential participants to describe the study and obtain voluntary informed consent&#xD;
      from interested patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the consent process, the study participant may choose to complete the e-consent (as&#xD;
      a form administered through our project's REDCap database via an e-mail link sent to the&#xD;
      patients who will read and electronically sign the consent) or verbal consent (the consent&#xD;
      will be read out to the patients who will subsequently provide verbal confirmation of having&#xD;
      understood the consent text and affirm consenting to the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary informed consent will include a discussion of the study purpose, study procedures,&#xD;
      research virtual visit schedule, reimbursement, confidentiality of research records, and&#xD;
      risks, benefits, and alternatives to study participation. Investigators will discuss that&#xD;
      research participation is voluntary, and participants will be notified that they can&#xD;
      discontinue participation at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will document that the purpose, risks, benefits, and alternative&#xD;
      treatments were explained to the participant, that the participant agreed to participate in&#xD;
      this protocol, and the date and time consent was obtained. A copy of the HIPAA form and a&#xD;
      copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participant. In either case,&#xD;
      whether the e-consent or the verbal consent form is obtained, the participant will receive&#xD;
      the consent document, which will be printed and mailed out to them. All informed consent and&#xD;
      HIPAA documents will be submitted to, and approved by, the Albert Einstein College of&#xD;
      Medicine IRB. E-consent forms will be stored within our project's secure REDCap database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients who provide voluntary informed consent will be invited to the remotely&#xD;
      conducted (via Zoom) baseline visit, which consists of downloading the app to the patient's&#xD;
      smartphone, explaining the app's functionality, having the patients complete the WELLXcel&#xD;
      animated educational videos and baseline questionnaires administered by REDCap. Assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted at baseline followed by 1, 2, and 3 months after baseline. The baseline&#xD;
      survey and the subsequent assessments will include process outcomes (patient usage,&#xD;
      acceptance and satisfaction with the app) as well as measures of disease morbidity (asthma&#xD;
      and diabetes control, utilization measures in terms of asthma and/or diabetes-related ED&#xD;
      visits and hospitalizations) and quality of life questionnaires. Based on our preliminary&#xD;
      studies, patients with 1 condition will take approximately 20 minutes to complete the surveys&#xD;
      during a given study visit. Patients with 2 conditions will take approximately 45 minutes to&#xD;
      complete the surveys. Each study visit will also include brief semi-structured interviews to&#xD;
      gather patient feedback (e.g. problems with using the app). Investigators will also use the&#xD;
      Google Analytics and WELLXcel admin panel to evaluate app usage patterns and click-through&#xD;
      data to better understand how the app is used, which may lead to the identification of&#xD;
      additional usability pitfalls. Investigators will use our existing REDCap project database to&#xD;
      store app-collected data and responses to REDCap-administered questionnaires. At the 2 month&#xD;
      visit, we will conduct exit interviews with each study participant to enable us to refine the&#xD;
      app for our upcoming studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess digital health literacy and concurrently validate our digital health literacy tool,&#xD;
      the study baseline session will also include NVS, eHEALS, and our digital health literacy&#xD;
      tool. At the subsequent 1-month assessment, digital health literacy tool will be&#xD;
      re-administered to evaluate test-retest reliability. There is no previously defined cut-off&#xD;
      score on the eHEALS questionnaire which simply defines a patient as eHealth literate' or 'not&#xD;
      eHealth literate'. For this study, investigators will define literacy as follows: a score of&#xD;
      32 or higher (out of a 40 point maximum score) will indicate 'good EHL', a score of 24-31&#xD;
      will indicate 'moderate EHL', and a score below 24 will indicate 'low EHL'. On the objective&#xD;
      digital health literacy tool, 'good EHL' will be defined as a score from 8-10 (out of a&#xD;
      maximum of 10), a score of 5-7 will indicate 'moderate EHL', and a score below 5 will&#xD;
      indicate 'low EHL'. Patients will complete all health literacy questionnaires via REDCAP&#xD;
      generated e-mail survey links during the study sessions.&#xD;
