  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus currently affects 463 million people worldwide. One of the most serious&#xD;
      complications of diabetes is the diabetic foot. Adequate foot care behaviours reduce the risk&#xD;
      of ulcers, infections, and amputations, and improve the quality of life, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial aims to analyse the impact of different&#xD;
      educational strategies - an instructive video (Video Watching Group - Experimental Group 1)&#xD;
      compared with a leaflet on foot care with real-time guided reading (Real-Time Leaflet Reading&#xD;
      Group - Experimental Group 2) and with standard teaching on diabetic foot care (Standard Care&#xD;
      - Control Group) - on adherence and knowledge regarding diabetic foot care, as well as on&#xD;
      patient's perception of their foot health. Participants will be assessed at the first&#xD;
      consultation of the diabetic foot (T0), about two weeks after the first assessment (T1), and&#xD;
      three months after the T0 in a follow-up assessment (T2), with T1 and T2 being performed&#xD;
      through telephone calls, after obtaining the patients' consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the present study will inform educational interventions regarding foot care&#xD;
      adherence in patients with diabetic foot, in order to decrease the likelihood of developing&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers and, consequently, to reduce amputation rates and the several associated&#xD;
      costs, contributing to improving patients' quality of life.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To analyze the contribution of sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological variables&#xD;
           to diabetic foot care adherence and knowledge, and perceived foot health, over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the differences between groups over time in diabetic foot care adherence,&#xD;
           knowledge on foot care, and perceived foot health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the mediating role of representations about diabetic foot in the relationship&#xD;
           between knowledge about foot care and adherence to diabetic foot care, over time,&#xD;
           controlling for health literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the moderating role of foot pain, foot function, and footwear between&#xD;
           representations about diabetic foot and adherence to diabetic foot care/ perceived foot&#xD;
           health, over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized Mixed Models, which allow examining changes over time including longitudinal&#xD;
      mediation and moderation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a dropout rate of 10%, the sample size required is 60 patients (20 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at the first consultation of the diabetic foot (T0), about two&#xD;
      weeks after the first assessment (T1), and three months after the T0 in a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment (T2), with T1 and T2 being performed through telephone calls.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 for the two conditions - Video Watching Group or Real-time Leaflet Reading Group versus Standard Care Group - into blocks of variable size, multiples of two. This randomization will be stratified according to the hospital (hospital 1 versus hospital 2) and the presence or absence of active diabetic foot ulcer.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Randomisation will be performed through an online random number generator, by a researcher external to the team of this study, to ensure the concealment of the allocation of participants by the several groups (Pandis, 2012). It will not be possible to conceal the group to which the patient was allocated to the medical and nursing team, since they have to administer the intervention or the researcher who will have to inform the respective team and administer the intervention in the Reading Group. Only the participants will be blind to the group to which they have been allocated.</masking_description>

    <measure>Adherence to the diabetic foot care behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to two weeks post-test and after a three month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to foot care behaviors will be assessed through the Nottingham Assessment of Functional Foot Care (Lincoln, Jeffcoate, Ince, Smith, &amp; Radford, 2007). Composed of 29 items whose answers are given on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. Higher scores correspond to a higher frequency of foot care behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to the diabetic foot care behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to two weeks post-test and after a three month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The level of foot self-care (indirect measure of adherence) will be assessed through the subscale of Foot Care of the Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire (Original Version by Toobert, Hampson, &amp; Glasgow, 2000; Portuguese Version by Bastos, Severo, &amp; Lopes, 2007). Composed of 3 items in which patients are asked how many of the last seven days did they perform the respective foot care behaviour. Therefore, answers are given on a scale between 0 and 7, and its score is calculated through the mean number of days. Higher scores indicate higher levels of foot self-care.</description>
