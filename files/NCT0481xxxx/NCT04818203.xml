    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of administering&#xD;
      clusters of autologous dermal fibroblasts to subjects with periorbital wrinkles on both&#xD;
      sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects who have signed the Informed consent form voluntarily are enrolled in this study,&#xD;
      they will be tested for eligibility during the screening period. Subjects will visit the&#xD;
      study site a total of 6 times while participating in this study. The subjects who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive a total of one dose of the IP (Visit 3). Then, the&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation will be conducted at Visit 4 (Week 2), Visit 5 (Week 12), and Visit 6&#xD;
      (Week 24), and safety will also be evaluated at each visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with periorbital wrinkles on both sides.&#xD;
      The study consists of phase 1 to evaluate safety and phase 2 to evaluate efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: Single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design. If a subject&#xD;
           voluntarily signs the written informed consent form to participate in this study, he/she&#xD;
           will be enrolled as a subject after eligibility evaluation. After a single&#xD;
           administration of the study drug to a subject, safety and efficacy will be evaluated at&#xD;
           Week 2, Week 12, and Week 24 visits after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an adverse drug reaction of grade 3 or higher occurs in 3 subjects 2 weeks after&#xD;
      administration of the study drug in the phase 1 study; if an adverse drug reaction occurs in&#xD;
      0/3 subjects, the phase 2 study will be conducted after completing the phase 1 study; if an&#xD;
      adverse drug reaction occurs in 2/3 or more subjects, the study will be terminated; and if an&#xD;
      adverse drug reaction occurs in 1/3 subjects, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled to&#xD;
      proceed with the study. After the safety of subjects in the phase 1 study is confirmed by&#xD;
      Week 12, the phase 2 study will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: Single center, randomized, subject- and assessor- blinded, placebo controlled,&#xD;
           parallel design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If safety is secured 12 weeks after administering the study drug in phase 1, phase 2 will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the subjects that meet the final inclusion criteria will be assigned sequentially and&#xD;
      recognized by the same procedure and will receive the study drug once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy will be evaluated at Week 2, Week 12, Week 24 after administration. All&#xD;
      subjects will be tested on the same schedule.&#xD;
