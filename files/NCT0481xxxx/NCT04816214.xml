    <textblock>
      This phase III study is designed to evaluate the anticancer activity of capmatinib in&#xD;
      combination with osimertinib compared to platinum-pemetrexed based doublet chemotherapy as&#xD;
      second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, T790M negative,&#xD;
      mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition factor (MET) amplified who progressed following EGFR&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The randomized part will be preceded by a safety run-in&#xD;
      part in which the recommended dose of the combination of capmatinib and osimertinib will be&#xD;
      confirmed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, global phase III study that&#xD;
      will enroll adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating&#xD;
      mutation, T790M negative, MET amplified who have progressed following EGFR TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of an initial safety run-in part to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of capmatinib in combination with osimertinib and to confirm the recommended&#xD;
      dose for the randomized part, and a randomized part that will evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of capmatinib in combination with osimertinib compared to platinum (cisplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin) - pemetrexed doublet based chemotherapy as second line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's respective treatment (either with capmatinib in combination with osimertinib,&#xD;
      or with platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) - pemetrexed based doublet chemotherapy) will be&#xD;
      continued until participant experiences any of the following: documented disease progression&#xD;
      by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) (as assessed by the&#xD;
      investigator in the run-in part, and as assessed by the investigator confirmed by blinded&#xD;
      independent review committee (BIRC) in the randomization part), withdrawal of consent,&#xD;
      pregnancy, lost to follow-up, or death. Study treatment may be continued beyond initial&#xD;
      disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 if, in the judgement of the investigator, there is&#xD;
      evidence of clinical benefit, and the participant wishes to continue on the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment discontinuation, all participants will be followed for safety evaluations&#xD;
      during the safety follow-up period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 37 months</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 items and is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures based on the patients experience over the past week. These include five scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact) and a global health status/quality of life scale (QoL) scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high /healthy level of functioning; a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>

    <description>The Lung Cancer module of the EORTC's quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-LC13) is used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and provides information on an additional 13 items specifically related to lung cancer. The five domains of the LC13 include pain, dyspnea, coughing and hemoptysis, and are based on their presence over the past week. All but the pain domain are scored on a 4 point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;. Pain score is based on its presence, hence yes or no. A higher score indicates a higher presence of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The EuroQoL-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol (EQ) Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages - the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each with 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical VAS with endpoints labeled 'the best health you can imagine' at the top and 'the worst health you can imagine' at the bottom.</description>

The FBrSI was adapted from the previously developed FACT-Brain module. The symptoms module contains 12 items with a recall period of the past 7 days. The participant responds to 12 statements and indicates to what extent it applies to them on a 5-point Likert response scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much.&quot;</description>
