      The word 'shiftwork' is commonly used to describe irregular, odd, untraditional working&#xD;
      hours, or working hours that are away from day work period. Shiftwork dates back to the late&#xD;
      1800s, as applied to guardians of old kingdoms and in the military services. After the&#xD;
      innovation of the light, shift work expanded for nonstop production as in steel factories,&#xD;
      iron foundries, and material plants. Approximately one-fourth of the workforce in hospitals&#xD;
      works unusual hours (away from the traditional diurnal work period) . Shiftwork has a number&#xD;
      of advantages and disadvantages to employers, employees, and their families. The advantages&#xD;
      for employers include optimal use of energy, facilities, and other resources through extended&#xD;
      capital operating time. The advantages for employees include increased income, more free time&#xD;
      for daily activities, and saving time by avoiding traffic rush hours. Shiftwork is associated&#xD;
      with both short-term and long-term disadvantages on physical and psychophysiological health.&#xD;
      Short-term effects include fatigue and difficulties with sleep. Difficulties with sleep are&#xD;
      found to be the most common complaint among shift workers. Sleep disturbances were the main&#xD;
      reasons that led shift workers to leave night shiftwork owing to disturbed health habits&#xD;
      compared with day workers .Gastrointestinal disorders were reported 2-5 times more commonly&#xD;
      among shift workers than daytime workers. These disorders range from minor complaints (e.g.,&#xD;
      constipation, heart burn, distension, and disturbed appetite) to serious gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders, which may develop into chronic diseases such as chronic gastritis or peptic&#xD;
      ulcers. Shiftwork has been also linked to type 2 diabetes and obesity as sleep deprivation&#xD;
      activates the immune system and influences glucose metabolism .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An association between shiftwork and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has been reported. There&#xD;
      is a higher risk for CVD such as hypertension, subclinical atherosclerosis, and ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease compared with daytime workers . Different types of cancer have been reported in&#xD;
      shift workers including cancers of the breast, colon, and endometrium. Shiftwork system&#xD;
      causes circadian rhythm disruption, which is probably carcinogenic to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, shiftwork causes disruption in both social and domestic lifestyle, which is a major&#xD;
      consequence of shiftwork, especially with maternal employment that may have some adverse&#xD;
      influences on their young children's cognitive and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
