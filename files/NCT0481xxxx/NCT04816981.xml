  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before any treatment decisions are made for patients with lung cancer, it is crucial to&#xD;
      determine whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the chest. Traditionally, this&#xD;
      is determined by taking biopsy samples from these lymph nodes, using the Endobronchial&#xD;
      Ultrasound Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) procedure. Unfortunately, in 40% of&#xD;
      the time, the results of EBUS-TBNA are not informative and wrong treatment decisions are&#xD;
      made. There is, therefore, a recognized need for a better way to determine whether the cancer&#xD;
      has spread to the lymph nodes in the chest. The investigators believe that elastography, a&#xD;
      recently discovered imaging technology, can fulfill this need. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators are proposing to determine whether elastography can diagnose cancer in the&#xD;
      lymph nodes. Elastography determines the tissue stiffness in the different parts of the lymph&#xD;
      node and generates a colour map, where the stiffest part of the lymph node appears blue, and&#xD;
      the softest part appears red. It has been proposed that if a lymph node is predominantly&#xD;
      blue, then it contains cancer, and if it is predominantly red, then it is benign. To study&#xD;
      this, the investigators have designed an experiment where the lymph nodes are imaged by&#xD;
      EBUS-Elastography, and the images are subsequently analyzed by a computer algorithm using&#xD;
      Artificial Intelligence. The algorithm will be trained to read the images first, and then&#xD;
      predict whether these images show cancer in the lymph node. To evaluate the success of the&#xD;
      algorithm, the investigators will compare its predictions to the pathology results from the&#xD;
      lymph node biopsies or surgical specimens.&#xD;

    <description>Patients undergoing LN staging for lung cancer with EBUS-TBNA will have digital images and biopsy of every LN obtained in accordance with standards of care. Prior to the lymph node biopsy by EBUS-TBNA, elastography will be performed. The relative strain of tissues in the scanned area of the LNs will be displayed as a colour map, with stiffer areas in blue and softer tissue in red. Elastography and B-mode images will be displayed side by side and images recorded and saved onto an external drive for analysis. Elastography images will be fed to the NeuralSeg algorithm which has a network architecture similar to the standard U-Net for image segmentation. The automatically identified regions of interest will be overlaid onto the EBUS Elastography images to extract the LN stiffness measurements. After overlaying, NeuralSeg will determine the proportion of the LN area within 9 previously defined stiffness thresholds.</description>
