  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to determine to reduce HIV incidence and to improve community health&#xD;
      with multi-sector, scalable interventions. This study will consist of two phases: Phase A, in&#xD;
      which randomized trials will assess effectiveness, fidelity and cost and improve&#xD;
      context-specific &quot;fit&quot; of prevention and treatment interventions. Combining effectiveness&#xD;
      with implementation, costing and modelling outcomes, Phase A will optimize intervention&#xD;
      packages with context specific adaptations in structured consultation with stakeholders.&#xD;
      Phase B, which will evaluate the effects of these optimized dynamic prevention and treatment&#xD;
      packages, alone and in combination, on prevention coverage, population-level suppression, and&#xD;
      HIV incidence, as well as other health outcomes, in a balanced, community randomized 2x2&#xD;
      factorial design. This clinicaltrial.gov registration is for Phase A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In the &quot;optimization&quot; Phase A, the study will conduct randomized trials to assess&#xD;
      effectiveness, fidelity and cost and improve context-specific &quot;fit&quot; of prevention and&#xD;
      treatment interventions. Phase A will evaluate dynamic treatment packages tailored to the&#xD;
      needs of heavy alcohol users and mobile populations. Phase A will evaluate dynamic choice&#xD;
      prevention delivered in the context of antenatal/family planning clinics, the outpatient&#xD;
      department, in youth hubs, and in the community delivered by village health teams. Phase A&#xD;
      will evaluate a linkage intervention for patients with hypertension. Combining effectiveness&#xD;
      with implementation, costing and modelling outcomes, the study will optimize intervention&#xD;
      packages with context-specific adaptations in structured consultation with stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the &quot;evaluation&quot; Phase B, the study will evaluate the effects of Dynamic Prevention and&#xD;
      Dynamic Treatment intervention packages based on data from Phase A and new advances from&#xD;
      outside the study, alone and in combination, on prevention coverage, population-level viral&#xD;
      suppression, and HIV incidence, as well as other health outcomes, in a 2x2 balanced,&#xD;
      community randomized factorial design. Phase B will measure outcomes within longitudinal&#xD;
      cohorts of residents living within study communities. Phase B will evaluate population-level&#xD;
      intervention implementation outcomes, elucidate mechanisms of action and component&#xD;
      intervention effects, and estimate incremental costs and gains. Finally, the study will use&#xD;
      the HIV Synthesis Model to model outcomes and costs of Phase B results over a period of&#xD;
      decades to inform policy and stakeholder decisions to adopt successful strategies to achieve&#xD;
      and sustain HIV epidemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured stakeholder consultations are formally incorporated in the study design and&#xD;
      leverage regular and ongoing collaborations the study team has with the HIV, non-communicable&#xD;
      disease and general health leads in Kenya and Uganda Ministries of Health and PEPFAR&#xD;
      implementing partners at the national and the regional level.&#xD;
