  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammatory disease1 caused by&#xD;
      hypersensitivity of the immune system to an allergen, affecting 100 million people in Europe&#xD;
      2and 400 million of the global population.The etiology of AR is multifactorial, resulting&#xD;
      primarily from genetic predisposition, immunological response, and environmental&#xD;
      pollutants.AR traditionally has been classified as seasonal (SAR) or perennial (PAR)&#xD;
      depending on the causes and duration of symptoms. Some patients with AR prefer complementary&#xD;
      and alternative medicine for their symptoms, with nearly 20% receiving acupuncture. According&#xD;
      to the updated practice parameter of rhinitis in 2020, the use of acupuncture for the&#xD;
      treatment of AR was not recommended due to a lack of well-controlled studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located under a thin (1-2 mm) layer of mucosa in the&#xD;
      pterygopalatine fossa, consists of sensory fibers that innervate the nasopharynx, nasal&#xD;
      cavity, and palate.Several studies have reported the benefit of SPG stimulation in chronic&#xD;
      cluster headache and acute ischaemic stroke. Compared with traditional acupoints selected on&#xD;
      basis of traditional meridian theory, acupuncture at SPG(inserting a needle through SPG&#xD;
      acupoint (near ST7, Xiaguan) to reach and directly stimulate the SPG) may help patients&#xD;
      ameliorate nasal symptoms immediately and improve quality of life by increasing sympathetic&#xD;
      nerve excitability, but the evidence is inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have designed this three-armed, randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      acupuncture at SPG for the treatment of SAR. We hypothesize that acupuncture at SPG plus&#xD;
      rescue medication is superior to sham acupuncture plus RM and RM alone in the treatment of&#xD;
      SAR.&#xD;

    <time_frame>weeks 1-4</time_frame>
    <description>The average daily Combined Symptoms and Medication Score (CSMS) is the sum of the daily symptom score (dSS) plus daily medication score (dMS) . The dSS contains a 6-item scale referring to nasal symptoms (4 items) and ocular symptoms (2 items), with each item scored using a Likert scale of 0 to 3. The dSS will be calculated as a mean of all non-missing dSS divided by the number of individual symptoms (range, o to 3). The dMS will again be calculated as an average of daily symptom relief medication score, with a range of 0 to 3.</description>

    <description>Sterile single-use stainless steel needles (size 0.35 mm × 55 mm) (YiDaiFu brand, Suzhou Tianyi Acupuncture Instrument Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China) will be utilized. Participants in lateral position, the acupoints area will be sterilized with 75% alcohol. To stimulate SPG, the needles will be inserted in the medial superior anterior direction to a depth of approximately 55 mm33 until the participants report a special sensation radiating toward the nose or the upper teeth. After that, the needle will be withdrew slightly. The needles will be retained for 30 minutes after three stimulation. Rescue medication are permitted when participants feel that their symptoms are intolerable.</description>

    <description>The acupuncture procedure will be similar to that of the acupuncture group. After sterilizing the skin, the 0.35 × 25 mm disposable needle will be vertically inserted at SPG acupoint about 3-5 mm. No needle manipulation will be conducted to avoid the deqi response.
