    <textblock>
      This study assesses the potential benefit of adjuvant platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release (CTR) for patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTR is a rather&#xD;
      common procedure performed and seems to be quite effective for those with moderate CTS, but a&#xD;
      number of patients with severe CTS do not have quite the same response post-CTR. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit patients who fall into the severe CTS category and compare CTR&#xD;
      with and without adjuvant PRP to see if PRP can improve outcomes of this common surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Study team recruits patients with severe CTS who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
           in an outpatient hand surgery clinic. Patients will be consented by the research team if&#xD;
           the patient agrees to participate in the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This will be a single blinded study, and participants will have an equal chance to be&#xD;
           placed in either group. Participants will be randomized using permuted block&#xD;
           randomization predetermined by our dedicated orthopedic biostatistician into two study&#xD;
           groups: those that undergo CTR with adjuvant intra-operative PRP and those that undergo&#xD;
           CTR without adjuvant PRP. All participants will have a pre-operative&#xD;
           electromyography/nerve conduction study (EMG/NCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Primary outcome measures (BCTQ and grip strength), and secondary outcome measures&#xD;
           (PROMIS; 2 point discrimination - thumb, index finger and middle finger; key pinch; 3&#xD;
           finger pinch; and EMG/NCS results) will be collected and stored in REDCap at initial&#xD;
           visit. BCTQ and PROMIS will actually be available online for patient to complete at the&#xD;
           patient's convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will undergo CTR with or without adjuvant PRP (based on assigned study group).&#xD;
           Patients will not know which group the subject is in (single blinded).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. BCTQ and PROMIS will be collected online at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months&#xD;
           post-operatively. EMG/NCS will only be performed preoperatively and at 12 months&#xD;
           post-operatively in the Sports Medicine clinic. At these visits, the investigators will&#xD;
           also collect data on 2 point discrimination, grip strength, key pinch, and 3 finger&#xD;
           pinch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The investigators will store data in REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Data will be analyzed with the assistance of our biostatistician, and results will be&#xD;
           written up.&#xD;
