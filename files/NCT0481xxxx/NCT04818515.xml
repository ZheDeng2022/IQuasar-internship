  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common neurological disorder typically characterized by attacks of throbbing,&#xD;
      moderate to severe headache, often associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light&#xD;
      and sound. This study will assess the drug to drug interaction between atogepant and&#xD;
      ubrogepant and assess the safety of atogepant and ubrogepant, when given alone or in&#xD;
      combination, in adult participants with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atogepant is an investigational (unapproved) drug for the preventative treatment of migraine.&#xD;
      Ubrogepant is a drug approved for the acute treatment of migraine. Adult participants with a&#xD;
      history of migraine will be enrolled. Approximately, 30 participants will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study in multiple sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral tablets of ubrogepant, followed be oral tablets of atogepant,&#xD;
      followed by administration of oral tablets of atogepant and ubrogepant in combination. The&#xD;
      study duration will be 30 days with a 7 day follow period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a&#xD;
      hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments,&#xD;
      telephone assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects, and clinician-rated&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
