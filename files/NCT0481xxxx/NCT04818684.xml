        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. PALLIATIVE CARE UNITS (USP) 35 palliative care unit will be drawn at random among the&#xD;
             164 French palliative care unit (www.sfap.org). In the event of refusal of&#xD;
             participation, the drawing of lots will continue until 35 participating palliative&#xD;
             care unit are obtained. The inclusion criteria for palliative care units were&#xD;
             determined from the survey carried out in 2013 by the National End of Life Observatory&#xD;
             on palliative care units in France. In order for there to be representativeness, the&#xD;
             status of the palliative care unit will be taken into account from the national&#xD;
             University Hospital (CHU) distribution, excluding CHU in the public sector, private&#xD;
             non-profit sector, private for-profit sector. Thus, out of the 35 palliative care&#xD;
             units: 7 will be within CHU, 16 will be outside CHU in the public sector, 7 will be in&#xD;
             the private non-profit sector, and 5 in the private for-profit sector (criteria&#xD;
             determined from the survey of the National End of Life Observatory in 2013) by&#xD;
             ensuring that there are no more than 3 palliative care units in the same department&#xD;
             (this in order to avoid that a geographical territory is over-represented, which would&#xD;
             be liable to bias the results).&#xD;
&#xD;

             palliative care units (doctors, psychologists, nursing assistants, nurses,&#xD;
             socio-educational assistant) as well as the coordinator of support volunteers and a&#xD;
