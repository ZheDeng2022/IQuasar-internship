  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to test a computerized cognitive bias modification&#xD;
      program (CBM) to treat attention and interpretive biases in patients with Intermittent&#xD;
      Explosive Disorder, a disorder characterized by habitual engagement in aggressive behavior.&#xD;
      Efficacy of the CBM program will be assessed via a small randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing CBM to a computerized control condition. This training program would consist of a&#xD;
      four-week regimen of twice-weekly 30-minute sessions (8 sessions total) during which&#xD;
      individuals would learn to: (a) focus attention away from threatening words toward neutral&#xD;
      words [attention bias], and (b) to disambiguate ambiguous interpersonal scenarios using more&#xD;
      benign, rather than threatening, interpretations [interpretive bias]. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete behavioral measures of attention bias and interpretive bias, as well as&#xD;
      self-report measures of anger / aggression, interpretive bias, emotion regulation and life&#xD;
      satisfaction at baseline (pre-training), post-training, and 1-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Attention (ATT) and interpretation (ITT) bias training. Participants complete the ATT and ITT tasks twice per week for four weeks. The ATT trains attention toward neutral stimuli and away from negative stimuli. On trials with one neutral and one threat word, the probe will always follow the location of the neutral word. Therefore, there is a contingency between the valence of the word and the location of the probe. Participants will be asked to indicate which type of probe had appeared in each trial by pressing a corresponding button as rapidly and accurately as possible. The ITT trains participants to make benign (vs. threatening) interpretations of socially-ambiguous scenarios. For each trial, a word suggesting a socially threatening or benign interpretation is presented then replaced by a sentence describing a socially-ambiguous scenario. Participants indicate if they thought the word and sentence were related. Participants will receive corrective feedback after each trial.</description>

    <description>A combination of attention (ATT-C) and interpretation (ITT-C) control tasks&#xD;
These tasks are identical to the experimental tasks (ATT and ITT) with the exceptions that:&#xD;
ATT-C: It is designed to train attention toward neither neutral nor the threat stimuli. This will be achieved by having an equal number of probes follow the location of the threatening word and the neutral word.&#xD;
ITT-C: It is not designed to train benign interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios. Thus, no feedback will be given during the inter-trial interval, rather participants will see a blank screen between trials.&#xD;
Participants will complete both the ATT-C and ITT-C tasks twice per week for four weeks, totaling to eight experimental sessions.</description>
