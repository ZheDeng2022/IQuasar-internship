  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a research repository, comprised of data collected in&#xD;
      the course of physical rehabilitation programs for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) using the&#xD;
      medical device SWORD Phoenix®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow the company to ascertain the acceptance, engagement and effectiveness of&#xD;
      programs using this asynchronous tele-rehabilitation platform in the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      MSDs.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data that will be collected in the scope of this registry includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. data that is sourced from the subject, which will be collected by the physical therapist&#xD;
           managing that subject;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. data that is generated by the physical therapist through interaction with the web-based&#xD;
           Portal (i.e. session composition in terms of exercises, sets, repetitions, usage or not&#xD;
           of external resistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. data that is generated by the subject through interaction with the app (i.e. pain and&#xD;
           fatigue levels, satisfaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. data that is generated automatically by the medical device (i.e. range of motion,&#xD;
           compliance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and objective analysis of the collected data will allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continuous monitoring of the safety of this medical device, under the post-marketing&#xD;
           surveillance process;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitoring of user needs, engagement and satisfaction to guide further improvements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis of the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs using this medical device;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlation of clinical outcomes with patient's demographic and clinical profiles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compilation of patient cohorts to increase and disseminate knowledge on each disorder,&#xD;
           its progression and response to physical therapy programs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Explore the cost-efficiency of physical therapy programs involving SWORD Phoenix®&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Development of novel intelligent tools to assist therapists with patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the evolution of patient's clinical condition along the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program, objectively estimated through the monitoring data collected using&#xD;
      SWORD Phoenix®, as part of patients' supervision routine. Depending on the condition, primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcome measures vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case, this registry will include a complete characterisation of the clinical&#xD;
      condition, as well as the periodic assessment of: a) joints' range of motion (collect by the&#xD;
      medical device); b) performance indicators (through condition-specific tests); c)&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes (obtained using internationally validated pathology-specific&#xD;
      questionnaires); d) pain and fatigue levels (reported by patients by the end of each&#xD;
      therapeutic exercise session); e) compliance; f) patient satisfaction&#xD;

    <measure>Timed-up-and-go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, each four weeks after initiation of rehabilitation program, and periodical follow-up assessments (each 8 weeks) until 2 years after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in condition-specific clinical outcomes over time measured through the TUG test. The TUG consists on the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. As a reference, patients treated with conventional physiotherapy 6 months after total knee replacement reported a TUG of 9.1 seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, each four weeks after initiation of rehabilitation program, and periodical follow-up assessments (each 8 weeks) until 2 years after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in condition-specific clinical outcomes over time, measured through the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).&#xD;
FAAM is a self-report measure that assesses physical function of individuals with lower leg, foot, and ankle musculoskeletal disorders. Thus instrument included 2 subscales: 1) Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) with 21 items and 2) Sports with 8 items. For each subscale patients are asked to answer each question with a single response that most clearly describes their condition within past week. To calculate the score for either subscale, the total number of points are added, divided by the total number os possible points (ADLs-84; Sports-32) and then multiplied by 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome Score (CM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, each four weeks after initiation of rehabilitation program, and periodical follow-up assessments (each 8 weeks) until 2 years after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in condition-specific clinical outcomes over time, measured through the CM score.&#xD;
The scale consists of:&#xD;
Subjective variables: a) Pain - Absence of pain gets maximum score of 15; b) Limitation of Activities of daily living (sleep, work, recreation/sport). No limitations get maximum score, 20. The subjective variables add to a maximum score of 35.&#xD;
Objective variables: c) Range of motion - Maximum score 40; d) Strength - Maximum Score 25 Objective variables add to a total of 65. Total Constant Score is calculated by adding the scores from subjective and objective variables. The maximum possible total score is 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, each four weeks after initiation of rehabilitation program, and periodical follow-up assessments (each 8 weeks) until 2 years after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in condition-specific clinical outcomes over time measured through the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). \ The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>
