  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to find a relationship between the positioning of the foetus before and&#xD;
      during birth and the results of obstetrics and to determine their incidence in the Polish&#xD;
      population. The study will be conducted by combining the use of ultrasound diagnostics,&#xD;
      midwives observations during childbirth, analysis of medical documentation and a&#xD;
      questionnaire on the activity of examined women. The obtained results will be used to prepare&#xD;
      guidelines for the birth in a particular foetus position.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the examination is to describe the difficulties associated with delivery in a&#xD;
      non-optimal position of the fetus. Initial observations show that such childbirth is&#xD;
      perceived as difficult by both the women giving birth and the staff. The aim of the study is&#xD;
      to describe the level of difficulty of this labor, expressed as the experience of the woman,&#xD;
      as well as all the elements that may affect the difficulty of this labor, for example, slower&#xD;
      or no progress in labor, disturbances in systolic function, injuries, the need to use&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia, increased blood loss.&#xD;
