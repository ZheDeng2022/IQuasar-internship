  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation or anaesthesia is necessary to be able to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      on children who cannot keep still or are uncooperative, and thus the targets of maximum&#xD;
      patient safety, successful imaging, and the highest imaging quality can be achieved. There&#xD;
      are various drugs for sedation in MRI. A child with Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (AED) has&#xD;
      a state of consciousness which can be described as &quot;irritable, uncompromising, inconsistent,&#xD;
      crying inconsistently, wailing, and kicking&quot;. The incidence of AED worldwide has been&#xD;
      reported to vary between 18% and 80%, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. This&#xD;
      difference can usually be explained by the use of different scales and defining criteria. In&#xD;
      2004, Sikich and Lerman developed the Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale,&#xD;
      including cognitive evaluation components in addition to agitation behaviours, and the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of this scale have been proven. In a study of anaesthesia early&#xD;
      delirium in children by Bong et al.7 a score of ≥10 on the PAED scale was shown to have the&#xD;
      greatest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of anaesthesia early delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the occurrence of emergence delirium,&#xD;
      and recovery, of propofol and ketofol in paediatric patients undergoing diagnostic MRI&#xD;
      following premedication with intranasal dexmedetomidine and midazolam.&#xD;

      This was a prospective, observational, and single-center study conducted between&#xD;
      July-November 2018. The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. The study&#xD;
      was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were separated into four groups according to the anaesthetic agents&#xD;
      given.Intranasal premedication was applied to all the patients, then an intravenous cannula&#xD;
      was placed and the anaesthetic agents were administered intravenously. The Ramsay Sedation&#xD;
      Scale (RSS) was used to evaluate the level of sedation, with a target of 5 points. The RSS is&#xD;
      scored from 1-6 as follows: 1: the patient is worried and anxious, or restless, 2: the&#xD;
      patient is calm and co-operative, and can be directed, 3: the patient only responds to&#xD;
      instructions, 4: the patient responds rapidly to painful stimuli, 5: the patient demonstrates&#xD;
      a slow response to painful stimuli, 6: the patient does not respond. When RSS 5 was reached&#xD;
      following the first bolus dose of the drug, an additional dose was administered. When RSS 5&#xD;
      was obtained and hemodynamic stability was ensured, the patient was placed on the MRI table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was monitored in the recovery room for regaining consciousness for up to 30 mins&#xD;
      after the procedure. AED was evaluated using the PAED scale by a nurse trained in the use of&#xD;
      this scale. PAED scoring was repeated every 5 mins until the patient was discharged from the&#xD;
      recovery room. If the PAED score was ≥10, a diagnosis of AED was made. Adverse events such as&#xD;
      laryngospasm, desaturation (SpO2 &lt;95%), respiratory depression, bradycardia, allergy,&#xD;
      hiccoughs, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting were recorded. When a Modified Aldrete Score of &gt;9&#xD;
      was obtained, the child was observed for a further 15 mins then transferred from the recovery&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
