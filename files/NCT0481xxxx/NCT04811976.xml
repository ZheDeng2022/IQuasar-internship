    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention is currently one of the effective methods for the&#xD;
      treatment of ACS. Unfortunately, the incidence of ISR is as high as 10%-20% at 3-6 months&#xD;
      after PCI. So it is necessary to identify the potential risk factors to provide evidence for&#xD;
      the prevention of ISR. Current research shows that anxiety and depression are related to the&#xD;
      increased risk of major adverse cardiac events and mortality in patients with acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. But there remains a relative paucity of evidence for the association&#xD;
      between anxiety and depression and in-stent restenosis (ISR) .So a retrospective cohort study&#xD;
      was conducted in the first hospital of Qinhuangdao in 2015-2020. The patients who underwent&#xD;
      coronary angiography 1 year after PCI in our hospital from January 2015 to September 2020&#xD;
      were selected. Patients were divided into ISR and non-ISR groups depending on the follow-up&#xD;
      coronary angiography results. Logistic regression model was utilized for analyzing the&#xD;
      association of depression and anxiety with the in-stent restenosis (ISR) after PCI.&#xD;

      Percutaneous coronary intervention is currently one of the effective methods for the&#xD;
      treatment of ACS. Unfortunately, postoperative in-stent restenosis (ISR) is still inevitable.&#xD;
      The incidence of ISR is as high as 10%-20% at 3-6 months after PCI. And its prevention and&#xD;
      treatment is very difficult clinical problems. So it is necessary to identify the potential&#xD;
      risk factors to provide evidence for the prevention of ISR. Current research shows that&#xD;
      anxiety and depression are related to the increased risk of major adverse cardiac events and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. But there remains a relative paucity&#xD;
      of evidence for the association between anxiety and depression and in-stent restenosis (ISR)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the first hospital of Qinhuangdao in 2015-2020.&#xD;
      The patients who underwent coronary angiography 1 year after PCI in our hospital from January&#xD;
      2015 to September 2020 were selected. Patients were divided into ISR and non-ISR groups&#xD;
      depending on the follow-up coronary angiography results. Every 3 months until 12 months, the&#xD;
      patients were consecutively recruited and followed up. Anxiety and depression were assessed&#xD;
      using the Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and&#xD;
      psychosomatic symptom scale at each follow-up timepoint. Relative clinical information was&#xD;
      recorded and analyzed. Logistic regression model was utilized for analyzing the association&#xD;
      of depression and anxiety with the in-stent restenosis (ISR) after PCI.&#xD;

    <description>Because of the recurrence of symptoms, patients who have done the PCI more than 12 months do the coronary angiography in our hospital. Two interventionists were assigned to record the coronary angiography and complete the corresponding diagnosis in an independent way. If there was a difference in diagnosis, a third doctor was assigned to perform the correlation analysis and analyze and process the other data of the study subjects by blind method. In-stent restenosis was defined asin-stenosis of lumen diameter ≥50% occurred in the diseased vessels, including the coronary arteries in the stent and at both ends of the stent ≤5 mm from the edge of the stent.</description>
