  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective observational cohort study is to answer the following&#xD;
      clinically important questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with a pre-operative history of ICBs, what is the likelihood of improvement&#xD;
           or deterioration in ICBs post-operatively?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the risk of developing post-operative de novo ICBs after Subthalamic Nucleus DBS&#xD;
           (STN DBS)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which factors are important in predicting changes in ICBs after STN DBS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the impact of ICBs on carer's quality of life QoL and burden?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will record outcomes related to ICBs for PD patients who have already been selected&#xD;
      for DBS therapy as a routine clinical treatment in participating in DBS operating centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is routine practice to assess ICBs before DBS decisions are made, but the manner varies&#xD;
      across DBS operating centres. The only additional factor to the routine DBS clinical pathway&#xD;
      in this study is that the centres involved will perform assessments in a uniform manner to&#xD;
      allow data to be combined. A unified set of clinical assessment scales for Impulsive Control&#xD;
      Disorders ICDs and ICBs, as well as other relevant neuropsychiatric symptom assessment, will&#xD;
      be added to routine pre- and post-operational clinical assessments for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the change in severity of ICBs. If subjects score above&#xD;
      1 in any of given questions on QUIP-RS, or if subjects had disagreement with carers regarding&#xD;
      scores, The Parkinson's Impulse-Control Scale, PICs will be triggered. PICs then will be&#xD;
      administered by our trained research fellow (AA), over phone or in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other scales to be administered are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parkinson's disease questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) at baseline and Clinician's Global&#xD;
           Impression - Improvement scale (GGI-I) post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Work and Social Adjustment Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be performed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be analysed to ascertain potential predictive measures for ICBS&#xD;
      development/change.&#xD;

    <description>In deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy, a specific anatomical target in the brain is stimulated via surgically fixed electrodes. These electrodes release electrical currents of a specific voltage, wavelength, and frequency. They are connected via subcutaneous wires to a device called an implantable pulse generator (IPG) which is surgically fixed on chest wall, beneath the clavicle. After electrodes and IPG are successfully installed, a clinician will be able to adjust and modulate the stimulation via a remote device connected to the IPG to obtain a maximum potential benefit. Deep brain stimulation has been used in clinics to treat various neurologic diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, mainly movement disorders.</description>
