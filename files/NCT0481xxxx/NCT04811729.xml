  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Main objective: to verify the effectiveness of a brief intervention, based on the&#xD;
           motivational interview (MI), in patients with excessive alcohol consumption assisted in&#xD;
           Primary Care (PC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: a multicenter, randomized, cluster-controlled clinical trial with two parallel&#xD;
           arms. PC professionals will be randomized to one of the two study groups: 1)&#xD;
           Experimental Group (EG): MI-based approach; 2) Control group (CG): usual care. At least&#xD;
           50 family doctors, residents and nurses will participate, recruiting PC patients (n =&#xD;
           394). GE intervention: Training program to acquire specific skills on approaching risky&#xD;
           alcohol consumption. It will consist of a workshop, with two video recordings of&#xD;
           consultations with simulated standardized patients, before and after it, with each&#xD;
           participant receiving formative feedback at the end. -Intervention GC: medical advice&#xD;
           that is usually performed in these patients. To measure the knowledge and attitude of&#xD;
           professionals in dealing with patients with alcohol consumption, they will fill out a&#xD;
           validated questionnaire. In addition, expert evaluators, after viewing the video&#xD;
           recordings, will fill out a check-list to check the attitude of each professional, using&#xD;
           the EVEM Scale. -Study population: patients ≥14 years of age with risky consumption,&#xD;
           detected by the professional in health centers in the province of Córdoba (Spain).&#xD;
           Sample size: Assuming a loss rate of 5%, and the &quot;cluster design effect&quot;, the number of&#xD;
           subjects to be recruited is estimated at 394 (197 / group). Intervention control&#xD;
           mechanism: each participant will be audio-recorded with a real patient in a randomly&#xD;
           chosen visit, evaluating her skills with the EVEM scale. The follow-up period for each&#xD;
           patient will be 12 months, with 5 visits (initial, per month, 3 months, 6 months and 12&#xD;
           months) and 4 interleaved telephone contacts. The main outcome variable will be the&#xD;
           level of self-reported alcohol consumption and the AUDIT questionnaire score.&#xD;
           -Statistical analysis by intention to treat. Descriptive analysis and initial&#xD;
           comparability of the groups will be carried out, and the effect of the intervention&#xD;
           (dependent variable: abstinence or consumption reduction and AUDIT score) will be&#xD;
           evaluated through bivariate and multivariate analysis.&#xD;

      -  Design: controlled, cluster-randomized, open-label, two-parallel-arm, multicenter&#xD;
           clinical trial. Primary Care professionals will be randomized to one of the two study&#xD;
           groups: 1) Experimental Group (EG): they will apply an approach based on Motivational&#xD;
           interview (MI), previously receiving a training program. 2) Control group (CG): usual&#xD;
           care. They will receive an instructional program in order to avoid the &quot;contamination&quot;&#xD;
           effect of the motivational approach. At least 50 professionals (family doctors,&#xD;
           residents and nurses) will participate, each of whom will recruit (through opportunistic&#xD;
           search) 9-10 PC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GE intervention: they will receive a 20-hour training program to acquire specific skills&#xD;
           on the approach to patients with risky consumption, which will consist of a workshop,&#xD;
           with two video recordings of consultations with simulated standardized patients, one&#xD;
           before and others after the same, each participant receiving at the end a personalized&#xD;
           training feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CG intervention: they will not receive the training program in MI, instructing them to&#xD;
           carry out the medical advice that they usually carry out in these patients (informative&#xD;
           model); They will also be videotaped, in order to verify that the approach they carry&#xD;
           out is not motivational. On the other hand, both groups will receive an 8-hour workshop&#xD;
           on detection, management and approach to the patient with excessive alcohol consumption,&#xD;
           based on the recommendations and the action algorithm postulated by the PAPPS. To&#xD;
           measure the knowledge and attitude of the professionals of both groups in relation to&#xD;
           the approach of the patient with alcohol consumption, they will fill out a questionnaire&#xD;
           validated by our group. In addition, expert evaluators, after viewing the video&#xD;
           recordings, will fill out a check-list to check the attitude of each professional, using&#xD;
           the EVEM Scale, which has been validated by members of our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Material and / or techniques to be used: The information of the participants will be&#xD;
           obtained from tools already validated to assess risk alcohol consumption [Alcohol Use&#xD;
           Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), the motivational interview (EVEM questionnaire)]&#xD;
           and satisfaction of the doctor-patient (PDRQ-9). In addition, the MCRS scale (Medical&#xD;
           Condition Regard Scale) will be used to evaluate the attitude of health workers in the&#xD;
           approach to alcohol, which has not been validated in Spanish to date. The Spanish&#xD;
           validation process will be carried out by this research group. -Alcohol Use Disorder&#xD;
           Identification Test (AUDIT). Tool designed to identify risky alcohol consumption and&#xD;
           comprises 10 questions divided into 3 conceptual domains. The first domain assesses&#xD;
           recent alcohol consumption and contains 3 questions (frequency of consumption, typical&#xD;
           amount and frequency of heavy consumption). The second domain assesses symptoms of&#xD;
           dependence through 3 items (loss of control over consumption, increased relevance of&#xD;
           consumption and morning consumption) and finally the third domain assesses harmful&#xD;
           alcohol consumption through 4 questions (Feeling of guilt after consumption , memory&#xD;
           gaps, alcohol-related injuries and environmental concern about consumption). A result&#xD;
           equal to or greater than 8 is considered indicative of risky and harmful consumption, as&#xD;
           well as a possible dependence on alcohol. -Evaluation Scale of the Motivational&#xD;
           Interview (EVEM). 14-item scale with a score of 0 to 4, created and validated by members&#xD;
           of our group, to assess encounters between professionals and patients in which MS is&#xD;
           used. This scale analyzes: 1) empathy; 2) facilitation for the patient to position&#xD;
           himself; 3) works in accordance with the patient; 4) use open questions; 5) perform&#xD;
           reflective listening; 6) performs summaries; 7) validate the patient; 8) agreement of&#xD;
           change objectives; 9) promotes the design of action / plan with the patient; 10) avoid&#xD;
           discord with the patient; 11) develop a maintenance plan with the patient; 12) global&#xD;
           spirit: evocation, collaboration, autonomy, understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ-9). 9-question scale that assesses the&#xD;
           doctor-patient relationship in clinical practice. Likert-type scale with 5 categories: 1&#xD;
           (&quot;not at all appropriate&quot;), 2 (&quot;somewhat appropriate&quot;), 3 (&quot;appropriate&quot;), 4 (&quot;quite&#xD;
           appropriate&quot;) and 5 (&quot;very appropriate&quot;). This scale has been validated in Spanish and&#xD;
           will allow knowing the satisfaction of the patient in the alcohol approach developed by&#xD;
           the health worker. -Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS). 11-question scale that&#xD;
           assesses the attitude of health workers in the clinical approach. It is a Likert-type&#xD;
           scale with 6 categories (1 = totally disagree, 6 = totally agree). It will be validated&#xD;
           in Spanish by our research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location: Health Centers of the Andalus Health Service of the province of Córdoba&#xD;
           (Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: patients aged 14 or over with risky alcohol consumption (28 Standard&#xD;
           Drink Units -SDU- / week in men and 17 SDU / week in women) users of PC services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: the main evaluation criterion will be the self-reported consumption by the&#xD;
           patient. Based on a previous study carried out by members of our team, and to detect a&#xD;
           difference of 20% between the percentage of patients in abstinence (partial or total)&#xD;
           between the EG (37%) and the CG (20%); for an alpha error of 5%, a statistical power of&#xD;
           80%, the size would be 220 subjects (110 / group). Assuming a 5% loss rate and being a&#xD;
           cluster randomization system, we will take into account the &quot;design effect&quot;. Estimates&#xD;
           of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) in CCT by cluster in PC show that&#xD;
           they are generally less than 0.05. This ICC translates, for a cluster size of 15, into a&#xD;
           design effect that corresponds to a factor of 1.7. Assuming this value, the size would&#xD;
           be 394 subjects to be recruited (197 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: The randomization unit will be the healthcare professional and the&#xD;
           intervention unit will be the patient. Professionals will be assigned randomly and&#xD;
           equally (1:1) to one of the two study groups. -Mechanism of control of the&#xD;
           interventions: each participant will also be videotaped with a real patient in a visit&#xD;
           chosen at random, also evaluating her skills with the EVEM scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follow-up period for each patient will be 12 months, with 5 visits (initial, per&#xD;
           month, at 3 months, at 6 months and at 12 months), in addition to four interleaved&#xD;
           telephone contacts. -Study variables: The main outcome variable will be the level of&#xD;
           self-reported alcohol consumption (UBEs) and the score of the Alcohol Use Disorder&#xD;
           Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire.&#xD;
