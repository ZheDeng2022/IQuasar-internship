  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of a moderate amount of amino acids on the rate of water absorption&#xD;
      and availability as a precursor fluid for sweat. Young and healthy (male or female)&#xD;
      volunteers will take part in three experimental trials. In each trial, volunteers will be&#xD;
      given one of two commercially available sports drinks or a commercially available sport drink&#xD;
      with added amino acids in a double-blinded, randomised, crossover design. Each drink will be&#xD;
      a single 600 mL bolus. All beverages will be labelled with deuterium (D2O). Trials will be&#xD;
      compared for temporal accumulation of deuterium in plasma over the course of 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Whole blood measurements of haemoglobin and haematocrit will also be made and plasma volume&#xD;
      changes calculated. It is hypothesised that the amino acid trial will increase the rate of&#xD;
      fluid absorption.&#xD;
