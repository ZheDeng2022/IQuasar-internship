  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the duration of treatment effect and response to&#xD;
      re-treatment with subcutaneous injections of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) compared with&#xD;
      placebo in adult participants with knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study duration will be up to 28, 56, 68, or 80 weeks depending on treatment received&#xD;
           in the parent study and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participating in the Treatment Part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The treatment duration will be up to 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The visit frequency will be twice weekly during the Treatment Period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up extension study to determine duration of treatment effect and assess&#xD;
      long-term safety and response to re-treatment with PPS in participants with knee OA pain who&#xD;
      completed the parent study study (PARA_OA_002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study PARA_OA_006 consists of Follow-up Part 1 and Part 2 and a Treatment Part&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be enrolled in Study PARA_OA_006 at the completion of the parent&#xD;
      study and will enter the 6-month Follow-up Part 1. At the end of Follow-up Part 1,&#xD;
      participants will begin the Treatment Part of the study, continue to Follow-up Part 2, or end&#xD;
      the study depending on the treatment received in the parent study, their response to&#xD;
      treatment during the parent study, and/or their response status at the end of the Follow-up&#xD;
      Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Treatment Part will be administered twice weekly subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injections for 6 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PPS dose regimen will be 1 of the 3 dose regimens evaluated in Stage 1 of the parent&#xD;
           study and selected by the independent data monitoring committee (DMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo will be 0.9% w/v sodium chloride injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration of study participation will be approximately:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  28 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Part 1 and are not eligible to continue&#xD;
           to Follow-up Part 2 or the Treatment Part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  56 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Part 1 and the Treatment Part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  68 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Part 1, Follow-up Part 2 up to Week 40,&#xD;
           and the Treatment Part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  80 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Parts 1 and 2 or Follow-up Part 1,&#xD;
           Follow-up Part 2 up to Week 52 and the Treatment Part&#xD;

          -  Resting, supine blood pressure (BP) ≥ 160 mmHg in systolic pressure or &gt;= 100 mmHg in&#xD;
             diastolic pressure at Screening. If a participant is found to have uncontrolled and/or&#xD;
             untreated significant hypertension at Screening and anti-hypertensive treatment is&#xD;
             initiated, assessment for study eligibility should be deferred until BP and&#xD;
             anti-hypertensive medication have been stable for at least 1 month. For participants&#xD;
             with previously diagnosed hypertension, anti-hypertensive medications must be stable&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  An employee of the Sponsor, clinical research organisations or research site personnel&#xD;
