  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia, considered as a global epidemic, is rapidly rising in prevalence especially in east&#xD;
      Asian countries. Younger ages are associated with greater annual progression and thus early&#xD;
      onset myopia is likely to result in higher levels of final net myopia.[1] Myopia, especially&#xD;
      high myopia (more than -6.00D) is associated vision threatening complications such as&#xD;
      cataract, glaucoma, choroidal thinning, vitreous liquefaction, myopic maculopathy, retinal&#xD;
      detachment etc. Furthermore, myopia can affect the quality of life of an individual through&#xD;
      restriction of employment in certain fields such as aviation. Myopia also imposes economic&#xD;
      burden through the recurring cost of vision correction such as spectacles, contact lenses and&#xD;
      specialist consultation fee. It is therefore important to develop novel optical and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical strategies that can control or slow the progression of myopia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the strategies used to control or slow the progression of myopia are optical and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical methods. Among spectacles, bifocal spectacles with and without prism,&#xD;
      progressive addition lenses, spectacles altering peripheral hyperopic defocus, spectacles&#xD;
      imposing myopic defocus both centrally and peripherally and spectacles with multiple defocus&#xD;
      segments that imposes myopic defocus in front, midperiphery and periphery of the retina&#xD;
      (defocus incorporating multiple segments or DIMS) are used to reduce the progression[2-6]. Of&#xD;
      these, spectacles designed to alter peripheral defocus demonstrated a small treatment effect&#xD;
      in reducing myopia progression[6, 7]. Bifocal and progressive addition spectacles&#xD;
      demonstrated variable treatment effect in reducing progression of myopia. Among contact&#xD;
      lenses, multifocal contact lenses altering peripheral defocus, extended depth of focus&#xD;
      contact lenses altering higher order aberrations in order to degrade the retinal image behind&#xD;
      the retina have shown promising results in slowing myopia progression along with&#xD;
      orthokeratology treatment[8-12]. Among these, orthokeratology and multifocal soft contact&#xD;
      lenses (centre distance multifocal contact lenses) showed promising results in slowing myopia&#xD;
      progression[9, 12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical interventions include Atropine, Pirenzepine, 7-Methylxanthine and&#xD;
      Timolol[13].Atropine is the most widely used, with higher concentrations more effective.&#xD;
      Atropine 1% concentration demonstrated 60 to 80% reduction in progression of myopia. However,&#xD;
      ocular side effects such as blurred vision, photophobia etc associated with atropine makes it&#xD;
      a less appealing option. Among the various treatment approaches, spectacles pose the least or&#xD;
      minimal side effects compared to contact lenses, orthokeratology or pharmaceutical&#xD;
      strategies. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of novel myopia control&#xD;
      prototype spectacle design on wearability and physiological ocular response among myopic&#xD;
      children aged 7 to 14 years.&#xD;
