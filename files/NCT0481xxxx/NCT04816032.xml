    <textblock>
      Migration is a global phenomenon that produces several psychological impacts on the migrant&#xD;
      causing psychological changes and difficulties such as the development of psychological&#xD;
      diseases, the decrease of the life expectancy, insecurity, isolation, and poorness. These&#xD;
      diseases create a situation of emergency that has prompted the need to intervene with&#xD;
      specific psychological treatments. This study proposed to verify the effectiveness of&#xD;
      expressive writing on the elaborative processes of the migratory journey's trauma.&#xD;
      Participants were twenty-eight migrants of a reception center. A blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial was performed to divide them into three groups: an experimental sample that&#xD;
      performed the expressive writing treatment, a neutral sample that performed the neutral&#xD;
      description writing, and a control sample. The samples were assessed in three times through&#xD;
      self-report measures. The administration of expressive writing is expected to improve the&#xD;
      psychological health condition of migrants&#xD;

      Emigration is a global phenomenon with a significant impact in both, host countries and&#xD;
      especially on people who decide to migrate. Italy seems to be a chosen destination for&#xD;
      migrants, mainly due to its geographical position, as one of the European Union's border&#xD;
      countries. Italy is mentioned as the fifth European country in Europe about the number of&#xD;
      migrants. Currently, there are 5 million immigrants in Italy. Recent migratory flows in Italy&#xD;
      have changed the cultural background of the main communities residing in the country.&#xD;
      However, several studies have pointed out that the migration phenomenon is not a comfortable&#xD;
      linear process, on the contrary, there are difficulties related to migratory traveling and&#xD;
      the way it is carried out. Among others, the traveling experience could leave relevant marks&#xD;
      on a psychological level. Recent studies underlie the effect of migration on the development&#xD;
      of psychological diseases, on the loss of hope for the future that it affected the life&#xD;
      expectancy causing insecurity, isolation, and poorness, and producing modification on the&#xD;
      possible existing symptomatology. Moreover, the discrimination and disorientation that&#xD;
      migrants experience while traveling and in host countries seem to have a relationship with&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, many investigations applied psychological intervention to treat the described&#xD;
      symptomatology. The literature highlights the importance of the treatments such as&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, narrative exposure therapy, dynamic therapy, combined&#xD;
      psychological treatments, and combined psychological with pharmacological treatments. Of the&#xD;
      mentioned treatments, the narrative exposure treatment seems to be the less applied&#xD;
      intervention, a meta-analysis suggested a fairly effective application of NET on populations&#xD;
      with trauma, however, this result must be taken with caution. The NET is a trauma-focused&#xD;
      therapy, based on trauma expositions in an autobiographical context. This treatment provides&#xD;
      both verbal and non-verbal application, as the expressive writing-EW. Additionally,&#xD;
      Pennebaker considered that expressive writing referring to the own traumatic events with&#xD;
      emotional descriptions could be of help in the resolution of the own life narrations and the&#xD;
      insert of own memories in life history. The expressive writing technique applies to the own&#xD;
      serious traumatic events, from 3 to 5 consecutive days, for 15 minutes daily. This technique&#xD;
      is more structured compare to NET which can be both written and oral and doesn't necessarily&#xD;
      provide a brief exposition. The expressive writing is applied in a more extended context of&#xD;
      trauma, violence, war, natural catastrophe, cancer, and torture. Currently in literature,&#xD;
      there not seem to be any authoritative studies that have applied the expressive writing&#xD;
      technique to the trauma of the migratory journey. The present investigation allows extending&#xD;
      the acknowledgment of this treatment applied to a population of adult migrants submitted to&#xD;
      forced migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to provide evidence of the effectiveness of expressive writing on&#xD;
      mental and physical health in migrants considering the mediation role of the hope for the&#xD;
      future. The hypothesis was that migrants who performed an expressive writing treatment will&#xD;
      show a decrease in symptomatology in association with a greater sense of hope for the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involved three different samples: experimental, neutral, and control group. The&#xD;
      three samples were composed through a randomized controlled trial placing 22 participants for&#xD;
      each sample. The random allocation of participants within the three samples was blindly&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-profit association &quot;Medihospes&quot; located in Rome provided the migrant participants.&#xD;
      Each participant was invited to read and accept the study by completing and signing the&#xD;
      informed consent form. The inclusion criteria were age &gt;18 years and the refugees' or asylum&#xD;
      seekers' status. The exclusion criteria were psychiatric or neurologic diagnosis and drug&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was settled in three different times. At T0 time were administered a self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires' battery composed of four measures: Beck Hopelessness Scale, BHS, Toronto&#xD;
      Alexithymia Scale 20, TAS-20, Symptom Check-List Revised, SCL-90-R, Impact of Event&#xD;
      Scale-Revised, IES-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this first assessment, the participants of the experimental sample received the&#xD;
      expressive writing Pennebaker's treatment, the participants of the neutral sample received&#xD;
      instructions of writing on a general topic of their choice and the participants of the&#xD;
      control sample received no treatment or instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week to the treatment phase (T1) and after one month from T1 time (T2) the same&#xD;
      self-report questionnaire's battery was administered to all the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Pennebaker's expressive writing was applied for three consecutive days for 20&#xD;
      minutes daily. The participants of the experimental sample were asked to write about the&#xD;
      traumatic traveling experience, focalizing the attention on the deeper emotions, thoughts,&#xD;
      and feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of the neutral sample were asked to write about different topics of their&#xD;
      knowledge for three consecutive days for 20 minutes daily; the topics could relate the&#xD;
      description of the city, their room, their place where they live, or easy procedure like, how&#xD;
      to make a coffee (or something else), or to describe their population, trying to remain free&#xD;
      from deep emotions, thoughts or feelings.&#xD;

Higher scores show the presence of psychopathological symptomology and psychological complications. The range of scores are less 45 more 75 with cut-off 55.
