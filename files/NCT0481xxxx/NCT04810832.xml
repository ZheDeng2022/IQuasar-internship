    <textblock>
      Neurophysiologic evaluation of disorders of consciousness (DOC) patients in intensive care&#xD;
      unit include late auditory evoked potentials. It allows the physicians to record cerebral&#xD;
      responses of patients to auditory stimuli and in particularly to their own name (as the P3a&#xD;
      response). Numerous studies try to improve the relevance of the auditory stimuli used in this&#xD;
      paradigm and notably using more expressive stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators investigate the intracerebral correlates of the P3a responses recorded&#xD;
      on the scalp with neutral and more expressive stimuli.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Late auditory evoked potentials (as P3 wave) are used in neurophysiology to assess the level&#xD;
      of consciousness in DOC (disorder of consciousness) patients. The P3 wave, elicited by&#xD;
      listening standard and deviant stimuli, corresponds to the activation of a frontoparietal&#xD;
      network and is considered to reflect a cognitive attention task. Using the own name of the&#xD;
      patient as deviant stimuli improve the ability to detect the P3 wave because of the&#xD;
      particularly relevance of this stimulus for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human cognition, to identify the expressivity valence of a voice is essential. Neural&#xD;
      processing of expressive voices should involves more widespread brain areas than neutral&#xD;
      voices processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators investigate the intracerebral correlates of the P3a responses recorded&#xD;
      on the scalp to own-name stimuli uttered by neutral and more expressive voices (positive :&#xD;
      smiling voice or negative : rough voice) in adult pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients.&#xD;

Evoked related potentials are recorded on the scalp and with intracranial electrodes for each participant while they listen 3 paradigms successively and in a random order:&#xD;
i) their own name uttered by a smiling voice ii) their own name uttered by a neutral voice iii) their own name uttered by a rough voice</intervention_model_description>
