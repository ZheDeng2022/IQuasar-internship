  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With recent advances in gene editing, gene therapy is becoming a viable curative treatment&#xD;
      option for sickle cell disease. In order to do genetic manipulation, investigators need to&#xD;
      collect hematopoietic stem cells from patients with sickle cell disease. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators want to study the safety and feasibility of collecting peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cells from pediatric and young adult patients with sickle cell disease after administering&#xD;
      plerixafor. Studying these peripheral blood stem cells will help in optimizing the yield of&#xD;
      peripheral CD34+ cells from pediatric and young adult patients with sickle cell disease,&#xD;
      which in turn will help to develop better gene therapies for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety profile associated with administration of plerixafor in pediatric&#xD;
           and young adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the number of CD34+ cells/kg of body weight that can be collected with&#xD;
           peripheral apheresis after administration of plerixafor in pediatric and young adult&#xD;
           patients with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the kinetics of CD34+ cell mobilization in peripheral blood after - + cells&#xD;
           obtained from pediatric and young adult patients with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of hydroxyurea therapy on senescence in plerixafor-mobilized CD34+&#xD;
           cells obtained from pediatric and young adult patients with SCD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be enrolled sequentially, and no two participants will undergo drug&#xD;
      administration, mobilization or apheresis at the same time. A subsequent participant can only&#xD;
      receive the study drug when the previous participant has been safely apheresed and discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital. In the first stratum of the study only adult participants (18-25 years of&#xD;
      age) will be enrolled. Once plerixafor and apheresis has been shown to be safe and acceptable&#xD;
      in at least 5 adult participants, the study will enroll participants in the pediatric&#xD;
      stratum. Pediatric stratum will not be activated until all the patients in the adult stratum&#xD;
      have been evaluated and completed participation with acceptable results. In the pediatric&#xD;
      stratum, older children (14 years old and above) will be enrolled before younger children&#xD;
      (10-14 years old). After 10 participants, 14 years and older, have safely completed the study&#xD;
      participation, younger children 10-14 years old will be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic red blood cell exchange or simple red cell transfusions will be given within 7&#xD;
      days prior to plerixafor administration to participants targeting HbS &lt;30% to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of vaso-occlusive crisis and other events that may be associated with high&#xD;
      hemoglobin S levels.Hydroxyurea treatment should be stopped 4 weeks before mobilization.&#xD;
      Plerixafor administration and apheresis will be timed for participants already receiving&#xD;
      chronic transfusion therapy such that the plerixafor administration and apheresis coincides&#xD;
      with regularly timed transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergoing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization will receive a daily-dose&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration of plerixafor (Mozobil®) at 0.24 mg/kg on up to 2 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Leukapheresis will start approximately 4 hours after each dose of plerixafor is given.&#xD;
      This process lasts 4-10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 30 days after the last dose of plerixafor and then taken&#xD;
      off study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe SCD who are 10-25 years old and are willing to donate autologous&#xD;
             HSCs for advancing future gene therapy for SCD. Parents/legal guardians of&#xD;
             participants must be able and willing to consent for their participation in this&#xD;
             study. Severe SCD, for the purpose of this study, will be defined as patients who are&#xD;
             receiving chronic transfusion therapy due to SCD related complications. The need for&#xD;
             undergoing chronic transfusion therapy must be determined by the primary hematologist.&#xD;
             Some patients may continue to receive hydroxyurea in addition to and simultaneously&#xD;
             with blood transfusion therapy. Such patients are eligible for inclusion on the study&#xD;
             if they hold hydroxyurea for at least 4 weeks. The ability to hold hydroxyurea (or&#xD;
             not) with ongoing chronic transfusion therapy will be made by the primary hematologist&#xD;
             as well. All genotypes of SCD will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function: serum/plasma creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL and creatinine clearance&#xD;
             &gt; 50 mL/min (as calculated by the Crockcroft-Gault formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function: direct bilirubin &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal range,&#xD;
             AST and ALT &lt; 5 times the upper limit of normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood counts: WBC &gt; 3,000/mm^3, granulocytes &gt; 1,000/mm^3, hemoglobin &gt; 7.0 g/dL,&#xD;
             platelets &gt; 150,000/mm^3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing age should have a negative serum pregnancy test within&#xD;
             one week of beginning plerixafor administration, have had a hysterectomy, be&#xD;
             post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serologic tests for syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and HTLV-1/II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should either have a central line in place or be able to undergo&#xD;
             apheresis without the necessity of the insertion of a central venous catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants of childbearing potential should agree to use of an effective form of&#xD;
             contraception during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose of&#xD;
             plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status/Karnofsky score/Lansky score &gt;80.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. Female patients of childbearing age should have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test within one week of beginning plerixafor administration, except those that have&#xD;
             had a hysterectomy, or are post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer, excluding squamous carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and painful splenomegaly or splenomegaly (size greater than upper limit of&#xD;
             normal) or splenic sequestration determined by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous history of splenomegaly or splenic sequestration, unless HbS level of &lt;30% is&#xD;
             documented within 48-72 hours of each plerixafor dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving hydroxyurea will not be included in the study. However, they may be&#xD;
             included if the primary hematologist determines that hydroxyurea can be safely&#xD;
             discontinued for at least 4 weeks prior to the plerixafor administration and&#xD;
             apheresis. Generally, patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy can safely&#xD;
             discontinue hydroxyurea therapy as there is unlikely to be any added benefit, but this&#xD;
             will be determined by the primary treating hematologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor cardiac function, as defined by an ejection fraction &lt; 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically proven pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Emergency room admission or hospitalization in the past 14 days prior to first dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery in the past 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
