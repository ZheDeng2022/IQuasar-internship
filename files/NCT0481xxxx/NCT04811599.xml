      The purpose of this study is to analysize the relationship between the characteristics of&#xD;
      tongue image and the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases , then develop and validate a&#xD;
      deep learning algorithm for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases depending on tongue&#xD;
      images, so as to improve the objectiveness and intelligence of tongue diagnosis. At the same&#xD;
      time, gastrointestinal flora of common tongue images were analyzed in order to provide a&#xD;
      microecological basis for understanding the relationship between tongue images and digestive&#xD;
      tract diseases.&#xD;

      Tongue diagnosis is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine.According to&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine theory,health condition can assessed by observing tougue&#xD;
      features,including color, gloss, shape and coating of the tongue, tongue features reflect&#xD;
      gastric mucosal state, disease classification and prognosis. Recently, deep learning based on&#xD;
      central neural networks (CNN) has shownTongue diagnosis is an important part of traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine.According to traditional Chinese medicine theory,health condition can&#xD;
      assessed by observing tougue features,including color, gloss, shape and coating of the&#xD;
      tongue, tongue features reflect gastric mucosal state, disease classification and prognosis.&#xD;
      Recently, deep learning based on central neural networks (CNN) has shown multiple potential&#xD;
      in detecting and diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases. However, there is still a blank in&#xD;
      recognition of gastrointestinal diseases .This study aims to develop and validate a deep&#xD;
      learning algorithm for the diagnosis of digestive tract diseases depending on tongue&#xD;
      images,and analyze gastrointestinal flora of common tongue images.&#xD;
