  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the value of non invasive continuous transcutaneous PtC02&#xD;
      monitoring for ventilatory withdrawal guidance in neuro-injured patients and to predict the&#xD;
      risk of extubation failure in this category of patients, particularly at risk of&#xD;
      re-intubation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extubation is part of the daily routine in intensive care and intensive care units. If the&#xD;
      procedures for weaning from mechanical ventilation are well supervised by the establishment,&#xD;
      in particular, of standardized treatment protocols, they nevertheless remain technical&#xD;
      procedures at risk and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extubation, defined by the withdrawal of the intubation probe, is to be distinguished from&#xD;
      the period known as ventilatory &quot;weaning&quot; or &quot;ventilation&quot; which is represented by the&#xD;
      separation of the patient from the invasive mechanical ventilation device. These 2 successive&#xD;
      phases (deventilation then extubation) must be anticipated as best as possible by the&#xD;
      intensivist in order to detect the risk factors and complications inherent in one or the&#xD;
      other of the stages. A patient can thus be ventilable but not extubable and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extubation failure can be defined as the need for early reintubation within 48-72 hours of&#xD;
      scheduled intensive care extubation. This definition takes into account the contribution of&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) that can be applied in the direct consequences of extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk factors specific to failure of extubation are well identified in the literature and&#xD;
      differ from those associated with failure of ventilatory weaning. These risk factors are&#xD;
      multiple but are represented in particular by obstruction of the airways, ineffectiveness of&#xD;
      cough or bronchial congestion, swallowing disturbances and disturbances of consciousness&#xD;
      among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of transcutaneous pressure in CO2 (PtCO2) has been developed over the past twenty&#xD;
      years as a reflection of arterial pressure in CO2 (PaCO2). To date, this type of monitoring&#xD;
      has been developed mainly in neonatal care due to its non-invasive nature. This continuous&#xD;
      monitoring could be an interesting tool in the evaluation of the gas exchange of the patient&#xD;
      under mechanical ventilation, in particular in a medical or surgical resuscitation&#xD;
      environment. This tool could thus make it possible to participate in the prediction of&#xD;
      extubation failure in medical intensive care or general surgery during ventilatory weaning&#xD;
      tests. There is indeed a good correlation between PaC02 and PtC02 in the intensive care&#xD;
      patient population for PaC02 values &lt;60 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to study the benefit of using transcutaneous PtC02 monitoring for&#xD;
      guiding ventilatory weaning in neuro-injured patients and predicting the risk of extubation&#xD;
      failure in this category of patients, particularly at risk of re-intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study carried out is therefore to assess the predictive value of&#xD;
      the observed variation in PtCO2 during a spontaneous ventilation weaning test in a population&#xD;
      of neuro-resuscitation patients at high risk of reintubation.&#xD;
