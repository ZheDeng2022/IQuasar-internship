      Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess feasibility and acceptability of all protocol components of a pilot pragmatic trial&#xD;
      testing a 6-week telehealth ketogenic nutrition adherence (KNA) program using motivational&#xD;
      interviewing and cognitive behavioral strategies (MI-CBT) compared to a KN information only&#xD;
      group for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a community senior health&#xD;
      clinic to prepare for a full-scale trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will examine the feasibility of the recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      assessment, electronic health record (EHR) downloads, and intervention delivery methods&#xD;
      through the FSU SeniorHealthTM clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study protocol will result in high patient retention (90%) and patient attendance of&#xD;
           intervention sessions (80%), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A centralized MI-CBT telehealth delivery approach will be associated with high&#xD;
           intervention acceptability ratings from patients and key stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess signal of initial effect of the KNA program on important clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      adherence relative to a KN information-only condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients in the KNA condition, relative to the KN-only&#xD;
      condition, will show:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. higher rates of clinically significant improvements on the RBANS total scale scores,&#xD;
           improvements in daily functioning (FSQ), and decreases in patient CAIDE risk score(&#xD;
           (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improved adherence to KN, as evidenced by higher levels of measurable urine ketones in&#xD;
           the KNA condition compared to the KN-only condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preparation. During the first 6 months of the study, the investigators will work closely with&#xD;
      key stakeholders (i.e., clinic director, practice manager, and nurse practitioner) in the&#xD;
      Florida State University (FSU) SeniorHealth clinic to coordinate initial contact with&#xD;
      patients about the study. Initial contact will include posting flyers in the SeniorHealth&#xD;
      clinic, handing out flyers during appointments, and emailing flyers or calling patients who&#xD;
      have consented to be contacted about FSU research studies (a consent process, which is&#xD;
      completed as part of the normal SeniorHealth intake packet), posting flyers in the&#xD;
      Westminster Oaks monthly newsletter, and patients will be able to fill out a contact card&#xD;
      with their name, phone number, and email that will be placed in a locked &quot;drop box&quot; in the&#xD;
      SeniorHealth clinic. A study team member will collect these cards weekly to enter into a&#xD;
      secure screening waitlist. Patients may also discuss interest with their provider or contact&#xD;
      the study team directly using the information on the study flyer, potential participants will&#xD;
      be added to a secure screening waitlist, which will include only their name and phone number.&#xD;
      This screening waitlist potential participant contact information will be stored in a&#xD;
      password protected document. Contact information for potential participants will be destroyed&#xD;
      for any participant who does not qualify and consent to remain in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phone call. After confirming interest in being contacted about the study,&#xD;
      participants will be contacted by a member of the research team and screened for eligibility.&#xD;
      This screening will include a telephone Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), sections 1 and&#xD;
      4 from the Functional Status Questionnaire (FSQ), a brief memory complaint scale, and&#xD;
      self-reported height, weight, and age. Participants will also be asked to report any&#xD;
      restrictive dietary or medical conditions that may make them unable to change their&#xD;
      nutrition. This contact information will not be retained for future research purposes. All&#xD;
      screened participants will be provided with a handout on healthy living designed in&#xD;
      collaboration with the SeniorHealth physicians. If participants are eligible, then they will&#xD;
      be sent an online consent form, which they will read and review telephonically with a member&#xD;
      of the research team before signing. The study team will then complete a final eligibility&#xD;
      check of the patient's EHR and review with the physician to confirm eligibility and ensure&#xD;
      participant safety. Participants who are eligible and consent to participate will have&#xD;
      screening data linked with other study data, in order to reduce redundancy in assessment&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention EHR data download (Time 0). The research team will extract and clean&#xD;
      relevant EHR data on participants who consent to participate in the study. Data from EHR will&#xD;
      be used to conduct a secondary eligibility screening to determine if there are any other&#xD;
      major health conditions that will exclude participants from the study. Data will only include&#xD;
      the minimum protected health information (PHI) necessary to complete the proposed study. Data&#xD;
      from the EHR will include the following information only from appointments pertinent to the&#xD;
      study: patients' problem/diagnostic list, medication list, patient vitals, metabolic panels,&#xD;
      HbA1C, scores on recent cognitive and psychological assessments (i.e., MoCA, depression&#xD;
      inventories), and relevant provider notes about a patient's cognitive functioning.&#xD;
      Participants that are seen by FSU clinicians will be considered for the study and contacted&#xD;
      by our team. Their EHR is maintained on Athena and thus all the information will be accessed&#xD;
      from Athena. Clinic staff working for FSU will be responsible for screening their EHR and&#xD;
      determining their eligibility for the study. These data will include the participants MoCA&#xD;
      scores, the geriatric depression inventory (GDS), and FSQ scores or relevant qualitative data&#xD;
      about their activities of daily living, and demographic characteristics. The study team will&#xD;
      also include laboratory results that may be relevant to cognitive outcomes for secondary data&#xD;
      analyses, including: HbA1c, glucose, potassium, blood pressure, and cholesterol. All&#xD;
      laboratory data will be pulled from the EHR, and will not require additional bloodwork or&#xD;
      labs to be completed by patient participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment (Time 1). In addition to embedded EHR data, we are collecting additional&#xD;
      data to evaluate the personal impacts of the intervention. This assessment will include: the&#xD;
      Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS update - form A), the GDS, FSQ, and&#xD;
      CAIDE risk score. This assessment will be completed using HIPAA Compliant Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention Assessment (Time 2). Participants will complete this assessment in the&#xD;
      final weeks of the program, in order to assess participants when they are in ketosis.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return their ketone logs either electronically, reported over&#xD;
      the phone, or via mail to the study PI. The research team will complete qualitative&#xD;
      interviews with participants to collect information about barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      completing the program and adhering to KN. Participants will complete the RBANS update - Form&#xD;
      B, the GDS, and FSQ, and the client satisfaction questionnaire . This assessment will be&#xD;
      completed using HIPAA Compliant Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention EHR data download and Provider Assessment (Time 3). Approximately six&#xD;
      months post-intervention, we will complete a final data extraction from the EHR, which will&#xD;
      include the same data as Time 0. Additionally, we will complete semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      with the clinic providers to assess implementation barriers and facilitators. Providers will&#xD;
      also complete quantitative measures on implementation acceptability (i.e., Modified version&#xD;
      of the Assessment of Fit Scale for outpatient clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention Assessment (Time 4). Patient participants will complete this assessment&#xD;
      approximately 3 months after completing the intervention program, in order to assess&#xD;
      long-term maintenance. The research team will complete qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      participants to collect information about barriers and facilitators to adhering to KN&#xD;
      long-term. Participants will complete the RBANS Update - form C, the GDS, and FSQ. This&#xD;
      assessment will be completed using HIPAA Compliant Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a centralized telehealth approach, the KNA program will consist of 6 weekly group&#xD;
      meetings, which will take place via HIPAA-compliant Zoom. The group will be co-led by a&#xD;
      clinical psychologist and a licensed nutritionist. Approximately half of each session will be&#xD;
      devoted to providing nutrition information and half devoted to psychoeducation, MI&#xD;
      activities, and CBT skills. Each group session will be recorded and rated by a trained&#xD;
      clinician using a modified MI Coach Rating Scale to measure fidelity to MI-CBT strategies and&#xD;
      reviewed with a recognized expert on MI and CBT. These recordings will be stored on a secure&#xD;
      College of Medicine network drive and will only be used for the duration of the project and&#xD;
      reviewed by the study team for quality control and intervention consistency. Any information&#xD;
      from these recordings used for research purposes will be fully de-identified, with&#xD;
      qualitative information transcribed and coded by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI-CBT KNA Week 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group meeting will consist of a 1.5 hour informational and psychoeducational&#xD;
      session to introduce participants to the purpose of the group, the ketogenic nutrition goals,&#xD;
      and to the MI-CBT model of behavior change in relation to nutrition. Participants will be&#xD;
      mailed a workbook that includes weekly goals, handouts on how to maintain KN, including daily&#xD;
      recipes and food lists, as well as MI-CBT handouts and worksheets. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to slowly begin reducing daily net carbohydrate intake to 125g over the first week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will provide individualized recommendations for macronutrient intake based on&#xD;
      the net carbohydrate weekly goal and participant health information (e.g., sex, weight,&#xD;
      height, activity level). Participants will log macronutrient intake in their food logs in&#xD;
      order to ensure that approximately 60% of their diet involves healthy fats (e.g., fish,&#xD;
      avocado, olive oils), and to begin learning the general macronutrient content of foods they&#xD;
      consume. Participants will have the option of completing these food longs online or using&#xD;
      paper copies at home. The focus of these first meetings will be on nutritional education and&#xD;
      helping participants identify relevant values, goals, and reasons for committing to make&#xD;
      healthy changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI-CBT KNA Weeks 2-4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1-hour weekly meetings, participants will learn about the CBT model and relevant skills,&#xD;
      with assigned homework. Based on feedback from the feasibility trial, the program will&#xD;
      emphasize cognitive restructuring and problem-solving as primary skills, while handouts on&#xD;
      additional techniques (e.g., distress tolerance, behavioral activation, mindfulness) will be&#xD;
      provided as optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These skills will help participants identify health goals, manage triggers for unhealthy&#xD;
      eating behaviors, and overcome external obstacles to healthy eating. MI will be employed&#xD;
      throughout these sessions, through worksheets as well as reflective listening, summarizing,&#xD;
      affirming, and open-ended questions from the group leaders. Participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to gradually reduce their net carbohydrate intake across the first 3 weeks of the program in&#xD;
      a step-wise fashion (i.e., 125g in week 1, 75g in week 2, 50g or less in week 3) in order to&#xD;
      reduce possible adverse responses to the diet (e.g., GI distress, fatigue). Healthy fat&#xD;
      intake is a core component of this program, and participants will be provided with ample&#xD;
      instruction on ways to increase healthy fat intake while maintaining a healthy balance of&#xD;
      macronutrients (e.g., 60% fat, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI-CBT KNA Weeks 5-6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the final two sessions, the focus will shift to emphasize CBT skills practice, maintenance&#xD;
      of goals, sustainment of progress, and social support. Participants will make maintenance&#xD;
      plans, learn to manage slips, and continue practicing cognitive restructuring skills. The&#xD;
      recommended net carbohydrate intake will be reduced to 20g or less these weeks, depending on&#xD;
      individual ketone level and macronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KN-Only (Condition 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the KN-only group will attend a 1.5-hour informational session as a&#xD;
      group, which will provide comprehensive information about how to adhere to KN and how to&#xD;
      track macronutrients, food intake, and ketone levels. Participants will be provided with the&#xD;
      same participant workbook as the MI-CBT KNA group with informational handouts and KN recipes,&#xD;
      but without the MI-CBT handouts. Participants will be asked to track food intake and daily&#xD;
      ketone levels, and will be provided with the option of attending a weekly Zoom meeting where&#xD;
      they may ask questions about KN and receive additional nutrition information as needed. These&#xD;
      optional meetings will be offered for 6 weeks. The structure of this control condition will&#xD;
      allow us to examine of the benefits that an MI-CBT group approach provides for increasing&#xD;
      adherence to KN and retention in a KN program, compared to KN education only.&#xD;
