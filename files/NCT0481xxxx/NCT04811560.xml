      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D[s]) of&#xD;
      JNJ-75276617 in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and to determine safety and tolerability at the&#xD;
      RP2D(s) in Part 2 (Dose Expansion).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled clonal&#xD;
      expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells (myeloid blasts) in the peripheral blood, bone&#xD;
      marrow, and other tissues. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematologic malignancy&#xD;
      propagated by impaired differentiation, proliferation, and accumulation of lymphoid&#xD;
      progenitor cells in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary sites. JNJ-75276617 is an orally&#xD;
      bioavailable, potent, and selective protein-protein interaction inhibitor of the binding&#xD;
      between histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A ([KMT2A], also called mixed-lineage leukemia 1&#xD;
      [MLL1]; wild-type and fusion) and menin, with activity in leukemic cell lines and primary&#xD;
      leukemia patient or patient-derived samples with either KMT2A alterations including gene&#xD;
      rearrangements (KMT2A-r), duplications, and amplification, or nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1)&#xD;
      alterations. The primary goal of this FIH study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of JNJ-75276617 with an acceptable safety profile. The total duration of the study is&#xD;
      up to 2 years and 10 months. Safety assessment will include adverse events (AEs), serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs), physical examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
      performance status, vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical safety laboratory assessment and&#xD;
      pregnancy testing.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in Part 1 (dose escalation) will receive JNJ-75276617 orally on a 28-day cycle. The dose levels will be escalated based on the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) evaluation by Study Evaluation Team (SET) until the recommended Phase 2 Doses (RP2Ds) has been identified. Food effect cohort participants in Part 1 will receive JNJ-75276617 orally on Cycle 2 Day 1 under fasted condition and on Cycle 2 Day 2 under fed condition. Participants in Part 2 (dose expansion) will receive JNJ-75276617 orally at one of the RP2D(s) determined in Part 1.</description>
