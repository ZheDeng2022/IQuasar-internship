  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known concerning the management of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in digestive&#xD;
      cancers other than hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC). The use of anticoagulant treatment (ACT),&#xD;
      screening of oesophageal varices (OV) and oesogatric varices (OGV), and primary prophylaxis&#xD;
      of OV (treatment with beta-blocker (BB) and / or OV ligation) if necessary are not clearly&#xD;
      defined. The autopsy series by Ogren et al. (World J Gastroenterol. 2006) found an incidence&#xD;
      of PVT in cancer patients of 1%, with 44% of digestive cancers other than HCC as a common&#xD;
      etiology, mostly pancreatic adenocarcinoma (42%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We reported a retrospective French study that included 118 patients with digestive cancers&#xD;
      other than HCC, including 50% locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with&#xD;
      PVT complications. A total of 38% of patients had radiological signs of portal hypertension&#xD;
      (PHT) and 51% had ACT. Only 1% of patients were screened for VO (n = 7). In addition, 19% (n&#xD;
      = 22) presented gastrointestinal bleeding. Among the causes of death, 17% (n = 12) were due&#xD;
      to gastrointestinal bleeding. Overall survival (OS) was statistically associated with a&#xD;
      metastatic disease (HR = 2.83 [95% CI 1.47-5.43], p &lt;0.01) and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR&#xD;
      = 1.68 [95% CI 1.01-2.78], p = 0.04).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding complications from PHT are not uncommon in patients with digestive cancer,&#xD;
      especially in patients with pancreatic cancer with PVT; but above all they can be responsible&#xD;
      for death. No data existed before our first study (Regnault et al. Dig Liv Dis 2018).&#xD;
      However, these data must be validated in a prospective multicentric study with standardized&#xD;
      follow-up. In order to obtain precise and homogeneous data, we have chosen to target&#xD;
      pancreatic cancers as these tumors are the most common causes of PVT.&#xD;
