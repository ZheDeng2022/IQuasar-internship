  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure (HF) represent a large population of patients who are at high&#xD;
      risk for complications related to undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF). However, currently&#xD;
      there are limited modalities for early AF detection and subsequent stroke prevention in this&#xD;
      high-risk population. An implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) is inserted subcutaneously and can&#xD;
      provide long term arrhythmia information via remote monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Confirm-AF trial seeks to accurately define the burden of AF and other arrhythmias in&#xD;
      high-risk HF patients using a Confirm Rx ICM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 6 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure (HF). By the year 2030&#xD;
      the prevalence of HF is expected to exceed 8 million people. Heart failure accounts for 1&#xD;
      million hospital admissions each year, costing our economy in excess of $30 billion dollars&#xD;
      per year. Mortality in patients with HF remains high, and nearly half of all patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with HF will die within 5 years. More than half of all patients admitted with HF&#xD;
      decompensation have preserved left ventricular systolic function. Patients with HF and mildly&#xD;
      reduced or preserved left ventricular systolic function are at high risk for developing&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF), the occurrence of which often contributes to HF decompensation and&#xD;
      increases morbidity and all-cause mortality. Similarly, patients with AF are at high risk for&#xD;
      developing HF due to loss of atrio-ventricular synchrony and rapid uncontrolled ventricular&#xD;
      rates. Detection of AF can be challenging and may go undiagnosed in asymptomatic or minimally&#xD;
      symptomatic patients through conventional monitoring methods. Patients with HF represent a&#xD;
      large population who are at risk for complications related to undiagnosed AF. AF increases&#xD;
      the risk of stroke five-fold and the risk of death nearly two-fold. Moreover, strokes related&#xD;
      to AF are twice as likely to be fatal or severely disabling compared to strokes due to other&#xD;
      causes, such as ischemic small vessel disease or atheromatous large vessel disease. Cardiac&#xD;
      implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), can be used for the early detection of AF in&#xD;
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with HF. However, current guidelines provide an&#xD;
      indication for prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) only in HF patients&#xD;
      with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, whereas there are limited data for&#xD;
      device-based detection of AF in HF patients with more preserved LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantable cardiac monitors (ICM) are devices that can be injected into the subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue and can provide automatic electrocardiographic recordings of asymptomatic arrhythmias&#xD;
      as well as patient triggered electrocardiographic recordings of symptomatic episodes during&#xD;
      long term follow-up. Implantable cardiac monitors are be paired with remote monitoring&#xD;
      systems, capable of rapid remote review of electrograms. Accordingly, we hypothesize that a&#xD;
      management strategy that incorporates ICM implantation in patients with HF and LVEF &gt;35% will&#xD;
      result in a significantly higher rate of AF detection leading to arrhythmia related&#xD;
      interventions compared to conventional monitoring and follow-up in patients with HF.&#xD;

    <description>The Confirm RX implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) is an FDA-approved device that can be injected into the subcutaneous tissue and can provide automatic as well as patient triggered electrocardiographic recordings of symptomatic episodes during long term follow-up. This Implantable cardiac monitor is paired with a remote monitoring smartphone application called My Merlin that capable of rapid remote review of electrograms to be utilized in this study for arrhythmia detection. The Confirm Rx ICM is indicated for the monitoring and diagnostic evaluation of patients who experience unexplained symptoms such as: dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, syncope, and shortness of breath, as well as patients who are at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. It is also indicated for patients who have been previously diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or who are susceptible to developing atrial fibrillation.</description>

Data related to subjects' arrhythmias, via the Merlin.net Patient CareNetwork will be transmitted on a monthly basis to the treating physician and subsequently to the study coordination and database center (CDC) at the University of Rochester. Data on the frequency/types of symptomatic (patient triggered) versus ICM detected (asymptomatic) arrhythmic events will be collected and adjudicated.
