  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator is thought to have effective&#xD;
      anti-tumoral properties for pancreatic cancer via IL-6 pathway (GP130/STAT3) inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to measure IL-6 (GP130/STAT3)-pathway modification on metastasis biopsy of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma before and after treatment with&#xD;
      bazedoxifene in addition to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-center, prospective, nonrandomized trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, prospective, non-randomized trial. The population studied will&#xD;
      consist of 10 patients of both sexes, aged 18 to 85 years, with a newly diagnosed metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma who will undergo palliative treatment with standard first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Gemcitabine +/- Nab-paclitaxel). Diagnosis must be confirmed by biopsy and&#xD;
      metastasis must be accessible for percutaneous biopsy using imaging guidance. Further, only&#xD;
      patients with an IL-6 (GP130/STAT3)-pathway activity of more than 5% on diagnostic biopsy&#xD;
      will be included .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to chemotherapy, patients will receive 20 mg bazedoxifene (Conbriza®) orally per&#xD;
      day, subject to good clinical tolerance and in the absence of a biological contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive bazedoxifene once a day at any time, with or without meals. Initiation&#xD;
      of treatment will be simultaneous to the initiation of chemotherapy. Bazedoxifene (Conbriza®)&#xD;
      will be prescribed and administered for the duration of the study. To minimize the risk of&#xD;
      thrombo-embolic events, prophylactic rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) 10 mg orally once per day will be&#xD;
      added for the duration of the bazedoxifene (Conbriza®) intake. Pantoprazole 20 mg once per&#xD;
      day will be added in selected patients to minimize gastric complications according to the&#xD;
      physician's appreciation. Participants will receive bazedoxifene (Conbriza®) and rivaroxaban&#xD;
      (Xarelto®) for the entire study duration from a subinvestigator at treatment initiation&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination with vital parameters, laboratory testing (blood count, liver enzymes,&#xD;
      creatinine) and tumor marker (CA 19-9) will be conducted in order to determine the baseline&#xD;
      prior to the initiation of the treatment. The quality of life using the EORTC core quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) will also be assessed at that point. Furthermore, the IL-6&#xD;
      pathway activity (GP130/STAT3) will be assessed immunohistochemically on metastasis biopsy&#xD;
      before administration of bazedoxifene (Conbriza®). The tissue will be obtained by&#xD;
      percutaneous biopsy using imaging guidance. A biopsy performed before study inclusion can be&#xD;
      used as baseline to avoid a second biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment and follow-up will be performed by the consultant physician at the HFR&#xD;
      Fribourg in the department of oncology. The follow-up will be carried out every 3 to 4 weeks&#xD;
      and will consist of a physical examination, vital parameters, laboratory testing (blood&#xD;
      count, liver enzymes, creatinine, electrolytes) and tumor marker (CA 19-9). Plasma samples&#xD;
      will be collected before and after treatment for storage and samples will be analyzed through&#xD;
      next generation sequencing NGS. Quality-of-life will be assessed during the follow-ups and&#xD;
      drug adherence will be monitored through patient survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months of treatment, the primary endpoint will be assessed. Thoraco-abdominal CT scan&#xD;
      or PET-CT will be performed, and a biopsy of metastasis tissue will be repeated (percutaneous&#xD;
      under radiological guidance) for immunohistochemical IL-6 pathway activity (GP130/STAT3)&#xD;
      analysis. The pathologist as primary endpoint assessor will be blinded. The activity of&#xD;
      bazedoxifene (Conbriza®) on inflammatory pathways and tumor progression will be evaluated by&#xD;
      comparing the modification in expression of the IL-6 pathway (GP130/STAT3) from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed by the investigator to report the occurrence of any adverse&#xD;
      event. Security outcomes will also be compared between the intervention and the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of participants participation will be 3 months.&#xD;
