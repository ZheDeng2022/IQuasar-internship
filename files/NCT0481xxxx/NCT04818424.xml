  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies of the exosuit technology have culminated in strong evidence for the&#xD;
      gait-restorative effects of soft robotic exosuits for patients post-stroke by means of&#xD;
      substitution for lost function. The present study builds on this work by suggesting that an&#xD;
      exosuit's immediate gait-restorative effects can be leveraged during high intensity gait&#xD;
      training to produce long-lasting gait restoration. Current gait training efforts are focused&#xD;
      on either quality or intensity. They focus on gait quality often by reducing the training&#xD;
      intensity to allow patients to achieve a more normal gait. In contrast, efforts focused on&#xD;
      training intensity push participants without focusing on the quality of their movements.&#xD;
      These intervention paradigms generally fail to substantially impact community mobility. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators posit that exosuits can uniquely enable an integration of these&#xD;
      paradigms (ie, high intensity gait training that promotes quality of movements). For this&#xD;
      protocol, exosuits developed in collaboration with an industry partner, ReWalk™ Robotics will&#xD;
      be used. To evaluate the effects of REAL gait training, the investigators will use clinical&#xD;
      measures of motor and gait function, locomotor mechanics and energetics, and physiologic&#xD;
      measures that may infer on motor learning. The spectrum of behavioral and physiologic data&#xD;
      that we will collect will enable us to understand more comprehensively the gait-restorative&#xD;
      effects of REAL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weakness of the ankle plantarflexors after a stroke results in impaired forward propulsion&#xD;
      during walking, which consequently impacts walking efficiency and speed - parameters that are&#xD;
      necessary for community participation. Next-generation soft, wearable robots, known as soft&#xD;
      robotic exosuits, were developed to assist paretic ankle dorsiflexion during its swing phase&#xD;
      and paretic ankle plantarflexion during push off. Prior observational studies of the exosuit&#xD;
      technology have culminated in strong evidence of immediate gait-restorative effects for&#xD;
      patients post-stroke through improved forward propulsion, and faster and farther walking. The&#xD;
      investigators posit that gait training using exosuits will leverage these immediate&#xD;
      gait-restorative effects to facilitate gait training at higher intensities without&#xD;
      compromising gait quality. This type of training will facilitate lasting rehabilitative&#xD;
      effects that persist beyond the use of exosuit. Leveraging a systematic approach in the&#xD;
      staging of pilot studies toward larger clinical trials, this clinical validation was&#xD;
      initiated with a single-subject study design followed by a case series, which both provided&#xD;
      early evidence for the potential of gait training with exosuits in restoring propulsion and&#xD;
      speed. As a next step, the investigators seek to examine the efficacy of these interventions&#xD;
      under more robust terms by implementing a randomized clinical trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study seeks to understand the rehabilitative effects of a Robotic Exosuit&#xD;
      Augmented Locomotion (REAL) gait training program relative to matched gait training without&#xD;
      exosuits (Control) on walking and propulsion function after stroke. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      REAL training will result in clinically meaningful improvements in walking speed that are&#xD;
      greater than the speed gains following Control training. Further, this study seeks to examine&#xD;
      whether training-related changes in propulsion function following both interventions (REAL,&#xD;
      Control) influence the training-induced effects on walking function. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that REAL training will result in substantial gains in walking function that are&#xD;
      achieved through improved propulsion function, while Control training will have modest gains&#xD;
      in walking function that are not related to changes in propulsion. For this protocol,&#xD;
      exosuits developed in collaboration with an industry partner (ReWalk™ Robotics) will be used.&#xD;
      To examine the effects of REAL gait training, the investigators will use clinical measures of&#xD;
      motor and gait function, locomotor mechanics, and physiologic measures that may infer on&#xD;
      motor learning. The spectrum of behavioral and physiologic data that will be collected will&#xD;
      enable a more comprehensive understanding of the gait-restorative effects of REAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be implemented by carrying out the following study visits: (1) Primary screen&#xD;
      over the phone, (2) Clinical screen &amp; fit, (3) Exposure, (4) Pre-training evaluation, (5)&#xD;
      Training (6 sessions), (6) Mid-evaluation, (7) Training (6 sessions), (8) Post-training&#xD;
      evaluation, and (9) Retention evaluation. Randomization to either REAL or Control will occur&#xD;
      after Pre-training evaluation. A washout period up to 4 weeks will precede Retention&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Soft exosuit</intervention_name>
    <description>A soft exosuit is a textile-based wearable robot that is worn on the paretic ankle. Soft exosuits provide assistive torques through retraction of Bowden cables that connect distally to anchor points on front and back of the ankle, assisting with dorsiflexion during swing for foot clearance, and plantarflexion during late stance to assist with propulsion, respectively. Exosuit assistance is provided synchronously based on the wearer's gait, as detected by integrated inertial measurement units.</description>
