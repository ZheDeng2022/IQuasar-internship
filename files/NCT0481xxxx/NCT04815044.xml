  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with the eating disorder bulimia nervosa (BN) have been found to have a higher risk of&#xD;
      unplanned pregnancies than healthy women, and experience greater miscarriage, premature&#xD;
      birth, birth complications, and postpartum depression. Other studies have found that women&#xD;
      with eating disorders seem to find motivation to refrain from the eating disordered behavior&#xD;
      for the sake of the fetus, but that it is highly different whether this gives sustained or&#xD;
      only a temporary remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating disorders are rarely detected in the primary health care service, nor during pregnancy&#xD;
      or during follow-up in fertility clinics. Meeting a health care provider in the pregnancy&#xD;
      care service who does not know about the eating disorder or who does not understand the&#xD;
      disease well enough, can also make the management and experience of pregnancy and weight gain&#xD;
      extra difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to increase the knowledge on how women with a history of eating&#xD;
      disorder experience their bodily changes, and how they experience the health service in&#xD;
      pregnancy care and post-partum period.&#xD;

      Women with the eating disorder bulimia nervosa (BN) have been found to have a higher risk of&#xD;
      unplanned pregnancies than healthy women, and experience greater miscarriage, premature&#xD;
      birth, birth complications, and postpartum depression. Having a disorder in which the&#xD;
      overevaluation of the need to control body weight and food intake is pertinent, may cause a&#xD;
      tremendous mental challenge to accept the bodily change through a pregnancy. Other studies&#xD;
      have found that women with eating disorders seem to find motivation to refrain from the&#xD;
      eating disordered behavior for the sake of the fetus, but that it is highly different whether&#xD;
      this gives sustained or only a temporary remission.&#xD;

      or during follow-up in fertility clinics. Meeting a health care provider in the pregnancy&#xD;

      extra difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to increase the knowledge on how women with a hisory of eating&#xD;
      disorders experience bodily changes through pregnancy, and how the pregnancy care service is&#xD;
      experienced. The purpose of this data collection is to help design preparatory information&#xD;
      for women with eating disorders who become pregnant, and to promote best practice guidelines&#xD;
      for the health service in the meeting with, and follow-up of, pregnant women with a history&#xD;
      of eating disorders.&#xD;
