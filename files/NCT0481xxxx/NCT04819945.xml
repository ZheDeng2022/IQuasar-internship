      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical safety and performance of GATT-Patch&#xD;
      for management of haemorrhage during elective open liver surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GATT-Patch study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter, pre-market, first-in-man&#xD;
      clinical investigation, that intents to determine the clinical safety and performance of&#xD;
      GATT-Patch for management of haemorrhage during elective open liver surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation will be carried out in a maximum of 7 sites in The Netherlands,&#xD;
      treating an estimated total of 51 participants. All participants will be thoroughly screened&#xD;
      and if found eligible, treated with GATT-Patch during open liver surgery. Participants will&#xD;
      be followed for 6 weeks with an additional ultrasound assessment at the 6 week follow up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant enrolment period is expected to take approximately 6 months, with a total&#xD;
      expected duration of the clinical investigation of approximately 8 months.&#xD;
