      This is an open-label, sing-arm, phase IV clinical study. The study is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of Afatinib in treatment of NRG1-fused locally advanced/metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and explore the clinical factors that may predict the effectiveness&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, sing-arm clinical study,which will recruit about 15 patients in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Afatinib in treatment of NRG1-fused locally&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and explore the clinical factors that&#xD;
      may predict the effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Patient Population:Locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV) NRG1-fused&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer patients, who have previously received platinum-based doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapy and developed disease progression subsequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Drug, Dosage and Medication Regimen:Afatinib is the second-generation TKI drug, which&#xD;
      can irreversibly bind to receptors of erbB family. Afatinib will be administered orally at a&#xD;
      dose of 40 mg per time, Q.D. If a patient cannot tolerate a dose of 40mg due to adverse&#xD;
      reactions, when the adverse reactions restore to level 1 (CTCAE 5.0) or below, the dosage&#xD;
      could be adjusted to 30mg per day, Q.D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations of Study:The data to be collected include demographic characteristics of the&#xD;
      patients, information necessary to determine whether the patients are qualified (including&#xD;
      medical history, features of previous and current diseases and NRG1 fusion status in tumor&#xD;
      tissue), and efficacy and safety data in terms of objective response rate (ORR), disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with NRG1 fusion detected by&#xD;
