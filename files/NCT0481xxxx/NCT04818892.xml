  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposal is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). This will help determine&#xD;
      if immunosuppressive regimens impact COVID-19 vaccine response. The investigators will&#xD;
      determine if certain groups may need more doses of a vaccine, with future adjuvanted vaccines&#xD;
      or require a booster to maintain immunity. 260 participants with IBD and scheduled to get a&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine will be recruited and can expect to be on study for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has a variable spectrum of illness with the majority of infection resulting in&#xD;
      asymptomatic or mild disease. However certain healthy adults and immunosuppressed populations&#xD;
      can develop severe or critical symptoms that require hospitalization or intensive care stay.&#xD;
      Emerging evidence suggest that certain immunosuppressive medications used to treat patients&#xD;
      with IBD such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) do not appear to confer an increased risk&#xD;
      for severe COVID-19, but the risk appears to be higher for other agents such as&#xD;
      corticosteroids. The efficacy of a candidate COVID-19 may be lower in immunosuppressed&#xD;
      patients with IBD, since these patient populations may have lower responses to vaccines.&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown that patients with IBD have variability in their vaccine&#xD;
      responses compared to healthy individuals. While many patients have a normal vaccine&#xD;
      response, those treated with TNF agents or combination therapy (TNF inhibitors and&#xD;
      immunomodulators) are more likely to mount a poor immune response. Furthermore, preliminary&#xD;
      data suggest some novel regimens (such as vedolizumab) may not impact the immune response but&#xD;
      there is insufficient data to know their impact on vaccine response. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      critical need to determine whether patients with IBD will mount normal immune responses to a&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center cross sectional clinical study of 260 patients with IBD who are&#xD;
      receiving the COVID-19 vaccine as standard of care. After obtaining informed consent,&#xD;
      individuals who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Determine the immunogenicity and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IBD. To&#xD;
      achieve this aim, the investigators will perform a prospective study evaluating the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a COVID-19 vaccine in 260 patients with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: Systemic immunosuppressive regimens such as Anti-TNF in combination with an&#xD;
           immunomodulator, associated with the lowest vaccine response, or other systemic&#xD;
           immunosuppressive regimens will blunt the immunogenicity of a COVID-19 vaccine while&#xD;
           other agents such as vedolizumab or aminosalicylates will not affect the vaccine&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Determine the impact of systemic immunosuppression on sustained antibody COVID-19&#xD;
      concentrations in patients with IBD who received the COVID-19 vaccine. To achieve this aim,&#xD;
      the investigators will evaluate sustained antibody concentrations using a quantitative assay&#xD;
      from LabCorp that is currently being used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) to evaluate seroprevalence and study immunity at 1, 6 and 12 months after completion of&#xD;
      vaccination. Labcorp activities are provided as a fee for service. The one month visit will&#xD;
      be optional and participants can enter the study at the six months study visit or at&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 month post third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine which has been approved for&#xD;
      patients with IBD. The 12 month visit may be replaced by a 6 month post 3rd dose vaccine if&#xD;
      participants received a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: Vaccine-induced antibody concentrations will wane over the 12 month interval&#xD;
           faster than the published rate in healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the proposed research, the safety and immunogenicity of a COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine in immunosuppressed patients with IBD will be determined.&#xD;
