    <textblock>
      The prevalence of MetS and its components among industrial workers and its risk factors&#xD;
      correlates among them and compare them with those in employees from a nonindustrial setting,&#xD;
      and explore the influence of different industries on hematological parameters especially WBCs&#xD;
      derangement&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS), an important risk factor for Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD), is&#xD;
      associated with a 2-fold increase in consequences of CVD and 1.5-fold increase in the total&#xD;
      mortality . The term MetS refers to a clustering of CVD risk factors including abdominal&#xD;
      obesity, high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high levels of blood triglycerides, and low&#xD;
      levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. An inappropriate lifestyle is one of&#xD;
      the most important risk factors for MetS and CVD . Likely, Workplace and working conditions&#xD;
      can affect an employee's lifestyle including dietary intake, physical activity, sleep&#xD;
      pattern, and their hobbies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workplace environment may also affect the occurrence of metabolic syndrome, Air pollution is&#xD;
      another risk factor that can increase the risk of metabolic disorders. Recent epidemiological&#xD;
      and experimental studies have reported an association between increased level of air&#xD;
      pollution with insulin resistance, weight gain, and obesity . Air pollution is higher in some&#xD;
      industrial work environments, including those of the gas and petrochemical industries. This&#xD;
      may also increase the risk of MetS and CVD among employees of those workplaces. Few studies&#xD;
      have assessed the health of employees in industrial workplaces. However, the working&#xD;
      conditions of industrial workplace can have a significant impact on the lifestyle and health&#xD;
      of employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has recently been suggested to vary greatly depending on&#xD;
      the subject's business category; high prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been reported&#xD;
      among the retired, unemployed, bus drivers, university employees, and workers in the&#xD;
      agricultural industry , oil industry , and health care sector .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of occupation is also important in development of metabolic syndrome. For example, the&#xD;
      incidence of metabolic syndrome in the white-collar workers are higher than other male&#xD;
      workers. Those with sedentary or shift work carry a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. The&#xD;
      incidence of metabolic syndrome is 2.3-fold higher in those working for 10 or more hours per&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have linked benzene exposure with the abnormality of hematologic parameters,&#xD;
      such as the reduction in the counts of white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC),&#xD;
      neutrophil, and lymphocyte, even at low exposure levels (&lt; 1 ppm). A decreased WBC count has&#xD;
      been considered as a key clinical sign of benzene-induced hematotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, studies investigating the relationship between work environment and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome in our region are scarce. We therefore, conducted this study to determine the&#xD;
      relationship between work environment and metabolic syndrome among a petrochemical workers &amp;&#xD;
      non industrial workers.&#xD;

    <description>MetS was defined according to International Diabetes Federation criteria as: central obesity (defined as waist circumference 90 cm for men and 80 cm for women, plus any two of the following four factors: Raised TG level (150 mg/dl or on treatment for lipid abnormality), reduced HDL cholesterol (¼90 cm for men and &gt;¼80 cm for women and any two of the following four factors: triglycerides &gt;¼150 mg/ dl, reduced HDL cholesterol (&lt;40 mg/dl in men and &lt;50 mg/dl in women or on treatment for lipid abnormality), raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 85 mm Hg or on treatment for hypertension),raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (FPG100 mg/dl or on treatment for diabetes).</description>

    <description>nutritional health behavior was obtained using the subscale of Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II. Nutritional health behavior included the following nine items: &quot;choose a low-fat diet&quot;; &quot;limit the use of sugars&quot;; &quot;eat servings of bread, cereal, and rice&quot;; &quot;eat servings of fruit&quot;; &quot;eat servings of vegetables&quot;; &quot;eat servings of meat, poultry, fish, dried beans, eggs and nuts&quot;; &quot;eat servings of milk, yogurt or cheese&quot;; &quot;read labels to identify nutrients&quot;; and &quot;eat breakfast.&quot; The number of daily servings for each food group was set according to the dietary guidelines, Participants were asked to rate nine items on a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (routinely). A higher mean score indicated a greater level of participation in nutritional health behavior.</description>
