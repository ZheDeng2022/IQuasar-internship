  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia in the lumbar paraspinal muscles is receiving renewed attention as a cause of&#xD;
      spinal degeneration. However, there were few studies on the precise concept and diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria for spinal sarcopenia. We have already developed the concept of spinal sarcopenia in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults and investigated the association between conventional&#xD;
      sarcopenic indices and spinal sarcopenia. However, intervention studies on spinal sarcopenia&#xD;
      have not been conducted until now. Here, we aim a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the combined exercise and nutrition intervention for spinal sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study with 35 community-dwelling older women who were diagnosed as&#xD;
      spinal sarcopenia in our previous cohort study. Combined intervention will consist of back&#xD;
      extensor strengthening exercise and nutritional supplementation for 12 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study is isometric back extensor strength after 12 weeks' intervention. All&#xD;
      functional outcomes will be measured at 0, 12, and 24 weeks after intervention. The data will&#xD;
      be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;

      Both the atrophy and fatty change of paraspinal muscles originated from sarcopenia on lumbar&#xD;
      paraspinal are also known to be associated with functional disorders and chronic back pain.&#xD;
      We want to suggest classifying this phenomenon as &quot;spinal sarcopenia.&quot; While feasible,&#xD;
      inexpensive, and less radiation-exposed tools such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry have&#xD;
      been used to measure appendicular skeletal muscle mass, paraspinal muscle assessment is still&#xD;
      needed using spinal CT or MRI. In addition, spinal extensor strength measurement is necessary&#xD;
      to confirm the function of lumbar paraspinal muscle, but isokinetic exercise equipment for&#xD;
      accurate measurement is not as feasible as a dynamometer for hand grip strength to evaluate&#xD;
      sarcopenia. Furthermore, many elderly people may experience pain during the measurement of&#xD;
      spinal extension strength. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple, accessible, and&#xD;
      clinically meaningful measurement index to confirm the myofunction of spinal extension. The&#xD;
      main two axes of treatment and prevention of conventional sarcopenia are muscle strengthening&#xD;
      exercises and high protein nutritional supplements. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the&#xD;
      clinical effect by intervention for spinal extension exercise and nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
