  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light to moderate sedation is recommended during surgery with spinal anesthesia . This study&#xD;
      is exploring which sedation drug is better, midazolam or dexmedetomidine for transurethral&#xD;
      resection of bladder and prostate in patients with or without high risk for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA). Patients were divided in two groups regarding OSA risk, and each group received&#xD;
      midazolam or dexmedetomidine for sedation. Investigators observed intraoperative&#xD;
      complications of airway and factors that are disturbing surgeon(movement due to participants&#xD;
      coughing and restlessness) because one could puncture bladder or prostate and cause&#xD;
      perforation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      All participants were premedicated with diazepam 5mg 12 hours and 1 hour before surgery.&#xD;
      Thromboprophylaxis (enoxaparin 4000-6000 IU) depending on the body weight was given at least&#xD;
      12 hours before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were divided by STOP-BANG(Snoring history, Tired during the day, Observed stop&#xD;
      breathing while sleep, High blood pressure, BMI more than 35 kg/m2, Age more than 50 years,&#xD;
      Neck circumference more than 40 cm and male Gender) questionnaire into one of two groups:&#xD;
      high OSA and low&amp;medium OSA. Each group was then allocated by permuted block randomisation&#xD;
      into midazolam or dexmedetomidine group. The randomisation list was obtained from R program.&#xD;
      The group allocations were contained in closed envelope that were opened before surgery after&#xD;
      the completed enrollment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants got IV cannula with switch for continuous intravenous infusion in operating&#xD;
      theatre. Non invasive monitoring (electrodes for ECG, blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter)&#xD;
      was placed before induction of spinal anesthesia. Skin was disinfected and 40mg of 2%&#xD;
      Lidocaine was given subcutaneously at lumbar vertebrae 3/4 level. 25 G spinal needle was used&#xD;
      and after dura and arachnoidea were pierced 12.5-15 mg of 0.5% Levobupivacaine was applied.&#xD;
      Participants were then positioned in uniform lithotomy position and 9cm pillow was inserted.&#xD;
      After sensory block, defined as the absence of pain at T10 dermatome, was induced by&#xD;
      needle-tip test by the anaesthesiologist, the surgery was initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time after subarachnoid block was T0 and sedation with midazolam or dexmedetomidine was&#xD;
      started via continuous intravenous infusion. Midazolam was started with 0.25 mg/kg of ideal&#xD;
      body mass, and dexmedetomidine with 0.5 ug/kg through 10 minutes. Every 10 minutes sedation&#xD;
      level was observed with Ramsay sedation scale (RSS). Drug was titrated to achieve RSS of 4 or&#xD;
      5 (closed eyes and patient exhibited brisk or sluggish response to light glabellar tap or&#xD;
      loud auditory stimulus). Independent blinded doctor was assessing RSS level, vital parameters&#xD;
      and signs of airway obstruction every 10 minutes. Every 10 minutes systolic, diastolic and&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure(MAP) were noticed along with heart rate, oxygen saturation by pulse&#xD;
      oximetry(SpO2), RSS level and adverse intraoperative events: snoring as sign of airway&#xD;
      obstruction, cough and restlessness as disturbing factors to surgeon. If peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      fell below 90% supplemental oxygen was delivered by facemask with reservoir bag at flow of 10&#xD;
      L/min. End tidal carbon dioxide(CO2)was measured for detection of possible apnea. If&#xD;
      oxygenation was still inadequate chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver were performed and&#xD;
      oropharyngeal airway was inserted if needed. If heart rate fell below 50 bpm atropine 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg was given and if systolic blood pressure fell below 100 mmHg(or MAP &lt; 65 mmHg)&#xD;
      ephedrine 5mg bolus was given. Total crystalloid infusion volume was noticed at the end of&#xD;
      surgery. All measurements were performed every 10 minutes and 1 hour after surgery in urology&#xD;
      intensive care. High risk OSA participants underwent cardiorespiratory polygraphy at Center&#xD;
      for sleep medicine Split.&#xD;
