    <textblock>
      To investigate whether diabetes affects lung function and exercise capacity and impairs&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease that affects the biochemical, morphological&#xD;
      and functional properties of various tissues of the body. It is characterized by the loss of&#xD;
      insulin-producing cells associated with an autoimmune disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronotropic response is an increase in heart rate due to physical activity and metabolic&#xD;
      demand. Chronotropic disorder is an inadequate cardiac response and is frequently encountered&#xD;
      in individuals with diabetes. Diabetes-related comorbidities or physiological abnormalities&#xD;
      may lead to impaired chronotropic response, such as altered blood catecholamine levels during&#xD;
      exercise, structural myocardial anomalies, and impaired baroreflex sensitivity. While there&#xD;
      are studies on chronotropic response in individuals with type 2 diabetes, chronotropic&#xD;
      disorders have not been investigated in adults with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes affects the lungs negatively. In individuals with diabetes decreased lung volume,&#xD;
      and diffusion were observed. Dynamic lung capacity of individuals with type 1 diabetes with&#xD;
      the pulmonary function test will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limited studies evaluating respiratory muscle strength and endurance in individuals&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes. These studies have presented conflicting findings. Informations will be&#xD;
      provided to literature by evaluating respiratory muscle strength and endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is positively correlated with in the cardiovascular risk factor.&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia stresses or fear of hypoglycemia experienced by individuals with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes may lead people to a sedentary life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity level of individuals with type 1 diabetes will be evaluated using metabolic&#xD;
      holter, which is an objective method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and healthy individuals will be evaluated and compared. According to the sample size&#xD;
      analysis, 27 patients and 27 healthy individuals with similar demographic characteristics&#xD;
      will be included in the study. Evaluations will be completed within two days.&#xD;

    <measure>Respiratory Muscle Endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>Second Day</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle endurance will be assessed by the POWERbreathe Wellness (POWERbreathe, Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) Technologies Ltd. Birmingham, UK) device and the respiratory muscle endurance test at increased threshold load.&#xD;
The test will be started with 20% of the maximal inspiratory pressure and the pressure will be increased to 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% every two minutes. Patients will be asked to continue breathing through the device during the test. During the test, the number of breaths delivered during each 2-minute period will be recorded. If the individual cannot breathe 3 consecutive times, the test will be terminated by the physiotherapist.&#xD;
The total duration of the test and the maximum pressure value at which it continues to breathe for at least 1 minute will be multiplied. The value found will be recorded as the respiratory muscle endurance value.</description>
