      This investigation is a prospective, open, non-comparative, single-center investigation with&#xD;
      the aim to investigate the effect of BARRIER EasyWarm active self-warming blanket on skin-&#xD;
      and body core temperatures. The investigation will enroll approximately 20 healthy volunteers&#xD;
      in one investigation site and each subject will be evaluated for up to 10 hours in one visit.&#xD;

      This investigation is a prospective, open, non-comparative, single-center investigation with&#xD;
      the aim to investigate the effect of BARRIER EasyWarm active self-warming blanket on skin-&#xD;
      and body core temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation will enroll approximately 20 healthy volunteers in one investigation site.&#xD;
      Each subject will be evaluated for up to 10 hours in one visit on site. Body core- and skin&#xD;
      reference temperatures will be established before applying the blanket. After reference&#xD;
      temperature assessments, the BARRIER EasyWarm is positioned on the subject with the neckline&#xD;
      at the collarbone. Skin temperatures will be assessed with an IR camera and body core&#xD;
      temperatures will be assessed with an ear thermometer at 30 min, 1 hour, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,&#xD;
      9, and 10 hours post blanket application. Subject perception of heat from the blanket will be&#xD;
      assessed at 30 minutes, 5 hours and 10 hours post blanket application by means of a five&#xD;
      graded question.&#xD;
