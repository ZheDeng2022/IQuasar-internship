      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this in vivo randomized clinical trial with split-mouth design was to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of one in-office application of a fluoride containing varnish and in office&#xD;
      application of a bonding resin in adult patients presenting with dentin hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study cohort consisted of 38 Caucasian outpatients, giving a total of 180 teeth were&#xD;
      treated by fluoride varnish (FV) and 160 - by bonding agent (BA). Baseline pain in FV group&#xD;
      was slightly higher on both scales (SCHIFF and VAS). Outcome measurements were assessed one&#xD;
      or two weeks before product application (enrollment), at baseline at the application days&#xD;
      (end of the run-in period: T0a, T0b, T0c), and at 1 week and at 1-2-6 months after first&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Varnish fluoride is a single dose transparent varnish with 5 % sodium fluoride (22.600 ppm fluoride) and 5 % calcium fluoride.&#xD;
The application was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The varnish was applied on a clean and dry surface, then after 10-20 seconds to allow the fluoride varnish to be absorbed, was then dried with air.</description>
