  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of the buccal infiltration technique with&#xD;
      inferior alveolar nerve block technique for alleviation of intraoperative pain during pulpal&#xD;
      treatment of second mandibular primary molars using 4% Articaine 1:100000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study started with 22 cooperative medically free patients aging 7 to 8 years old seeking&#xD;
      treatment for bilateral deep carious mandibular second primary molars with no previous&#xD;
      history of irreversible pulpitis, swelling, sinus tract or tooth mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was achieved when each candidate was instructed to pick an opaque and sealed&#xD;
      envelope from two separate black and opaque boxes. First box contained two envelopes to&#xD;
      identify the side on which the operator will perform the treatment. While the second box&#xD;
      contained another two envelopes describing which anesthetic technique will be implemented&#xD;
      with the previously chosen side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical and radiographic examination, the patient received the pulpal treatment under&#xD;
      the identified side and injecting technique. Videotaping of the pulpal treatment procedure&#xD;
      was initiated after numbness was experienced by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blind assessor was assigned to review the videos and fill in the SEM pain scale to identify&#xD;
      the pain and level of discomfort experienced by the child during the pulpal treatment.&#xD;

      This study was a split mouth randomized controlled trial enrolling 22 patients from the&#xD;
      diagnostic center in the Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Cairo University. All participants met the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cooperative children (rating four or three based on Frankl behavior scale) aging from&#xD;
           seven to eight years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medically free child categorized as ASA I or ASA II according to the American Society of&#xD;
           anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Restorable bilateral deep carious lower primary second molars as shown in figure (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Normal radiographic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative periapical x-rays were done on the targeted molars to confirm their adherence to&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria and to confirm their restorability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant was asked to pick an opaque and sealed envelope from two separate black and&#xD;
      opaque boxes to randomly choose the operated technique and side on the first operating visit.&#xD;
      By default the other technique will be implemented on the other side on the upcoming visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper psychological management and desensitization procedures were undertaken to prepare the&#xD;
      patient for the treatment. Certain phrases were used to prepare the child for applying&#xD;
      topical anesthetic gel and injecting the anesthetic agent in any given technique like &quot;The&#xD;
      magic water will be used to put the tooth to sleep&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocols followed for inferior alveolar nerve block and buccal infiltration techniques&#xD;
      were according to Jones and Dean; 2016 and Tudeshchoie et al; 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries removal and pulpal treatment were videotaped with both local anesthetic techniques.&#xD;
      Caries was removed using a high speed contra with copious cooling and proper suction,&#xD;
      complete deroofing and excavation to the coronal pulpal tissues, bleeding from canals was&#xD;
      evaluated after the application of a wet cotton for two to four minutes, and then a cotton&#xD;
      damped with formocresol was applied for two to four minutes, fixation and brown stumps had to&#xD;
      be evident for applying the zinc oxide and eugenol dressing in the pulp chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any pain was felt during the procedure and the patient raised his/her left hand the&#xD;
      procedure was immediately halted. If pulpal exposure was still not evident additional&#xD;
      anesthesia was injected through the inferior alveolar nerve block technique since it is the&#xD;
      gold standard for anesthetizing mandibular posterior teeth. While if pain was experienced&#xD;
      after pulpal exposure few drops of anesthesia was injected intra-pulpally, in both cases and&#xD;
      this was considered a failure in the anesthetic technique used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After application of zinc oxide and eugenol cement, video recording was halted, zinc&#xD;
      phosphate cement was then used to seal the coronal part of the tooth and then the tooth was&#xD;
      covered with a preformed stainless steel crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videos were then assessed by an assessor who was completely blinded from the technique of&#xD;
      injection to fill in a printed (SEM) pain scale sheet for each technique with each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative instructions were verbally stated to the parent/guardian regarding precautions&#xD;
      towards lip biting due to lip numbness. The patient was dismissed, and after at least a week&#xD;
      the patient would be recalled to operate on the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure complete blindness of the statistician to the results of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic techniques, the inferior alveolar nerve block technique (IANB) was designated as&#xD;
      Treatment Group I and buccal infiltration technique (BI) was designated as Treatment Group&#xD;
      II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Data measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEM Pain Scale was used to evaluate the intraoperative pain experienced during pulpal&#xD;
      treatment of mandibular primary second molars with both local anesthetic techniques using&#xD;
      articaine four percent solution.&#xD;
