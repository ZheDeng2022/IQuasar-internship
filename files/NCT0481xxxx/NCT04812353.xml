  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recovery of foot and ankle arthrodesis and osteotomy is still plagued by the problem of&#xD;
      delayed consolidation or even pseudo-arthrosis. To date, the foot and ankle unit of UZ Leuven&#xD;
      is using a state of the art system, called the Io-Fix system, to optimize the biomechanical&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the current literature lacks studies assessing and quantifying the advantages of the&#xD;
      Io-Fix system. Objective presentations about the use of, and (early) results are currently&#xD;
      missing. Therefore, the investigators want to take their responsibility to objectively&#xD;
      investigate whether they can confirm and quantify the expected positive results of using the&#xD;
      Io-Fix system. Subsequently, the investigators want to search for eventual unexpected&#xD;
      problems with Io-Fix.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The recovery of foot and ankle arthrodesis and osteotomy is still plagued by the problem of&#xD;
      delayed consolidation or even pseudo-arthrosis. Some known risk factors for delayed&#xD;
      consolidation are inherent to the patient and /or cannot be easily corrected by the surgeon:&#xD;
      smoking, diabetes mellitus, use of NSAIDS, etc. Many other biological risk factors are well&#xD;
      known. The fusion rate is one of these factors. This factor is influenced by the mechanical&#xD;
      stability and compression at the level of arthrodesis. The right alignment till the moment of&#xD;
      consolidation is an important factor as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, two concepts leading to a better fusion rate are under investigation. First,&#xD;
      research is done to optimize the local biological factors by using concentrated growth&#xD;
      factors. Second, researchers are working towards optimal biomechanical stability and&#xD;
      compression by further developing per-operative osteosynthesis material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the optimal biomechanical stability concept, the following innovation was recently&#xD;
      released: the Io-Fix system of Extremity Medical L.L.C. (Parsippany , NJ). This state of the&#xD;
      art system has clear advantages compared to other systems. Based on the well-expected&#xD;
      advantages, the Foot and Ankle unit of UZ Leuven has been using this system since more than&#xD;
      one year. The initial subjective results with Io-Fix are strongly positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the current literature lacks studies assessing and quantifying the advantages of the&#xD;
      Io-Fix system. Objective presentations about the use of, and (early) results are currently&#xD;
      missing. Therefore, the investigators want to take their responsibility to objectively&#xD;
      investigate whether they can confirm and quantify the expected positive results of using the&#xD;
      Io-Fix system. Subsequently, the investigators want to search for eventual unexpected&#xD;
      problems with Io-Fix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the investigators believe that a larger study groups within a prospective framework&#xD;
      with a longer follow-up is mandatory.&#xD;
