  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become the third most common malignant tumor and is the second&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Adenomatous polyps of the colon are&#xD;
      possible precursor lesions for CRC. Screening for CRC has been shown effective in preventing&#xD;
      CRC and related deaths, especially colonoscopy and resection of adenomatous polyps.&#xD;
      Currently, for intermediate sized polyps 5 - 19 mm hot snare polypectomy (HSP) with the use&#xD;
      of electrocautery is conventionally used, causing relevant adverse events including&#xD;
      haemorrhage and postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome, but is safe regarding complete&#xD;
      resection of the polyp due to burning effect on residual tissue. On the other hand, cold&#xD;
      snare polypectomy (CSP) has grown popularity. Absence of electrocautery makes it technically&#xD;
      easier and most important reduces adverse events. CSP is recommended as the preferred&#xD;
      technique for polyps &lt;5 mm by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE)&#xD;
      guidelines. In literature, there is one multicenter trial from Japan recommending CSP for&#xD;
      polyps 4-9 mm (average polyp size 5,4 mm) and only a few case studies for polyps 10-15 mm&#xD;
      with inconsistent results, especially regarding the complete resection and pathological&#xD;
      evaluation of the specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators want to compare the complete resection&#xD;
      rates of small and intermediate sized colorectal polyps 5-15 mm with CSP and HSP.&#xD;

    <description>If an eligible polyp 5-15 mm (as compared by the size of the snare) is found, according to the randomized group, HSP is performed for the removal of all eligible polyps in this patient. After polypectomy, the resection site is washed thoroughly with saline water. After the endoscopist carefully examines the resection site for residual adenomatous tissue, eventually another resection with the same method is indicated. Afterwards 2 biopsies (polyps 5-9mm) or 4 biopsies (polyps 10-15mm) are performed from the resection margin to reveal presence or absence of residual neoplastic tissue.</description>
