    <textblock>
      Based on the pervious data, aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI is one of the effective&#xD;
      2nd line treatment option in advanced colorectal cancer. In this study, we prospectively&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of 2nd line aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI in advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer in terms of progression-free survival. We further assess the efficacy&#xD;
      according to the type of 1st line treatment. plasma biomarker study (HGF, VEGF-A, VEGF-D,&#xD;
      IFN-γ, Angiopoietin-2, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, TIMP-1, PIGF (HS), IL-6 (HS), IL-8 (HS),&#xD;
      sNeuropilin-1, Thrombospondin-2 , Osteopontin , sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, sVEGFR3) , overall survival&#xD;
      (OS)OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety are also assessed as the 2ndary objectives.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm study. Patients will be considered&#xD;
      &quot;on study&quot; upon signing the written informed consent form (ICF). The study consists of a&#xD;
      baseline period, followed by a treatment period, consisting of 14-day treatment cycles, which&#xD;
      will end by a 30-day Follow-up visit, which in turn, will be followed by a post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for PFS then be followed on study until death or until cut-off&#xD;
      date for final analysis of OS has been reached, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 21-day baseline period, all baseline procedures will have to be performed within&#xD;
      defined timelines, including review of eligibility criteria During the treatment period, the&#xD;
      study treatment, aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI will be administered every 2 weeks unless&#xD;
      a definitive treatment discontinuation criterion is met. Cycle lengths may be extended in&#xD;
      case of unresolved toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging to document tumor response and progressive disease will take place every 6 weeks and&#xD;
      will continue to be done during the follow-up period in case of early study treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation (i.e. prior to documented progression). Once disease progression is&#xD;
      documented, patients will be followed every 2 months for survival status and collection of&#xD;
      data regarding further anticancer therapy, until death or until the study cutoff date,&#xD;
      whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed for safety for a minimum of 30 days following the last&#xD;
      administration of the study treatment (30-day Follow-up visit). Beyond this date, all study&#xD;
      drug related AEs and all SAEs should be followed until resolution/stabilization. Study&#xD;
      drug-related AEs brought to the attention of the investigator at any time after the 30-day&#xD;
      Follow-up visit should be recorded in the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
