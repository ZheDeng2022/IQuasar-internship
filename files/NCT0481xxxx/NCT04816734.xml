  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The department of gastroenterology, hepatology and pediatric nutrition at the Necker-Enfants&#xD;
      Malades hospital has created an evaluation system for the initial therapeutic education&#xD;
      program followed by parents of children requiring parenteral nutrition at the Necker-Enfants&#xD;
      Malades hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test this evaluation plan and assess its interest in the learning&#xD;
      process of parents and then include it in the initial therapeutic education program for&#xD;
      parents of children requiring parenteral nutrition of Necker-Enfants Malades hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the highly technical nature of the care to be provided at home by parents of children&#xD;
      in need of parenteral nutrition, an assessment of the acquisition of both factual knowledge&#xD;
      provided to parents in hospital, but also of the reasoning, decision-making, technical skills&#xD;
      and parents attitudes seem necessary and essential before the child's return to his home in&#xD;
      order to guarantee his safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The department of gastroenterology, hepatology and pediatric nutrition of Necker-Enfants&#xD;
      Malades hospital has developed an educational assessment system based on previous studies in&#xD;
      this field. Composed of 4 tools, this plan allows a complete assessment with relevant&#xD;
      educational decision fields of the set of skills that parents must master to cope with their&#xD;
      child's illness on a daily basis, following their participation in the initial program of&#xD;
      therapeutic education offered by the Necker hospital team.&#xD;
