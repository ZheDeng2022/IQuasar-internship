  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are studies in the literature that include parent training for the prevention and care&#xD;
      of mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many national and international organizations have emphasized the responsibility of the nurse&#xD;
      in patient education and stated it in the relevant laws and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regulations focus on the educative role of the nurse for patients. In pediatric oncology&#xD;
      clinics where leukaemia treatment and care is provided, the educational role of the nurse is&#xD;
      directed towards the child individual and their family, and determining and meeting the&#xD;
      educational needs of the whole family is vital in the nursing management of the child with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, this study aims to examine the effect of mucositis care training to&#xD;
      caregivers of pediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years, on the development of mucositis and the&#xD;
      clinic's &quot;mucosal barrier damage, laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infections&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Children who are treated for leukaemia are exposed to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents and immunosuppressive treatments during the treatment, therefore they are at high risk&#xD;
      of complications. Gastrointestinal mucositis is the leading factor affecting the quality of&#xD;
      life of the child among the chemotherapy-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal mucositis (GM) can be defined as inflammation or ulceration in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal organs due to chemotherapy treatment. Symptoms of GM include abdominal pain,&#xD;
      diarrhoea, bleeding, fatigue, malnutrition, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and secondary&#xD;
      infections. GM can present in two forms as oral and anal mucositis. Both oral and anal all&#xD;
      GMs have negative effects on growth and development in children. One of the main issues of&#xD;
      the remedial approach in this regard is the provision of qualified mucositis care. There are&#xD;
      studies in the literature that include parent training for the prevention and care of&#xD;
      mucositis.&#xD;
