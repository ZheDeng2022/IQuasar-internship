  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical progress have made it possible to considerably improve the survival of children with&#xD;
      an oncological disease. Currently, the survival rate increased to above 90 % in the most&#xD;
      developed countries . This increase of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) asks us about their&#xD;
      future and their quality of life. Assessing health related life quality , previous studies&#xD;
      observe that in this particular population of patients, it is related to a poor physical&#xD;
      capacity , physical activity level and many of these patients do not meet the activity level&#xD;
      recommended by the world health organization due to fatigability and sedentary behaviours .&#xD;
      In addition to these habits, the CCS are more susceptible to develop cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      (CVR) leading to cardiovascular disease in adulthood and increases them mortality .&#xD;
      Furthermore, CCS who have been experiencing hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT)&#xD;
      are more susceptible to develop these CVR. In parallel with the common CVR, lower&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in the general&#xD;
      population has been established as a major and independent CVR for cardiologic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary fitness assessed by maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) allows&#xD;
      physicians to measure metabolic response to maximal effort in a population that is known as&#xD;
      VO2max. This domain of applied physiology permits a new way to approach the understanding of&#xD;
      global health prognosis in chronic disease. For example, decrease of VO2max is involved in&#xD;
      lower quality of life in patients with congenital heart disease. Cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
      test for VO2max exploration has been demonstrated feasible in child patients with leukemia or&#xD;
      other tumors after intensive chemotherapy, prior to HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness in CCS is already described in previous studies, but&#xD;
      this study aimed to compare a maximal CPET assessment on a large childhood cancer survivors&#xD;
      cohort with healthy control, on a quite young cohort, during the oncologic follow up and find&#xD;
      out its determinants.&#xD;

      This is a controlled, monocentric, cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary care center&#xD;
      for oncologic disease in children (Montpellier University Hospital, France) was carried out&#xD;
      between November 2010 and November 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups were identified: CCS group and control group.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control</arm_group_label>
    <description>The control group consisted in children referred for a non-severe functional symptom linked to exercise (murmur, palpitation, or dyspnoea) or for a medical sports certificate. These children were classified in the control group only after a completely normal check-up, including physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and spirometry.</description>
