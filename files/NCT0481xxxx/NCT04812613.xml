      According to the 2015 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), there has been a&#xD;
      significant increase in the number of secondary school youth who use poly-substances. Not all&#xD;
      youth have the same risk for problematic substance use. Health literature documents a high&#xD;
      level of comorbidity between mental health and substance use, which is exacerbated in&#xD;
      homeless youth populations. Therefore, the proposed study will focus on understanding&#xD;
      poly-substance use among at-risk homeless school youth. As seen in substance use research and&#xD;
      the PROMPT (2016) study (Participatory Research in Ottawa: Management and Point-of-Care for&#xD;
      Tobacco Dependence, PI: Dr. Smita Pakhale), reduction and quitting of one substance (tobacco&#xD;
      smoking) can lead to the reduction and quitting of other poly-substance use. A&#xD;
      Community-Based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR) approach can help at-risk youth feel&#xD;
      safe and comfortable enough to provide personal information about their poly-substance use&#xD;
      and engagement with treatment or harm reduction programs. This project will be a first step&#xD;
      in increasing health equity among at-risk homeless youth in Downtown Ottawa. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to follow a group of at-risk youth to while providing an appropriately&#xD;
      modified PROMPT intervention, including peers support and a licensed mental health and&#xD;
      substance use nurse.&#xD;

      Aim: A 6- to 8-month prospective cohort study to understand the root causes or facilitators&#xD;
      of poly-substance use among at-risk youth and designing an individualized, youth-specific,&#xD;
      community-based social intervention to reduce overall poly-substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: According to the 2015 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), there&#xD;
      has been a significant increase in the number of secondary school youth who use&#xD;
      poly-substances. Not all youth have the same risk for problematic substance use. Health&#xD;
      literature documents a high level of comorbidity between mental health and substance use,&#xD;
      which is exacerbated in homeless youth populations. With addiction research speaking to the&#xD;
      entangled nature of poly-substance use strengthened by shared neurobiological processes, the&#xD;
      need to address poly-substance use is important. Using a Community-Based Participatory Action&#xD;
      Research (CBPAR) approach can enhance intervention design as at-risk youth feel safe and&#xD;
      comfortable enough to provide personal information about their poly-substance use and&#xD;
      engagement with treatment or harm reduction programs. This type of research is especially&#xD;
      important given the growing opioid use crisis in the US and Canada, and the urgent need for&#xD;
      novel strategies to deal with the synchronicity of co-addictions, especially in high risk&#xD;
      youth populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 20 at-risk homeless youth between the ages of 13-17, including&#xD;
      street-involved, indigenous, LGBTQ and other non-mainstream youth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Patient-Oriented Outcome: Improved engagement and quality of life in participants. As&#xD;
      well, reduced self-reported poly-substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Phase 1 will involve gathering information on the root causes or facilitators&#xD;
      of poly-substance use among at-risk youth, the types of drug use that is most prevalent among&#xD;
      at-risk youth, and the early and ongoing points of access to licit and illicit substances.&#xD;
      Following Phase I, Phase II will involve a single arm prospective cohort study looking to&#xD;
      tackle poly-substance use in marginalized youth by providing an individualized,&#xD;
      youth-tailored (i.e. based on qualitative results obtained in phase I), social-based&#xD;
      intervention with optional access to an licensed mental health and substance use nurse&#xD;
      counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: 1) The Bridge Engagement Centre, Ottawa and 2) Operation Come Home, Ottawa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expertise: The PI is well versed in community-based research. Dr. Pakhale led the PROMPT&#xD;
      project, a community-based smoking cessation project engaging a similar target population.&#xD;
      Partnering with Operation Come Home and Ms. Elspeth McKay, the executive director of&#xD;
      Operation Come Home, provides the PI with expert experience in engaging this marginalized&#xD;
      youth population. Together the team is very experienced in substance dependence and the&#xD;
      target population. The investigators collective expertise with links to the target community&#xD;
      will support the implementation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Community-based participatory and peer-led research holds a tremendous potential in&#xD;
      investigating solutions 'for the people, by and with the people'. Outcomes of this trial will&#xD;
      aid policy makers in designing and implementing effective programs to treat substance&#xD;
      dependence in marginalized youth populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: The trial will require 6-8 months to complete.&#xD;

    <description>This study will utilize a mixed methods CBPAR approach. A peer-driven recruitment strategy will be implemented to enroll 20 at-risk youth who attend alternative schooling and drop-in activities at OCH. The investigators will select with the help of OCH staff, youth peer researchers that will be rigorously trained, similar to the PROMPT project. Peer researchers will be paid honoraria ($15/hr) to compensate for the time spent on research activities. Qualitative data through focus groups will also be collected from youth and key informants at OCH. This information will be used to design an individualized and focused social support intervention for youth. All youth in this arm will also have option to meet with a licensed mental health and substance use nurse to discuss treatment options. Youth's progress in the intervention will be followed with monthly interviews. The involvement of the research team will be limited to referring interested youth to said licensed health professional.</description>

    <description>An appropriately designed intervention will be created based off the qualitative data obtained from the participants and key-informants in phase 1 of the study. The intervention will first involve acquiring consent for participation and a baseline questionnaire, including: 1) demographic information, detailed poly-substance use history, and a social network questionnaire 2) EQ-5D-3L test to measure quality of life; 3) Patient Health Questionnaire to establish depressive disorder anxiety disorder. These same questions and tests will be also be administered at the end of the 6-month study to assess change substance use behavior, mental health and quality of life. For the next six months monthly follow-ups will occur, including iPad-based follow-up surveys (focusing on current substance use status) and weekly peer-led life skills workshops. A licensed addiction nurse will be available to youth throughout the study to discuss an individualized treatment plan.</description>
