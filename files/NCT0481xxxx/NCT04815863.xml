  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid aging and worsening psychological problems worldwide, the special focus on&#xD;
      somatic symptom and other psychological diseases of the older population is needed. However,&#xD;
      there is no research comparing the incidence of somatic symptom between elderly and&#xD;
      non-elderly, and clinical relevance with somatic symptom is uncertain. The study aims to&#xD;
      clarify the prevalence of somatic symptom, depression and anxiety disorders in China, to&#xD;
      compare physical and psychological difference between the elderly and non-elderly and to&#xD;
      explore risk factors for somatic symptom in the elderly.&#xD;

      With the steadily increasing of life expectancy, the aging people is expected to 2 billion by&#xD;
      2050, which brings the deeper demand on the quality of life improvement. The psychological&#xD;
      problems is an important factor affecting the quality of life. As reported, 73.6% of urban&#xD;
      residents were with mental sub-health, indicating that psychological problem has grown into&#xD;
      inevitable issues in hindering healthy development. The elderly, compared with the&#xD;
      non-elderly, have unique social and biological characteristics, so psychological problem of&#xD;
      the older population deserves special focus. Literatures have investigated aged people with&#xD;
      depression or anxiety disorder, but somatic symptom in elderly have rarely been addressed.&#xD;
      Somatic symptom disorder prevalence in elderly in European ranged from 0-13.5%. However,&#xD;
      there is no research comparing the incidence of somatic symptom, anxiety and depression&#xD;
      between elderly and non-elderly and revealing the prevalence of somatic symptom under&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators use Somatic Symptom Scale-China (SSS-CN) questionnaire to assess the presence&#xD;
      and severity of the symptoms. Patient Heath Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder Screener (GAD-7) are used to evaluate depression and anxiety disorder respectively.&#xD;
      The study aims to clarify the prevalence of somatic symptom, depression and anxiety disorders&#xD;
      in China, to compare physical and psychological difference between the elderly and&#xD;
      non-elderly and to explore risk factors for somatic symptom in the elderly.&#xD;
