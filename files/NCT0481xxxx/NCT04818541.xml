  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Clinical Investigation Plan is to assess the initial feasibility results&#xD;
      of the PerQseal® device, when used on this very specific Impella population. Safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness will be assessed in patients where an Impella device was used for either&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock or PPCI. Closure of femoral arterial access sites created with 13 to 14 F&#xD;
      sheaths will be studied, assessing the need for alternative therapy other than manual&#xD;
      compression or adjunctive endovascular ballooning.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm EFS. Patients undergoing use of an&#xD;
      Impella device for cardiogenic shock or PPCI, requiring an arteriotomy created by 13 to 14 F&#xD;
      sheaths (arteriotomies up to approx. 18 F), via the common femoral artery will be screened&#xD;
      against the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets study eligibility&#xD;
      requirements, they shall be invited to participate, provide informed consent, and shall&#xD;
      subsequently be assigned a study ID number. Enrollment will occur at the point where the&#xD;
      PerQseal study device first enters the patient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned enrollment is a minimum of 20 treated patients at a maximum of 5 study sites&#xD;
      located in the United States.&#xD;
