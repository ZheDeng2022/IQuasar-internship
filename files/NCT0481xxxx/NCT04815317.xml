  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Half of the patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) have moderate to severe dyspnea. This dyspnea has a negative impact on the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, on patients' comfort and could be involved in the genesis of&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress syndromes, a frequent complication of intensive care. Modifying&#xD;
      ventilation parameters does not always relieve dyspnea and administering morphine prolongs&#xD;
      the duration of mechanical ventilation. Dyspnea has, in addition to its sensory component, an&#xD;
      emotional component. The possibility to distract the patients' attention or to modulate their&#xD;
      emotions in order to relieve their dyspnea could therefore represent an innovative&#xD;
      therapeutic alternative devoid of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate the effect of auditory and sensory extra respiratory stimuli on the&#xD;
      sensation of dyspnea in intensive care patients undergoing mechanical, invasive or&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 45 intensive care patients under artificial ventilation will be exposed, according&#xD;
      to their randomization arm, to the following two stimuli for a duration of 10 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard relaxing music piece versus &quot;pink&quot; noise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fresh air on the face versus fresh air on the thigh. The effect of this stimulus will be&#xD;
           compared to a randomized control, these two conditions will be separated by a wash-out&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An pressure support (+5) increment will be performed to ensure comparability of subsequent&#xD;
      experimental sequences and their effect on dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea will be assessed in terms of intensity (visual analog scale) and characterized&#xD;
      sensorially. Will also be evaluated during the different conditions: pain, anxiety and stress&#xD;
      (sympathetic/parasympathetic balance) and extra-diaphragmatic electromyographic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical framework: research involving the human person at risk and minimal constraints&#xD;
      (physiology study that does not entail any risk for the patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and prospects: the investigators hypothesize that pleasant extra-respiratory&#xD;
      sensory stimulation significantly reduces the intensity of dyspnea in artificially ventilated&#xD;
      patients without any change in ventilator settings and pharmacological intervention. This&#xD;
      reduction in dyspnea is associated with decreased anxiety and stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will bring new, easy-to-use and side-effect-free tools to the therapeutic arsenal&#xD;
      for the relief of dyspnea in mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea or &quot;shortness of breath&quot; is a major symptom that alters the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients who suffer from it. It is a multimodal sensation that integrates psychological,&#xD;
      social and environmental factors (1). Recent studies have shown that dyspnea and pain share a&#xD;
      number of characteristics (2). In intensive care, dyspnea affects up to half of the patients&#xD;
      under mechanical ventilation (3). However, unlike pain, which has been the subject of&#xD;
      numerous studies in intensive care, relieving it is not a usual therapeutic objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, despite considerable progress in the understanding of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      dyspnea, there has been no major advance in the therapeutic tools aimed at relieving it. The&#xD;
      best evaluated and most prescribed drugs currently available to relieve dyspnea are morphine&#xD;
      drugs (4). However, there is no formal proof of their long-term effectiveness and side&#xD;
      effects such as the respiratory depressant effect make them difficult to use.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological tools integrating the sensory but also emotional dimension of dyspnea&#xD;
      have also been developed. The investigators find parallel medicines (acupuncture,&#xD;
      hypnosis...) but also extra respiratory stimulation techniques (thoracic vibrations,&#xD;
      administration of fresh air to the face...) which modulate and relieve dyspnea with a certain&#xD;
      success (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimizing tools to relieve dyspnea patients is therefore a priority. To date, the&#xD;
      pharmacological arsenal is limited due to the number of effective molecules and their side&#xD;
      effects. Non-pharmacological tools allowing to modulate the sensory and emotional components&#xD;
      of dyspnea represent a therapeutic alternative that deserves to be explored. This is the&#xD;
      purpose of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care have moderate to&#xD;
      severe dyspnea. This dyspnea has a negative impact on the duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      on patient comfort and on the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Changing&#xD;
      ventilation parameters does not always relieve dyspnea, and administering morphine prolongs&#xD;
      the duration of mechanical ventilation. The possibility of distracting the patients'&#xD;
      attention or modulating their emotions in order to relieve their dyspnea seems to be a simple&#xD;
      way to improve their comfort and could represent an innovative therapeutic alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators hypothesize that pleasant extra respiratory sensory&#xD;
      stimulation relieves dyspnea in artificially ventilated patients without any change in&#xD;
      ventilator settings and pharmacological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to demonstrate, in dyspneic patients undergoing artificial&#xD;
      ventilation, a decrease in dyspnea under the effect of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  listening to a piece of music versus pink noise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the application of cold air to the face versus the application of cold air to the calf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of extra-respiratory stimuli on :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the quality of dyspnea (thirst for air, excessive respiratory work, concentration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the intensity of secondary emotional responses (anxiety, fear).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the electromyographic activity of extra-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY CONDITIONS The experimental sessions will take place in the patient's room, in the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit of Prof. T. Similowski.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have been previously informed orally and in writing and will have signed the&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TYPE OF STUDY It is research involving the human person with minimal risk and constraints,&#xD;
      interventional, open, randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION, SAMPLING All subjects, without exception, must understand French and have read&#xD;
      and understood the appropriate information leaflet and signed the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is research involving the human person with minimal risk and constraints, interventional,&#xD;
      open, randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT MONITORING During the experimental sessions, an investigating physician will&#xD;
      systematically be present in the room. Any tolerance abnormality (agitation, disturbance of&#xD;
      vigilance, SpO2 &lt;88%, tachycardia greater than 130/min or mean blood pressure &lt; 60mmHG) will&#xD;
      lead to the interruption of the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL Each patient will participate in a single one-hour experimental session&#xD;
      that will take place as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of stimulation administered to the patient will be determined by randomization. The&#xD;
      order of administration of the stimulation and its control will also be determined by&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each experimental session will consist of ten sequences of 10 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental sequences will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASIC: recording of ventilation parameters, constants, ECG, skin conductance and&#xD;
      psycho-sensory parameters at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRESSURE SUPPORT INCREMENT: An pressure support (+5) increment will be performed to ensure&#xD;
      comparability of subsequent experimental sequences and their effect on dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WASH OUT: new recording in basic ventilation. Sensory and psycho-sensory parameters are again&#xD;
      collected as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STIMULUS 1 case or control: administration of extra-respiratory stimulation 1 or its control&#xD;
      depending on the randomization arm. Sensory and psycho-sensory variables are measured as&#xD;
      above.&#xD;

    <description>Electromyogram (EMG) of the extra-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles: the amplitude of the EMG signal of the extra-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles is proportional to the intensity of the dyspnea. It will be collected by self-adhesive surface electrodes of the same type as those usually used to collect the ECG signal in intensive care patients. A distance of 2 cm will separate the two electrodes. The position of the electrodes will depend on the muscle whose EMG activity is collected: scalene muscles, intercostal parasternal muscles, Alae nasi muscles, etc. The EMG signal will be amplified (PowerLab, AD Instruments, Hastings, UK), then sampled at a frequency of 10 kHz and finally filtered between 40 and 500 Hz.</description>

    <description>The impact of these stimulations will be compared to that of a control stimulus.&#xD;
The auditory control condition will consist of listening to a pink noise. The pink noise, like the white noise, is a normalized noise. The sound produced on a TV set that is out of adjustment during the &quot;snow effect&quot; is a representative example of such noise. Pink noise is a random signal whose power spectral density decreases by 3dB per octave. This signal is closer to the sensitivity of the ear than white noise.&#xD;
The sensitive control condition will be achieved by administering fresh air on the calf.&#xD;
An pressure support (+5) increment will be performed to ensure comparability of subsequent experimental sequences and their effect on dyspnea.</description>
