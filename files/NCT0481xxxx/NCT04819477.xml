  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most frequently dianosed cancer worldwide. To date, no screening method&#xD;
      has been able to establish itself as routinely recommended by the guidelines. In this&#xD;
      prospective study with 1:1 randomized questioning using an Internet tool, physicians will be&#xD;
      asked in 2 phases (before and after intervention with a fact box) about their assessment of&#xD;
      the benefits and risks of lung cancer screening by thoracic computed tomography and about a&#xD;
      potential intention to change referral behavior. Randomly assigned, half of the participants&#xD;
      will receive the same information in addition to the fact box graphically presented as a&#xD;
      Cates plot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The topic of lung cancer screening is highly topical and relevant in that this cancer is the&#xD;
      most frequently diagnosed worldwide and has the highest mortality among malignancies. To&#xD;
      date, no screening method has been able to establish itself as routinely recommended by the&#xD;
      guidelines. In the recently published Dutch-Belgian NELSON study on low dose thoracic CT as a&#xD;
      screening method in high-risk patients (smokers and ex-smokers), an - albeit small -&#xD;
      reduction in mortality was shown in the screening group vs. the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prerequisite for a detailed information of the patient about the implementation as well as&#xD;
      the advantages and disadvantages of screening is that the physician has risk competence and&#xD;
      knows and is able to interpret the screening data. The use of a fact box can be used to&#xD;
      improve knowledge of statistical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study with 1:1 randomized questioning using an Internet tool, physicians&#xD;
      will be asked in 2 phases (before and after intervention with a fact box) about their&#xD;
      assessment of the benefits and risks of lung cancer screening by thoracic computed tomography&#xD;
      and about a potential intention to change referral behavior. Randomly assigned, half of the&#xD;
      participants will receive the same information in addition to the fact box graphically&#xD;
      presented as a Cates plot.&#xD;
