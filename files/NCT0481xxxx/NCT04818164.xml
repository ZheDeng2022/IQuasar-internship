  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) may present with profound&#xD;
      hypoxemia not fully explained with pulmonary infiltrates. Accordingly, how prone positioning&#xD;
      improves oxygenation in these patients is not fully known. The investigators conducted a&#xD;
      study among patients with severe Covid-19 ARDS receiving prone position for at least 16&#xD;
      hours. End Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV) was measured with Nitrogen wash-in/wash-out&#xD;
      technique before (Supine Position 1- SP1), during (Prone Position - PP) and after (Supine&#xD;
      Position 2 - SP2) prone positioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, initial ventilator settings were&#xD;
      performed by the attending physician. These settings include titration of best PEEP to&#xD;
      promote oxygenation if Spo2 &lt;92% despite a Fio2 higher than 80% or best compliance that do&#xD;
      not jeopardize oxygenation if Fio2 is between 50-80% and Spo2 &gt;92%. After a period of 30&#xD;
      minutes for stabilisation, the first set of measurements were done in the SP1 position.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the patient was turned to prone position with the same PEEP (which was unchanged&#xD;
      throughout the study period) and measurements were repeated every four hours until the&#xD;
      patient was reverted back to SP2. Eventually, there were 7 measurements in total. (SP1, PP0,&#xD;
      PP4, PP8, PP12, PP16, SP2). Dead space ventilation and shunt fraction calculations were made&#xD;
      based on central venous blood gas measurements and oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      production at the relevant timepoint.&#xD;

             and intubated due to increased work of breathing and/or worsening hypoxemia. All&#xD;
             patients had a positive Covid-19 real time Polymerase Chain Reaction test&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria were; age &lt; 18 years, ARDS resulting from other risk factors,&#xD;
             presence of chest drainage tubes, tracheostomy, pneumomediastinum, hemodynamic&#xD;
             instability (systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg, lactate &gt; 2 mmol/l, or an increase in&#xD;
             lactate concentrations for 20% in two consecutive blood gas analysis within 2 hours&#xD;
             interval) and suspicion or confirmed pulmonary emboli.&#xD;
