  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study engages cancer survivors who have considered breast reconstruction after&#xD;
      mastectomy in developing and pilot testing an up-to-date, understandable, meaningful patient&#xD;
      decision aid video and workbook. Once the video and workbook are pilot-tested, a field test&#xD;
      with new patients will then compare whether it is more feasible and useful for women&#xD;
      considering breast reconstruction after mastectomy to view a video and workbook before their&#xD;
      appointment or an educational booklet during their appointment. The video explains the&#xD;
      process and types of reconstruction, the timeline for how breast reconstruction is done, and&#xD;
      how the cost of this surgery is covered. The workbook helps patients compare your options and&#xD;
      prepare for the appointment. The educational booklet explains the same process, types,&#xD;
      timeline and costs, and is designed to help the patient and their surgeon compare and discuss&#xD;
      the options together during the appointment. By comparing these two methods, researchers may&#xD;
      learn which of these is more effective in helping patients make a decision about breast&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To design a patient decision aid video about breast reconstruction. II. To pilot test its&#xD;
      acceptability with women. III. To field test the feasibility of delivery pre-consultation and&#xD;
      efficacy at preparing women for their discussion with their plastic surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOCUS GROUP: Survivors who previously considered breast reconstruction participate in a 40 to&#xD;
      60-minute focus group to gather feedback on currently-available patient decision aids and&#xD;
      educational materials. The research team uses their feedback to create an initial prototype&#xD;
      of a patient decision aid video&#xD;
&#xD;
      PILOT TEST: Survivors who previously considered breast reconstruction review the initial&#xD;
      prototype of the patient decision aid video, then complete a questionnaire providing their&#xD;
      feedback about the video's strengths and areas that could be improved. The research team then&#xD;
      incorporates their feedback into the video.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIELD TEST: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Before their appointment, patients spend up to 30 minutes viewing a video and&#xD;
      workbook. They also spend 5 to 10 minutes completing a questionnaire before and after the&#xD;
      video and workbook, and again after their appointment. After their appointment, the research&#xD;
      assistant reviews their medical record to confirm what decisions the patient and doctor made&#xD;
      about breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: During their appointment, patients spend up to 30 minutes reviewing the standard&#xD;
      educational booklet about breast reconstruction. They also spend 5 to 10 minutes completing a&#xD;
      questionnaire before and after the booklet, and again after their appointment. After their&#xD;
      appointment, the research assistant reviews their medical record to confirm what decisions&#xD;
      the patient and doctor made about breast reconstruction.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delivery Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months prior to plastic surgery consultation</time_frame>
    <description>The statistician will calculate how many women to whom the research assistant was able to deliver the video/workbook or educational materials (i.e., by sending them the URL link or scheduling time to show them the video/workbook or educational materials on an iPad at the clinic), out of the total n = 130 eligible women. The statistician will also calculate the rates of women who prefer to view the video and workbook at home or at the clinic; and of women who re-visit the video and workbook after the consultation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast Reconstruction Knowledge Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months prior to plastic surgery consultation</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 10 true/false items assessing participants' knowledge of breast reconstruction. Items are scored such that 0% correct responses equals no knowledge and 100% correct responses equals perfect knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preparation for Decision Making Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 11 multiple choice items assessing how well-prepared participants feel they are for making this shared medical decision with their doctors. Participants rate each item on 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (a great deal). To calculate a total score, responses are summed and multiplied by 2 to yield the total score. Total scores range from 0 (Poorly prepared) to 100 (Excellently prepared). Alpha coefficients observed between 0.92 to 0.96. This scale discriminates between people who do/do not find the decision aid helpful (p &lt; 0.0001). For this study, a threshold of 75 out of 100 will be considered acceptable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before intervention, immediately after intervention, immediately after consultation</time_frame>
    <description>This scale includes 16 question-items assessing participants' level of decisional conflict, defined as anxiety that blocks taking action. Participants rate each item on a Likert Scale with 5 responses from 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Extremely). Scores are summed, divided by 16, and multiplied by 25 to yield a total score of 0 (Less conflicted) to 100 (Highly conflicted). Total scores above 37.5 out of 100 are associated with delaying decisions and uncertainty about implementing their preferred treatment option; scores below 25 out of 100 are associated with making decisions and successfully implementing their preferred treatment option.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BREAST-Questionnaire (Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year prior to surgery, up to 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The BREAST-Q assesses women's self-reported ratings of their satisfaction with their breasts and associated quality of life in terms of psychosocial, sexual, and physical well-being. Participants rate 64 items from 1 (Very Dissatisfied) to 4 (Very Satisfied). Psychometric properties include a person separation index of 0.76 to 0.95, Cronbach's alphas of 0.81 to 0.96, and test-retest reproducibility of 0.73 to 0.96 Before surgery, after surgery</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Type of surgery completed</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The study coordinator will abstract the type(s) of reconstructive surgery completed, including immediate versus delayed reconstruction, autologous versus implant-based reconstruction, nipple reconstruction, contralateral balancing surgery, oncoplastic tissue rearrangement, and/or no reconstruction. This questionnaire is not a validated scale and thus no scoring or psychometric properties are appropriate. Responses will be used to model potential covariate relationships with the primary and other secondary outcome measures.</description>
