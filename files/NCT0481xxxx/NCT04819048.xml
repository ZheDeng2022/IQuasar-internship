  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) , a musculoskeletal condition , includes a series of&#xD;
      clinical problems involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the masticatory muscles, and&#xD;
      related structures.This study evaluates the efficacy of integrated traditional Chinese and&#xD;
      western medicine in the treatment of TMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 84 patients ranging in age from 18 to 65 years with diagnoses of TMD will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG) who will receive the integrated&#xD;
      traditional Chinese and western medicine treatment group(with Low-Level Laser&#xD;
      Therapy+acupuncture) and a control group who will receive the only western medicine&#xD;
      treatment(with Low-Level Laser Therapy).Both approaches will be applied 3times a week for 3&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <description>TMD pain will be quantified by the VAS, which is a 10-cm line ranging from 0 cm (no pain at all) to 10 cm (the worst possible pain). The patients are instructed to choose the grade of their spontaneous pain intensity on the 10 points scale during resting, mouth opening, and chewing.And then the operator takes the maximum from that.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tempommandibular Opening Index(TOI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Tempommandibular Opening Index at week 3</time_frame>
    <description>TOI=(Maximum voluntary opening-passive opening)/Maximum voluntary opening+Passive opening)× 100％.&#xD;
The maximum mouth opening without pain will be recorded by placing a millimeter ruler in a vertical position, from the incisal edge of the maxillary left central incisor to the incisal edge of the mandibular left central incisor.&#xD;
Based on the the maximum opening, the researcher uses thumb and forefinger slowly against the upper and lower incisor , with soft and stable pressure until the distance no longer increases .This is called the passive opening .</description>

    <description>The laser light will be applied in 6 points on the affected side: anterior to the mandibular condyle and intraauricular toward the temporomandibular joint; 2 points irradiation on the superficial masseter muscle and 2 points on the anterior temporal muscle bundle. Each point will be irradiated for 30 seconds for a total of 180 seconds.&#xD;
After LLLT irradiation,the following acupuncture points will be selected: Jiache,Xiaguan,Quanliao,Baihui,Fengchi, Hegu.The needles will be inserted and rotated manually with a frequency of about 100 turns per minute clockwise and counterclockwise ,as above vertically into a depth of 25-30 mm to achieve the proper feel called &quot;Deqi&quot; in every point on the affected side, and then the needles will be retained for 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will be firstly irradiated by the GaAlAs infrared laser (CDHC,Denlase 980/7 Diode Laser Therapy System,China), with an output of 500 mW, emitting radiation wavelength of 980 nm, spot size 0.2cm2 ,15J/point, in a continuous mode .The therapeutic LLLT application is achieved through direct contact of the probe on the skin.&#xD;
The needles using are disposable, sterile, individually packed, and made of stainless steel (Hua Tuo; Suzhou Medical Supplies Factory Co, Ltd,Suzhou, China), in sizes 0.25 mm ×40 mm.Asepsis of the skin will be performed with cotton wool and 75% alcohol.</description>
