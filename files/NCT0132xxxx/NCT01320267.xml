    <textblock>
      The investigators will document the success for completing laparoscopic resection of cancer&#xD;
      in the right colon using a new single port access technique. The current procedure requires 4&#xD;
      incisions for 4 separate ports. With technological advancement of newly designed instruments&#xD;
      it is now possible to do the same laparoscopic procedure through a single port. The&#xD;
      investigators want to demonstrate here in British Columbia that it is a safe procedure with&#xD;
      similar success and outcomes compared to the standard 4-port laparoscopic operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that this procedure may provide early discharge due to less pain&#xD;
      and also be associated with less wound infection and hernia complications. The single&#xD;
      incision will have improved cosmesis compared to the standard 4-port standard laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that single port right hemi-colectomy can be&#xD;
      performed with consistency. The second purpose is to assess single port surgery in terms of&#xD;
      length of stay in the hospital, analgesics requirement, and length of scar at 30 days. The&#xD;
      single port surgery is a latest advancement towards achieving minimal scarring after major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Colon resection is well-documented and standard practice in many centers&#xD;
      throughout the world. A Cochrane Review of 25 Randomized Control Trials (RCT) published in&#xD;
      2005 looked at the short term (30 Days) benefits of laparoscopic colorectal resection showed&#xD;
      better outcome in intra-operative blood loss, intensity of postoperative pain, postoperative&#xD;
      hospital stay, duration of postoperative ileus, and pulmonary functions (1). Total morbidity&#xD;
      and local (surgical) morbidity was decreased in the laparoscopic groups. Until the 30th&#xD;
      postoperative day, quality of life was better in laparoscopic patients. They concluded if the&#xD;
      long-term oncological results of laparoscopic and conventional resection of colonic carcinoma&#xD;
      show equivalent results, the laparoscopic approach should be preferred in patients suitable&#xD;
      for this approach to colectomy. A Cochrane Review published in 2008 looked at 33 RCT's&#xD;
      comparing laparoscopic/Laparoscopic-assisted and open colectomy for colo-rectal carcinoma&#xD;
      found similar long-term oncologic outcomes in both groups (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) instead of traditional 4 ports theoretically may&#xD;
      reduce the wound complications. For cholecystectomy, a blinded randomized control study&#xD;
      showed significant reduction in pain control at sub-costal port-sites in 2-port versus 4-port&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy and also showed similar pain at umbilical port (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been few reports of performing colectomy through a single port similar to the SILS&#xD;
      cholecystectomy as mentioned above. Remzi et al published a report of performing&#xD;
      sigmoid-colectomy for polyp using single umbilical tri-port system (4). Merchant et al used a&#xD;
      single port (this time a Gel-port) to perform SILS right hemicolectomy (5). Bucher reported a&#xD;
      case of single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for stenosis due to endometriosis (6).&#xD;
      They questioned if SILS colectomy offers benefits except in cosmesis, when compared to&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-mentioned publications of SILS colectomy used conventional and not so conventional&#xD;
      instruments (curved and/or articulating forceps). The availability of these instruments due&#xD;
      to technical advancement has opened the door for these procedures to be performed more&#xD;
      routinely. In a recent study this technique was applied effectively and performed in&#xD;
      comparable operative times to traditional 3-port cholecystectomy with a learning curve of&#xD;
      approximately 5 cases (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently Dixon et al.(8) demonstrated by performing variety of colo-rectal procedures using a&#xD;
      single port laparoscopic technique. They performed, right hemi-colectomy, extended right&#xD;
      hemi-colectomy, total colectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis, procto-colectomy, restorative&#xD;
      procto-colectomy with ileo-anal pouch formation and anterior resection. Two of these&#xD;
      procedures were for cancers. All operations were performed using a single incision tri-port&#xD;
      system with harmonics scalpel, linear/circular stapler and standard laparoscopic instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess short-term outcome variables for the single incision&#xD;
      laparoscopic resection procedure in a pilot study of 20 patients diagnosed with resectable&#xD;
      right colon cancer. The investigators will compare these short term outcome variables to an&#xD;
      aggregate group of patients that previously had undergone standard 4-port laparoscopic&#xD;
      resection of right colon cancer in a 12-month period (2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Successful completion of the right hemicolectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of additional ports and reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conversion to an open procedure and reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Duration of the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Operative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Number and total length of surgical incisions&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Postoperative analgesia requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Postoperative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Length of postoperative hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Cancer stage (TNM)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Resection margin clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Number of lymph nodes assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected prospectively for patients undergoing the single port laparoscopic&#xD;
      resection. Data will be abstracted retrospectively from electronic hospital and office charts&#xD;
      for patients that previously had standard laparoscopic resection of right colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, operative and postoperative data will be summarized and reported as counts and&#xD;
      percents for categorical variables and Mean Â± Standard Deviation (plus Median &amp; Min. Max.)&#xD;
      for continuous variables. Outcomes of the two groups will be compared by independent samples&#xD;
      t-tests and non-parametric median tests for continuous variables and Chi-square or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact tests for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study sample size of 20 was chosen on the basis of a reasonable number of patients&#xD;
      to be recruited in one year. The comparison group size for patients previously having&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic resection was chosen only for convenience but is estimated at&#xD;
      approximately 20 patients.&#xD;
