    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced head and neck cancer is at high risk of recurrence at the primary site&#xD;
      or in the neck. Part of normal treatment is to treat such patients with chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation. The chemotherapy can include Erbitux. The purpose of this study is to treat such&#xD;
      patients with an additional agent, Torisel. This study tests the doses of Torisel that can be&#xD;
      safely administered together with radiation and chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30,000 new cases of local-regionally advanced head and neck carcinoma (HNC) and&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are diagnosed each year for which surgery is&#xD;
      either insufficient, non-curative or not feasible. For these patients, radiation therapy is&#xD;
      the mainstay of treatment often with the use of concurrent chemotherapy and/or concurrent&#xD;
      cetuximab therapy. Radiation therapy is also commonly employed in the post-operative setting&#xD;
      for patients with high risk features predisposing to recurrent disease. Although progress has&#xD;
      been made, the prominent pattern of failure among these aggressively treated patients remains&#xD;
      loco-regional failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinases, is abnormally activated in nearly all epithelial cancers, including HNC. Nearly all&#xD;
      HNC expressing high levels of EGFR have been associated with poor outcomes. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      can lead to increased expression of EGFR in cancer cells, and blockade of EGFR signaling has&#xD;
      been shown to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation. The use of monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      directed against EGFR has a rich pre-clinical record. However, it was not until the&#xD;
      publication of the Bonner trial that combined radiotherapy plus anti-EGFR therapy was shown&#xD;
      to be successful in the clinic to treat HNSCC. This study showed that the addition of single&#xD;
      agent cetuximab 250 mg/m2 given weekly with concurrent radiation therapy improved median&#xD;
      overall survival from 29 to 49 months. Furthermore, progression-free survival was improved&#xD;
      from 12 to 17.1 months. In addition, patients were able to tolerate the regimen with no&#xD;
      difference in rates of mucositis. Other toxicities were also similar to radiotherapy alone,&#xD;
      with the exceptions of a small risk of infusion reactions, and the common - but non-dose&#xD;
      limiting - occurrence of an acneiform rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an enzyme&#xD;
      that regulates cell growth and proliferation. Temsirolimus prevents progression from the G1&#xD;
      phase to the S phase of the cell cycle through inhibition of mTOR, which is a novel mechanism&#xD;
      of action for an anticancer drug. This is also important for concurrent treatment with&#xD;
      radiation, since S-phase represents the most radiation resistant phase of the cell cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is a structural analog of sirolimus (rapamycin) that has been formulated for IV&#xD;
      or oral administration for the treatment of various malignancies. Sirolimus was shown to have&#xD;
      potent immunosuppressive as well as antifungal and antitumor properties. Its mechanism of&#xD;
      action results in part from binding to an intracellular cytoplasmic protein, FK506&#xD;
      (tacrolimus) binding protein (FKBP)-12. The complex of sirolimus bound to FKBP-12 blocks the&#xD;
      activity of mTOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is an important agent in the treatment of HNSCC; however its success may be limited&#xD;
      by downstream signaling molecules which may up-regulate and cause the malignant phenotype to&#xD;
      persist. MET proto-oncogene amplification has been hypothesized to lead to EGFR-independent&#xD;
      activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway through activation of HER3-dependent signaling. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that attacking HNC at two key points in the cellular proliferation and survival&#xD;
      system will maximize HNC cell killing and irradicate subpopulations of cells which may be&#xD;
      able to bypass the EGFR inhibition with independent activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.&#xD;
      The concomitant use of cetuximab and temsirolimus permits active inhibition of both EGF, and&#xD;
      the VEGF pathway related with angiogenesis, with synergistic responses as seen in&#xD;
      experimental models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients who have pre-existing renal or functional conditions - preventing the&#xD;
      administration of cisplatin - receive cetuximab concurrently with radiation as standard of&#xD;
      care, there is a clear phenomenon of the development of EGFR inhibitor resistance. Therefore,&#xD;
      the ability to target one of the escape pathways of EGFR inhibitor resistance via blockade of&#xD;
      the PI3K pathway, possibly in the synergistic manner, provides an important and novel method&#xD;
      for achieving high rates of complete and durable response to treatment in patients who are&#xD;
      unable to tolerate traditional chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most patients who do not have pre-existing renal or functional conditions, cisplatin is&#xD;
      considered the standard of care. However, given the relatively poor rates of disease free&#xD;
      survival with platinum and radiation combinations, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group&#xD;
      (RTOG) 0522 phase III trial of a combination of accelerated radiation therapy with cisplatin&#xD;
      and cetuximab was completed to accrual in March 2009. The results of that trial are still&#xD;
      pending, although the fact that it closed to accrual indicates that it was a tolerable&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who can receive cisplatin, they will receive temsirolimus together with&#xD;
      cisplatin, cetuximab and radiation in a phase I study. In patients judged by the medical&#xD;
      oncologist as being unable to receive cisplatin, they will receive temsirolimus together with&#xD;
      cetuximab and radiation in a separate arm in this phase I study. We will show the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated doses of temsirolimus as a primary objective, with a secondary objective of&#xD;
      examining progression-free survival at 12 months in each of these two arms.&#xD;
