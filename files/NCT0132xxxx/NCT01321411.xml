      Respiratory muscles (the muscles used to breathe) need more blood (and oxygen) when their&#xD;
      workload increases. It is difficult to measure respiratory muscle blood flow (RMBF) without&#xD;
      invasive techniques. We will evaluate a new, much less invasive technique to measure RMBF in&#xD;
      2 groups: Healthy Volunteers and Critically Ill patients on breathing machines. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the accuracy of this new monitoring technique called Near&#xD;
      Infrared Spectroscopy Utilizing Indocyanine Green Dye when compared with traditional&#xD;
      measurements. The information gained from this study will help us to provide better care to&#xD;
      patients with severe lung problems.&#xD;

      PURPOSE To demonstrate the relationship between Respiratory Muscle Blood Flow and Work of&#xD;
      Breathing using Near Infrared Spectroscopy utilizing Indocyanine Green Dye NIRS-ICG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS #1: In subjects with normal respiratory muscle function (healthy volunteers) RMBF&#xD;
      as measured by the NIRS-ICG technique will vary directly with work of breathing (WOB) as&#xD;
      measured by changes in transpulmonary pressure gradients and as measured by Esophageal and&#xD;
      Surface EMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective #1: To measure and demonstrate the relationship between RMBF and WOB/EMG in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers simulating abnormal pulmonary resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective #2: To measure and demonstrate the relationship between RMBF and WOB in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers simulating abnormal pulmonary compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS #2: In subjects with abnormal respiratory muscle function (weaning from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation after exacerbations of COPD or ARDS) RMBF as measured by the NIRS-ICG technique&#xD;
      will vary with work of breathing as measured by changes in transpulmonary pressure gradients&#xD;
      and as measured by Esophageal and Surface EMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective #3: To measure and demonstrate the relationship between RMBF and WOB in clinical&#xD;
      subjects with abnormal pulmonary resistance (weaning from mechanical ventilation after COPD&#xD;
      exacerbation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective #4: To measure and demonstrate the relationship between RMBF and WOB in clinical&#xD;
      subjects with abnormal pulmonary compliance (weaning from mechanical ventilation after ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS #3: We speculate, based on previous authors, that the blood flow rates in&#xD;
      respiratory muscles for a given WOB will be different in clinical populations that in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. We hypothesize that the slope of the linear regression analysis relating BFI to&#xD;
      WOB (both transpulmonary pressure gradients and EMG) will be &quot;steeper&quot; in clinical&#xD;
      populations, suggesting that one reason for respiratory failure and weaning difficulties in&#xD;
      these populations may be inefficient respiratory muscle oxygen utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective #5: To demonstrate that the RMBF-WOB relationships in clinical populations will be&#xD;
      different from that measured in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION To date, the measurement of regional blood flow and oxygen utilization has&#xD;
      proven difficult. Nowhere is this more true than in the measurement of the regional blood&#xD;
      flow and oxygen utilization of the respiratory muscles. Much of what we know about&#xD;
      Respiratory Muscle Blood Flow (RMBF) stems from animal investigations or human research&#xD;
      requiring highly invasive methods. The development of a minimally invasive technique for the&#xD;
      measurement of RMBF has the potential to add significantly to our knowledge of respiratory&#xD;
      energetics in research and clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to measure the absorption of electromagnetic&#xD;
      energy in the near infrared range (650 to 1000 nm) by in vivo chromophores. When assessing&#xD;
      regional tissue oxygenation, NIRS assesses the amount of emitted energy absorbed in the range&#xD;
      associated with hemoglobin (760 nm) and with deoxyhemoglobin (800 nm). The ratio of these&#xD;
      amounts of absorbed light can be used to generate an index of tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation/deoxygenation. Indocyanine green dye is a synthetic chromophore that absorbs&#xD;
      energy in the infrared spectrum (805 nm). Guenette et al. measured the accumulation of ICG in&#xD;
      respiratory muscles using NIRS while the concentration of ICG in the arterial blood was&#xD;
      measured using photodensitometry. This technique has the advantage of being able to quantify&#xD;
      absolute muscle blood flow with simultaneous measures of cardiac output, thereby allowing the&#xD;
      calculation of absolute regional blood flows and absolute rates of regional oxygen uptake.&#xD;
      The practicality of this technique in healthy volunteers is complicated by with the need for&#xD;
      blood withdrawals and re-infusions as well as arterial cannulation and the measurement of&#xD;
      cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid the logistical difficulties of arterial cannulation and central venous cannulation&#xD;
      (required for the determination of cardiac output), a relative Blood Flow Index (BFI) has&#xD;
      been proposed. The BFI method is a minimally invasive alternative and was first developed for&#xD;
      rapid and repeated bedside estimation of cerebral blood flow. The BFI is derived from a&#xD;
      transcutaneously measured NIRS ICG signal and does not require arterial cannulation or the&#xD;
      measurement of cardiac output. BFI is a relative measure of blood flow as absolute flow&#xD;
      cannot be determined unless arterial ICG concentration is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous analyses have compared BFI and absolute muscle blood flow determined using NIRS and&#xD;
      ICG and demonstrated strong agreement between BFI and NIRS derived absolute muscle blood&#xD;
      flow. To date, no study has looked at the relationship between NIRS-ICG derived BFI values&#xD;
      and respiratory workload as measured by esophageal and surface EMG (EEMG-SEMG) in subjects&#xD;
      with abnormal compliance or resistance or in clinical populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), is a pathologic&#xD;
      condition characterized by lung parenchyma destruction and abnormal airway narrowing that&#xD;
      leads to a limitation of air. In clinical practice, COPD is defined by its characteristically&#xD;
      low airflow and abnormal pulmonary system resistance during lung function tests. In contrast&#xD;
      to asthma, this limitation is poorly reversible and progresses over time. COPD is the 4th&#xD;
      leading cause of death amongst Canadians. Severe exacerbations of COPD may require mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and intensive care unit admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung disease caused by both direct and&#xD;
      indirect inflammatory injury. It is characterized by inflammation of the lung parenchyma&#xD;
      leading to impaired gas exchange and abnormal respiratory system compliance. Hypoxemia and&#xD;
      the release of systemically active cytokines frequently result in multiple organ failure and&#xD;
      death. ARDS typically requires mechanical ventilation and admission to an intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD or ARDS that require mechanical ventilation are at high risk of death&#xD;
      either from their disease or from complications during critical illness. Those that survive&#xD;
      the acute phase of their illness often require prolonged mechanical ventilation and often&#xD;
      have difficulty weaning from ventilator support. While lung parenchymal abnormalities and&#xD;
      deconditioning are significant components of this &quot;weaning failure&quot;, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, and potentially respiratory muscle blood flow, may play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD We will conduct a series of four studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the Near Infrared Spectroscopy Indocyanine Green Dye (NIRS-ICG) technique for the&#xD;
      non-invasive measurement of Respiratory Muscle Blood Flow (RMBF). The first two studies will&#xD;
      occur in healthy volunteers and the second two studies will occur in clinical populations&#xD;
      (mechanically ventilated patients recovering from exacerbations of COPD or recovering from&#xD;
      ARDS). The first two studies will occur in our respiratory physiology laboratory (the Health&#xD;
      and Integrative Physiology Laboratory at the University of British Columbia) and the second&#xD;
      two will occur in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at VGH.&#xD;
