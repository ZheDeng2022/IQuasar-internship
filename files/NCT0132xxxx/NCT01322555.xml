      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with autism and autism spectrum disorders have problems with communication,&#xD;
      behavior, and socializing, and many also have intellectual and developmental disabilities.&#xD;
      The cause of autism is not known, but previous research has suggested an association between&#xD;
      autism and immune changes in the brain. Researchers are interested in using the experimental&#xD;
      radioactive drug (11C)PBR28, which attaches to a protein in the brain that is involved in&#xD;
      immune changes, in positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of people with and without&#xD;
      autism to see if there are greater immune changes in those with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine if positron emission tomography scanning can be used to evaluate changes in an&#xD;
      immune system protein in the brains of people with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who have been diagnosed with either autism or&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorders, or are healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and psychological examination,&#xD;
           medical history, questionnaires about behavior and mood, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two imaging studies of the brain at separate study visits. The&#xD;
           first study visit will involve a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to provide a&#xD;
           baseline image of the brain. The second study visit will involve PET scan with the&#xD;
           radioactive chemical (11C)PBR28 to study immune system proteins in the brain. The MRI&#xD;
           scan will take about 40 minutes, and the PET scan will take about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a final study visit 24 hours after the PET scan to provide a&#xD;
           final blood sample for testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current estimates indicate that 1 in 110 children are affected with autism. Despite this&#xD;
      striking statistic, we remain unable to describe the pathophysiology for autism, and we do&#xD;
      not have adequate treatments for autism. The etiologies in most patients with autism are&#xD;
      unknown, but emerging evidence supports a causal role of immune activation in autism.&#xD;
      Multiple studies provide clear evidence of immune activation in peripheral blood of patients&#xD;
      with autism, as demonstrated by elevations in immune markers (IFN-gamma, IL-1RA, IL-6, and&#xD;
      TNF-alpha). Studies also demonstrate immune activation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of&#xD;
      patients with autism, as evidenced by significant elevations in cytokines and TNF-alpha.&#xD;
      Finally, three postmortem brain studies report neuroimmune activation in patients with autism&#xD;
      (ages 4-45). Combined, these three postmortem studies show activation of microglia and&#xD;
      astroglia through elevations in cytokines, histology and stereology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the growing body of literature supporting neuroimmune activation in autism is&#xD;
      intriguing, the current results present limitations. First, there are no studies assessing&#xD;
      the brains of living patients with autism/ASDs. Second, the most convincing evidence for&#xD;
      neuroimmune activation in postmortem brains is extracted almost exclusively from patients&#xD;
      with classical autism, where intellectual disability is common. As such, the evidence for&#xD;
      neuroimmune activation in higher functioning patients with autism and autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorders (ASDs) is less robust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to determine whether neuroimmune activation is present in the living brains of&#xD;
      patients with autism. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of the autisms , as they are now&#xD;
      called, we would like to determine whether neuroimmune activation is detectable in higher&#xD;
      versus lower functioning patients with autism/ASDs. We propose to measure neuroimmune&#xD;
      activation in the living brains of patients by utilizing positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      and the radioligand [(11)C]PBR28. This radioligand binds translocator protein (TSPO), which&#xD;
      is over-expressed in activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, and has been demonstrated&#xD;
      as a reliable marker of neuroimmune activation in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Because&#xD;
      the majority of patients with autism/ASD will require propofol sedation to remain motionless&#xD;
      for the two hour scan, we will include a control arm with healthy volunteers without then&#xD;
      with propofol in order to determine the effects of propofol on [(11)C]PBR28 uptake. NIH has&#xD;
      developed a setup in the clinical center for administering sedation/anesthesia in a safe&#xD;
      manner, making this important study possible.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS WITH AUTISM OR ASD (INCLUSION CRITERIA):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have a diagnosis of autistic disorder (299.0) or Asperger s disorder&#xD;
             (299.80), as determined using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) and&#xD;
             confirmation with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (Lord 1997) and/or Autism&#xD;
             Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS). (A diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder,&#xD;
             or PDD, will not suffice for this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be adults between 18-45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be healthy based on history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must be &quot;binders&quot; to [11C]PBR28 as determined via one of two ways: by prior&#xD;
             participation in a PET scan with [11C]PBR28 or by in vitro testing of their&#xD;
             leukocytes. We found that non-binders have markedly reduced affinity of [3H]PBR28 to&#xD;
             leukocyte membranes. The in vitro binding has shown no overlapping values between&#xD;
             binders (~90%) and non-binders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must either provide informed consent, or they must assent in combination with&#xD;
             informed consent by a legal guardian or durable power of attorney (DPA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (INCLUSION CRITERIA):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be adults between 18-45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be healthy based on history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be binders to [11 C]PBR28 (see point 4 above for details)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior to the PET scan, all healthy subjects must have had within the prior year an MRI&#xD;
             scan of the brain to rule out significant structural abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS WITH AUTISM OR ASD (EXCLUSION CRITERIA):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any history of alcohol or substance dependence, as these conditions may alter uptake&#xD;
             of [11C]PBR28.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any history of alcohol or substance abuse within the past 6 months, as these&#xD;
             conditions may alter uptake of [11C]PBR28.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In addition to the diagnosis of autistic disorder, ASD or Asperger, any other Axis I&#xD;
             disorder that requires inpatient hospitalization during this study, or is at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment worsening relative to baseline. We will not completely exclude all Axis&#xD;
             I disorders, because it is typical for patients with autism /ASD to carry comorbid&#xD;
             Axis I disorders, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), social phobia,&#xD;
             obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), dysthymia, Major Depressive Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Intellectual quotient (IQ) less than 30, as including the lowest functioning patients&#xD;
             would make the experiment logistically challenging and would broaden heterogeneity too&#xD;
             much.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as assessed by the PI, medically&#xD;
             responsible investigator or consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Serious medical problems including but not limited to chronic neurological disease&#xD;
             such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, poorly controlled seizure disorder,&#xD;
             or serious cardiopulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active seizure disorder, as defined as having had a seizure in the past year or being&#xD;
             on antiepileptic medications for seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Positive HIV status.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Head trauma resulting in a period of unconsciousness lasting longer than 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Exposure to radiation in the past year (i.e., PET from other research), which when&#xD;
             combined with this study would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Positive urine drug screen at time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnancy at time of scan (beta HCG will be measured in all female patients within 24&#xD;
             hours before start of scan and must be negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. In patients who will get an MRI scan at NIH, metallic foreign bodies that would be&#xD;
             affected by the MRI magnet, or a fear of enclosed spaces that would prohibit MRI&#xD;
             scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Allergy to propofol or eggs (since egg products are used to formulate propofol),.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Snoring, as this increases the likelihood of complications from propofol sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Currently taking antibacterial drugs (such as Amoxicillin-Clavulanate/ Augmentin ,&#xD;
             Metronidazole/Flagyl Minocycline/Minocin ). We will not discontinue any medications in&#xD;
             any subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Currently taking antiviral drugs (such as Acyclovir/Zovirax , Interferon beta 1/Avonex&#xD;
             , Valacyclovir/Valtrex ). We will not discontinue any medications in any subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Taking corticosteroids within the 6 months prior to study enrollment (such as&#xD;
             Dexamethasone/Decadron , Hydrocortisone/Hydrocortone , Methylprednisone/Medrol ). We&#xD;
             will not discontinue any medications in any subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Taking immunosuppressants in the past 6 months prior to study enrollment (such as&#xD;
             Azathioprine/Imuran , Infliximab/Remicade , Sulfasalazine/ Azulfidine ,&#xD;
             Olsalazine/Dipentum ). We will not discontinue any medications in any subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Any history of taking immunosuppressants in the context of chemotherapy or organ&#xD;
             transplant. Medications in this class might include Tacrolimus/Prograf ,&#xD;
             6-mercaptopurine/Purinethol , and Methotrexate/Trexall . We will not discontinue any&#xD;
             medications in any subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Currently taking Clozapine/Clozaril , as high doses in rats increases TSPO. With the&#xD;
             exception of clozapine, patients may be on centrally-acting medications, including&#xD;
             medications for mood and behavioral disturbances. These medications may be&#xD;
             antiepileptic medications, so long as the antiepileptics are being used for symptoms&#xD;
             of mood and behavior as opposed to seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers (Exclusion criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any past or present Axis I disorder. The exception is substance abuse which ended over&#xD;
             6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Intellectual disability or significant learning problems, as determined by IQ testing&#xD;
             lower than 70, inability to read or write, or history of being unable to take regular&#xD;
             classes while in school.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, as defined as laboratory values that&#xD;
             are out of normal range or require clinical workup and/or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. With the exception of isolated doses of benzodiazepine which may be administered once&#xD;
             or twice by the investigators of this study, psychotropic medication use (including&#xD;
             benzodiazepines and illicit drugs) during the 28 days (42 days if fluoxetine) prior to&#xD;
             the PET scan. Investigators of this study may administer lorazepam for anxiety (see&#xD;
             procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serious medical problems including but not limited to chronic neurological disease&#xD;
             such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases or cardiopulmonary disease that would&#xD;
             significantly increase risk with propofol sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive HIV status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Metallic foreign bodies that would be affected by the MRI magnet or fear of enclosed&#xD;
             spaces likely to make the subject unable to undergo an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Head trauma resulting in a period of unconsciousness lasting longer than 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Exposure to radiation in the past year (i.e., PET from other research), which when&#xD;
             combined with this study would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive urine drug screen at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Inability to lie flat on a camera bed for about 2.5 hours per PET scan and 1 hour for&#xD;
             MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Allergy to propofol or eggs, since egg products are used to formulate propofol&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnancy at time of scan (beta HCG will be measured in all female patients within 24&#xD;
             hours prior to start of scan and must be negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Snoring, as this condition increases the likelihood of complications from propofol&#xD;
             sedation.&#xD;
