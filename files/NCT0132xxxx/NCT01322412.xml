    <textblock>
      Physical exercise has been identified as a major item of many chronic diseases and cancer&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, physical activity for health is a valid and relevant way to improve quality of&#xD;
      life and to manage cancer patient fatigue. The aim of the study is the assessment of the&#xD;
      effects of a physical activity retraining program on aerobic capacity, strength and fatigue,&#xD;
      in a breast cancer population treated by adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Physical exercise has been identified as a major item of many chronic diseases and cancer&#xD;
      rehabilitation. It contributes to an improvement in the quality of life and to a decrease in&#xD;
      the current treatment side effects and mortality. Cancer in association with treatment&#xD;
      toxicity and an inactive lifestyle lead to a fall in physical capability and causes problems&#xD;
      in daily activities. The physical capacity and the tolerance for exercise fall simultaneously&#xD;
      leading to a deconditioning vicious circle which increases physical, psychological and&#xD;
      emotional symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, physical activity for health is a valid and&#xD;
      relevant way to improve quality of life and to manage cancer patient fatigue. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is the assessment of the effects of a physical activity retraining program on aerobic&#xD;
      capacity, strength and fatigue, in a breast cancer population treated by adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 44 subjects is required. The programme is organised as follows: Arm A (aerobic and&#xD;
      strength training) and during the 27 weeks of treatment (chemotherapy and radiotherapy); Arm&#xD;
      B (control group). This study includes 3 assessments phases (T0: before adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy; T1 (week 27) and T2: final evaluation at the 54th week). These assessments&#xD;
      include: cardiopulmonary exercise test including maximal oxygen uptake test (VO2max),&#xD;
      six-minute walk test, muscular testing, assessment of physical activity (IPAQ questionnaire),&#xD;
      fatigue (MFI20 questionnaire), quality of life (EORTC QLQ C30), anxiety and depression&#xD;
      symptoms (HADS) and nutritional evaluation: BMI and total body photonic absorption.&#xD;
