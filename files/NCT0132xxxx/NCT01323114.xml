    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with severe long-term health consequences. In&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are also morbidly obese, an abundance of clinical&#xD;
      evidence exists showing that significant clinical improvement in their diabetes occurs&#xD;
      following certain types of bariatric, or weight loss, surgical procedures. There is&#xD;
      additional data showing that bariatric surgical procedures that bypass the beginning of the&#xD;
      small intestine, such as the Roux-en Y gastric bypass, can markedly improve type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      even before significant weight loss has occurred. This early effect on type 2 diabetes prior&#xD;
      to weight loss suggests that bypassing the beginning of the small intestine in patients who&#xD;
      are not morbidly obese may also treat type 2 diabetes. There have been small studies outside&#xD;
      the United States that support the concept of treating type 2 diabetes with a surgical&#xD;
      procedure that bypasses the beginning of the small intestine without causing significant&#xD;
      weight loss; however, data is limited in the United States and a call for comparative studies&#xD;
      has been made internationally. The investigators propose to compare, in patients who are not&#xD;
      morbidly obese, conventional medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to surgical treatment of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes using a bypass procedure that does not cause significant weight loss, the&#xD;
      laparoscopic duodenal exclusion.&#xD;

      Diabetes is a disease of glucose metabolism which in the United States in 2007 was estimated&#xD;
      to effect at least 17.5 million people with type 2 diabetes mellitus accounting for&#xD;
      approximately 90% to 95%. Poorly-controlled or treated type 2 diabetes is associated with a&#xD;
      variety of health risks, including heart disease, stroke, renal failure, amputations,and&#xD;
      blindness and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (NDIC, National&#xD;
      Diabetes Statistics, 2011). A large number of medical treatments are available yet&#xD;
      approximately 67% of patients in the United States with type 2 diabetes are unable to reach&#xD;
      levels of hemoglobin A1C less than 6.5%, which is the target level set by the American&#xD;
      Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE, State of Diabetes in America, 2011). In&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are also morbidly obese, certain bariatric&#xD;
      surgical procedures have shown improvement in the control of type 2 diabetes in addition to&#xD;
      the expected weight loss effects. However, clinical investigations have pointed to a&#xD;
      mechanism other than just weight loss in the improvement of type 2 diabetes in these patients&#xD;
      and raised the possibility of utilizing the same mechanism in non-morbidly obese patients.&#xD;
      Subsequent basic science research in 2004 involving a surgical bypass procedure of the&#xD;
      proximal intestine in non-obese mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus showed remission of&#xD;
      diabetes in the majority of mice and marked improvement over medical treatment in the&#xD;
      remaining mice (13). Human clinical trials have been conducted in various locations worldwide&#xD;
      and have produced similar results to the animal study; a call has been made for studies of&#xD;
      new surgical procedures for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in IRB-approved clinical trials&#xD;
      (39). In several studies, the duodenal exclusion, which is a procedure which bypasses the&#xD;
      duodenum and proximal jejunum and leaves the stomach intact, has been shown to cause&#xD;
      remission or marked improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus without significant weight loss&#xD;
      in non-morbidly obese patients. However, no study within the United States has compared the&#xD;
      effect of this surgical procedure upon type 2 diabetes with the effect of conventional&#xD;
      medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in a controlled clinical trial. In this clinical study,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to directly compare the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in&#xD;
      non-morbidly obese humans by a surgical bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum to the&#xD;
      treatment of a similar group of humans treated with conventional medical therapy. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that a non-bariatric surgical procedure, the laparoscopic duodenal exclusion,&#xD;
      will provide improved treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in non-morbidly obese patients&#xD;
      when compared to conventional medical treatment. The measures of the treatment of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus in which a difference is expected to be observed are glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), fasting glucose, and insulin resistance. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      prospective, controlled, non-randomized clinical trial to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
