      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of Z-endoxifen hydrochloride in&#xD;
      treating patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (metastatic) or has come back at or near the same place as the&#xD;
      original tumor (locally recurrent). Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells.&#xD;
      Hormone therapy using Z-endoxifen hydrochloride may fight breast cancer by blocking the use&#xD;
      of estrogen by tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      l. To determine either the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Z-endoxifen hydrochloride or the&#xD;
      dose level associated with endoxifen steady state concentration (Css) of at least 2 uM in&#xD;
      women with metastatic estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. (Dose Escalation&#xD;
      Cohort) II. To describe the safety profile of Z-endoxifen (Z-endoxifen hydrochloride) at each&#xD;
      of the doses examined. (Dose Escalation Cohort) III. To evaluate changes in vision after 2&#xD;
      cycles of treatment. (Dose Escalation Cohort) IV. To gather preliminary data on the clinical&#xD;
      benefit in terms of tumor response rate and progression-free survival. (Dose Escalation&#xD;
      Cohort) V. To evaluate the changes in the frequency and severity of hot flashes after 2&#xD;
      cycles of treatment. (Expansion Cohort) VI. Evaluate changes in irritability scale using a&#xD;
      validated irritability questionnaire. (Expansion Cohort) VII. To evaluate changes in markers&#xD;
      of bone formation and absorption after 2 cycles of treatment. (Expansion Cohort) XIII. To&#xD;
      evaluate changes in vision after 2 cycles of treatment. (Expansion Cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To further characterize the safety profile of Z-endoxifen. (Expansion Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of Z-endoxifen at each&#xD;
      of the doses examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. For patients beginning in dose level 7 as well as the expansion cohorts, we will describe&#xD;
      any changes in tumor expression of ER (both full length and truncated forms), progesterone&#xD;
      receptor (PR), steroid receptor co-activator (SRC)1, SRC3, as well as the insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (IGF)1R/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral&#xD;
      Oncogene Homolog 1 (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and&#xD;
      proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki67) after 1 cycle of treatment (approximately 28&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the frequency of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations and the presence of&#xD;
      antitumor activity (response rate and progression free survival [PFS]) in all patients whose&#xD;
      tumors harbor ESR1 alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether the ESR1 mutations identified in pre-treatment tumor biopsies can be&#xD;
      detected in matched plasma cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the same patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by an expansion cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Z-endoxifen hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
