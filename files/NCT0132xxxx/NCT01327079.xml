  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed investigation will test the following hypotheses: 1) Enzymatic activity of&#xD;
      CYP2B6 characterized by the formation clearance of methadone to EDDP (CLf,EDDP), is directly&#xD;
      related to both gestational and postnatal age; 2) variations in the CYP2B6 gene (SNPs) are&#xD;
      associated with variable activity of the CYP2B6 enzyme (as measured by the formation&#xD;
      clearance, CLf,EDDP), and 3) the elimination rate of methadone and its major metabolite EDDP&#xD;
      in neonates is dependent on the glomerular filtration rate and therefore on the stage of&#xD;
      development (defined by both gestational and postnatal age). The investigators propose to&#xD;
      develop a PK model for methadone dosing in neonates that takes into account both&#xD;
      developmental stage and genetic variability. The long-term goal of the proposed&#xD;
      investigations is to improve dosing of methadone in neonates exposed to opioids in utero or&#xD;
      post-natally, leading to improved control of their withdrawal syndrome and decreased adverse&#xD;
      drug reactions associated with the current use of methadone in these vulnerable patients.&#xD;
      More immediately, the investigators will develop a PK model for methadone dosing based on&#xD;
      relevant developmental and genetic characteristics. The acquired knowledge based on the&#xD;
      proposed study will lead to a more efficacious treatment of pain or opiate withdrawal&#xD;
      syndrome in newborn infants with a decreased chance of adverse drug reactions.&#xD;

      The investigators will identify and recruit from the NICU of CNMC 60 preterm neonates&#xD;
      uniformly distributed with respect to gestational age and encompassing GA's of from 22 to&#xD;
      less than 43 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratified Selection by Gestational Age (GA): The study neonates will be selected to&#xD;
           achieve balance in the following GA strata: (22-24 wks, 25-26 wks, 27-28 wks, 29-30 wks,&#xD;
           31-32 wks, 33-37 wks; 38-43 wks). Stratification will be done to ensure broad&#xD;
           representation by GA. As described below, analyses will treat GA as a continuous&#xD;
           variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization will assign a newborn infant to group 1 (n=30) or group 2 (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study medications: Methadone and inulin administration Blood and urine will be collected&#xD;
           for the purposes of this research project. Blood will be drawn from the indwelling&#xD;
           arterial catheter that already is in place for clinical purposes. The amount of blood&#xD;
           obtained for all study related determinations will be minimized and kept at less than 3&#xD;
           mL/kg of blood per 48 hour period. The study will last 60 hours for group 1 and 72 hours&#xD;
           for group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA study 0.3ml whole blood will be collected from each subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK study Blood samples (0.2 mL per sample) will be taken in 30 newborn infants at t=0,&#xD;
           1, 4, 12, 36, 60 h (group 1) after the administration of one dose of methadone, and in&#xD;
           30 newborn infants at t=0, 2, 8, 24, 48, 72 hr (group 2) after the administration of&#xD;
           methadone. A total of 1.5 ml of blood will be collected from each subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine Collection Urine samples will be collected from each infant's diaper (wood pulp&#xD;
           based study diapers) every 3-4 hours over the first 24 hour period or alternatively,&#xD;
           from an indwelling urinary catheter placed based on clinical indications unrelated to&#xD;
           the study protocol.&#xD;
