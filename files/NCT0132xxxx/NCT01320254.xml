      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of panitumumab plus&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine (CisGem) combination chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer patients without systemic pre-treatment, compared to the historical data and to the&#xD;
      randomised control group without the antibody, which verifies the historically based&#xD;
      assumption.&#xD;

      The rationale of the study is the assessment of the clinical activity of Panitumumab in&#xD;
      conjunction with standard Cisplatin/Gemcitabine chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinomas and gall bladder carcinomas in 1st-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an epithelial cancer originating from the bile ducts with&#xD;
      features of cholangiocyte differentiation. CCA is the second most common primary hepatic&#xD;
      malignancy, and epidemiologic studies suggest its incidence is increasing in Western&#xD;
      countries. Hepatobiliary malignancies account for 13% of the 7.6 million annual&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths worldwide and CCA accounts for approximately 20% of the deaths from&#xD;
      hepatobiliary malignancies (Kubicka and Manns 2000; Kubicka 2004; Blechacz and Gores 2008;&#xD;
      Malek et al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only curative option for patients with gallbladder- or bile duct cancer is surgical&#xD;
      resection. Advanced CCA has a devastating prognosis. There are only limited numbers of&#xD;
      studies about the systemic treatment options for biliary cancers. Gallbladder and bile duct&#xD;
      carcinomas are moderately chemotherapy-sensitive tumors. The objective response rates in&#xD;
      phase II studies with 5-FU or gemcitabine monochemotherapy are between 10 - 30 % (Kubicka et&#xD;
      al. 2001b). Higher response rates between 20 - 50 % have been observed in phase II studies&#xD;
      with combination chemotherapy, in particular with the combination of gemcitabine/cisplatin&#xD;
      (Kubicka 2004; Malek et al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently for the first time an improvement of overall survival has been demonstrated in a&#xD;
      large randomized phase III trial with chemotherapy combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine&#xD;
      (n=206) compared to gemcitabine mono-chemotherapy (n=204) (Valle et al. 2009). Median overall&#xD;
      survival was 8,2 month in the monotherapy arm versus 11,7 month in the combination arm&#xD;
      (p=0.002). As a consequence of this study the combination of Cisplatin (25mg/m² d1,8) and&#xD;
      Gemcitabine (1000mg/m² d1,8) should be considered as the standard first line chemotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with irresectable cholangio- or gallbladder carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growing understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CCA opens new therapeutic options&#xD;
      for molecular targeting (Blechacz and Gores 2008). In particular EGFR signaling appears to be&#xD;
      important for tumor growth of CCA. Inhibition of EGFR signaling has been shown to&#xD;
      significantly suppress CCA cell growth (Blechacz and Gores 2008). In addition EGFR can&#xD;
      directly be activated by bile acids and promote CCA cell proliferation, a potential&#xD;
      explanation for the tropism exerted by CCA for the biliary tree. It has been shown that EGFR&#xD;
      activation is sustained in CCA by failure to internalize the ligand-receptor complex, a&#xD;
      homeostatic mechanism essential for receptor inactivation. EGFR phosphorylation results in&#xD;
      activation of the downstream kinases p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK, which in turn increase&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase 2 expression in CCA cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further evidence for the essential contribution of EGFR-signalling comes from studies with&#xD;
      IL-6 (Blechacz and Gores 2008). IL-6 is a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of CCA. IL-6 is&#xD;
      produced at high levels by CCA cells, and elevated IL-6 serum concentrations have been&#xD;
      reported in CCA patients. It has been shown that there is a cross-communication between IL-6&#xD;
      and EGFR resulting in IL-6 mediated overexpression of EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the first results of a randomized phase II study of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (GEMOX) alone or in combination with cetuximab in patients with advanced biliary cancer have&#xD;
      been reported (Malka et al. 2009). The primary objective of the study was a 4-month PFS rate&#xD;
      of more than 60% in the experimental arm with cetuximab. The included patients were not&#xD;
      monitored for RAS or B-RAF mutations. However compared to GEMOX chemotherapy (n=51),&#xD;
      GEMOX+cetuximab (n=50) showed an increased 4-month PFS-rate (50% versus 61%) and an improved&#xD;
      median PFS (5 versus 7 months). This is the first evidence from a randomized trial that&#xD;
      anti-EGFR therapy may be effective for patients with cholangiocarcinomas and gallbladder&#xD;
      carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KRAS is a downstream molecule in the EGFR-pathway. Recently it has been shown that oncogenic&#xD;
      RAS mutations are predictive for poor efficacy of an anti-EGFR-therapy in colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Conversely patients with colorectal cancers harbouring KRAS wild-type showed frequently&#xD;
      dramatic tumor responses upon anti-EGFR-treatment, indicating that colorectal cancers with&#xD;
      KRAS wild type are highly susceptible for an anti-EGFR-therapy. Although dysregulation of&#xD;
      KRAS is commonly observed in malignancies, mutations of KRAS have only been described in 12%&#xD;
      to 54% of intrahepatic CCA (Kubicka et al. 2001a; Blechacz and Gores 2008, Gruenberger et al&#xD;
      2009). This is in sharp contrast to pancreatic ductal carcinoma where KRAS mutations are&#xD;
      present in approximately 90% of cancers. Thus, despite shared developmental ontology between&#xD;
      the pancreatic ducts and the biliary tree, their adult cancers are different and may explain&#xD;
      the negative result of a phase III studies in pancreatic cancer with Cetuximab&#xD;
      (anti-EGFR-antibody).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very preliminary and sparse data from a recent small phase II study with cetuximab do not&#xD;
      allow to speculate whether the RAS status does predict the response in cholangiocarcinomas&#xD;
      similarly to colorectal cancers (Gruenberger et al. 2009). However, due to the clear evidence&#xD;
      of absence of efficacy in mutant KRAS colorectal cancer, the presumptive population&#xD;
      &quot;enrichment&quot; should be applied in this first trial on biliary duct cancer, which is to focus&#xD;
      on KRAS wild type patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since most of the patients with CCA are treated in large centers a chemotherapy protocol with&#xD;
      limited numbers of intravenous infusions appears to be very comfortable for patients with&#xD;
      CCA. A further argument for the investigation of Cisplatin/Gemcitabine/Panitumumab in a&#xD;
      randomized phase II study is the fact that the 3-week interval of the Cis/Gem protocol fits&#xD;
      very well into the 3-week interval of the Panitumumab schedule.&#xD;
