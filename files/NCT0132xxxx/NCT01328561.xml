      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Oxytocin, a substance produced mostly in the brain, plays a role in influencing social&#xD;
      interactions and reactions to stress, and may be related to pain. Arginine vasopressin, a&#xD;
      hormone that regulates water, sugar, and salt in the blood, influences hostile behaviors and&#xD;
      reactions to stress, and may also be related to pain. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      investigating both substances and their relationship to pain in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effects of oxytocin and arginine vasopressin on pain in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves two 2-hour testing sessions held 1 day apart. Each session includes&#xD;
           the administration of oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, or placebo (a nonactive&#xD;
           substance), or no drug. The drugs and the placebo will be given by a nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will provide blood and saliva samples to measure&#xD;
           hormone levels, and will be asked to fill out questionnaires about some psychological&#xD;
           factors such as anxiety and empathy. Participants will then have an assessment of their&#xD;
           sensitivity to pain, consisting of a brief electrical stimulation that lasts less than 1&#xD;
           second. After the pain assessment, participants will receive oxytocin, arginine&#xD;
           vasopressin, placebo, or no drug at all, and will be monitored to provide baseline&#xD;
           information. Participants will then have another pain sensitivity test and will complete&#xD;
           the questionnaires again, and provide another saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit, participants will provide another saliva sample; receive oxytocin,&#xD;
           arginine vasopressin, placebo, or no drug at all; and have tests of pain sensitivity and&#xD;
           a pain-relieving procedure. During the pain-relieving procedure, participants will&#xD;
           receive brief, moderately painful electrical shocks on the back of the nondominant hand&#xD;
           and a low-level electrical stimulation on the middle finger that counteracts or reduces&#xD;
           the pain from the shocks. Participants will rate their pain perception at the end of&#xD;
           each stimulation by using a visual scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum&#xD;
           imaginable pain). The experiment ends with a final saliva collection and completion of&#xD;
           the psychological questionnaires.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that social and contextual cues and the whole atmosphere around the patient,&#xD;
      such as words, attitudes, and providers behaviors, all contribute to evoke placebo responses.&#xD;
      Moreover, an extensive literature investigating prosocial behaviors (e.g. ability to share&#xD;
      another s feelings, imitation, mimicry) suggests that social modeling is critical in&#xD;
      developing learning processes across species, including social influences on psychophysical&#xD;
      aspects of pain. Only recently, it has been demonstrated that observing the beneficial&#xD;
      effects in a demonstrator induces substantial placebo analgesic responses which are&#xD;
      positively correlated with empathy. A crucial role in social behaviors is played by oxytocin&#xD;
      (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), two neuropeptides, produced mostly in the hypothalamus&#xD;
      and acting on certain brain regions whose function is associated with emotion perception&#xD;
      (amygdale and nucleus accumbens), eye-gaze, trust and processing of positive and negative&#xD;
      social cues. Since beliefs, trust and contextual cues are important elements of the&#xD;
      clinicianpatient relationship and socially-induced placebo effects, it is reasonable to&#xD;
      hypothesize that OXT and AVP may be one of the endogenous substances that trigger contextual&#xD;
      and interpersonal placebo responses. By viewing interpersonal healing as a central causal&#xD;
      process (or a set of related causal processes) within the domain of pain modulation, it is&#xD;
      possible to probe the potential role for OXT and AVP in the modulation of a placebo response.&#xD;
      In pursuit of this goal, we use a neuropharmacological intervention with OXT and AVP agonists&#xD;
      in combination with a behavioral, brain imaging and genetic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men and women participants aging from 18 to 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate the role of oxytocinergic system in the processing of social cues by&#xD;
      using a model of pain and interpersonal placebo analgesia already tested (9). The following&#xD;
      drugs will be used: 1) oxytocin, 2) arginine vasopressin, and 3) placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are subjective pain reports (Experiment 1) and brain- and cortical -related&#xD;
      responses (Experiments 2 and 3). Secondary measures include skin conductance response, heart&#xD;
      rate, cortisol, subjective measures of empathy; trait and state anxiety measures; and&#xD;
      functional pain-related genetic polymorphisms.&#xD;
