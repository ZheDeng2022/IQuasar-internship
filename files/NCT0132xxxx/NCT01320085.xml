    <description>Objective response as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.0, was defined as participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), were recorded from date of randomization or date of start of treatment until date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and sustained for at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>PFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.0, was defined as time (in months) from date of randomization or date of start of treatment to first documentation of PD or date of death due to any cause or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. PD was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of all measured target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (this included baseline sum if that was smallest on study), sum also demonstrated absolute increase of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 5 mm, or appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. If a participant did not had an event, data censoring was done at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization or date of start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <time_frame>From first documentation of CR or PR until first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause or data censoring date, whichever occurred first (maximum duration of up to 33 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR:time from first documentation of OR(confirmed CR or PR) to first documentation of PD/death due to any cause/data censoring date,whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.0, CR:disappearance of all target(T) and non-target(Non-T) lesions sustained for =&gt;4 weeks. Any pathological lymph nodes(T or non-T) reduced in short axis to &lt;10mm. PR:&gt;=30% decrease in sum of diameters(SOD) of T lesions, taking as reference baseline SOD. PD for T lesions:at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of T lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study treatment, with absolute increase of &gt;=5 mm, or appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions.PD for Non-T lesions:unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions/increase in overall tumor burden leading to discontinuation of therapy/appearance of new unequivocal malignant lesion.Data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment for participants without an event,who started new anti-cancer treatment prior to assessment,who missed &gt;=2 tumor assessments.</description>

    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization or date of start of treatment to the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) or data censoring date, whichever occurred first (maximum duration of up to 33 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTR as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.0, was defined as the time (in months) from date of randomization or date of start of treatment until first documented response (CR or PR) or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) reduced in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Participants who did not achieve a confirmed PR or CR, were censored at last adequate tumor assessment date when they did not progress (including deaths not due to underlying disease) or at maximum follow-up (from study start to study end date) when participant had an event for progression-free survival.</description>

PD was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of all measured target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (this included baseline sum if that was smallest on study), sum also demonstrated absolute increase of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 5 mm, or appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. If a participant did not had an event, data censoring was done at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Time to Response (TTR)</title>
        <description>TTR as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.0, was defined as the time (in months) from date of randomization or date of start of treatment until first documented response (CR or PR) or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) reduced in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Participants who did not achieve a confirmed PR or CR, were censored at last adequate tumor assessment date when they did not progress (including deaths not due to underlying disease) or at maximum follow-up (from study start to study end date) when participant had an event for progression-free survival.</description>

As per NCI-CTCAE v4.0, Grade 1: asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2: moderate, minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (ADL); Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4:life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5:death related to study drug. Treatment-emergent ADRs are between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose of study drug, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.

        <description>Fundoscopy examination included an examination of the retina, vitreous, macula, optic nerve, optic nerve pallor, choroid and other new abnormalities in either or both eyes. New abnormalities were identified where the baseline assessment showed no abnormalities in a particular eye, but at the post-dose time point an abnormality was observed. New abnormalities at any time point were reported and included unscheduled assessments.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (for a maximum duration of up to 33 months)</time_frame>
        <population>Safety analysis set included all participants who had received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one valid post-baseline safety assessment. Here 'number analyzed' signifies participants with available data for each specified category.</population>
