    <textblock>
      The incidence of bladder cancer is increasing. Denmark have approximately 1800 incidence per&#xD;
      year. The disease is most frequently in males above the age of 70 years. In invasive&#xD;
      bladdercancer surgery including removal of the seak bladder with constructing of a new&#xD;
      diversion, is the first line treatment. However the procedure is followed by a high morbidity&#xD;
      and convalescence. Extended surgical procedure cause pain, stress-induced metabolism and&#xD;
      impaired organ function resulting in postoperative complications impacting on rehabilitation.&#xD;
      The combination of extended surgery and the increasing numbers of elderly comorbid patients&#xD;
      with invasive bladder cancer challenge professional treatment and care&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of a multiprofessional rehabilitation&#xD;
      programme for patients with invasive bladder cancer referred to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods The study is a randomised controlled trial. All patients &gt; 18 years&#xD;
      referred to radical cystectomy will be eligible for this study. The efficacy is primary&#xD;
      expressed by the difference in length of stay(LOS). Secondly by complications, health related&#xD;
      quality of life(HRQoL) and patient reported quality of care during hospitalization. The&#xD;
      intervention includes precise instructions and educations in intensive pre- and&#xD;
      postoperatively exercises and stoma-care, supported by the multiprofessional team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective It is a national goal to improve cancer care. This study is of critical&#xD;
      importance and places great emphasis on the patients perspective and involvement in a&#xD;
      successful outcome for participant's and involvement in nutritional support, intensive&#xD;
      exercises and stoma care, supported by the multidisciplinary team&#xD;

&#xD;
      Background In Denmark, the incidence of patients with bladder cancer is approximately 1800&#xD;
      cases annually; 75% of the cases are men. The disease is most frequent among the 50 to&#xD;
      80-year-olds and most cases are approximately 70 years old [1]. Recent studies have shown&#xD;
      that the incidence of bladder cancer is increasing in Europe[2]. Cystectomy is one of the&#xD;
      most comprehensive surgical procedures in urology[3,4]. In Denmark, the average&#xD;
      post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 19 days in 2005; the hospital mortality rate was 3.7%&#xD;
      and 58% had a complicated course of disease. The mortality was comparable to experiences&#xD;
      abroad [3,5]. LOS is, however, long compared with high-volume hospitals with well-defined&#xD;
      clinical patient pathways [1,5,6]. Major surgery causes pain and stress-induced catabolism&#xD;
      leading to an unwanted metabolic and inflammatory response, impaired organ function and risk&#xD;
      of thrombosis. These conditions increase the risk of losing muscle mass and reduce the&#xD;
      activity level [2]. Overall, the above-mentioned circumstances delay the rehabilitation&#xD;
      process. The concept &quot;fast-track surgery&quot; is a multi-modal and inter-professional approach to&#xD;
      reduce post-surgical morbidity and optimise post-surgical rehabilitation [7,8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-modal approach comprises both pre-operative optimisation of organ function, patient&#xD;
      education, effective pain management, early post-operative mobilisation and early oral&#xD;
      nutrition [9]. The concept has proven effective, though primarily documented in connection&#xD;
      with colorectal surgery [9-11,12,13,], with increased survival, reduced LOS and reduced costs&#xD;
      compared with conventional patient pathways[14,15]. The combination of a major surgical&#xD;
      intervention and an increasing number of elderly comorbid patients with bladder cancer poses&#xD;
      a challenge to treatment and care in all phases of the patient pathway. The above studies&#xD;
      primarily focus on the pre- and post-operative effort. Evidence is sparse concerning the&#xD;
      importance of an optimised pre-operative effort in rehabilitation [11]. It is hypothesised&#xD;
      that an optimised patient pathway calls for an inter-professional pre-operative clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and a pre-optimisation of the patient's general condition including nutrition and&#xD;
      physical activity[11,16-18]. There is low evidence of the efficacy of multi-modal&#xD;
      pre-optimisation efforts in major surgical procedures in urology [2,19]. Especially&#xD;
      concerning the importance of a multi-facilitated pre-operative intervention for&#xD;
      rehabilitation and health-related quality of life [7,8]. Generally, there has been a&#xD;
      post-operative effect concerning early nutritional intervention and LOS [20]. Early&#xD;
      nutritional intervention increases the number of patients fulfilling the threshold for&#xD;
      sufficient nutritional status [15,21]. Nutrition strategies are increasingly combined with&#xD;
      physical training consisting of exercise to increase muscle strength and endurance, to&#xD;
      increase hypertrophy of muscle cells by increasing muscle protein synthesis and reducing&#xD;
      disintegration [22]. Thus, a pre-operative multi-modal intervention involving nutritional&#xD;
      optimisation and physical training should be a part of future studies. A muli-modal patient&#xD;
      pathway will involve expectations of an increased risk that the economic burden will shift to&#xD;
      the primary sector [23], an increased frequency of readmissions, complications and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life. This thesis investigates the efficacy of pre- and post-operative multi-modal&#xD;
      interventions in the rehabilitation of patients with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material: All patients undergoing cystectomy at Aarhus University Hospital in 2009 fulfilling&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A. To investigate the efficacy of pre- and post-operative multi-modal intervention in&#xD;
      bladder cancer patients referred to radical cystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses are tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An inter-professional multi-modal pre- and post-operative intervention promotes&#xD;
           rehabilitation and reduces length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group obtains a higher functional and activity level compared with the&#xD;
           control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group obtains a better management of urinary diversion compared with&#xD;
           the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: LOS is defined as number of post-operative days (until 7 defined discharge&#xD;
      criteria are fulfilled). The outcome data will be presented approximately 12 months after&#xD;
      inclusion have been closed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complications ( measured at discharge and 120 days postoperatively in average)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity and functional level( will be measured every day during admission and 120 days&#xD;
           after discharge).Pfysical parametres like bioimpedance, musclepower and handgrip&#xD;
           strength will be measured at baseline( two weeks before operation, one day before&#xD;
           operation, at discharge and 120 days after operation in both arms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-experienced quality during admission ( measured with EORTC-questionaire at&#xD;
           discharge in both arms)Informations will be presented approximately 12 months after&#xD;
           inclusion is closed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life will be measured at baseline and 120 days after operation&#xD;
           ( EORTC questionaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of urinary diversion will be measured at baseline, before operation,35 days&#xD;
           and 120 days after operation.A validated stoma score scale for patient stoma skills will&#xD;
           be used.The outcome data will be presented approximately 12 months after inclusion have&#xD;
           been closed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. The study population is calculated on the basis on LOS for patients undergoing&#xD;
      cystectomy at the Department of Urology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby in 2008. Average&#xD;
      LOS was 13 days with a standard deviation of 4.75 days. Risk of type 1 error was 5% at a&#xD;
      2-sided analysis and strength at 80%. Lowest relevant difference in effect is a 20% reduction&#xD;
      in LOS in the intervention group. When a 2-sided comparison is made, 92 patients have to be&#xD;
      included; 46 in the intervention and control group, respectively.Written information about&#xD;
      the study is forwarded to the patients along with the appointment for a uro-oncological&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Performed 14-17 days prior to surgery. When deciding on surgery the patient&#xD;
      receives oral information about the examination. After time for deliberation and giving&#xD;
      informed consent, the patients are randomised at the outpatient consultation following the&#xD;
      uro-oncological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical background variables are registered at baseline. Follow-up after 4&#xD;
      months. Data are collected for further analysis at 1-year follow-up (appendix 1.1-1.5). All&#xD;
      patients undergo nutritional screening at baseline by NRS [32,33].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with age-adjusted score&lt;3 will receive supplements according to standard&#xD;
      criteria[25-28]. Energy demand is calculated as weight x100x1.3 KJ /day. Protein need is&#xD;
      calculated as weight x 1.5 gram protein/day. Fluid need is calculated as weight x 30 ml/day&#xD;
      [30]. Comorbidity is scored using the Charlson index score, pain and nausea using the&#xD;
      VAS-score [32,33].Habitual intestinal function is scored using the Bristol scale[34].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity level is estimated at baseline using the Physical Activity Scale (PAS)&#xD;
      [35]. Daily mobilisation time and walking distance are registered pre-operatively and during&#xD;
      admission using a pedometer [36,37].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability to perform personal activities of daily living are evaluated daily during admission&#xD;
      using the KATZ score [38].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle power, muscle strength and body composition are registered at baseline,&#xD;
      pre-operatively, at discharge and 35, 120 (and 365) days post-operatively. Muscle power&#xD;
      (force x velocity) is evaluated by leg extensor power Rig [39]; Isometric muscle strength&#xD;
      (hand grip strength) is evaluated by &quot;Good Muscle Strength&quot; [40]and body composition is&#xD;
      evaluated by bioimpedance [41] Progression in management of urinary diversion is evaluated by&#xD;
      a categorial scale (appendix 1.4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eat normally until the operation. The rectal ampulla is emptied the evening before&#xD;
      surgery. From midnight the patients fast and drink two glasses of sweet juice at 06.00 am&#xD;
      before the operation. TED stockings are used to prevent thrombosis per- and post-operatively&#xD;
      until the mobilisation criteria have been met. 5000 IU of Fragmin are injected subcutaneously&#xD;
      from day 0. Individual prescriptions are made for patients with sclerotic diseases.&#xD;
      Per-operative infection prophylaxis is standardised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sevofluorane is used as a sedative and Bupivacain as well as Ultiva infusions as pain&#xD;
      management. Epidural catheter is used for pain treatment at th-12-L1 level. The transfusion&#xD;
      regime is standardised. Pain treatment: Post-operatively - epidurally administered Bupivacain&#xD;
      2.5 mg /ml 5-6 ml / h in 3 full days. Peripheral pain treatment is tablet paracetamol 1g x 4&#xD;
      and from day 2, two tablets Ibuprofen 400 mg x 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care of urinary diversion; When surgery is decided there is an interprofessional meeting&#xD;
           concerning management of stoma and neobladder. Stoma markings are made the day before&#xD;
           surgery in collaboration with the surgeon, the patient and the stoma care nurse.&#xD;
           Relevant aids are demonstrated and the post-operative regime is presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapy: Instruction and information about pulmonary physiotherapy is performed&#xD;
           pre-operatively. Daily mobilisation in each shift post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge criteria (see appendix 1.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following initiatives are made in the intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative optimisation: The intervention group is taught pre-operatively about the&#xD;
           management of urinary diversion. Exercise kit is handed out with exercises to perform in&#xD;
           the home. Intensive instruction and teaching is provided by physiotherapist. Moreover,&#xD;
           plans for post-operative progressive mobilisation and transfer techniques. Balancing&#xD;
           mutual expectations for the entire intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative optimisation: Intensive, structured and progressive plans for daily&#xD;
           mobilisation and physical activity from the day of surgery until planned discharge at&#xD;
           7-9 post-operative day as well as instruction in urinary diversion by the stoma care&#xD;
           nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect: Expressed as the difference in: LOS, complications, functional and activity level and&#xD;
      management of urinary diversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Normally distributed data are described as mean, standard deviation (SD) and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (CI) and tested with Student's t-test for paired data, unpaired data are&#xD;
      tested by unpaired t-test and repeated measurements. Non-normally distributed data are&#xD;
      described as median and range and tested by the Mann-Whitnew U-test or Wilcoxon's sign rank&#xD;
      test. When testing 3 or more variables the Friedman test is applied. Pearson's test is&#xD;
      applied in correlation analyses if conditions are met or Spearman's Rho. Frequencies are&#xD;
      compared by Fischer's exact test. Associations between variables are reported as odds ratios&#xD;
      and 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: Health-related quality of life and experienced patient quality in multi-modal&#xD;
      interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: to study the effect of multi-modal interventions concerning the patient experience&#xD;
      during hospital admission and health-related quality of life (HeQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will have better experienced quality and higher HeQoL. End points:&#xD;
      Score concerning HeQoL and patient experienced quality. Material /Method: Same method and&#xD;
      study population as in study 2. Disease-specific questionnaires from the European&#xD;
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, EORTC QLQ-BLM30 and QLQ-C30 [42] were&#xD;
      applied. Scores are made at baseline and follow-up at planned control visits (35 days, 120&#xD;
      days and 365 days). At discharge EORTC In-PATSAT32 is used to evaluate the patient experience&#xD;
      of quality during admission. All questionnaires are validated and translated into Danish&#xD;
      [43,44].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics study B. Data are registered at a categorial scale and described as mentioned in&#xD;
      study A for non-normally distributed data. Wilcoxon's sign rank test is used to test the&#xD;
      difference in HeQoL between the groups.When testing 3 or more groups, Friedman's test is&#xD;
      applied. Spearman's Rho is used for correlation analyses of non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
      Associations between variables are reported as ORs and 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The study is approved by the Central Denmark Committee on Biomedical&#xD;
      and Research Ethics and the Danish Data Agency. Transport costs in connection with control&#xD;
      visits are refunded and it is attempted that examinations take place at days where the&#xD;
      patient has to meet for a control visit at the hospital. At present, the treatment offer to&#xD;
      this patient group does not include pre- and post-operative optimisation and it is not deemed&#xD;
      unethical to randomise patients to pre- or post-operative optimisation or standard treatment,&#xD;
      respectively. The study is registered in the American clinical database&#xD;
      www.clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan including time schedule: Daily project management, data processing and&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be made and interpreted by PhD student Bente Thoft Jensen(BTJ), who&#xD;
      is also responsible for publication of results. Data collection will be made in collaboration&#xD;
      with the stoma care and nutrition responsible nurses and a dietician. Instruction in home&#xD;
      exercises, test of functional and activity level is made in collaboration with the&#xD;
      physiotherapists in the bladder team. The project is expected to start in the spring 2011.&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients will run for 1.5 years according to the current surgical activity. Data&#xD;
      collection and analyses are made in 2011 and 2012. Summary and reporting of results will be&#xD;
      made in 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication: The project results are communicated in 3 peer-reviewed articles and in a PhD&#xD;
      thesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding:The project will be partly financed by the Department of Urology, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital, Skejby (1/3), by the hospital management teat, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby&#xD;
      (1/3) and the rest will be university scholar ships, industrial collaborators and&#xD;
      foundations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective: Cystectomy is one of the most resource-consuming surgical procedures. Despite&#xD;
      comprehensive shifts in paradigms in both nursing and treatment strategies throughout the&#xD;
      last decade, the average LOS has only been modestly reduced. In addition to the newly&#xD;
      introduced packages for diagnostics and treatment of cancer patients it is essential to&#xD;
      strengthen the overall effort. This PhD project should be seen as a part of the endavour to&#xD;
      fulfil all parts of the overall purpose concerning evidence-based optimisation of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of bladder cancer patients. Whether urological patient pathways with a&#xD;
      pre-operative intervention can minimise post-operative complications, lead to a higher HeQoL&#xD;
      and shorten the rehabilitation period will be highlighted.&#xD;
