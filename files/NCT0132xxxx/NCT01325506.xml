  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. Surgical removal of the entire&#xD;
      prostate (prostatectomy) is one option among the various ways to treat prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      use of robot assistance for prostatectomy has become common place, but its effectiveness has&#xD;
      not been compared to standard open prostatectomy in trials carried out at more than one&#xD;
      medical institution in which participants are identified and followed forward in time. Robot&#xD;
      assisted and standard open prostatectomy health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes have&#xD;
      not been compared in a prospective, multi-centered study. Prostatectomy can have side effects&#xD;
      that can change with time. This research study seeks to determine how common and how&#xD;
      long-lasting such side effects are; to find out what features of individual men's cancers and&#xD;
      what features of the treatments affect those side effects. This study also seeks to identify&#xD;
      factors that affect the quality of prostate cancer care by looking at how satisfied men are&#xD;
      with their prostate cancer care. Through these findings, this study aims to allow treatment&#xD;
      side effects to be anticipated more accurately for individual patients, and to provide a&#xD;
      means for determining the quality of prostate care.&#xD;

      The investigators will follow your prostate cancer treatment outcomes and health related&#xD;
      quality of life following prostatectomy by asking you direct questions, collect information&#xD;
      from medical records and phone interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about your prostate cancer treatment, and related health concerns, and&#xD;
      information regarding the cost of care, may also be collected from your medical record, other&#xD;
      medical center sources, and your primary care provider (PCP). Clinical information will be&#xD;
      collected: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 6 month, 12 months, 18 months, and&#xD;
      24 months after your prostatectomy; once a year thereafter for possibly up to 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to take part in six telephone interviews regarding quality of life,&#xD;
      possible therapy side effects, and satisfaction with prostate cancer therapy. Each phone&#xD;
      interview should last 15-25 minutes. All questions are voluntary. The phone interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18&#xD;
      months, and 24 months after prostatectomy; 10 additional phone interviews may be conducted&#xD;
      (once a year thereafter, for possibly up to 12 years).&#xD;
