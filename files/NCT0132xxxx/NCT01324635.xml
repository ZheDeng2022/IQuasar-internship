      This is an open label phase I clinical trial with two arms, representing single and&#xD;
      fractionated radiation therapy (Figure 4.1). Within each arm the radiation dose is&#xD;
      pre-determined and not escalated. Panobinostat will be administered orally 3 times a week for&#xD;
      2 weeks. Panobinostat will be dose-escalated independently in each arm. There is no&#xD;
      intra-patient dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent gliomas (Arm A) will be treated according to the Jefferson protocol for&#xD;
      re-irradiation, 10 fractions each of 3.5Gy delivered over 2 weeks. Panobinostat will be&#xD;
      administered orally three times a week for 2 weeks, starting on day 1 or 2 of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. High-grade meningiomas (Arm A) will be treated with 6 weeks/30 fractions of&#xD;
      fractionated radiation therapy, to a total dose of between 54 Gy and 60 Gy in fractions of&#xD;
      either 1.8Gy or 2Gy. Panobinostat will be administered orally three times a week for 2 weeks,&#xD;
      starting on the day of 1st fraction of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large brain metastases (Arm B) will be treated with a single fraction of radiosurgery.&#xD;
      Panobinostat will be administered orally three times a week for 2 weeks, starting on the day&#xD;
      of radiation. The radiosurgery may be delivered by either LINAC, gamma-knife, cyber-knife or&#xD;
      tomotherapy technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors, both primary and metastatic present a therapeutic challenge. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      plays a major role in management of both entities. Nonetheless, local control remains&#xD;
      sub-optimal in a large proportion of patients. Over the previous decade there has been a&#xD;
      great deal of progress regarding 1) precision in the localization and targeting of brain&#xD;
      lesions with radiation, 2) increased use of single/hypofractionation schedules and 3)&#xD;
      combining fractionated conformal radiation with targeted agents. This trial utilizes a novel&#xD;
      approach - the combination of an HDAC inhibitor (Panobinostat) with stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery. The combination blends the advantages of extreme high precision radiation with&#xD;
      a potent targeted agent - promising enhanced efficacy with minimal toxicity. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine the combination in three settings, in all of which current&#xD;
      standard of care is sub-optimal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recurrent glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High grade meningioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Large brain metastases from solid malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, including Panobinostat, radiosensitize tumor cells&#xD;
      both in vitro and in vivo. HDAC inhibitors modify the expression of approximately 8% of the&#xD;
      transcriptome83. In particular, they have been shown to down regulate expression of the DNA&#xD;
      repair enzyme rad51, possibly explaining their radiosensitization properties. It is thought&#xD;
      that Panobinostat radiosensitizes through an epigenetic mechanism. Since the target of HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitors includes many proteins beyond histones, many prefer the name &quot;deacetylase&#xD;
      inhibitors&quot;, (DAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several lines of evidence suggesting HDAC inhibitors cross the BBB. The&#xD;
      anticonvulsant valproic acid, a member of the short chain fatty acid class of HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitors, has a well-recognized capacity to cross the BBB. HDAC inhibitors are also being&#xD;
      studied in Huntington's disease. Panobinostat is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier and&#xD;
      influence gene expression in rodents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When combining radiation therapy with systemic agents it is generally considered important&#xD;
      that there is a high concentration of drug present at, or just before, the time of&#xD;
      irradiation. The goal is to use panobinostat as a radiosensitizer, not a single systemic&#xD;
      agent. The investigators will administer oral panobinostat 3 times weekly for 2 weeks. This&#xD;
      is an open label phase I clinical trial with two arms, representing single and fractionated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (Figure 4.1). Within each arm the radiation dose is pre-determined and not&#xD;
      escalated. Panobinostat will be administered orally 3 times a week for 2 weeks. Panobinostat&#xD;
      will be dose-escalated independently in each arm. There is no intra-patient dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent gliomas (Arm A) will be treated according to the Jefferson protocol for&#xD;
      re-irradiation, 10 fractions each of 3.5Gy delivered over 2 weeks. Panobinostat will be&#xD;
      administered orally three times a week for 2 weeks, starting on the day of 1st fraction of&#xD;
      radiation. High-grade meningiomas (Arm A) will be treated with 6 weeks/30 fractions of&#xD;
      fractionated radiation therapy, to a total dose of between 54 Gy and 60 Gy in fractions of&#xD;
      either 1.8Gy or 2Gy. Panobinostat will be administered orally three times a week for 2 weeks,&#xD;
      starting on the day of 1st fraction of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large brain metastases (Arm B) will be treated with a single fraction of radiosurgery.&#xD;
      Panobinostat will be administered orally three times a week for 2 weeks, starting on the day&#xD;
      of radiation. The radiosurgery may be delivered by either LINAC, gamma-knife, cyber-knife or&#xD;
      tomotherapy technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation treatment: definition of target volumes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent gliomas (Arm A) If progression is diagnosed with the development of new enhancing&#xD;
      tumor: The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be defined by the new contrast-enhanced T1&#xD;
      abnormality on the post-operative MRI scan. This will generally include the surgical cavity&#xD;
      margins from the most recent surgical procedure. If progression is diagnosed with the&#xD;
      development of new non-enhancing tumor: volumes will be defined through careful comparison of&#xD;
      new and previous MRI scans in consultation with a neuro-radiologist. This will generally&#xD;
      include the surgical cavity margins from the most recent surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GTV will then be expanded by an additional margin of 5.0 mm to create the PTV. This 5mm&#xD;
      margin may be reduced, or eliminated around natural barriers to tumor growth such as the&#xD;
      skull, ventricles, falx, etc, and also to allow sparing of the optic nerve/chiasm or other&#xD;
      critical structure at the discretion of the treating physician. The minimum dose to the PTV&#xD;
      will be 95% of the prescription dose (35Gy). The maximum dose to the PTV will be 110%. Any&#xD;
      beam arrangement and set of energies that accomplishes these criteria is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-grade meningiomas (Arm A) Target volumes will be based upon postoperative-enhanced MRI&#xD;
      (unless only biopsy was performed). Preoperative imaging may be used for correlation and&#xD;
      improved identification. The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be defined by the tumor bed on the&#xD;
      postoperative- enhanced MRI and is to include any residual nodular enhancement. Cerebral&#xD;
      edema is not to be specifically included within the GTV. The &quot;dural tail&quot; may or may-not be&#xD;
      included depending on physician preference. The clinical target volume (CTV) will be the GTV&#xD;
      plus a margin of between 1.0 cm and 2.0cm according to physician preference. The CTV margin&#xD;
      may be reduced to 0.5 cm around natural barriers to tumor growth such as the skull. The&#xD;
      planning target volume (PTV) is an additional margin of 3.0 to 5.0 mm, depending upon&#xD;
      localization method and reproducibility. PTV margins account for variations in set-up and&#xD;
      reproducibility. The CTV/PTV margins way be modified to allow sparing of the optic&#xD;
      nerve/chiasm or other critical structure at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum dose to the PTV will be 95% of the prescription dose (35Gy). The maximum dose to&#xD;
      the PTV will be 110%. Any beam arrangement and set of energies that accomplishes these&#xD;
      criteria is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large brain metastases (Arm B) Single fraction radiosurgery doses will be in accordance with&#xD;
      prescriptions from RTOG radiosurgery trial 90-058. Metastases larger than 2 cm but equal to&#xD;
      or smaller than 3 cm will be treated with 18•0 Gy; and metastases larger than 3 cm and less&#xD;
      than or equal to 4 cm will be treated to a prescription dose of 15.0 Gy. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      should be planed in accordance with standard radio-surgical principals, i.e. prescribed to&#xD;
      the 50% isodose line for gamma-knife and 90% isosurface for LINAC based systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Technical aspects of radiation therapy Fractionated treatment will be highly conformal&#xD;
      external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) delivered with either gamma-knife, tomotherapy,&#xD;
      cyberknife or megavoltage LINAC radiation therapy machines of energy ≥ 6 MV. Any standard&#xD;
      technique of dose planning including conformal dynamic arcs, 3D-CRT or IMRT may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For single fraction treatments cyber-knife, LINAC, tomotherapy or gamma-knife based&#xD;
      radiosurgery may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal tissue constraints Arm A, Recurrent glioma The brain stem: no more than 1cm3 should&#xD;
      receive more than 30Gy; optic chiasm and optic nerves should not receive more than 25Gy,&#xD;
      unless included in the target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A, High-grade meningioma Lenses 7Gy, Retinae 50Gy, Optic Nerves 55Gy, Optic Chiasm 56Gy,&#xD;
      Brainstem 60Gy Arm B, Single fraction Brain stem no more than 1cm3 should receive more than&#xD;
      10Gy; optic chiasm and optic nerves no more than 8 Gy;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that an organ at risk (OAR) is in immediate proximity to a PTV such that dose to&#xD;
      the OAR cannot be constrained within protocol limits, the final decision is left to the&#xD;
      treating physician to weigh up potential treatment toxicity versus under-coverage of target&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat for oral administration will be provided by Novartis. Medication labels will&#xD;
      comply with US legal requirements and be printed in English. They will supply no information&#xD;
      about the patient. The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication&#xD;
      label, and the investigator's brochure, edition #5 19-Jun-2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat should be administrated after at least 2-hour fast, and subjects will continue&#xD;
      the fast for 2 more hours. If the patient misses one or more doses of panobinostat and it is&#xD;
      before the next dose of panobinostat is due, the patient should take the make up dose at the&#xD;
      earliest time, then resume the protocol schedule. If patient misses one or more doses of&#xD;
      panobinostat, and the patient is due for the next dose of panobinostat, the patient should&#xD;
      resume the protocol schedule without making up for the missing dose/doses. If the patient&#xD;
      misses one or more panobinostat doses and it is past the scheduled last dosing time of the&#xD;
      panobinostat, the patient should stop panobinostat without making up for the missing&#xD;
      dose/doses.&#xD;

                  All patients are required to have initially undergone fractionated radiation&#xD;
                  therapy, to between 55 Gy to 70 Gy in fractions of 1.8-2 Gy as part of 'first&#xD;
                  line therapy'. The diagnosis of 'recurrence' is to be made by the treating&#xD;

                  defined by WHO grade 2 or 3 (also known as atypical and anaplastic/malignant&#xD;
                  meningioma). WHO grade 1 meningiomas with an elevated Ki67 proliferation rate of&#xD;
                  &gt; or = 8% are also considered high-grade for the purposes of this trial, due to&#xD;

                  biopsy only resection) or recurrent disease (re-growth following surgery alone).&#xD;
                  Measurable disease is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Arm B Large brain metastases: Pathological diagnosis of malignancy is required,&#xD;

                  MRI scan) of one of more brain metastases is required. At least one of the brain&#xD;
                  metastases to be treated as part of this study must be 2.5cm or larger in maximal&#xD;
                  diameter. The brain metastasis/es to be treated may not be more than 4cm in&#xD;
                  maximal diameter, as assessed by CT or MRI scan. The brain metastasis may either&#xD;
                  be un-resected or partially resected, provided that the target lesion (which may&#xD;
                  include a resection cavity) remains between 2.5 and 4cm in diameter, as defined&#xD;
                  in section 6. Whole brain radiation therapy may or may-not have been delivered&#xD;
                  prior to entering this protocol.&#xD;
