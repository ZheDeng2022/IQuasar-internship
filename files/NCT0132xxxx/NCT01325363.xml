      The aim of this research is to investigate the neurolinguistic mechanisms underlying thought&#xD;
      disorders among schizophrenic patients. In particular, it will investigate the&#xD;
      neurolinguistic basis for loose association - a phenomena which this population is&#xD;
      characterized by. Several researchers have previously suggested that loose associations among&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients relate to a lack of inhibition in the automatic spread of activation&#xD;
      mechanisms within semantic networks (e.g., Soriano, Jimenez, Roman, &amp; Bajo, 2008). This&#xD;
      research focuses on the relationship between I. the left-right hemisphere dynamic and II.&#xD;
      semantic processing, among schizophrenic patients. The research follows Jung-Beeman's (2005)&#xD;
      model which relates semantic associations, activation and inhibition processes to the&#xD;
      functioning of the two cerebral hemispheres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research suggests that, when compared to the neurotypical population, people with&#xD;
      schizophrenia show a less defined - or even reversed - hemispheric lateralization pattern for&#xD;
      semantic processing. This is linked to an impairment in language function in the left&#xD;
      hemisphere, and to a language functions shift from left to right hemisphere (e.g., Crow,&#xD;
      1997). The investigators assume that this unique lateralization pattern may cause a change in&#xD;
      balance in the semantic activation and inhibition system among schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated, one of the linguistic models that predicts how reduced left hemisphere dominancy&#xD;
      will influence linguistic functioning is Jung-Beeman's (2005) bilateral model for language&#xD;
      understanding. According to this model, the left hemisphere specializes in precise and fine&#xD;
      semantic processing, while the right hemisphere specializes in coarse and abstract semantic&#xD;
      processing. Building upon this distinction, our assumption is that schizophrenic patients&#xD;
      experience a difficulty in fine semantic processing which is caused by functional impairment&#xD;
      in the left hemisphere. It is our further assumption that coarse semantic processing -&#xD;
      located in the right hemisphere - is relatively unimpaired. This change in the balance&#xD;
      between the two processes may have direct implications on the associative semantic network&#xD;
      among schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis, the current research will make use of a specific language&#xD;
      expression type which involves fine and coarse semantic processing, and for which there is&#xD;
      evidence for crucial right hemisphere involvement: novel metaphor processing. 10-20 adult&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients will be presented with four different types of two word expressions:&#xD;
      literal; conventional metaphor; novel metaphor and unrelated. The patients will have to&#xD;
      decide as quickly and accurately as possible if the expression is meaningful or meaningless&#xD;
      while their brain activity is recorded by a Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) device (which&#xD;
      combines a high temporal resolution with the ability to localize the activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, our main hypothesis is that schizophrenic patients will show a bilateral brain&#xD;
      activity pattern when conducting semantic decisions, and that this pattern will be related to&#xD;
      improved reaction times and accuracy when presented with novel metaphors than when presented&#xD;
      with other types of expressions.&#xD;
