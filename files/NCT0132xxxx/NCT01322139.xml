  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate effects of Sativex on electrocardiogram (ECG) traces when&#xD;
      administered at its therapeutic dose of 8 sprays per day and at multiples of the therapeutic&#xD;
      dose (24 or 36 sprays per day), and to evaluate its safety and tolerability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and&#xD;
      active-controlled, four arm, parallel group study to evaluate the effect of Sativex on the&#xD;
      QT/QTc interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days of screening, eligible subjects were randomized to one of four treatment&#xD;
      groups. Baseline ECG measurements were recorded at specified times and the following day,&#xD;
      subjects commenced five days treatment with Sativex or placebo. On Day 5, subjects then&#xD;
      received either moxifloxacin 400 mg (Group 4) or moxifloxacin placebo (Groups 1, 2 and 3).&#xD;
      Triplicate ECG measurements and pharmacokinetic samples were collected on Day 5. On days 1-5,&#xD;
      Safety ECG measurements were also collected at pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose. Subjects&#xD;
      returned to the study centre for an outpatient safety follow-up visit approximately 10-14&#xD;
      days after their last dose of study medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to cannabinoids, propylene glycol, ethanol,&#xD;
             peppermint oil, moxifloxacin or other quinolone antimicrobials, related drugs, or any&#xD;
