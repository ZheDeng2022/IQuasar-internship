    <textblock>
      Circadian rhythm disorders are a class of sleep disorders characterized by misalignment&#xD;
      between the timing of sleep and the timing of rhythms driven by the biological clock. Light&#xD;
      therapy can effectively treat these disorders, but the intensity and duration of light&#xD;
      exposure required to do so has limited its practical use. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      will test whether pre-exposure to dim light may enhance the response of the circadian system&#xD;
      to light therapy. If so, this could result in shorter treatments that would have greater&#xD;
      practical applications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders affect 35-40% of adults, resulting in diminished quality of life, and&#xD;
      increased morbidity, mortality, and risk of automobile and occupational accidents. Circadian&#xD;
      rhythm sleep disorders form a distinct class of sleep disorders characterized by misalignment&#xD;
      between the timing of sleep and the circadian pacemaker. While light therapy can be an&#xD;
      effective treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, there are numerous practical&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light is the most powerful signal from the environment that influences and regulates daily&#xD;
      biological rhythms. It is well-established that the irradiance, duration, and timing of light&#xD;
      exposure all affect the response of the circadian system. While it was once thought that&#xD;
      these responses were mediated through the visual system, it is now known that there is a&#xD;
      network of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that mediate&#xD;
      circadian responses to light. Other new studies have demonstrated that recent light exposure&#xD;
      history affects the circadian response to light in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These recent findings have important implications for the use of light to treat circadian&#xD;
      rhythm disorders, including delayed and advanced sleep phase disorders, shift work sleep&#xD;
      disorder, and jet lag, and they may also have relevance for the use of light to treat&#xD;
      seasonal affective disorder. Up to now, little attention has been paid to the duration or&#xD;
      intensity of light exposure prior to such light treatments. The investigators now have&#xD;
      evidence that the human circadian system can become desensitized to light during long&#xD;
      exposures and evidence that it can be sensitized to light by prior exposure to dim light.&#xD;
      These recent findings suggest that light treatment protocols that sensitize the circadian&#xD;
      system prior to the light treatment will be more effective than those currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 13-day inpatient studies the investigators propose will examine the effect on the human&#xD;
      circadian system of different durations of dim-light sensitization prior to a standardized&#xD;
      light treatment. These results will be compared within subjects in a randomized cross-over&#xD;
      design study in which each subject will receive a control treatment and a light treatment&#xD;
      with prior dim-light sensitization. The investigators will also include circadian phase&#xD;
      disorder patients to test these mechanisms in the target patient population. Our findings&#xD;
      will provide an important step in understanding how new knowledge about the circadian&#xD;
      photoreceptive system can be used to refine and provide better treatment options for&#xD;
      circadian rhythm disorders.&#xD;
