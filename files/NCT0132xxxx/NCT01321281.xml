      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common kind of arthritis and primarily affects the large,&#xD;
      weight bearing joints (including the knees, lower back, hips, neck and the feet) and the&#xD;
      joints in the hands. OA results from the breakdown of cartilage in joints, leading to joint&#xD;
      pain and damage. It affects about 8 million people in the United Kingdom and nearly 27&#xD;
      million people in the United States, most of whom are over the age of 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aim to determine if Aquamin (as AquaCal and AquaPT) affects molecules of&#xD;
      inflammation in the blood of osteoarthritis and healthy subjects.&#xD;

      Aquamin is a seaweed-derived mineral source, which is rich in calcium, magnesium and 74 other&#xD;
      trace minerals including zinc, iron and selenium. It is produced from the red algae,&#xD;
      Lithothamnion Calcareum, which is found in just three locations in the world, including the&#xD;
      south-west coast of Ireland and Iceland. During a five-year life span, these algae absorb&#xD;
      essential minerals from the sea - this gives Aquamin its unique multimineral content. The&#xD;
      algae then break down naturally and settle on the sea bed. These calcified skeletal remains&#xD;
      are harvested, washed, dried and milled and provided in a capsule formulation. AquaCal is the&#xD;
      capsule form of Aquamin. AquaPT contains green tea and pine bark extract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common kind of arthritis. OA is called degenerative&#xD;
      arthritis, is a disease that results from the breakdown of cartilage in joints, leading to&#xD;
      joint pain and damage. OA is very variable and there are lots of different types affecting&#xD;
      different joints. This degenerative disease primarily affects the large, weight bearing&#xD;
      joints (including the knees, lower back, hips, neck and the feet) and the joints in the&#xD;
      hands. In OA, the disease begins with the degeneration of the cushion of cartilage between&#xD;
      the joints. As it degrades, the synovium and the ends of the bones thicken, resulting in the&#xD;
      pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. The progressive cartilage deterioration is&#xD;
      followed by &quot;hardening of the joints&quot; due to calcification and bone spur formation. Treatment&#xD;
      generally involves a combination of exercise, lifestyle modification and analgesics. If pain&#xD;
      becomes debilitating joint replacement surgery may be used to improve the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of Osteoarthritis include early morning joint stiffness and pain, loss or&#xD;
      restriction of joint mobility, pain that is worse after use, stiffness after periods of rest,&#xD;
      creaking/cracking of joints after movement (also known as crepitus), tenderness and swelling&#xD;
      in certain areas, restricted mobility, pain in the joint before or during changes in the&#xD;
      weather and deformity of the joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of chronic disability in the United States.[1] It affects&#xD;
      about 8 million people in the United Kingdom and nearly 27 million people in the United&#xD;
      States, most of whom are over the age of 45. A number of studies have shown that there is a&#xD;
      greater prevalence of the disease between siblings and especially identical twins, indicating&#xD;
      a hereditary basis [2]. Up to 60% of OA cases are thought to result from genetic factors.&#xD;
      Other factors causing OA are congenital disorders of joints, diabetes, inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      and all chronic forms of arthritis. In addition, injury to joints as a result of an accident,&#xD;
      septic arthritis, Marfan syndrome, obesity, ligamentous deterioration or instability may also&#xD;
      be factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current anti-inflammatory treatments for OA while providing some relief from symptoms are&#xD;
      suboptimal and the side effects associated with these treatments; in particular the COX-2&#xD;
      specific NSAID's are becoming increasingly recognized [3,4]. As a result of this, use of&#xD;
      alternative treatments and complementary medicines are gaining popularity among OA sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, where osteoarthritis subjects were treated with Aquamin, there was a&#xD;
      significant improvement in the WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness, activity and composite&#xD;
      scores over the course of the 12-week treatment, in comparison to subjects in the Placebo&#xD;
      group[5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aquamin is composed of multiple minerals and the 'active ingredient' for the complex is&#xD;
      difficult to determine. A number of the minerals in Aquamin may have anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-oxidant properties which might directly and/or indirectly influence the efficacy of this&#xD;
      unique complex [7,8,9]. While the prominent mineral present in Aquamin is calcium (dosage =&#xD;
      80% Ca U.S RDA), its role in joint health is unclear. Magnesium however, was given at the&#xD;
      daily dosage providing 14% (male) to 18% (female) U.S. RDA [6] and over the course of this&#xD;
      study, this increased consumption of magnesium may have influenced OA symptoms by affecting&#xD;
      the utilization of calcium or by potentially reducing inflammation around the affected joint.&#xD;
      Both manganese and selenium were given at the daily dosage providing up to 16% and 4% of&#xD;
      their RDA respectfully. Both of these trace minerals have been reported to reduce the&#xD;
      appearance of osteoarthritic lesions and reduce the severity of symptoms in OA [8,9].&#xD;
