  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer mortality in Asia. Most patients&#xD;
      present with intermediate or advanced disease. Percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) are not considered as a&#xD;
      curative treatment and have achieved very limited success in eradicating large HCC. With the&#xD;
      development of new radiotherapy (RT) technique, RT can be more safely given to patients with&#xD;
      larger tumor burden. Thus, TACE combined with RT has been suggested for treating large HCC.&#xD;
      Based on the results of these studies, RT could achieve a tumor response rate of 50 % to 70&#xD;
      %. However, it has not been definitively shown to prolong the overall or disease-free&#xD;
      survival due to lack of a phase III clinical trial. In contrast, a retrospective clinical&#xD;
      investigation with molecular study suggests that sublethal dose of RT promoted HCC growth&#xD;
      outside RT field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phase III trials were shown to be efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC. Median overall survival was significantly 2 to 3 months longer in the sorafenib&#xD;
      group than that in the placebo. It is interesting to recognize the combined therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of RT with sorafenib. Based on several preclinical experiments, tumor angiogenesis&#xD;
      inhibitors seem to be synergistic with irradiation when using before RT, concurrently with&#xD;
      RT, or after RT. Thus, the investigators design a single-arm phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of combined RT with sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria are patients with unresectable HCC; good performance status; no&#xD;
      prior radiotherapy for the liver; clinical measurable tumor; good liver function and good&#xD;
      compliance. After entering this study, the testee will receive RT to hepatic tumor with&#xD;
      concurrently sorafenib with a dose of 400 mg twice daily. Hepatic RT will be performed with a&#xD;
      daily fraction size of 2.0 to 2.5 Gy to a total dose of 46 Gy to 60 Gy. After RT, maintenance&#xD;
      sorafenib with a dose of 400 mg twice daily will be ongoing. Sorafenib will be continued&#xD;
      until the occurrence of clinical or radiologic progression, or the occurrence of either&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events or death. Minimum maintenance duration of 6 months is&#xD;
      recommended, but not mandatory.&#xD;
