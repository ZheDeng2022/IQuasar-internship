  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of pravastatin and rosuvastatin on&#xD;
      coronary plaque characteristics in patients with stable angina pectoris.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous mega trials have demonstrated that lipid-lowering therapy with HMG-CoA reductase&#xD;
      inhibitors in individuals with high risk of cardiovascular disease reduces the incidence of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease. NCEP ATP-III has suggested the advantage of more intensive lipid&#xD;
      lowering therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C below 70 mg/dL for such patients categorized&#xD;
      as very high risk. In Japan, Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) Guidelines for Diagnosis and&#xD;
      Treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases 2002 have recommended that an LDL-C goal&#xD;
      for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) should be below 100 mg/dL. However, there is&#xD;
      no satisfactory evidence whether the investigators need to lower LDL-C level less than the&#xD;
      70mg/dL or not in Japanese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, research on diagnosis of coronary plaque has shown significant advances. The&#xD;
      REVERSAL study in patients with a history of CHD, by diagnosis with intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      (IVUS), suggested that intensive lipid lowering therapy with atorvastatin (80 mg/day) was&#xD;
      associated with no growth of plaque (-0.4% compared to baseline), whereas therapy with&#xD;
      pravastatin (40 mg/day) showed a slight increase (2.7%) in plaque volume over 18 months in&#xD;
      Western population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEGA study has shown that lipid lowering therapy with pravastatin (10-20 mg/day) was&#xD;
      associated with a 33% reduction in coronary heart disease incidence as the primary prevention&#xD;
      in Japanese patients. However, the effect of lipid lowering therapy in secondary prevention&#xD;
      of cardiovascular events is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative plaque regression rate between intensive and moderate lipid lowering therapy would&#xD;
      clarify the ideal level of target LDL-C in Japanese population. Furthermore, the different&#xD;
      effect on coronary plaque between pravastatin and rosuvastatin which have different LDL-C&#xD;
      lowering effect and different affinity to arterial tissue would determine the superior lipid&#xD;
      lowering regimen to affect coronary plaque volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate whether there would be lipid lowering&#xD;
      therapy differences in terms of the composition of coronary artery plaques in patients with&#xD;
      stable angina pectoris (SAP) using integrated backscatter intravascular ultrasound (IB-IVUS)&#xD;
      and optical coherence tomography (OCT).&#xD;
