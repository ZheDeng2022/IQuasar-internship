      Main Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that measurements of lingual tonsil tissue&#xD;
      (LTT) thickness will decrease following treatment with once daily oral dexlansoprazole 60 mg&#xD;
      in patients diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and lingual tonsil hypertrophy&#xD;
      (LTH) compared to matched controls receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour oropharyngeal pH testing, pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean lingual tonsil tissue (LTT) thickness, pre- and post-treatment, as determined by CT&#xD;
           scan of the base of tongue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflux Finding Score (RFS) on pre- and post-treatment endoscopy of the oropharynx&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective outcome metrics for assessing LPR-related symptoms and associated quality of&#xD;
           life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bed-partner assessment of snoring intensity according to a Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflux Symptom Index (RSI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment of&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with LPR and LTH with 3 months of PPI therapy reduces LTT thickness, as&#xD;
      measured on CT scan of the tongue base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate changes in LPR-related symptoms and quality of life after therapy using the&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detail: The backflow of gastric contents into the esophagus occurs in healthy people to a&#xD;
      limited extent.[1] When the refluxed material transcends the upper esophageal sphincter and&#xD;
      enters the laryngopharynx on a chronic basis, it is termed laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).&#xD;
      LPR typically manifests as dysphonia, globus sensation, chronic cough, and throat irritation.&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that untreated LPR may be a cause of lingual tonsil hypertrophy (LTH),&#xD;
      [2,3] which itself has been implicated as a contributing factor in obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).[4-6] Lingual tonsil tissue (LTT) is present to a variable&#xD;
      degree in most individuals and tends to regress with age. Although standardized parameters&#xD;
      for defining LTH have yet to be established, a recent study by Friedman et al [7]&#xD;
      demonstrated that on average subjects with LPR, OSAHS, or both diseases had significantly&#xD;
      thicker LTT on CT imaging than patients without either disease. Del Gaudio and coworkers [2]&#xD;
      identified a trend between increasing severity of LTH and the frequency of reflux events,&#xD;
      while Mamede et al [3] found a positive correlation between reflux symptoms and the degree of&#xD;
      LTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LTH in the setting of LPR is thought to result from the edema and inflammation brought about&#xD;
      by chronic exposure of the tissues to the refluxed acid. The resulting thickened and inflamed&#xD;
      LTT may narrow the retrolingual airway, increasing the likelihood of airway obstruction and&#xD;
      apneic events. Theoretically, increases in negative intrathoracic pressure secondary to the&#xD;
      obstruction may, in turn, facilitate further LPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the treatment of reflux has been shown to decrease indices of OSAHS severity in some&#xD;
      patients, [8-10] a direct causal relationship between LPR and OSAHS has not been proven.&#xD;
      Similarly, more evidence is necessary to elucidate the exact relationship between LPR and&#xD;
      LTH. No study to date has investigated whether treatment of LPR reduces LTH. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that adequate treatment of LPR using a PPI in patients with LTH&#xD;
      will result in a significant reduction in LTT thickness as well as improvement in OSAHS&#xD;
      symptoms, if present. The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine whether control of LPR reduces LTH and, as a corollary, improves OSAHS symptoms.&#xD;
      Control of LPR will be determined by 24-hour oropharyngeal pH monitoring [11], and LTH will&#xD;
      be measured on CT. While the length of time required for LTH regression to occur is not&#xD;
      currently known, Reichel et al have found that 3 months of PPI therapy are typically&#xD;
      necessary before improvement in LPR is seen. [12] Similarly, a study by Park et al showed a&#xD;
      significantly greater rate of improvement or resolution of LPR symptoms when treatment with a&#xD;
      PPI was for longer than 2 months. [13] PRELIMINARY STUDIES Preliminary Studies: In a previous&#xD;
      study, the investigators utilized axial and sagittal CT images of the tongue base to measure&#xD;
      LTT in patients with LPR, OSAHS, both conditions, or neither disease. The investigators found&#xD;
      that patients with LPR, OSAHS, or LPR+OSAHS had significantly thicker LTT than patients&#xD;
      without LPR or OSAHS. This study was presented at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American&#xD;
      Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and was published in the April 2010 issue of&#xD;
      the journal Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study at a tertiary,&#xD;
      university-affiliated medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: In order to achieve a power of 0.95, a sample size of 40 subjects per group (80&#xD;
      total) was determined based on an a priori power analysis. The sample size stated in the&#xD;
      original concept was an estimate and was not determined statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: The study protocol begins after a patient has been diagnosed with&#xD;
      laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) on the basis of routine history, physical exam, and diagnostic&#xD;
      studies including 24-hour oropharyngeal pH monitoring with the Dx-pH Monitoring System&#xD;
      (Restech, San Diego, California). Prospective candidates for the study will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo CT imaging of the tongue base. Those who are subsequently diagnosed with lingual&#xD;
      tonsil hypertrophy (LTH), as determined by mean lingual tonsil tissue (LTT) thickness greater&#xD;
      than 3.0 mm on axial and sagittal views, will be eligible for enrollment, providing they meet&#xD;
      the additional inclusion criteria listed above. The enrollment period is expected to last 12&#xD;
      months, and the total duration of the study is expected to be 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an eligible patient has agreed to participate in the study and provided informed&#xD;
      consent, s/he will be randomly assigned to the experimental or control group according to a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. Patients as well as the practitioner administering treatment will be blinded to&#xD;
      patient group assignments. Patients in the experimental group will be started on a 3-month&#xD;
      regimen of once daily oral dexlansoprazole 60 mg. Patients in the control group will receive&#xD;
      a placebo once daily by mouth for the same length of time. Following completion of the&#xD;
      3-month treatment regimen, patients from both groups will undergo repeat 24-hour&#xD;
      oropharyngeal pH testing and CT of the tongue base. Endoscopic findings of LPR will also be&#xD;
      recorded before, monthly during treatment and after treatment using the Reflux Finding Score&#xD;
      (RFS). A 3-month treatment period was chosen based on previous studies, which have shown&#xD;
      failure of symptom resolution after shorter lengths of time. Once enrolled, patients will be&#xD;
      seen in clinic approximately every four weeks. Treatment with cimetidine 200 mg PO BID will&#xD;
      be offered as a rescue medication to patients of either group whose LPR symptoms worsen&#xD;
      during the study. Once started, cimetidine, as well as study drug (dexlansoprazole or&#xD;
      placebo) will be continued for the duration of the study. At study conclusion, all patients&#xD;
      will be re-evaluated for continued treatment, based on the effectiveness of dexlansoprazole&#xD;
      (after unblinding) and need for rescue medication (dexlansoprazole and placebo). If&#xD;
      cimetidine fails to offer relief, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and other&#xD;
      treatment options will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (CSAQLI), visual analog scale for snoring&#xD;
      (VAS), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) will be used as subjective outcome metrics. These&#xD;
      questionnaires are validated tools for assessing symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea&#xD;
      syndrome (OSAHS) and associated quality of life. The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), a validated&#xD;
      instrument for assessing reflux symptoms, will also be administered along with the other&#xD;
      questionnaires both prior to initiating therapy and again at the end of the 3-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and Interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will focus on determining whether lingual tonsil tissue size differs&#xD;
      before and after therapy. Mean lingual tonsil tissue size will be calculated along with&#xD;
      standard deviation and student t test will be used to determine statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will also examine the mean change in four subjective metrics, (1) Calgary Sleep&#xD;
      Apnea Quality of Life Index, (2) Visual Analog Scale of snoring, (3) Epworth Sleepiness&#xD;
      scale, and (4) Reflux Symptom Index. Again, means and standard deviations will be calculated&#xD;
      and student t test will be used to assess statistical significance.&#xD;
