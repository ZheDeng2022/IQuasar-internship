      The overall study objective is to use microarray technology to identify and characterize the&#xD;
      gene expression of multiple relevant genes in biopsies of non-healing venous ulcers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with a ≥5 cm2, non-infected target ulcer that has not reduced in area by ≥ 40% since&#xD;
      the Screening visit will be randomized at Day 0 to either Apligraf or Control. After&#xD;
      enrollment of 25 subjects, randomization will be discontinued and all remaining subjects will&#xD;
      receive Apligraf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the target ulcer is assessed by the Investigator as healed at a study visit, the&#xD;
      subject's participation in the study is completed (eg, assessed as healed at Week 3, subject&#xD;
      would not be required to complete any subsequent study visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apligraf Group (Day 0 to Week 4) Prior to all applications, Apligraf will be fenestrated&#xD;
      (perforated) in a standardized manner using a #11 blade with 6 fenestrations per 44 cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those subjects randomized to the Apligraf group, after Apligraf application, the dressing&#xD;
      regimen will include a foam dressing (eg. Mepilex) and a 4 layered compression bandage system&#xD;
      (eg. Profore) which will be changed weekly by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial Apligraf application at study Day 0, Apligraf may be applied weekly&#xD;
      thereafter for an additional 4 weeks at study Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, if, upon visual&#xD;
      inspection, adherent Apligraf wound coverage is &lt; 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 4, the area of the target ulcer will be compared to the area of the target ulcer at&#xD;
      Day 0 to determine if the target ulcer is PTH or NPTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apligraf subjects that do not achieve CWC by Week 5 will enter the Follow-Up Phase at that&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group (Day 0 to Week 4 [PTH] or Day 0 to Week 8 [NPTH] Beginning at Day 0, subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the Control group will receive the standard dressing regimen which includes a&#xD;
      foam dressing (e.g. Mepilex®) and a four layered compression bandage system (e.g. Profore™)&#xD;
      which will be changed weekly by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study Week 4, the size of the ulcer will be compared to the size at study Day 0 to&#xD;
      determine if the ulcer is demonstrating &quot;Predicted to Heal&quot; (PTH), defined as &gt;40% reduction&#xD;
      in ulcer surface area compared with study Day 0, or &quot;Not Predicted to Heal (NPTH), defined as&#xD;
      &lt;40% reduction in ulcer surface area compared with study Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control PTH subjects that do not achieve CWC by Week 4 will continue to receive Control&#xD;
      treatment and will enter the Follow-Up Phase at Week 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control NPTH subjects will receive Apligraf beginning at Week 4. Prior to all applications,&#xD;
      Apligraf will be fenestrated (perforated) in a standardized manner using a #11 blade with 6&#xD;
      fenestrations per 44 cm2. After the initial Apligraf application at Week 4, Apligraf may be&#xD;
      applied weekly thereafter for an additional 4 weeks at study Weeks 5, 6, 7, and 8 if upon&#xD;
      visual inspection, adherent Apligraf wound coverage is &lt; 100%. After Apligraf application,&#xD;
      the standard dressing regimen will be applied over the target ulcer. The dressing will be&#xD;
      changed weekly by the Investigator. At Week 8, the area of the target ulcer will be compared&#xD;
      to the area of the target ulcer at Week 4 to determine if the target ulcer is PTH or NPTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control NPTH subjects that do not achieve CWC by Week 9 will enter the Follow-up Phase at&#xD;
      that time.&#xD;
