      The safety and performance of the Elaspine™ Implant System in the treatment of lower back&#xD;
      pain will be evaluated with a prospective and nonrandomized, multicenter post-marketing&#xD;
      clinical study (PMCS). The study will be enrolled within Germany and Switzerland in 3-5&#xD;
      clinical centres, including in average 10 patients per centre. The study is conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the Standard ISO 14155, where applicable on clinical investigation of medical&#xD;
      devices for human subjects and other legal requirements.&#xD;
