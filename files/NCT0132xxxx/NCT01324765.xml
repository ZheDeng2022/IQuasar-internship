  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a two therapeutic models designed to&#xD;
      enhance women's skills for managing reactive emotions in their current lives as well as to&#xD;
      educate them about how using these skills can enhance their personal effectiveness and help&#xD;
      them to gain control of post-traumatic stress reactions. The interventions adaptations of a&#xD;
      manualized psychotherapy that has shown promise with adults with complex Posttraumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD) (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy; TARGET) compared&#xD;
      to a supportive group therapy (SGT) that has been found to have modest benefits with women&#xD;
      survivors of childhood abuse (Wallis, 2002).&#xD;

      In a randomized treatment design, we will compare offenders receiving skills-based&#xD;
      intervention (TARGET) and those receiving a similar amount of supportive intervention (SGT).&#xD;
      We will assess the efficacy of treatment by determining if those receiving the TARGET skills&#xD;
      training show an improvement in functionality, as compared to those receiving only supportive&#xD;
      intervention. We will measure this by analyzing PTSD symptoms, psychological distress,&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning, and social/legal adjustment and services using structured&#xD;
      interviews, self-report questionnaires and qualitative questions. Questionnaires are listed&#xD;
      below in the outcome measure's section. We will collect follow-up data on program&#xD;
      participants who successfully finish the program at York. For those offenders who discharge&#xD;
      into the community directly from York, we will collect follow-up data on program participants&#xD;
      through CDOC Parole or Probation records. Statistically we anticipate a medium effect size&#xD;
      difference between the treatment conditions.&#xD;
