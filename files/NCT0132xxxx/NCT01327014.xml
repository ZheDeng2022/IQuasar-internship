  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to&#xD;
      be conducted in approximately 120 patients with hyperlipidemia in approximately 10 sites in&#xD;
      US and China. Patients who satisfy the entry criteria at screening visit will have a 4-week&#xD;
      Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet control period during which all lipid-lowering&#xD;
      medications will be discontinued. After the 4-week diet control period, eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three treatment groups. The treatment period will last for&#xD;
      12-weeks. Patients will have blood samples collected at 5 time points (screening, baseline,&#xD;
      Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12).&#xD;
