      The investigators will identify possible participants using our database of previously&#xD;
      treated hepatitis c patients. The investigators will identify those who have documented&#xD;
      evidence of current injecting drug use as a risk factor for acquisition of the virus. The&#xD;
      investigators will then search for those who have received curative treatment between&#xD;
      2004-2010. This covers all patients in the current database. The investigators will include&#xD;
      those over 18 years old. The investigators will exclude those patients who are coinfected&#xD;
      with either hepatitis B or HIV. This is because both of these conditions can accelerate liver&#xD;
      damage when in combination with hepatitis c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible participants identified will be sent an information sheet giving a simple and&#xD;
      clear outline of the proposed research. The investigator will try to obtain an au to date&#xD;
      residential address from the PAS system in the NHS or through confirmation from the patients&#xD;
      GP or drug worker. It will explain the purpose of the study, why they have been chosen, what&#xD;
      taking part will involve, the potential advantages and disadvantages of taking part and that&#xD;
      everything will be kept confidential. It will also outline who is conducting the study, how&#xD;
      any expenses will be paid and contact details for any problems/complaints that arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those interested in taking part will attend an appointment at the hospital after they have&#xD;
      had the opportunity to read through the information leaflet. They will be given time to ask&#xD;
      any questions they have about the study and have them answered fully. They will then be asked&#xD;
      to sign two copies of a consent form in order to take their participation any further. Once&#xD;
      this is complete they can have their first 'liver assessment'. The assessment will take&#xD;
      approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will take three blood samples from them (approximately 10mls of blood or 4&#xD;
      teaspoons full). One sample is to measure the levels of hepatitis C virus in the blood. This&#xD;
      will tell us whether there has been reinfection with hepatitis C. The second sample is to&#xD;
      measure the levels of inflammation within the liver and the third sample is to measure the&#xD;
      full blood count. The investigators will then perform a liver scan called a fibroscan. This&#xD;
      is a noninvasive test similar to an ultrasound (that pregnant women have) and gives a reading&#xD;
      that can tell us about any 'stiffness' in the liver. It takes approximately five to ten&#xD;
      minutes to complete and involves the patient lying on their back with their right arm above&#xD;
      their head for the duration of the scan. Following the scan the investigators will ask the&#xD;
      participant to complete a short questionnaire. This will include questions about past and&#xD;
      current drug use as well as any alcohol use. The answers will be kept strictly confidential.&#xD;
      They will be stored in the researchers locked office and have no direct participant&#xD;
      identifiers on them. They will simply have a study number on them.The participant will then&#xD;
      be thanked for their time and offered Â£30 to cover all travel and time expenses for their&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be invited to attend for a further liver assessment one year after their first one&#xD;
      and annually thereafter. This is optional and they are of course free to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time without needing to give a reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be identifying participants at different points in time following&#xD;
      their curative treatment. For example some will have been cured 5 year ago whereas other will&#xD;
      have been cured 6-12 months ago. This will increase the number of patient years follow up.&#xD;
      Once the investigators have done the first set of liver assessment the participants will then&#xD;
      be followed prospectively for as long as they wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of my higher degree I will present the data I have following two years of&#xD;
      'liver assessments'.&#xD;

      There is a stark paucity of data published concerning reinfection rates post successful&#xD;
      treatment for HCV in currently injecting drug users. The investigators research will focus in&#xD;
      this important area and provide desperately needed evidence to increase confidence in&#xD;
      treating this population who carry the burden of the disease. Treating larger numbers of&#xD;
      individuals in this population will reduce the incidence of HCV in injecting drug users and&#xD;
      therefore reduce the overall prevalence of the disease. This will reduce the current threat&#xD;
      to public health that HCV produces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETAILS OF MD RESEARCH PROJECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV therapy in the currently injecting group is beneficial with reinfection rates and long&#xD;
      term outcomes comparable to those who are not current injectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main aim is to determine if patients who have been successfully treated for HCV and&#xD;
           who are currently injecting drug users have comparable rates of reinfection to those who&#xD;
           injected drugs in the past (at least 6 months ago).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A secondary aim is to determine if currently injecting drug users have comparable long&#xD;
           term outcomes to those who injected drugs in the past (at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
           treatment) in terms of liver fibrosis and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the rates of reinfection in an historical cohort of drug users with HCV who&#xD;
           have been previously treated and achieved SVR compared to those who have injected drugs&#xD;
           in the past (at least 6 months prior to treatment) and achieved SVR with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine long term outcomes in those who injected drugs at the time of treatment and&#xD;
           compare this to past injecting drug users (those who injected drugs at least 6 months&#xD;
           prior to treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do current drug users have higher rates of reinfection than past drug users?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is the rate of reinfection in drug users as a whole low?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does progression of fibrosis continue following successful treatment for HCV?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How often do currently injecting drug users stop injecting during or after treatment for&#xD;
           HCV?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How often do past drug users return to injecting drug use during or following treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Does any rise in liver enzymes persist following successful treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. What are the most commonly used drugs for injection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. How often do currently injecting drug users share needles/equipment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Do injecting drug users know that they can be reinfected following SVR?&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. What proportion of injecting drug users drink more than the recommended weekly allowance&#xD;
           for alcohol?&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. What is the quality of life post SVR?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study looking at reinfection rates based on a historical cohort of&#xD;
      intravenous drug users that have been previously treated and achieved an SVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a HCV database set up at North Manchester Hospital of all patients started on&#xD;
      treatment since 2004. The investigator will access this and create a separate database of&#xD;
      those patients with injecting drug use at any time as their risk factor for acquisition of&#xD;
      HCV. The investigator will then identify those who were injecting drugs in the 6 months prior&#xD;
      to treatment including those who continued to inject during treatment. These will be the&#xD;
      'active' drug using group. The investigator will then identify the group of patients that&#xD;
      stopped injecting drugs at least 6 months prior to commencing treatment. These will be the&#xD;
      'past' drug using group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will be responsible for obtaining informed consent from the participants.&#xD;
      Two copies of the consent form will be obtained - one for the participants records and one&#xD;
      for the study file. Prior to obtaining informed consent The investigator will highlight that&#xD;
      if any information comes to light during the course of the study pertaining to a potential&#xD;
      criminal activity The investigator will obliged to pass this information on to the relevant&#xD;
      authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will be sent written information detailing the study and inviting&#xD;
      them to take part. This is to avoid any possible selection bias. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      follow up this group for 2 years to collect data on outcomes including reinfection rates&#xD;
      using annual HCV RNA (with subsequent genotyping if positive) and liver disease progression&#xD;
      using standard liver function blood tests and a fibroscan (a non-invasive method to assess&#xD;
      liver fibrosis and cirrhosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire regarding drug use post treatment will be done detailing any high risk&#xD;
      practises. They will also be questioned again about drug use on treatment in order to confirm&#xD;
      which group they should be assigned to and to reduce the possibility of previous&#xD;
      underreporting for fears of exclusion from the treatment programme initially. Alcohol history&#xD;
      will also be assessed. Quality of life questionnaires validated for use in HCV will be used&#xD;
      during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator is aiming to recruit 45 participants in to each group. The participants will&#xD;
      be asked to attend for 2 visits in total one year apart. One major limitation of this study&#xD;
      is the frequency of sampling for HCV RNA. By doing this annually the investigators may miss&#xD;
      those reinfections that the patient clears spontaneously. However, the investigator feels&#xD;
      that it is those with persistent viraemia and therefore persistent reinfection that are&#xD;
      important to quantify. This is because much of the physicians' reluctance to treat active&#xD;
      drug users comes from the perception that reinfection will occur resulting in the need for&#xD;
      further repeated courses of treatment. Whilst those transient reinfections that the&#xD;
      investigators may miss are very important in terms of onwards transmission, they largely do&#xD;
      not result in the need for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All new data gathered will be included in a specially designed database which will be&#xD;
      password protected and on a limited access drive on the NHS computer, following the&#xD;
      principles set out in the data protection act. Identifiers will be kept to an absolute&#xD;
      minimum. Data will be stored for 25 years before being destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator is aiming to distribute and communicate the results of this study at&#xD;
      national and international conferences. The investigator is also aiming to publish a paper in&#xD;
      a peer reviewed journal. The participants will be informed prior to consenting that they are&#xD;
      entitled to access to the overall results.&#xD;
