  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, therapy with monoclonal antibodies is considered to be a standard treatment that&#xD;
      increases the rate of remissions and the overall survival in patients with follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma. Nevertheless there are an important number of patients who do not benefit from this&#xD;
      therapy. A way to improve the efficiency of monoclonal antibodies therapy could be to improve&#xD;
      the activity of the effector arm of the immune system. A strategy that has been proposed to&#xD;
      obtain this improvement is the utilization of lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) cells. In&#xD;
      addition, the combination of LAK cells with monoclonal antibodies might obtain an additive&#xD;
      effect across the stimulation of the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical assay proposes to study the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      treatment with autologous effector cells expanded ex vivo associated with a standard&#xD;
      maintenance treatment with rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma in remission after&#xD;
      first-line treatment. In addition, we plan to analyse various biological parameters that can&#xD;
      predict the susceptibility of patients to treatment with rituximab. Specifically, we propose&#xD;
      to study the polymorphisms of Fc receptor, polymorphisms related to the ability of complement&#xD;
      activation, to study both the complement activity and peripheral blood cell subpopulations&#xD;
      that can mediate directly or indirectly dependent antibody cytotoxic effect. We will also try&#xD;
      to correlate any of these biological parameters with the response to treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are many mechanisms involved in the antitumor effect of the antibodies including the&#xD;
      induction of apoptosis, blocking angiogenesis, blockade of intracellular signaling pathways,&#xD;
      and activation of complement leading to lysis of tumor cells. However it appears that the&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the predominant mechanisms of&#xD;
      action. It is important to note that in order to obtain a powerful ADCC effect it is&#xD;
      necessary the action of the antibody but also the activity of the effector cell, and thus the&#xD;
      competence of the immune system of the guest. There are different cellular subpopulations&#xD;
      that mediate the ADCC effect. CTL and NK are two of these subpopulations that can be reduced&#xD;
      in patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A way to improve the efficiency of the monoclonal antibodies would be to improve the activity&#xD;
      of the effector arm of the immune system. A strategy that that has been planed is the&#xD;
      utilization of LAK cells. The culture of lymphocytes of peripheral blood with IL-2 activates&#xD;
      the subpopulations of killer cells. This population of killer cells activated with cytokines&#xD;
      (LAK: lymphokine activated killer) has a high number of NK and CTL cells, both with increased&#xD;
      cytotoxic capacity. It has been demonstrated that the immunotherapy with LAK cells might be&#xD;
      an effective and sure treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a murine model it has been demonstrated that LAK cells associated with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies increase the antitumoral activity when compared to the administration of&#xD;
      antibodies alone. In addition, in this model the combination was also superior to the&#xD;
      administration of monoclonal antibodies + IL-2 (Schultz et al., 1990). Other investigators&#xD;
      have demonstrated similar results. This information supports the idea of the combined therapy&#xD;
      consisting in LAK with anti-CD20 antibodies. This therapy can induce a destruction of CD20&#xD;
      positive cells greater than that with the monoclonal antibodies alone. In addition, it has&#xD;
      been reported that the administration of systemic IL-2 and LAK cells improves the ADCC in&#xD;
      lymphoma patients treated with rituximab. It is a small pilot study, with 10 patients. Seven&#xD;
      of them received LAK cells following a programmed way. The safety of the treatment and the&#xD;
      promising results demonstrated in this study encourage to investigate in this line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since one of the mechanisms of action of the monoclonal antibodies is to promote ADCC , our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the treatment with a suspension of autologous effector lymphocytes&#xD;
      expanded ex-vivo with culture should modify the biological effect of the treatment with&#xD;
      rituximab in follicular lymphoma patients, with an acceptable safety profile, and probably&#xD;
      increasing the efficiency of the monoclonal antibodies. In order to evaluate this hypotesis&#xD;
      we propose an open, prospective, historically controlled, phase II clinical study in patients&#xD;
      with follicular lymphoma who have achieved a remission after first-line therapy including the&#xD;
      anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and chemotherapy.&#xD;
