    <textblock>
      Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a pulmonary disorder caused by a complex&#xD;
      hypersensitivity response to antigens released by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The&#xD;
      clinical entity was first described by Hinson et al in 1952, and the clinical and immunologic&#xD;
      significance of Aspergillus fumigatus in the sputum were reported by Pepys and coworkers in&#xD;
      1959. The prevalence of ABPA in bronchial asthma is fairly high and a recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      suggested the prevalence of ABPA in asthma clinics to be as high as 13 percent. Diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria for ABPA have been laid and generally include the following eight major criteria:&#xD;
      (a) history of asthma; (b) transient or fixed pulmonary infiltrates; (c) immediate cutaneous&#xD;
      hyperreactivity to A fumigatus antigen; (d) absolute eosinophil count &gt; 1000/µL; (e) serum&#xD;
      precipitins against A fumigatus; (f) total IgE levels &gt; 1000 IU/mL; (g) central&#xD;
      bronchiectasis on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT); and, (h) raised A fumigatus&#xD;
      specific IgE or IgG levels. However, none of these are specific for ABPA,and there is still&#xD;
      no consensus on the number of criteria needed for diagnosis, and patients in different stages&#xD;
      of ABPA may not fulfill all these criteria. Also, there is no established definition for&#xD;
      remission of ABPA. The most widely followed criteria are clinical and radiological&#xD;
      improvement with at least 35 percent decline in total serum IgE levels. However, in a recent&#xD;
      study the investigators demonstrated that a 35% decline in serum IgE levels at six weeks is&#xD;
      not seen in all patients with ABPA, and the decline is slower in patients with baseline IgE&#xD;
      levels &lt; 2500 IU/mL. Moreover, the quantum decline in serum IgE levels did not predict&#xD;
      clinical outcome. The disorder is highly prevalent in India. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously reported our experience with screening stable outpatients with bronchial asthma&#xD;
      and acute severe asthma for ABPA. The investigators have also recently reported the&#xD;
      prognostic factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients with ABPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral corticosteroids are currently the treatment of choice for ABPA associated with bronchial&#xD;
      asthma. They not only suppress the immune hyperfunction but are also anti-inflammatory.&#xD;
      However, there is no data to guide the dose and duration of glucocorticoids and different&#xD;
      regimens of glucocorticoids have been used in literature. Itraconazole, an oral triazole with&#xD;
      relatively low toxicity, is active against Aspergillus spp. in vitro and in vivo. The&#xD;
      activity of itraconazole against Aspergillus spp. is more than that of ketoconazole. The&#xD;
      administration of itraconazole can eliminate Aspergillus in the airways and can theoretically&#xD;
      reduce the allergic responses in ABPA. The aim of this prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole monotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with ABPA.&#xD;
