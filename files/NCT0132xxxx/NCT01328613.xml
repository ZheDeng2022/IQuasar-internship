      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious syndrome that resembles a major depressive episode&#xD;
      and occurs in 10% to 20% of all mothers in the year following delivery. Women with histories&#xD;
      of major depressive disorder (MDD) are at an increased risk for PPD and recurrent PPD with&#xD;
      subsequent pregnancies. One possible genetic vulnerability to depression and PPD in&#xD;
      particular is the BDNF gene. BDNF is a protein that affects the growth and development of&#xD;
      brain cells, including those that help to regulate mood. BDNF levels have been shown to be&#xD;
      significantly lower in individuals with depression, including women. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in studying BDNF levels and hormones such as estrogen in pregnant women who have&#xD;
      MDD and are at risk for developing PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study connections between the BDNF protein and hormonal levels in pregnant women who are&#xD;
      at risk for developing postpartum depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women who are currently pregnant and have a history of major depressive disorder, and&#xD;
      either are taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or are not taking an&#xD;
      antidepressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves six visits over the course of 12 months, during the first, second,&#xD;
           and third trimesters (if possible) as well as 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postpartum.&#xD;
           Women will be allowed to participate at any point during pregnancy, but researchers are&#xD;
           most interested in recruiting women who are in the first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, blood&#xD;
           samples, and questionnaires about their history of depressive episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, participants will complete a number of questionnaires on depression&#xD;
           symptoms, such as sleep disturbance and stress levels. Participants will also provide&#xD;
           blood samples for hormone and other testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who become depressed during the study will be referred to a treating&#xD;
           psychiatrist or other professional for appropriate care and treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious syndrome which resembles a major depressive episode&#xD;
      and occurs in 10-20% of all mothers in the year following delivery. The etiology of PPD&#xD;
      involves psychological factors, environmental factors such as stress and sleep deprivation,&#xD;
      biological factors including hormonal changes, and social factors. Women with histories of&#xD;
      major depression (MDD) are at an increased risk for PPD and recurrent PPD with subsequent&#xD;
      pregnancies. No consistent hormonal abnormalities have been found in women with PPD and,&#xD;
      instead, they may be sensitive to the normal changes in hormone levels during the postpartum&#xD;
      time. One possible genetic vulnerability to depression, and in particular PPD, is the&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. BDNF is an important member of the&#xD;
      neurotrophin family and is known to affect neuronal outgrowth, differentiation, synaptic&#xD;
      connectivity and neuronal repair for a broad range of neuronal cell types including&#xD;
      serotonergic neurons. In humans, serum BDNF levels have been shown to be significantly lower&#xD;
      in patients with depression, including women . Interestingly, estrogen has been shown to&#xD;
      upregulate the expression of the BDNF gene in animals, suggesting that BDNF could be a&#xD;
      critical link for women who have hormonally related depressive symptoms. In addition,&#xD;
      serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) used to treat depression are known to&#xD;
      upregulate the expression of BDNF in the brain. Interestingly, links between depression,&#xD;
      perturbed energy metabolism and BDNF signaling have recently been elucidated. In the present&#xD;
      study, NIA investigators will measure levels of BDNF and reproductive and energy-regulating&#xD;
      hormones in serum samples from subjects enrolled in Dr. Jennifer Payne s study of PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in this study will be enrolled, evaluated and serum samples collected by Dr.&#xD;
      Payne and her staff at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine under Dr. Payne s already&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins approved IRB protocol NA_0008149.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIA Role:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coded serum samples will then be sent to Dr. Mattson at the NIA facility. Data obtained in&#xD;
      the analysis of serum samples will be sent to Dr. Payne and maintained in her database, and&#xD;
      analyzed to elucidate relations between levels of serum markers and clinical and genetic data&#xD;
      acquired by Dr. Payne.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are currently pregnant and who have a history of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to minimize heterogeneity in the sample, all women must be currently taking a&#xD;
        serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant medication or not taking&#xD;
        antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will attempt to recruit approximately 50% in each category (SSRI versus no medications).&#xD;
        If a woman becomes depressed during the study she will be referred to her treating&#xD;
        psychiatrist or given appropriate clinical care. We will continue to follow women for the&#xD;
        specified time course even if she placed on an (any) antidepressant medication during the&#xD;
        course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current active suicidal ideation or medical instability&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active substance abuse or dependence during the last 90 days.&#xD;
