      Objectives: To evaluate the role of human histo-blood group antigens in susceptibility to&#xD;
      Norovirus infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Design: Healthy volunteers with different blood types and low antibody&#xD;
      titers to the challenge strain will be challenged orally with a Norovirus in the CCCR&#xD;
      inpatient facility. Subjects with resistant (non-secretors) or susceptible (secretors (of&#xD;
      either A, B or O blood group)) to the challenge strain will be recruited. The challenge study&#xD;
      will be conducted in two groups of twenty, each with approximately ten secretors and ten&#xD;
      non-secretors. Three additional subjects per group will serve as alternates in the event that&#xD;
      any of the study subjects are unavailable or become ineligible at the time of the inpatient&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be monitored daily in the isolation facility for at least five days&#xD;
      following this challenge for daily clinical and virological evaluations. Subjects will return&#xD;
      to the investigational site for evaluation the day after discharge from the inpatient unit&#xD;
      and about 30 days (28-35 days) post challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: Norovirus infection as assessed by viral shedding, seroconversion and&#xD;
      clinical illness assessed by the duration and severity of symptoms&#xD;

      Noroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis&#xD;
      in humans. The prototype Norwalk virus (NV) was identified in a large outbreak of acute&#xD;
      gastroenteritis in an elementary school in Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968. Since then, many strains&#xD;
      have been described and named by the locations of their first isolation. Genetically,&#xD;
      Noroviruses belong to one of four genera within Caliciviridae (CV). Phylogenetic analysis has&#xD;
      shown that the Norovirus genus is divided into five genogroups and each genogroup can be&#xD;
      further divided into genetic clusters; at least 30 genetic clusters of Noroviruses have been&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noroviruses have been recognized as the most important cause of non-bacterial epidemics of&#xD;
      acute gastroenteritis, affecting individuals of all ages, in both developing and developed&#xD;
      countries. Such outbreaks usually have high attack rates and have occurred in child care&#xD;
      centers, schools, restaurants, summer camps, hospitals, nursing homes, ships (both civilian&#xD;
      and military) as well as deployed military troops. The viruses are highly contagious and are&#xD;
      able to survive in the environment for extended periods of time. They are spread by contact&#xD;
      with environmental surfaces and person-to-person transmission. Noroviruses normally cause&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe diarrhea and the disease is often incapacitating and can be fatal in the&#xD;
      young and elderly. The most important public health concern is that Noroviruses can cause&#xD;
      large water- and food-borne outbreaks, resulting in the virus being classified as a Category&#xD;
      B agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noroviruses have also been implicated in several military outbreaks. The &quot;Desert Shield&#xD;
      virus&quot; (DSV) isolated in US troops in the 1991 Gulf War was subsequently identified as a&#xD;
      Norovirus. Similarly the recently reported &quot;mysterious&quot; attacks of acute gastroenteritis&#xD;
      affecting the British troops in Afghanistan were also caused by a Norovirus. Large outbreaks&#xD;
      of Norovirus-associated gastroenteritis are common on US Navy ships, similar to those that&#xD;
      occurred on board cruise ship lines. Surveillance of acute gastroenteritis on board five US&#xD;
      Navy combat ships in 1998-1999 showed that all the ships experienced large outbreaks of&#xD;
      Norovirus acute gastroenteritis during their deployment in the Pacific and Indian Oceans,&#xD;
      following port visits. Because of the rapid spread of the disease, many departments and units&#xD;
      on board the ships were unable to function during the peak of the outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noroviruses are difficult to study because: 1) they are genetically and antigenically highly&#xD;
      diverse and multiple strains with distinct genetic identities co-circulate in the same&#xD;
      communities, making diagnosis and disease control extremely difficult; and 2) the virus&#xD;
      cannot be cultivated in cell culture and 3) no small animal model for studying Noroviruses&#xD;
      exists. The molecular cloning of the prototype Norwalk Virus (NV) in 1990 by one of the&#xD;
      co-investigators of this application has allowed rapid progress in studying Noroviruses and&#xD;
      other genera; however, many issues on Norovirus infection, pathogenesis, immunology and host&#xD;
      range remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of Norovirus receptors provides new opportunities to evaluate the pathogenesis&#xD;
      and epidemiology of Noroviruses. A host genetic factor involving Norovirus infection was&#xD;
      originally suggested by many researchers before the cloning of Noroviruses in the 1990s&#xD;
      because about 20-30% of individuals who did not have antibodies against Noroviruses were&#xD;
      never infected following a challenge with NV, and in outbreaks, individuals who remained&#xD;
      healthy were clustered in families that had the same exposure to Noroviruses as the ill&#xD;
      families. Further, pre-existing antibodies against NV were not protective against NV&#xD;
      infection, while individuals who had high levels of antibodies against NV were more&#xD;
      susceptible to NV than individuals who did not have the antibodies. These observations&#xD;
      indicate that, in addition to immune responses, there must be another factor(s) that controls&#xD;
      the host-specificity of Norovirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently discovered that Noroviruses recognize human histo-blood group antigens as&#xD;
      receptors. Using recombinant capsid proteins from different Noroviruses representing&#xD;
      different genetic clusters, we have identified four binding patterns of Noroviruses to human&#xD;
      histo-blood group antigens, which are defined by the host Lewis, secretor and ABO blood&#xD;
      types. This finding provides a new approach to develop strategies to control the disease.&#xD;
      Specifically, if Noroviruses rely on the histo-blood group antigens on the surfaces of the&#xD;
      intestinal epithelial cells as receptors, a compound that inhibits the interaction between&#xD;
      the virus and receptors could be developed as an antiviral drug for Noroviruses. This finding&#xD;
      provides the basis for this protocol which seeks to confirm the relationship between specific&#xD;
      Norovirus susceptibility and specific histo-blood group antigen presence as well as establish&#xD;
      a model to evaluated future interventions (drugs and vaccines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specificity of the NV interaction with the sugar moieties of histo-blood group antigens&#xD;
      was shown by specific blocking of the binding by human milk from a secretor, by monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies specific for secretor human blood-group antigens (HBGAs), by synthetic&#xD;
      oligosaccharide conjugates containing secretor antigens, and by treatment of the tissues with&#xD;
      a1,2 fucosidase. NV also binds to differentiated CaCo2 cells and differentiated CaCo2 cells&#xD;
      express human histo-blood group antigens. Transfection of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells&#xD;
      with a a1,2-linked fucosyl-transferase cDNA allowed attachment of NV virus-like particles&#xD;
      (VLPs). The bound rNV VLPs were internalized following incubation of the cells at 37oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further investigate the association between secretor status and susceptibility to Norwalk&#xD;
      virus (NV), we collaborated with Dr. Christine Moe at Emory University's School of Medicine&#xD;
      on a volunteer challenge study. This study utilized the prototype NV, the first Norovirus&#xD;
      strain to be used for human challenge studies. Saliva samples from 77 NV-challenged&#xD;
      volunteers were tested for secretor status and for NV-binding. Fifty-five (71%) of the 77&#xD;
      volunteers were secretors. Among the 55 secretors, 34 (62%) were infected with NV following&#xD;
      challenge and saliva from 41 (75%) bound NV recombinant VLPs. None of the saliva samples from&#xD;
      the 22 non-secretor volunteers bound NV virus-like particles (VLPs) and none of them became&#xD;
      infected following NV challenge; strongly suggesting that the susceptibility to NV is&#xD;
      determined at least in part by the ability of the host to bind the norovirus strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently we performed a study to determine whether other strains of Noroviruses have a&#xD;
      similar pattern of host-specificity and have extended the binding patterns to 7 based on&#xD;
      examination of fourteen Noroviruses. The 7 patterns have been classified into two groups&#xD;
      according to their interactions with three major epitopes (A/B, H and Lewis) of HBGAs: the&#xD;
      A/B binding group and the Lewis-binding group. Strains in the A/B binding group recognize the&#xD;
      A and/or B and H antigens, but not the Lewis antigens, while strains in the Lewis-binding&#xD;
      group react only to the Lewis and/or H antigens. This classification also resulted in a model&#xD;
      of the Norovirus/HBGA interaction, in which a maximum of two binding sites within a receptor&#xD;
      binding interface are involved in NV/HBGA interaction. The A, B and H side chains are&#xD;
      responsible for binding by the A/B binding strains while the Lewis epitopes are responsible&#xD;
      for the Lewis binding strains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that strains with identical or&#xD;
      closely related binding patterns tended to be clustered, but strains in both binding groups&#xD;
      can be found in both genogroups I and II. Our results suggest that Noroviruses have a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of host range and human HBGAs play an important role in Norovirus evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since human Noroviruses cannot be cultivated in vitro or infect animals, it is necessary to&#xD;
      perform human volunteer challenge studies to study the pathobiology of the infection. The&#xD;
      study will further the concept that Norovirus has a narrow host range which is fundamental in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis and immunology of Noroviruses. Additionally, we recently have identified&#xD;
      more than a dozen compounds that specifically block Norovirus attachment to their receptors.&#xD;
      The human challenge study should also establish a model that can be used in the evaluation of&#xD;
      these new compounds in regards to their capacity to block virus replication (anti-viral&#xD;
      drug). Furthermore, our study will re-evaluate whether acquired immunity is an independent&#xD;
      factor in Norovirus infections which may provide additional information in host immunity&#xD;
      potentially useful in vaccine development. Finally, the study will allow for banking of the&#xD;
      Norovirus challenge strain by collecting the diarrheal stools passed by the study subjects.&#xD;
      Banking of additional specimen, as mentioned above, is critical for future clinical trials&#xD;
      because the virus cannot be cultivated in vitro and must be isolated from humans infected&#xD;
      with the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific challenge study would only use one challenge strain and any challenge strain used&#xD;
      in human clinical trials would have a separate IND and FDA approval prior to administration&#xD;
      to subjects.&#xD;
