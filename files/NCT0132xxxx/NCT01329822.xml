  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled study was to evaluate the effects of CR on circulating&#xD;
      fetuin-A levels in obese humans with type 2 diabetes based on monitoring energy intake and&#xD;
      energy expenditure by daily activity. Furthermore, the investigators examined the&#xD;
      relationship between the changes of fetuin-A levels induced by CR and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      parameters including atherogenic lipid profile, visceral fat area (VFA), brachial artery&#xD;
      endothelial function, and carotid IMT.&#xD;

      Rapidly growing aging society augmented the risk of age-associated disorders, such as&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Dietary interventions that&#xD;
      reduce daily energy intake, also known as caloric restriction (CR), has been shown to be the&#xD;
      most robust intervention to extend average and maximal lifespan in various experimental&#xD;
      animals (1). In addition, CR diminishes the risk of multiple age-associated diseases, such as&#xD;
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some forms of cancer in rodents and primates (rhesus&#xD;
      monkeys) (1; 2). Moreover, in obese humans, CR improves insulin sensitivity and reduces&#xD;
      fasting glucose as well as the other components of metabolic syndrome (3). However, the exact&#xD;
      underlying mechanism of CR has not been fully defined yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it is hypothesized that liver may regulate systemic energy metabolism through&#xD;
      production of secretory proteins known as hepatokines. Fetuin-A, a circulating glycoprotein&#xD;
      almost exclusively secreted by the liver, has been found to inhibit insulin receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase activity in animal studies (4). Fetuin-A knockout (KO) mice have enhanced glucose&#xD;
      sensitivity, resistance to weight gain, and lower serum free fatty acid levels (5). In&#xD;
      humans, high fetuin-A levels are associated with insulin resistance and fat accumulation in&#xD;
      the liver (6). Ix et al. reported that higher human fetuin-A concentrations are strongly&#xD;
      associated with metabolic syndrome and atherogenic lipid profile in non-diabetic patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease (7). In addition, fetuin-A levels were associated with surrogate&#xD;
      marker of atherosclerosis such as arterial stiffness and intima-media thickness (IMT) (8).&#xD;
      Recent studies reported that elevated fetuin-A levels predict increased risk of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and ischemic stroke (9) as well as type 2 diabetes (10). However, there has been&#xD;
      no previous report about the effects of CR on fetuin-A comparing with changes of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk indicators in animals or humans.&#xD;

    <description>CR group were educated by a dietitian to reduce their usual energy intake to 1400 kcal/day (-500 kcal/day, -26% from baseline) for weight reduction and the recommended macronutrient composition was the 50-55% of energy intake as carbohydrate, 15-20% as protein and 20-25% as fat. Daily energy intake and nutrient composition were determined using a computer-aided nutritional analysis program (CAN-Pro 3.0; Korean Nutrition Society, Seoul, South Korea).</description>
