  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 800,000 people in France suffer from peripheral artery disease (PAD), of&#xD;
      whom 1-2% present the most severe form critical limb ischaemia (CLI). In this situation, the&#xD;
      patient frequently presents painful non-healing ulcers and focal gangrene. Wound care is&#xD;
      generally associated with increasing pain. Pain relief may be challenging in spite of major&#xD;
      analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies in this country and elsewhere assessed the usefulness of music for chronic or&#xD;
      acute pain relief during care. However, no data are published regarding the interest of music&#xD;
      therapy for pain relief during local care in PAD patients.&#xD;
