    <textblock>
      The association between exposure to ambient air pollution and pulmonary disease has been well&#xD;
      established.To date no study has assessed the burden of cardiovascular disease in Israel and&#xD;
      its relation to ambient air pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Haifa Bay Area has a long history of industrialization including possessing the nation's&#xD;
      largest oil refineries, oil-fired power plant, agrochemical and cement producers, industrial&#xD;
      incinerators and the Eastern Mediterranean's busiest port. The presence of industrial and&#xD;
      mobile sources, combined with a basin effect has contributed to air pollution in the Haifa&#xD;
      Bay Area and has raised concerns about potential health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if the increased rate of cardiovascular mortality in Haifa is associated with&#xD;
           PM 2.5 concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess effect modification in diverse sub-populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If an association does exist, assess the economic burden of PM 2.5 associated&#xD;
           cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design prediction models of daily cardiovascular emergency department visits based on&#xD;
           daily and seasonal variation of air pollution.&#xD;

      The association between exposure to ambient air pollution and pulmonary disease has been well&#xD;
      established. Recent studies have attempted to investigate the effect of air pollution,&#xD;
      specifically exposure to PM 2.5, on cardiovascular outcomes. Acute exposure to PM 2.5 is&#xD;
      associated with increased heart rate, decreased heart rate variability, and increased&#xD;
      incidence of cardiac arrhythmia. Population based research from the United States and Europe&#xD;
      has demonstrated increased rates of emergency room visits, hospitalization and cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity in association with increased daily concentrations of fine particulates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no study has looked at the burden of cardiovascular disease in Israel and its&#xD;
      relation to ambient air pollution. Standardized mortality ratios due to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease are significantly elevated in the Haifa Bay Area in comparison to the rest of the&#xD;
      country; mortality due to MI is 13% above national average while total ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      mortality is 29% above national average. The Haifa Bay Area has a long history of&#xD;
      industrialization including possessing the nation's largest oil refineries, oil-fired power&#xD;
      plant, agrochemical and cement producers, industrial incinerators and the Eastern&#xD;
      Mediterranean's busiest port. The presence of industrial and mobile sources, combined with a&#xD;
      basin effect has contributed to air pollution in the Haifa Bay Area and has raised concerns&#xD;
      about potential health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis- Fine particulate variation in the Haifa Bay Area is positively&#xD;
      associated with emergency room visit,hospitalization rates and mortality rates secondary to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology- Critical to any environmental epidemiology research is coordination&#xD;
      between experts in exposure assessment and health outcomes. This study will be a two year&#xD;
      collaborative effort between the School of Public Health at the University of Haifa and the&#xD;
      Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Technion. Exposure measures will come&#xD;
      from the Haifa District Municipal Association for the Environment's (HDMAE) network of 15&#xD;
      monitoring stations in the region. HDMAE also monitors a number of meteorological covariates&#xD;
      (ie. maximum and minimum temperatures, mean humidity, and mean barometric pressure) which&#xD;
      will be incorporated into exposure modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes of interest will be daily mortality rates and daily rates of cardiovascular&#xD;
      related emergency room visits and hospitalizations at the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa&#xD;
      Israel. Electronic medical record databases will be queried for ICD-9 codes of related&#xD;
      cardiac (acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, dysrhythmia/conduction disturbance)&#xD;
      diagnoses. A time-series analysis will be utilized to assess change in mortality and&#xD;
      emergency room visit rates in relation to incremental change in PM2.5. Covariates in the&#xD;
      model will include seasonal trends in disease incidence, daily concentration of&#xD;
      co-pollutants, meteorological variables such as temperature and humidity. Calculation of&#xD;
      relative risk will incorporate a 1 through 7 day lag into the model into to determine latency&#xD;
      of effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contribution to Environmental Health in Israel- This research hopes to evaluate the&#xD;
      contribution of ambient air pollution on the increased rate of cardiovascular morbidity in&#xD;
      the Haifa Bay Area. In assessing effect modification in sub-groups we will contribute to the&#xD;
      understanding of how environmental pollution impacts Israel's diverse population. In&#xD;
      calculating the economic impact of associated morbidity and mortality we hope to contribute&#xD;
      to the cost-benefit analysis of environmental regulation in Israel. Finally, by creating&#xD;
      prediction models of daily cardiovascular emergency department visits based on air pollution&#xD;
      and meteorlogical variation, we can potentially inform local medical facilities and public&#xD;
      health agencies on how to predict and prepare for changes in disease incidence.&#xD;
