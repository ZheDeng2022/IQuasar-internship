    <textblock>
      The incidence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to increase, and&#xD;
      prevalence estimates for NAFLD range from 17-33%, making it is the most common cause of&#xD;
      chronic liver disease in North America. It is associated with increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity as well as progression to cirrhosis is a subset of patients. There is currently no&#xD;
      approved treatment for NAFLD. A key barrier to the development of effective therapies is a&#xD;
      lack of consensus on the criteria for diagnosis and endpoints for studies evaluating&#xD;
      diagnostic markers, prognosis and therapeutic modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD encompasses an entire pathological spectrum of disease, from relatively benign&#xD;
      accumulation of lipid (steatosis) to progressive non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)&#xD;
      associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and necrosis. It has been estimated that 20-30% of&#xD;
      patients with NAFLD will exhibit biochemical and histological changes characteristic of NASH,&#xD;
      and 15-20% of those patients will progress to have cirrhosis. NASH remains an important&#xD;
      phenotypic state, because this sub-group of patients is deemed at high-risk for developing&#xD;
      progressive disease resulting in cirrhosis, liver failure requiring transplantation, or&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although NAFLD has not to date been included as a component of the metabolic syndrome, there&#xD;
      is increasing evidence that NAFLD frequently accompanies the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and therefore may be an indicator or predictor of future cardiometabolic risk.&#xD;
      Moreover, recent findings in skeletal muscle of experimental insulin resistance (lipid&#xD;
      infusion) as well as naturally occurring obese and type 2 diabetic, insulin resistant&#xD;
      patients show that skeletal muscle inflammation leads to a pattern of extracellular matrix,&#xD;
      structural, and remodeling abnormalities that closely resemble the TGFb, connective tissue&#xD;
      growth factor (CTGF) mediated fibrotic response that differentiates simple steatotic liver&#xD;
      from NASH. This suggests there may be a common underlying mechanism. Given the ready&#xD;
      availability of skeletal muscle tissue using percutaneous needle muscle biopsies, compared to&#xD;
      the more invasive liver biopsy, it may be possible to use characteristics of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      to distinguish the severity of liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the preponderance of patients being identified with NAFLD, the recognition of less and&#xD;
      non invasive tests that help to discriminate the different phenotypic types of NAFLD would be&#xD;
      highly practical and useful. This would help identify patients at risk of progression to&#xD;
      cirrhosis, and thus make them the target of any available therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that 1. Insulin resistance measured through glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test directly correlates with the extent of liver and muscle fibrosis, and 2. Inflammation&#xD;
      and fibrosis in the skeletal muscles correlates with the histopathological changes seen in&#xD;
      patients with NAFLD, and potentially skeletal muscle inflammation may be used as a diagnostic&#xD;
      predictor to differentiate patients with NASH from patients with simple steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to determine the extent to which inflammation and&#xD;
      fibrosis in skeletal muscle mirrors and is predictive of the level of liver inflammation and&#xD;
      can distinguish NASH from simple steatosis. Specifically, the investigators propose the&#xD;
      following Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To use estimates of insulin sensitivity from modeling of oral glucose tolerance tests to&#xD;
           test the hypothesis that the extent of liver and muscle fibrosis is directly related to&#xD;
           insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To use liver and muscle biopsies to characterize the changes in abundance of mRNAs and&#xD;
           proteins that characterize inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis.&#xD;
           The investigators will use quantitative rt-PCR and immunoblot analysis to compare mRNA&#xD;
           expression and protein abundance of collagens I and III, fibronectin, and connective&#xD;
           tissue growth factor (CTGF) to test the hypothesis that there is a direct relationship&#xD;
           between the levels of these proteins in muscle and liver and the degree of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a biospecimen repository of serum, mRNA from circulating white blood cells,&#xD;
           liver and muscle tissue, and DNA to serve as the substrate for future studies of the&#xD;
           pathogenesis of NASH.&#xD;
