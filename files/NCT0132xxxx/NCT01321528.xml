      The IBSR (Inquiry-based stress reduction) intervention, developed by Byron Katie&#xD;
      (www.thework.com), trains subjects to reduce their perceived level of stress by self-inquiry&#xD;
      of their thoughts and beliefs connected to stressful circumstances or symptoms. This&#xD;
      meditative process, named &quot;The Work&quot;, enables the participants to identify and question the&#xD;
      stressful thoughts that cause their suffering. The core of IBSR is simply four questions and&#xD;
      a turnaround, which is a way of experiencing the opposite of what the participant believes.&#xD;
      This process is simple, powerful and can be easily implemented in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, on the basis of previous data and beneficial observations the investigators&#xD;
      postulate that the clinical utility of IBSR mediation program may alleviate stress and rate&#xD;
      of burnout and improve quality of life among health care professionals. Thus, we will conduct&#xD;
      a pilot/feasibility Observational study designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess feasibility of a IBSR intervention by examining attendance, drop-out rates, and&#xD;
           program satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigate whether IBSR intervention is efficacious in alleviating stress and rate of&#xD;
           burnout and improving quality of life among health care professionals.&#xD;

      Study Goals To investigate whether IBSR intervention is efficacious in alleviating stress and&#xD;
      rate of burnout and improving quality of life among health care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology The proposed study is pilot/feasibility intervention study with pre and&#xD;
      post measures. 30 participants will receive Inquiry-based stress reduction (IBSR) group&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population The pilot intervention group will consist 30 nurses at the Geriatric&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Department in the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC) who are willing to&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessments will be taken at an initial baseline orientation and at the end of the&#xD;
           12-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One week before IBSR classes will start, a baseline orientation will be held at this&#xD;
           session, informed consent will be obtained, baseline data will be collected, and a brief&#xD;
           overview of the IBSR program will be provided, which will highlight the 12-week class&#xD;
           schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will receive weekly 3.5 hour sessions conducted by two facilitators trained in&#xD;
           IBSR and certified by BKI to conduct this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Class size will range from 12-16 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All the sessions will be standardized and follow the training manual developed to&#xD;
           maintain consistency in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects will receive a training manual and CD's to support home practice of various&#xD;
           forms of inquiry practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The training manual will include weekly exercises, and program content related to the&#xD;
           content identified below. In addition, the manual will include a weekly diary for&#xD;
           recording homework practice activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBSR-BC program is a 12-week program adapted for consideration of health professionals&#xD;
      well-being. During the process, participants will be encouraged to identify and inquire about&#xD;
      their stressful thoughts: regarding health and illness, relationships with others, Beliefs&#xD;
      that prevent them to promote their health, self judgments, perception of death and suffering.&#xD;
      This intervention provides for management of specific emotional/psychological symptoms&#xD;
      (stress, anxiety, depression) and physical symptoms, such as fatigue and sleeps disorders and&#xD;
      enables the participants to inquire and be relieved of their stressful thoughts, and emotions&#xD;
      caused by these thoughts. Through the use of self-inquiry practices subjects are taught to&#xD;
      increase awareness of their thoughts and feelings, to observe their emotional and physical&#xD;
      responses during situations perceived by them as stressful, and allow their mind to return to&#xD;
      its true, peaceful, creative nature. Through the process of self inquiry, subjects take an&#xD;
      active role in investigating their stressful thoughts, and by this regulating their stress&#xD;
      and managing symptoms and emotions, thus enabling them to cope better with with emotional&#xD;
      stress and burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 12-week IBSR (HCP - health care professionals) program, all subjects will be&#xD;
      requested to formally meditate and perform self inquiry exercises alone or with a partner for&#xD;
      a minimum of 15 min per day.&#xD;
