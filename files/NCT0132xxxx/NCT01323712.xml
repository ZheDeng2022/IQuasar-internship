      Impact of Vitamin D supplementation on Cardiac Hypertrophy and Function in Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease Patients- A randomised placebo controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lay summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are up to 3.5 times more likely to die from&#xD;
           diseases of heart and blood vessels (Cardiovascular Disease-CVD). Vitamin D&#xD;
           insufficiency is very common in CKD and associated with CVD. Animal studies have shown&#xD;
           an improvement in heart size and function with Vitamin D therapy, although evidence in&#xD;
           humans is lacking. The proposed study will test if oral Vitamin D treatment, in&#xD;
           deficient CKD patients, will improve heart enlargement and function. With these proposed&#xD;
           changes the investigators expect to reduce CVD and deaths in patients with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abstract of proposed investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional risk factors inadequately explain the disproportionate increase in CV risk in&#xD;
      CKD. Hypovitaminosis D is common in CKD and associated with increased CV mortality. In animal&#xD;
      experiments, vitamin D reduces LV mass (LVM) and improves systolic function. In dialysis&#xD;
      patients, observational studies show that vitamin D therapy reduces CV mortality and improves&#xD;
      diastolic function. However, benefit of native vitamin D repletion on cardiac structure and&#xD;
      function has not been investigated in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial, if 40 weeks of&#xD;
      oral Colecalciferol, in predialysis CKD patients, will result in reduction of LV mass and&#xD;
      improvement in systolic/diastolic function along with cardiac extracellular matrix&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, NICE does not recommend routine measurement of vitamin D in CKD patients. If&#xD;
      effective in this setting, further outcome trials will prove if this inexpensive and easily&#xD;
      administered therapy can be routinely prescribed to prevent morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Background to the project and pilot data: (i) CVD in CKD: CV death rates are up to 3.4&#xD;
      times higher in patients with CKD compared to the general population(1). The investigators&#xD;
      and others have demonstrated a graded relationship between CV events and death with declining&#xD;
      renal function(2). Traditional risk factors only partially explain the elevated risk. This&#xD;
      highlights the importance of non-traditional risk factors such as inflammation, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, and vitamin D deficiency as modifiable CV risk factors in CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Vitamin D deficiency in the general population and in CKD Hypovitaminosis D is common in&#xD;
      general population. A study by Thadhani's group of 15,088 adults has shown the prevalence of&#xD;
      Vitamin D insufficiency to be between 40-80% in the US general population(3). CKD patients&#xD;
      are at an increased risk of hypovitaminosis D. In a group of 145 non-dialysis CKD patients&#xD;
      from south London, have seen a 85% prevalence of Vitamin D insufficiency [25 hydroxy vitamin&#xD;
      D (25(OH)D)&lt; 75 nmol/L], including 32% deficiency[25(OH)D &lt; 37.5nmol/L], with a significantly&#xD;
      higher risk among Afro-Caribbeans' and south-Asians'(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Hypovitaminosis D and CV disease: Cross sectional studies show an independent&#xD;
      association between low 25 (OH) D and CV mortality(5;6). In the dialysis population,&#xD;
      observational studies by Thadhani et al show an increase in early CV mortality in patients&#xD;
      with low 25 (OH) D levels (OR=1.9). Vitamin D supplementation is associated with better&#xD;
      survival on dialysis (OR=0.6)(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Vitamin D improves cardiac function and morphology: The Vitamin D endocrine system is&#xD;
      ubiquitous in human tissues, including the myocardium and the vascular endothelium. There is&#xD;
      now mounting evidence from animal studies that Vitamin D directly affects cardiac function&#xD;
      and structure through a genomic action on cardiac myocytes. Vitamin D knockout mice show an&#xD;
      increase in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis and heart weight (8). More&#xD;
      importantly, treatment with vitamin D in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats and&#xD;
      wild type mice has been shown to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and modulates&#xD;
      cardiac myocyte contractility, respectively (9;10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an animal model of Dahl salt sensitive rats treated with active vitamin D for 6 weeks,&#xD;
      Thadhani's group demonstrated a reduction in heart weight, LVM, posterior wall thickness and&#xD;
      increased fractional shortening. There was a significant reduction in plasma BNP and renin&#xD;
      levels in rats fed high salt (HS) along with Vitamin D, compared to rats fed HS diet alone.&#xD;
      There was no difference in BP between the two groups, thus reaffirming a direct action of&#xD;
      vitamin D on cardiac morphology and function, as opposed to a haemodynamic effect. Most&#xD;
      importantly, they also demonstrated an improvement in diastolic function, and reduction in&#xD;
      septal and posterior wall thickness in a small observational study of haemodialysis patients,&#xD;
      treated with active vitamin D, suggesting that the findings from animal models can be&#xD;
      replicated in humans(11). Moreover, intravenous Vitamin D administration in a group of&#xD;
      haemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism was associated with a significant&#xD;
      reduction in LVM Index (178 ±73 to 165±61 g/m2) on transthoracic echocardiogram over 15&#xD;
      weeks(12). However, no studies thus far have investigated the effects of native vitamin D&#xD;
      repletion on cardiac structure and function, as a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in predialysis CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) Vitamin D and cardiac fibrosis: Recent evidence using gadolinium-enhanced cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (CMR), suggests that cardiac fibrosis is a predominant feature of uremic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy(13). Animal studies have demonstrated an important role of vitamin D in&#xD;
      maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) composition in the heart. In vitamin D receptor&#xD;
      knockout mice model there is marked increase in cardiac fibrosis, related to abnormal&#xD;
      expression of collagenases(14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies by Diez's group in hypertensive heart disease subjects have identified a reliable&#xD;
      serum biomarker that reflects type 1 collagen synthesis in human heart- Carboxy-terminal&#xD;
      propeptide of procollagen type 1 (PICP)(15). Serum PICP along with free Matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases 1 (MMP-1) and free Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP 1), as&#xD;
      markers of collagen degradation accurately reflect collagen metabolism in the heart(15). PICP&#xD;
      is released in a 1:1 ratio during the synthesis of type 1 collagen, from its precursor&#xD;
      procollagen type 1. Furthermore, peripheral serum PICP accurately reflect amount of collagen&#xD;
      type 1 fibres in the heart(16) and can therefore be used to monitor the effects of treatment&#xD;
      on collagen content of the heart(17). However, no studies thus far have shown an effect of&#xD;
      vitamin D therapy on changes in ECM composition within the human heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) Abnormal LV size with systolic and diastolic dysfunction in pre dialysis CKD patients:&#xD;
      In a group of 18 consecutive stable stage 4 and 5 CKD patients, deemed suitable for renal&#xD;
      transplantation, the investigators have seen significant increase in LVM, interventricular&#xD;
      septal (IVS) diameter and posterior wall diameter with systolic and diastolic dysfunction;&#xD;
      using a combination of Transthoracic and Cardiac Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI)&#xD;
      echocardiography, compared to normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (5) Original Hypothesis The investigators propose that 40 weeks treatment with oral&#xD;
      Colecalciferol will improve cardiac structure and function in predialysis CKD patients, as a&#xD;
      consequence of improvement in cardiac ECM composition and turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to address this central hypothesis through the following specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of oral Colecalciferol therapy on left&#xD;
      ventricular mass as measured by CMR imaging. The investigators expect a 10g reduction in LVM&#xD;
      on CMR in active treatment group compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of oral Colecalciferol therapy on cardiac&#xD;
      systolic function by cardiac TDI and diastolic function by transthoracic echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic function will be measured as an improvement in average longitudinal peak systolic&#xD;
      strain rate (SR) and longitudinal end systolic strain (S) assessed at the base, mid wall and&#xD;
      apex of the IVS, lateral, inferior and anterior wall on cardiac TDI. Improvement in diastolic&#xD;
      function will be measured by early (peak E) and late (peak A), trans-mitral flow and annulus&#xD;
      motion, isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and deceleration time (DT) on transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These parameters will be tested in randomised placebo controlled trial involving 25 patients&#xD;
      in each arm. 25 hydroxy vitamin D3 [25 (OH) D] has been used in this proposal, as CKD stage&#xD;
      3-4 patients would be expected to have adequate stores of 1 α-hydroxylase enzyme to convert&#xD;
      25 (OH) D to active 1,25 (OH)2 D. The investigators will measure the level of 25 hydroxy&#xD;
      colecalciferol to ensure adequate repletion. Colecalciferol has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      effective when given at this dose(18;19). To examine the improvement in ECM composition and&#xD;
      turnover the investigators will demonstrate reduction in cardiac collagen content as measured&#xD;
      by decrease in serum PICP and Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1(TIMP1) and an increase&#xD;
      in serum Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1). PICP will be corrected for eGFR and bone alkPO4.&#xD;
      MMP1/TIMP1 ratio will be used to measure the collagen degradation. Cardiac function pre and&#xD;
      post therapy, will also be assessed by measuring plasma N-Terminal proBNP (NT proBNP).&#xD;
      Furthermore, a biobank of whole cells, mRNA and DNA, blood and urine will be created for&#xD;
      future analysis of novel genes or biological pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (6) Experimental detail and design of proposed project&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Study Population: Vitamin D naive patients will be recruited from the general nephrology&#xD;
      outpatient clinics from St. George's, Guy's and Kingston hospitals. Patients with 25 (OH) D&#xD;
      deficiency [(25 (OH) D &lt; 37.5 nmol/L] (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines)&#xD;
      on ACEi/ARB therapy, will be enrolled. Cardiac recruitment criteria will be left ventricular&#xD;
      mass index (LVMI) between 80-160 g/m2 for females and 100-160 g/m2 for males (these figures&#xD;
      correspond to the upper tertile of normal LV mass index (LVMI) on TTE based on Framingham&#xD;
      Heart study (20).and those with LVMI 1SD above the mean values observed in CKD3-4, based on&#xD;
      the CREATE study) (21)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Patient randomization, blinding and follow-up: A clinical trials pharmacist will oversee&#xD;
      the randomisation into two equal groups for comparison, blinding and dispensing the&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stages of the trial are summarised below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 patients with 25 (OH) D levels &lt; 37.5 nmol/L will be recruited. Patient demographics,&#xD;
           anthropometric data and pertinent clinical history would be obtained upon enrollment.&#xD;
           Blood will be collected for calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone levels, bone alkPO4,&#xD;
           and high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP). Biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis (serum&#xD;
           PICP), ECM turnover (MMP1 and TIMP1) and cardiac function (plasma NT proBNP) will be&#xD;
           measured. Transthoracic Echocardiography will be performed at baseline to fulfill&#xD;
           recruitment criteria and diastolic function. Cardiac TDI function and CMR will be&#xD;
           performed at baseline for systolic function and LVM, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomised into 2 equal groups to receive 4 directly observed oral&#xD;
           doses of 150,000 IU in 50 mls vegetable oil colecalciferol (Martindale, UK) at 0, 10, 20&#xD;
           and 30 weeks or matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 40 weeks blood samples will be collected for repeat haematology, biochemistry and&#xD;
           biomarkers of collagen synthesis and metabolism as mentioned above. Changes in LV&#xD;
           geometry and function will be re-measured using CMR, Transthoracic and cardiac TDI&#xD;
           echocardiography, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the pre and post treatment measurements will be compared in the active and placebo&#xD;
      group. All patients will continue to be followed up in the general nephrology clinic during&#xD;
      the trial and subsequently upon trial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) CMR protocol: All subjects will be imaged on a 1.5T Philips Intera MRI Scanner with&#xD;
      dedicated 32 channel cardiac coil. MRI protocol will include a plan scan, SENSE reference&#xD;
      scan, interactive scan to identify 4 chamber, 2 chamber long axis and short axis geometries&#xD;
      of the heart. Breath hold Steady State Free Procession 4 chamber, 2 chamber and short axis&#xD;
      stack (1.5mm, 1.5mm, 10mm) cine (30 cardiac phases) will be acquired. Ventricular mass will&#xD;
      be calculated using a viewforum work station (Philips Healthcare) by delineating the&#xD;
      diastolic left ventricular endocardial and epicardial borders(figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) Cardiac Tissue Doppler Imaging and Transthoracic Echocardiography: Cardiac TDI will be&#xD;
      recorded for longitudinal deformation. Data will be obtained from septum, lateral, anterior&#xD;
      and inferior wall using narrow sector (typically 120). Longitudinal S and SR will be&#xD;
      calculated over a computation area of 10 mm. SR and S averaged over 3 cardiac cycles will be&#xD;
      analysed using dedicated software (SPEQLE, Univ. Leuven) (figure 3). The intra- and inter-&#xD;
      observer variability of this approach is less than 10%(22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be obtained from parasternal and apical views using a GE Vivid 7 scanner. LV&#xD;
      volumes will be measured using the Teichhloz formula. Diastolic function will be assessed as&#xD;
      previously described by our group(17). Global radial function will be assessed by both&#xD;
      endocardial and mid-wall fractional shortening. All measurements will be performed using&#xD;
      Echo-Pac (GE) workstation and averaged over 3 individual measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) Analysis of Biomarkers for Inflammation, Cardiac fibrosis and Cardiac Function: :&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation will be quantified by serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (hsCRP) using a chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Immulite® 2500) at 0,20 and 40&#xD;
      weeks. Serum samples stored at -700 C and batch analysed for PICP (RIA- Framos Diagnostica),&#xD;
      MMP1 and TIMP 1 (ELISA- Amersham) at University of Pamplona and Plasma NT proBNP will be&#xD;
      measured by the Elecsys® proBNP immunoassay on the Roche Elecsys® 1010 immunoassay analyzer&#xD;
      at baseline and at study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vii) Potential confounders: Haemoglobin will be maintained between 10-13gm%. Use of&#xD;
      Erythropoietin stimulating agents, dose/frequency of iron replacement and any blood&#xD;
      transfusion will be documented. Office blood pressure as per BHS guidelines will be&#xD;
      documented at vitamin D administration stages. Changes in anti-hypertensive medications over&#xD;
      the follow-up period will be noted. In addition the following parameters will be assessed at&#xD;
      0, 20 and 40 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma Aldosterone/renin activity ratio;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse wave velocity, Central Arterial Pressure and Augmentation Index (SphygmoCor Pulse&#xD;
           Wave Velocity system);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum calcium x phosphate product (&lt;5 mmol/L);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary protein-creatinine ratio, sodium and fractional excretion of phosphate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum FGF-23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (viii) Creation of a Biobank 10ml EDTA samples for cells and 3x3 ml tempus tubes for mRNA on&#xD;
      PBMC/whole blood will be collected at week 0, 20 and 40 weeks for creation of a biobank at&#xD;
      Kings college London (Guy's Campus) for future analysis of novel genes or biological&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ix) Recruitment and retention of trial participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning and preparation of the trial would be conducted over the first 6 weeks. 120 CKD&#xD;
      patients/week are seen at the three hospital sites. 30% of the patients are diabetic and 60%&#xD;
      of the patients have a GFR &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73m2. The investigators estimate vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency to be about 35% based on our pilot study. Recruitment will be over 50 weeks. The&#xD;
      total duration of the trial will be 102 weeks. A timeline of the proposed study is described&#xD;
      in figure 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (7) Power calculation and statistical analysis The interstudy variability of CMR for LV mass&#xD;
      using a protocol similar to ours, has been reported between 2.8% to 4.8% with a SD of&#xD;
      8.4g(23). To demonstrate a 10g improvement in LV mass in the active treatment group, the&#xD;
      investigators would need 19 patients [α= 0.05 and Power=95%]. Accounting for a dropout rate&#xD;
      of 30%, the investigators will recruit 25 patients in each group. Comparisons for continuous&#xD;
      variables will be performed using independent sample t-test between the active treatment and&#xD;
      placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (8) Expected value of results The investigators are confident that the study is adequately&#xD;
      powered to show a 10 gm change in LVM, using MR scan at Reza Rezavi's laboratory, if it&#xD;
      exists; similarly a change in systolic function using echocardiogram at the expert laboratory&#xD;
      at St Georges. The investigators will also be able to examine the role of fibrosis in the LVH&#xD;
      and systolic dysfunction by measuring biomarkers at Javier Diez's laboratory. A large CKD&#xD;
      patient population at St George's, Guy's and Kingston Hospitals will facilitate recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 3: Timeline expressed in weeks showing planning, recruitment and anticipated&#xD;
      randomization of 50 patients with 25 (OH) vitamin D levels &lt; 37.5 nmol/L. Cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance, Echocardiography, markers of cardiac fibrosis will be measured at randomization&#xD;
      and at study completion. CMR- Cardiac magnetic resonance, TDI- Tissue Doppler imaging, TTE-&#xD;
      Transthoracic Echocardiography. Analysis and reporting of findings will take place between&#xD;
      96-102 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (9) Potential problems and alternative strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of potential confounders has been minimised through strict entry criteria and&#xD;
           follow-up protocol. A 30% attrition rate has been allowed for in our sample size&#xD;
           calculation to accommodate changes in patients' clinical status that may account for&#xD;
           observed changes in cardiac measurements, such as rapid decline in renal function, MI or&#xD;
           death during trial follow-up, pre-emptive kidney transplantation, CaxP product &gt;&#xD;
           5mmol/L, Hb &lt; 10 or &gt; 13gm% and persistent high office BP(&gt; 150/90mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although patients in our pilot study were young, the investigators expect proportionate&#xD;
           improvement in parameters in the trial participants as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators are conscious that improvement in LV function and morphology has not&#xD;
           been previously shown with vitamin D therapy in human subjects. However, evidence of&#xD;
           genomic effects of vitamin D on cardiac myocytes, extracellular matrix and myocardial&#xD;
           contractility are well established in animal studies. Most importantly, this study&#xD;
           explores a novel anti-fibrotic mechanism of vitamin D therapy in humans, which could&#xD;
           provide the proof of principle for use of vitamin D in other disease states such as&#xD;
           autoimmune disorders.&#xD;
