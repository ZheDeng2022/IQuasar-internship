      The purpose of this retrospective, open-label, post-market study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF) performed with EsophyX (brand&#xD;
      name) in a broad range of GastroEsophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) patients treated at high&#xD;

    <measure>Typical and Atypical Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Symptom Elimination</measure>
    <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Typical and atypical GERD symptom elimination in GERD Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL). HRQL questionnaire measures typical GERD symptoms, scale 0-5 for each of 9 questions; scores considered normalized if every score is 0), GERD Symptom Score (GERSS measures atypical GERD symptoms, scale 0-3 for severity and 0-4 for frequency, with total scale 0-60; patients with controlled reflux symptoms are expected to have a score of &lt;18) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI measures atypical laryngopharyngeal (LPR) symptoms, scale 0-5 for each of 9 questions with maximum of 45 with a normality threshold of &lt; or = 13) questionnaires) at the follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) &amp; Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The treatment will be considered safe if the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) is below the ranges reported for laparoscopic fundoplication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Complete Elimination of Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) Use</measure>
    <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients reporting complete discontinuation of daily PPI use will be considered clinically significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Healing of Reflux Esophagitis</measure>
    <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>One LA grade reduction will be considered clinically significant. LA grades are A, B, C, D, with A being the least severe esophagitis. No grade assigned is considered &quot;normal&quot;, i.e. no esophagitis reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Whose Baseline Hiatal Hernia Has Remained Reduced at Post-TIF Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement obtained by study investigator, under endoscopic visualization using cm markings on the endoscope. Outcome measure assesses if hiatal hernia that was present at baseline and reduced (size reduction to &lt; 1 cm is considered clinically significant) during TIF procedure, has remained reduced at the post-TIF follow up exam.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Normalization or Clinically Significant Improvement in Esophageal Acid Exposure Assessed by Impedance/pH Testing and Reflux Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Esophageal acid exposure will be measured objectively by 48-hour Bravo Potential of Hydrogen (pH) or 24-hour impedance/pH testing at the follow-up (where pH testing is available). Normalization of esophageal acid exposure will be defined by total time pH&lt; 4 for ≤ 6% of 24-hour or for ≤ 5.3% of 48-hour monitoring period. The number of reflux episodes of ≤ 44 per each 24-hour period will be considered normal.</description>

          <description>LA grading of esophagitis is an A, B, C, D system, where A is the least severe esophagitis and D is the most severe. LA grade D is an exclusion for this protocol. Normal or no esophagitis reported, will have no grade listed. LA grading is a subjective measure made using an endoscope to visualize the gastroesophageal junction to assess for esophagitis based on the LA grade criteria. An improvement of one grade post-TIF is considered a success, e.g., from grade B to grade A, or grade A to no grade (normal), etc.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Whose Baseline Hiatal Hernia Has Remained Reduced at Post-TIF Follow-up</title>
        <description>Measurement obtained by study investigator, under endoscopic visualization using cm markings on the endoscope. Outcome measure assesses if hiatal hernia that was present at baseline and reduced (size reduction to &lt; 1 cm is considered clinically significant) during TIF procedure, has remained reduced at the post-TIF follow up exam.</description>
        <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
        <population>53 patients were assessed for esophagitis and presence of hiatal hernia at follow-up. Hiatal hernia was present at baseline and reduced during TIF procedure in 34 of the patients examined at follow-up. Hiatal hernia in 33 of 34 remained reduced at follow-up. Please note: there was one new case of hiatal hernia reported that had not been present at baseline.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Normalization or Clinically Significant Improvement in Esophageal Acid Exposure Assessed by Impedance/pH Testing and Reflux Episodes</title>
        <description>Esophageal acid exposure will be measured objectively by 48-hour Bravo Potential of Hydrogen (pH) or 24-hour impedance/pH testing at the follow-up (where pH testing is available). Normalization of esophageal acid exposure will be defined by total time pH&lt; 4 for ≤ 6% of 24-hour or for ≤ 5.3% of 48-hour monitoring period. The number of reflux episodes of ≤ 44 per each 24-hour period will be considered normal.</description>
        <time_frame>median 7 months (range 5-17 months)</time_frame>
        <population>Note: neither 48-hour Bravo pH nor 24-hour impedance/pH testing was completed. pH testing was unavailable at the study sites. Study protocol noted that testing would be completed &quot;if available&quot;. In the absence of these testing tools, sites relied on detailed history, physical signs, symptom evaluation, barium swallow, and repeated esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy to make diagnosis. This continues to be the most commonly used method of GERD diagnosis among community physicians.</population>

      <time_frame>This is a retrospective study. TIF procedures were performed from November 2008 through December 2009. The study enrolled patients and collected post-TIF follow up visits in 2010. Adverse event data was collected from day of TIF procedure through final follow-up visit.</time_frame>
      <desc>There was an intra-op event described in the study publication, but because the TIF procedure could not be completed due to an intra-op hematoma, patient did not sign consent or start this retrospective study. This is not included as a study-related adverse event.</desc>
