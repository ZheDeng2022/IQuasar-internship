      Background: Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria provide the&#xD;
      possibility of a parasite-based diagnosis in areas where good quality microscopy can not be&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. falciparum tests targeting the histidine-rich protein (HRP2) antigen are generally more&#xD;
      sensitive than tests targeting the Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen. However,&#xD;
      as the HRP2 antigen is eliminated from the bloodstream more slowly than the pLDH antigen,&#xD;
      HRP2-based tests can give a positive result two weeks or more after the patient has taken an&#xD;
      effective treatment, while pLDH tests generally turn negative a few days after. The use of an&#xD;
      RDT positive result in a routine patient care is therefore challenged by the interpretation&#xD;
      of whether the result is due to a lasting effect of the already treated infection or to a new&#xD;
      infection. The interpretation might also be affected by the level of malaria transmission in&#xD;
      the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of positive tests in&#xD;
      patients successfully treated for malaria (smear negative) at different time points in time&#xD;
      after treatment, for three rapid diagnostic tests: SD Bioline Malaria Antigen P.f. (catalogue&#xD;
      number: 05FK50-02-4), CareStart Malaria HRP2 (Pf) (catalogue number: G0141) and CareStart&#xD;
      Malaria pLDH (PAN) (catalogue number: G0111). The study will be carried out in two settings&#xD;
      with known low and high malaria transmission levels in order to provide guidance of&#xD;
      interpretation of a RDT positive result depending on the intensity of malaria transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the malaria rapid&#xD;
      tests compared to smear microscopy, to estimate the median time to become negative for each&#xD;
      of the tests and to estimate the proportion of positive tests and the median time to become&#xD;
      negative according to the initial parasitaemia and the presence of gametocytes.&#xD;

      The study population will be patients under 5 years of age who attend the consultation&#xD;
      service of one health centre of Mbarara municipality (low transmission setting) and one&#xD;
      health centre in Kazo sub-county (high transmission setting) and for whom the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of malaria is confirmed by smear microscopy and with at least one positive RDT.&#xD;
      Patients with general signs of danger of severe malaria or who took a full course of&#xD;
      antimalarial treatment in the previous 2 weeks will be excluded. Written consent will be&#xD;
      sought from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 212 patients will be included in each setting. The sample size was based of a&#xD;
      minimum accuracy of 8% around a proportion of 50% positive RDTs to which a 15% was added for&#xD;
      patients who will not be positive for all RDTs or will be secondarily excluded from the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-day artemether-lumefantrine will be given to enrolled cases and treatment intake will&#xD;
      be supervised. RDTs and a blood smear microscopy will be repeated at day 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21,&#xD;
      28, 35 and 42 after inclusion until all RDTs become negative. Follow-up will not last longer&#xD;
      than 42 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion and 95% confidence intervals of positive tests among patients with a negative&#xD;
      thick smear will be calculated for each day of follow-up. Moreover the investigators will&#xD;
      identify for each test a regression model to estimate the number of days required to obtain a&#xD;
      50, 25, 10 and 5% probability of having a false positive RDT result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values will be estimated for each&#xD;
      RDT independently using the result of microscopy as a reference. The analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using the day 0 results for all patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
