      This is a multi-center, single arm, open-label, prospective IIS study, which will enroll 40&#xD;
      recurrent MCL patients.The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bortezomib,&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide treatment and also analyze the relationship between NF-kB&#xD;
      activity and efficacy of bortezomib treatment and whether NF-kB activity can predict MCL&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, single arm, open-label, prospective IIS study, which will enroll 40&#xD;
      recurrent MCL patients.The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bortezomib,&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide treatment and also analyze the relationship between NF-kB&#xD;
      activity and efficacy of bortezomib treatment and whether NF-kB activity can predict MCL&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of three phases: screening/baseline phase, treatment phase and follow-up&#xD;
      phase after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening/baseline phase, investigators obtain informed consent form, check the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and then collect the following data: demographics, medical&#xD;
      history data, vital signs, ECG, MRI/CT/B-ultrasound/X-ray examinations, physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory examinations, pregnancy test (only female) and bone marrow biopsy and aspiration.&#xD;
      Pathological diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma should be established by lymph node biopsy or&#xD;
      other tumor histopathological examination and immunophenotyping. At the same time,&#xD;
      ECOG-performance status, Fact/GOG-Ntx questionnaire and NF-κB activity will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment period, patients will be treated with bortezomib, fludarabine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in a 28-day cycle. Patients achieve complete response (CR) or partial&#xD;
      response (PR) can receive up to six cycles of VF (C) treatment, while those continue stable&#xD;
      disease (SD) will be stopped after 4-cycle treatment and those with progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      will also be stopped after 2-cycle treatment. Due to adverse events, patients may receive&#xD;
      reductions or deviate from the intended dose and duration of VF (C) treatment. These&#xD;
      adjustments must be in accordance with the regulations in the protocol about the dose and&#xD;
      time adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cyclophosphamide will be determined in accordance with the&#xD;
      standard &quot;3+3&quot; method, testing three dose levels, 150mg/m2, 200mg/m2 and 250mg/m2.&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide dose escalation test will be conducted in the first cycle, with every three&#xD;
      patients in a group. Patients' enrollment will be competed among different sites, but further&#xD;
      step should be taken only after the 3 patients in one group complete the first cycle, their&#xD;
      efficacy and safety have been completely evaluated, and the notification of going to next&#xD;
      step by a CRO company. Subjects involved in the cyclophosphamide dose escalation test will&#xD;
      continue initial cyclophosphamide dose during the entire study, except for possible dose&#xD;
      adjustment determined by investigators due to DLT. After ascertaining MTD, new patients will&#xD;
      be administrated with cyclophosphamide at the MTD. According to the dose escalation diagram,&#xD;
      up to 18 patients will be involved in dose escalation phase. Subjects who discontinue the&#xD;
      treatment due to causes other than DLT in the first cycle should be replaced by new&#xD;
      participants to enter dose escalation test. DLT is defined as: a grade 4 neutropenia lasting&#xD;
      longer than 7 days, a grade 4 thrombocytopenia, a neutropenic fever, or a grade 3 or above&#xD;
      non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea, vomiting and alopecia); a grade 3 or above&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting or diarrhea is considered as DLT only if still observed after treatment.&#xD;
      Please refer to dose escalation diagram to conduct dose escalation trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed up for 24 weeks after the end of chemotherapy. In this study, the&#xD;
      primary efficacy endpoints are maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      combination treatment with bortezomib and fludarabine, complete response rate (CR + CRu),&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR). Main indicators will be evaluated every 2 cycles in the&#xD;
      treatment period and every 12 weeks in follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medications within 2 week before enrollment and during the study process need to&#xD;
      be documented. All adverse events will be reported from the time a signed and dated informed&#xD;
      consent form is obtained until 30 days following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <description>The International Working Group (IWG) published the guidelines for response criteria for lymphoma in 1999. These response criteria are based on the reduction in the size of the enlarged lymph node as measured by CT scan and the extent of bone marrow involvement that is determined by bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.</description>
