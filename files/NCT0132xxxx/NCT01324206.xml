      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies provide important information on the structure and&#xD;
      function of various body systems, including the brain, muscles, joints, heart, and blood&#xD;
      vessels. Scientific applications of MRI scans often use techniques that need to be modified&#xD;
      or refined before they are used in clinical studies. To develop and modify these techniques&#xD;
      for the new Philips 3T Achieva whole-body MRI scanner, researchers are interested in&#xD;
      conducting trial MRI scans on healthy individuals and individuals with conditions that&#xD;
      require imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To conduct preliminary trials of the 3T MRI facility to develop and refine MRI scanning&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are able to have magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, as&#xD;
           well as blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an MRI scan using the 3T scanner. Some scans may require the use&#xD;
           of a contrast agent or radiotracer, which is a small amount of radioactive substance&#xD;
           that will be injected before the start of the scan. Some participants may be asked to&#xD;
           perform tasks of thinking and movement while in the scanner, in order to test the&#xD;
           procedures required for a functional MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies yield important information on the structure and&#xD;
      function of various body systems including the brain, muscles, joints, heart, blood vessels&#xD;
      and other body areas. Unlike clinical MRI imaging, scientific applications often utilize&#xD;
      techniques that either requires de-novo development or modification of existing research or&#xD;
      commercially available protocols before implementation in clinical studies. The proposed&#xD;
      protocol is intended to allow MRI scanning on human subjects for the development and&#xD;
      refinement of MRI scanning procedures before implementation in larger scale clinical National&#xD;
      Institute on Aging (NIA) research studies. We will evaluate a variety of MRI pulse sequences&#xD;
      on normal volunteers and individuals with a variety of medical conditions to determine&#xD;
      optimal protocols for use in normal volunteers and patient populations. In addition,&#xD;
      participants can be recruited and scanned to provide additional data for already approved NIA&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
