      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are investigating the use of DNA vaccines to treat various types of cancer by&#xD;
      provoking an immune system response to tumor cells. DNA vaccines mimic the effect of normal&#xD;
      vaccines given to prevent infectious diseases, but they have been less effective than&#xD;
      anticipated in humans. To improve the effectiveness of DNA vaccines, researchers are studying&#xD;
      alternate delivery methods, such as the investigational Derma Vax(Trademark) injection system&#xD;
      that delivers the vaccine into the skin. However, because the Derma Vax(Trademark) system has&#xD;
      not been studied in humans, more research is needed to determine whether this new vaccine&#xD;
      delivery method is safe and tolerable, particularly in terms of pain levels and skin&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and relative pain levels of intradermal&#xD;
      electroporation using Derma Vax(Trademark) administered after pretreatment with either a&#xD;
      topical cream anesthetic or placebo cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and&#xD;
           urine tests, and an electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two different creams applied to their upper arms: one cream will&#xD;
           be an anesthetic (lidocaine and prilocaine) and the other will be a placebo lotion. Each&#xD;
           arm will receive a different cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the cream has taken effect, participants will receive Derma Vax(Trademark)&#xD;
           treatment. No actual medication will be given during the injection; participants will&#xD;
           evaluate their reaction based on the pressure and needle stick alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately after the treatment, participants will use the Visual Analogue Scale of pain&#xD;
           intensity to provide a description of the level of pain experienced during the&#xD;
           injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete additional questionnaires about pain intensity and will have&#xD;
           the injected skin site inspected to determine possible reactions to the injection. They&#xD;
           will also be asked their opinions on whether (based on pain levels) a series of Derma&#xD;
           Vax(Trademark) treatments would be acceptable for treatment of a serious illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day after the injection, participants will return for an additional skin assessment&#xD;
           of the treated areas.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objectives are: to assess safety and tolerability of Intradermal electroporation&#xD;
      (IDEP) using Derma Vax(Trademark) administered after pretreatment with either EMLA(Registered&#xD;
      Trademark) cream as topical anesthetic or with placebo and to determine if the&#xD;
      EMLA(Registered Trademark) cream applied to the electroporation site significantly decreases&#xD;
      pain associated with the IDEP procedure. Our secondary objectives are: to determine the&#xD;
      magnitude of pain perception of IDEP; to determine the quality of pain perception during IDEP&#xD;
      using a Visual Analog Scale and the McGill pain scale; to determine the time course after&#xD;
      IDEP of Pain rating and skin irritation and to determine variations in skin resistance with&#xD;
      and without EMLA(Registered Trademark) cream and between participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve healthy men or women will be recruited for this study. This is a randomized&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a medical device. Each subject will receive&#xD;
      EMLA(Registered Trademark) cream or control cream placed on the electroporation site on each&#xD;
      deltoid area in a blinded randomized manner. This will be followed by IDEP administration to&#xD;
      each pre-treated deltoid area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA vaccines are a promising treatment for infectious diseases and cancer. The ideal delivery&#xD;
      method for induction of cellular and humoral immune responses has not been defined.&#xD;
      Information from this study is necessary for future studies using Derma Vax(Trademark) in&#xD;
      therapeutic DNA vaccine studies. Derma Vax(Trademark) is unique in its proprieties of&#xD;
      delivering a series of electric pulses that provoke DNA uptake by antigen presenting cells&#xD;
      that reside in the dermal layer of the skin. We expect that the application of Intradermal&#xD;
      Electroporation (IDEP) using Derma Vax(Trademark) will be well tolerated and the use of&#xD;
      EMLA(Registered Trademark) cream will decrease the pain compared to placebo.&#xD;
