    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm Phase II study of induction chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      concurrent chemo-radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      cancer (HNSCC) using monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Those patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      HNSCC deemed to be candidates for definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy will be treated&#xD;
      initially with 6 weeks of PCC (Paclitaxel, cetuximab and Carboplatin). This will be followed&#xD;
      by a week of no treatment for interim evaluation, followed by definitive concurrent&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy using 70Gy radiation with weekly cetuximab and cisplatin for 7 weeks. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that the use of cetuximab during induction chemotherapy followed&#xD;
      by cetuximab concurrent with chemoradiotherapy using low dose weekly cisplatin will improve&#xD;
      local control as well as distant spread.&#xD;

      Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy would be used in two phases. In the initial phase all patients would be treated&#xD;
      with ICT involving 6 cycles of PCC. This involves Cetuximab 400mg/m2 Week 1 and then 250mg/m2&#xD;
      weekly, Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly and carboplatin AUC 2 weekly for 6 weeks followed by&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cetuximab. After ICT patients would be given weekly&#xD;
      Cisplatin at 30mg/m2 and cetuximab at 250mg/m2 concurrent with radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically for tumors treated by megavoltage (6MV) radiotherapy alone or with chemotherapy,&#xD;
      the primary tumor bed with an adequate margin and the draining lymphatics will be treated&#xD;
      with parallel opposed lateral treatment portals; the lower neck node bearing area will be&#xD;
      treated through an anterior port. The standard total dose for the targeted tumor bed and&#xD;
      electively treated lymphatics is 50 Gy/25 fractions, and then, an additional boost dose to&#xD;
      the neoplasm-bearing site(s) of 16 Gy to 20 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total dose received by the spinal cord should not be allowed to exceed 46 Gy. For N1 to&#xD;
      N3 disease, they also shall need a total dose (boost included) of 66 Gy and perhaps up to 70&#xD;
      Gy if it can be safely given 6.4 Study Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who are deemed eligible and sign informed consent would be enrolled in the&#xD;
           clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior to starting therapy staging PET/CT scan, medical history, physical exam,&#xD;
           hematologic and biochemical testing will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Since mucositis and oropharyngeal dysfunction is very likely with chemo-radiation PEG&#xD;
           tube placements will be considered prior to treatment, in order to allow adequate&#xD;
           nutrition in case of mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prior to starting radiation patients would undergo dental evaluation which is a standard&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients would then undergo 6 weeks of ICT using PCC. Based on toxicity dose would be&#xD;
           modified as described in section 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. For PCC regimen, cetuxmiab would be given first followed by paclitaxel and then&#xD;
           carboplatin using standard pre-medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A CT scan (no PET scan) of the head and neck will be performed during the evaluation&#xD;
           Week 7 on any day of that week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Following induction chemotherapy patients would be treated with radiation therapy of up&#xD;
           to 70 Gy concurrent with weekly Cisplatin at 30mg/m2 and cetuximab at 250mg/m2 for the&#xD;
           duration of radiation therapy. Again dose modifications would be performed based as&#xD;
           described in section 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Cetuximab would be administered first followed by cisplatin concurrent with radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. History and Physical examination would be performed at the end of treatment to document&#xD;
           response and assess toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Patient with residual disease at the primary site or neck after completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy would be offered surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Week 26 (3 months) after completion of radiation therapy a repeat PET scan will be&#xD;
      performed to assess response which is standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. After completion of all treatment patients will be followed at every 3 months interval to&#xD;
      document relapse or manage toxicities from treatment.&#xD;
