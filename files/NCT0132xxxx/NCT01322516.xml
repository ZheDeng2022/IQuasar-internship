  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to follow a cohort of pregnant and post-partum Canadian women through the fall and&#xD;
      winter of 2009/2010 and the anticipated second and third waves of the current pandemic in&#xD;
      order to better understand the incidence, complications and risk factors for severe disease&#xD;
      due to H1N1 influenza in pregnant women, and to contribute data on the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of antivirals and vaccines in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) pandemic influenza infection in the second and third trimester of pregnancy is associated&#xD;
      with an increase in adverse fetal outcomes (fetal loss, stillbirth, neonatal mortality,&#xD;
      significant neonatal morbidity, prematurity) (ii) close contact with young children (&lt;2 yrs)&#xD;
      at home or work is the most important risk factor for influenza in pregnant women (iii)&#xD;
      higher scores on a scale of community infection prevention (a combination of self-reported&#xD;
      hand hygiene adherence, avoidance of ill persons and avoidance of crowds) are protective&#xD;
      against influenza (iv) receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine from 2007 to 2009 will increase&#xD;
      the risk of illness due to influenza A(H1N1)v in the second and third waves of the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) pandemic influenza vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic influenza in pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) vaccination of pregnant women against a particular strain of influenza protects their&#xD;
      infants against influenza infection in the first six months of life.&#xD;

      Subjects will be consented to participate in the study. They will complete a web-based&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire. Participants will be given a nasal swab kit with instructions for&#xD;
      obtaining swabs. Baseline blood (10mls) will be drawn for influenza serology and for&#xD;
      measurement of total IgG and IgG subtypes. An email will be sent to each participant within&#xD;
      24 hours of their enrolment to welcome them to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a weekly diary using web-based data entry. An email&#xD;
      will be sent to each participant every Monday during the study reminding the participant to&#xD;
      complete their weekly diary and to report and submit a nasal swab if they have any symptoms&#xD;
      of an acute respiratory illness. Reminder emails will be sent 48 hours later if the weekly&#xD;
      form remains incomplete. Participants will be telephoned if forms remain incomplete for three&#xD;
      weeks. Weekly emails will also be used to update participants about vaccine availability,&#xD;
      current vaccine recommendations, and any changes in expert recommendations for pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once every four weeks additional questions will be asked on the weekly survey. If any&#xD;
      participant develops symptoms compatible with an acute viral respiratory illness they will be&#xD;
      asked to collect and submit a nasal swab as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms and&#xD;
      to complete an illness starting the day of symptom onset and ending when all symptoms are&#xD;
      either absent or mild, or for 3 days, whichever is longer. Subjects will be notified if&#xD;
      results are positive for influenza along with the local Medical Officer of Health. Treatment&#xD;
      for influenza will be discussed with each infected participant by a physician investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat serology and blood for total IgG and IgG subtype will be drawn at the time of delivery&#xD;
      to the six week post partum. Women will notify the study when they are admitted for delivery&#xD;
      or termination of pregnancy and will be interviewed either in person at the hospital, or over&#xD;
      the telephone within 3 weeks of delivery. A chart review will be performed to identify any&#xD;
      complications at delivery or termination, and to record neonatal outcomes. Post-partum,&#xD;
      mothers will continue their own weekly and illness diaries and weekly diaries for their&#xD;
      infants will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women requiring hospital admission for influenza in hospitals participating in&#xD;
      surveillance for the Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network (TIBDN) and Serious Outcomes&#xD;
      Surveillance (SOS) for the PHAC/CIHR Influenza Research Network (PCIRN), as well as pregnant&#xD;
      women with influenza admitted to intensive care units as part of the Canadian Critical Care&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Group Influenza Surveillance System (ICU-Flu) will be approached. Risk factor&#xD;
      data from the baseline and weekly questionnaires will be collected retrospectively from these&#xD;
      women. With consent, women will be followed to delivery/termination, and the same information&#xD;
      collected regarding neonatal outcomes as was collected for other women in the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An email will be sent to all participating women requesting their consideration of three&#xD;
      additional parts of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A questionnaire of development (the 8 month Ages and Stages® Questionnaire; see&#xD;
           attached) to be completed by the parent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An assessment with a physical examination at 7-9 months of age by a trained physician or&#xD;
           a nurse practitioner&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Permission for the study to contact parents in the future about further follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will also be asked to book an appointment for the 7-9 month assessment. Mothers who&#xD;
      do not wish to have a pediatrician assessment will be asked over the telephone if they have&#xD;
      any questions they wish to have answered about the study or the Ages and Stages®&#xD;
      questionnaire, and if they consent to contact for future long term follow-up studies. If the&#xD;
      child's score on the Ages and Stages® questionnaire raises a concern, mothers will be offered&#xD;
      the chance to discuss this with a study physician, to have the results shared with her&#xD;
      child's physician and/or to be referred to a pediatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may choose to withdraw from the study at any time. When they do so, they will be&#xD;
      asked if the data and blood samples that have been provided can be kept and used for study&#xD;
      purposes. If a patient withdraws and cannot be contacted data that has been obtained will be&#xD;
      retained, and blood will be used for the immediate study purpose, but will not be used for&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;

        800 pregnant women followed through pregnancy during second and third waves of the 2009&#xD;
        influenza pandemic, and 2009/10 influenza season. Forty percent are high risk pregnancies:&#xD;
        either for maternal influenza complications (eg. underlying asthma, gestational diabetes&#xD;
        mellitus in prior pregnancies) or high risk for obstetrical complications (eg. prior&#xD;
        premature birth, multiple pregnancies). Recruitment from Halifax, Quebec City, Toronto,&#xD;
        Hamilton, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. Plan to enroll all women before the beginning&#xD;
        of the second wave; however, enrolment of women &lt;20 weeks pregnant will continue at each&#xD;
        site until the second wave has peaked locally.&#xD;
