  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical experience in Japan with GSK1120212, a novel MEK inhibitor. This&#xD;
      study is designed to identify recommended doses and regimens in Japanese subjects for the&#xD;
      future development of GSK1120212.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK1120212 has demonstrated anti-proliferative activity against a broad range of tumors cell&#xD;
      lines and xenograft models. To date, MEK inhibitors have demonstrated evidence of both&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic and clinical activity in early trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first clinical experience in Japan with GSK1120212, a novel MEK inhibitor. This&#xD;
      study is designed to identify recommended doses and regimens in Japanese subjects for the&#xD;
      future development of GSK1120212.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in subject with solid tumors, and GSK1120212 single agent&#xD;
      treatment to assess safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy (Part 1) and combination treatment&#xD;
      with gemcitabine in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary&#xD;
      cancer, urothelial cancer or other tumor types for which gemcitabine has been approved in&#xD;
      4-week schedule to assess safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy(Part 2) will be conducted in&#xD;
      the same protocol.&#xD;
