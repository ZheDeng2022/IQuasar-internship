      This study is designed to analyze the use of early aggressive pain management with thoracic&#xD;
      epidural in eligible patients with blunt thoracic trauma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due the limited availability of patient population this study requires together with the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria the study demands, this study will employ both a&#xD;
      retrospective chart review process as well as prospective enrollment of qualified patients&#xD;
      who provide consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main groups being evaluated are: (1) eligible patients who received thoracic epidural&#xD;
      within 48 hours of injury and (2) eligible patients who did not receive thoracic epidural&#xD;
      within 48 hours of injury. In both retrospective and prospective approaches, the&#xD;
      investigators will identify patients with blunt thoracic trauma who were eligible for&#xD;
      thoracic epidural placement and received the treatment as well as those patients who were&#xD;
      eligible but did not receive it. Hospital data such as ventilator days, ICU days, hospital&#xD;
      days, hospital charges, and complications, etc. will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective chart review of patients admitted to SFGH suffering from a blunt thoracic&#xD;
      injury resulting in 3 or more rib fractures during a 5year time period from January 1, 2004&#xD;
      through January 1, 2009 will be conducted. Patient charts will be reviewed for pain&#xD;
      management used for blunt thoracic trauma, hospital course, vitals, labs, and outcome&#xD;
      measures. Similar to the prospective enrollment process, the retrospective chart review will&#xD;
      screen for patients who had met the inclusion criteria and had not met any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective patients admitted to SFGH suffering blunt thoracic injury (rib fractures, sternal&#xD;
      fractures) requiring IV opioids for pain relief who do not fit exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be asked to give informed signed consent for the study doctor to&#xD;
      place a thoracic epidural within 48 hours of injury and continued for a maximum of 5 days.&#xD;
      The consent process will be twofold. For those who have consented to receive thoracic&#xD;
      epidural and agreed to have their health information (HIPAA form) used for the study no&#xD;
      additional permission will be required. However, for those patients who do not wish to&#xD;
      receive epidural, consent will still be sought if their health information can be used to&#xD;
      analyze that arm of the study that did not receive thoracic epidural.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data such as vitals, labs and outcome measures will be recorded and analyzed. The&#xD;
      data gathered both in the retrospective and prospective analyses will be used to assess&#xD;
      utilization rate of thoracic epidural, and to determine if the use of thoracic epidural is&#xD;
      associated with lower resource utilization and is cost effective. In both the retrospective&#xD;
      chart review and prospective enrollment process, subjective pain, improved pulmonary&#xD;
      function, amount of analgesia and overall clinical outcomes will be measured to determine if&#xD;
      patients who received epidural catheters have significantly improved clinical outcomes than&#xD;
      those patients who did not receive epidural catheter.&#xD;
