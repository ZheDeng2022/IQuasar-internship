    <textblock>
      Using the traditional and hitherto used uncemented hip prostheses achieved good clinical&#xD;
      results, but one of the drawbacks is the risk of fracture in the femoral shaft in indbankning&#xD;
      of the prosthesis (1-2%). In addition, the bone scan demonstrated that in the years after&#xD;
      surgery dropped almost 30% of bone mass in the femoral shaft. This bone loss increases the&#xD;
      risk that in the years after surgery, the increased risk of fractures around the prosthesis&#xD;
      and in addition to impeding the described bone replacement prosthesis later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newly developed prosthesis is anchored in the femoral neck and thus not involve the&#xD;
      femoral shaft. This ensures a more physiological or normal weight transfer to the femur bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This contributes to bone mass in long large extent preserved in the years after surgery, so&#xD;
      you have a better opportunity later to make a new prosthesis surgery with good results. The&#xD;
      new prosthesis should be capable of simultaneously reducing the incidence of thigh pain in&#xD;
      the first year after surgery.'&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By insertion of artificial hip joints in young and middle aged are often used so-called&#xD;
      uncemented technique in which the prosthesis is fixed to the bone without the use of bone&#xD;
      cement. Anchoring happens when the bone cells grow into the prosthesis porous surface,&#xD;
      thereby creating a stable anchorage of the prosthesis, both short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hip prosthesis consists of 3 main elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. socket&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ball&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. femoral component, which hold ball. Femoral component is anchored to the upper end of&#xD;
           the femur including the upper 12-15 cm of the marrow cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieved good results with this principle. The method involves a risk of fracture at the top&#xD;
      end of the femur bone during and after insertion of the prosthesis, but also that there is&#xD;
      some bone loss in the year after surgery. Finally there is a 3-10% chance that you get thigh&#xD;
      pain due to different elasticity of the femur and the long shank prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the foregoing disadvantages of the femoral components, which are commonly used, has&#xD;
      for years been experimenting with the introduction of shorter implants, which are either&#xD;
      anchored in the femoral neck or femoral neck combined with the very top end of the femur bone&#xD;
      (metaphysis). By using such a prosthesis, it is proven to preserve the bone in the upper&#xD;
      femur forward and avoids the disadvantage in terms of the above described femoral pain. There&#xD;
      is also described problems by using these short prostheses, especially in the form of&#xD;
      solution, and pain secondary to anchor bolts in the upper femur forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Orthopaedic Surgery, Region Nordjylland, one has in the period 1999 to 2003 33 such&#xD;
      prostheses implanted at clinics in Farsø and Frederikshavn and achieved good results apart&#xD;
      from pain similar to the above anchoring screws. At follow-up of these prostheses, using DEXA&#xD;
      scans, the investigators have shown that prosthesis, bone-saving, since bone mass at the&#xD;
      femoral neck and the very top end of the femur bone is preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From our experience with the aforementioned short prosthesis, the investigators have joined&#xD;
      with Biomechanical Institute, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, London and firm&#xD;
      Biomet developed a modern design of the above. This is a short prosthesis that is anchored in&#xD;
      the femoral neck and the upper end of the femur (metaphysis). Prosthesis made of titanium&#xD;
      with a porous surface (Bonemaster ®). The prosthesis is anchored during surgery by&#xD;
      pressure-fit (press-fit) and in a few weeks the bone grows into the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosthesis manufactured in 5 sizes and design of the prosthesis is aligned with a series of&#xD;
      CT scans of the femur was carried out at Stanmore in London. Has developed instruments to&#xD;
      ensure a uniform instrumentation and minimizing the risk of fractures in connection with the&#xD;
      operation. Performed a series of laboratory tests and these tests, the prosthesis was found&#xD;
      to be completely stable and even full load stable and the risk of fracture related to&#xD;
      prosthesis insertion is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study intends to examine whether that can be achieved equally good clinical&#xD;
      results as with the conventional uncemented femoral component and bone mass in the upper end&#xD;
      of the femur bone is preserved. Using a specific X-ray analysis (RSA) also assessed the&#xD;
      stability between the prosthesis and bone. Both DEXA scan as RSA studies have routine&#xD;
      examinations by Orthopaedic Surgery, Region Nordjylland, Klinik Farsø.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned surgery 50 young men and women with primary or secondary osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      hip joint. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and not subject to exclusion criteria&#xD;
      received oral and written information about the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accept the patient to cooperate with the investigation confirmed that the patient's signature&#xD;
      approx. 2 weeks after oral and written information is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation is performed after the usual principles with rear access to the hip joint,&#xD;
      removal of rod ends and the insertion of an uncemented socket. After preparing the femoral&#xD;
      neck and top of thigh to the insertion of the short femur prosthesis and make selection using&#xD;
      tantalumkugler for RSA analysis. When the prosthesis is inserted carried out sample-space&#xD;
      theorem and using a 36 mm Co-Cr-ball, which is currently the department's practices. After&#xD;
      surgery the patient allowed partial load the first 6 weeks. There is an ongoing clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic controls and registration of unforeseen events arising from the use of the&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the flow after 2 years are fully comparable clinical outcomes, minimal migration as&#xD;
      measured by RSA and final preservation of the bone around the implant, then the use of the&#xD;
      implant extends to several clinics at home and abroad, as per the recommendations of the&#xD;
      Danish Orthopaedic Association reference program for hip replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When implementing any new implant designs is a lower risk of unforeseen complications in the&#xD;
      form of fracture encountered in denture-deployment and subsequent unexpected prosthetic&#xD;
      solution. If the burst occurs Intraoperative, you can convert to the deployment of&#xD;
      conventional hip prosthesis without involving major risks for the patient. Early prosthetic&#xD;
      solution is also possible deployment of conventional complete dentures without result&#xD;
      deteriorates. The disadvantages of the possible complications are in the worst case of&#xD;
      operation (revision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the disadvantages of trial participation increased radiation dose due to 4&#xD;
      additional X-ray checks in the first 2 years after surgery and 4 extra bone scans (DEXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The described investigation will clarify whether the theoretical advantages that have&#xD;
      hitherto been demonstrated by clinical and biomechanical study (normal weight transfer, bone&#xD;
      sparing and bone-keeping in the short and long term), also obtained by applying the newly&#xD;
      developed prosthetic component. If so, there will then be able to especially younger patients&#xD;
      with osteoarthritis of the hip joints better chance of achieving good clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      long-term sustainability by eventual replacement surgery, typically 10-20 years after primary&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disadvantages of the described study estimated minimal compared to the benefits that a large&#xD;
      group of patients could benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;

      UK Ltd.. and Orthopaedic Surgery, North Jutland and the amount transferred to specific&#xD;
      research account affiliated research unit of Orthopaedic Surgery, Region Nordjylland and paid&#xD;
