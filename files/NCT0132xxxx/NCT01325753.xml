  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of cryotherapy (cryoablation [CA]) in&#xD;
      treating patients with lung cancer. Cryotherapy kills cancer cells by freezing them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the initial safety of the CA for lung tumors less than or equal to 3.5 cm in size&#xD;
      including acute toxicity (30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess physical function for this cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the impact of treatment on generic and disease-specific quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To obtain pilot data useful for the design of a subsequent phase II or randomized phase&#xD;
      II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate changes in pulmonary function at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo computed tomography (CT)-guided CA&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24,&#xD;
      36, 48, and 60 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition metastatic&#xD;
             carcinoma or sarcoma involving the lungs or pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic diagnosis of stage 4 cancer prior to enrollment by biopsy or on imaging&#xD;
             with known (biopsied) primary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion is determined (by CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] images) to&#xD;
             be in a location where cryoablation is technically achievable based on the proximity&#xD;
             of adjacent organs and structures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximum number of lesions per patient will be 5 total (a maximum of 3 on either the&#xD;
             right or left side and 2 lesions on the respective contralateral side)&#xD;
&#xD;

             radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation, such that all known active pulmonary disease&#xD;
             is planned to be treated with a definitive local therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients are required to have been evaluated either in consultation with a&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000 within 21 days prior to study registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A signed study specific consent form is required&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, nursing or wishes to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude giving informed&#xD;
             consent or receiving optimal treatment or follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
