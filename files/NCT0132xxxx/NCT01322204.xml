    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the absorption and bioavailability of codeine in&#xD;
      relation to postnatal (PNA) and postconceptional (PCA) age; determine the parent drug&#xD;
      (codeine), its active metabolites, their formation rates and their ratios in relation with&#xD;
      PCA and PNA; and identify relevant genetic polymorphisms of opioid metabolism in the study&#xD;
      population and their potential relationship to the biodisposition and pharmacodynamic effects&#xD;
      of codeine. The study population is intubated and mechanically ventilated infants equal to or&#xD;
      greater than 26 weeks gestational age at birth and less than 4 weeks postnatal age.&#xD;

      This proposal has its origins in a larger initiative to elucidate the pharmacological basis&#xD;
      for the interindividual differences observed in opioid responsiveness. Gaps in our knowledge&#xD;
      related to opioid disposition in newborns need to be addressed to complete the design of the&#xD;
      required overarching initiative in which age could be treated as a continuous variable within&#xD;
      a context of PK, PD and PG determinants.This proposal is designed to generate preliminary&#xD;
      data that addresses two issues. First, can newborns absorb enterally administered codeine and&#xD;
      is this ability determined by PCA or PNA age? The second relates to the ability of newborn&#xD;
      infants to catalyze those reactions required to metabolically activate both codeine and&#xD;
      morphine. The latter will also be evaluated within the context of PCA versus PNA age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will not only fill an information gap that must be addressed before the larger&#xD;
      initiative moves forward, but they also provide a platform for serious study of the ontogeny&#xD;
      of certain pharmacokinetic processes that may prove critical to our understanding of newborn&#xD;
      drug disposition. In this way, codeine can provide important insights concerning the ontogeny&#xD;
      of drug disposition and permit the determination of the relative importance of PCA versus PNA&#xD;
      ages to the functional expression of these processes.&#xD;
