  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study explores the incretin effect; a central mechanism of sugar metabolism.&#xD;
      People with type 2 diabetes have a markedly reduced incretin effect, while the incretin&#xD;
      effect never has been studied in patients with severe chronic renal failure. Non-diabetic&#xD;
      patients with severe kidney failure and patients with diabetes and normal kidney function&#xD;
      share several pathophysiological traits, including decreased sensitivity to insulin, fasting&#xD;
      hyperinsulinaemia and impaired beta cell function. The investigators expect the incretin&#xD;
      effect to be affected in patients with chronic renal failure without diabetes, which in time&#xD;
      can result in therapeutic changes in this group of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel and original aspect of this investigator initiated study is the focus on incretin&#xD;
      (patho)physiology in an uraemic milieu. In this first of 5 substudies (separate notification&#xD;
      and registration) the investigators explore the incretin effect. Our hypothesis is that it is&#xD;
      impaired in non-diabetic patients in chronic dialysis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rapidly increasing worldwide. In&#xD;
      addition to reduced insulin sensitivity and beta cell dysfunction, T2DM is characterized by a&#xD;
      severely impaired incretin effect. The incretin effect refers to the insulinotropic action of&#xD;
      the nutrient-released incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent&#xD;
      insulinotropic peptide (GIP). Both hormones are secreted from intestinal endocrine mucosal&#xD;
      cells. The incretin effect is defined as the difference in insulin secretory responses&#xD;
      between oral and isoglycaemic intravenous (iv) glucose challenges. In healthy individuals it&#xD;
      accounts for as much as 70% of insulin secreted in response to oral glucose, whereas patients&#xD;
      with T2DM exhibit an incretin effect in the range of 0 to 30%. The incretin hormone GLP-1 has&#xD;
      a potent blood glucose-lowering effect in patients with T2DM. However, following secretion of&#xD;
      GLP-1, the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) rapidly cleaves the hormone, by&#xD;
      which it is completely inactivated. This has formed the basis for new pharmacological agents&#xD;
      blocking DPP-4 (DPP-4 inhibitors) or DPP-4 resistant GLP-1 receptor agonists. Long-term&#xD;
      treatment has showed positive effect on glycaemic control and risk factors of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These effects may be applicable also in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) because&#xD;
      patients with T2DM and normal kidney function and non-diabetic patients with ESRD show&#xD;
      several identical characteristics. These include decreased insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      hyperinsulinaemia and impaired beta cell function. The incretin effect has only to a small&#xD;
      extent been investigated in patients with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single most frequent cause of ESRD and need of chronic maintenance dialysis is diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy. In the U.S. more than 50% of patients in dialysis have diabetes compared with&#xD;
      about 23% in Denmark. The life expectancy of dialysis patients with T2DM is severely reduced&#xD;
      with a median survival of 2 to 4 years and there is no treatment documented to significantly&#xD;
      improve this poor prognosis. The most common cause of death in this group of patients is&#xD;
      related to cardiovascular disease that seems to result from death of causes different from&#xD;
      classical atherosclerosis. So far intervention directed towards hypertension, dyslipidaemia&#xD;
      and other classical risk factors have showed divergent and primarily negative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is therefore an unmet medical need to find new treatments to protect these patients&#xD;
      from cardiovascular disease and premature death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the glycaemic control using incretin-based therapies has the potential to meet this&#xD;
      medical need. The incretin hormones and their metabolites are however to a large extent&#xD;
      excreted by the kidneys and this may lead to problems (or benefits!) when administered to&#xD;
      patients without kidney function or with severely reduced kidney function. The present&#xD;
      knowledge about the incretin effect and incretin hormone physiology as well as&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, clinical effects and side effects of GLP-1 analogues in patients with&#xD;
      reduced kidney function is limited and the few studies available are predominantly confined&#xD;
      to patients with only mild or moderately reduced kidney function. The investigators will&#xD;
      explorer basic and pharmacologic aspects in patients with severe reduced kidney function&#xD;
      depending on chronic maintenance dialysis treatment. Before any potential treatment can be&#xD;
      initiated, the investigators need basic information on how the incretin system is affected by&#xD;
      an uraemic milieu. Current and succeeding substudies will provide us with that information.&#xD;
