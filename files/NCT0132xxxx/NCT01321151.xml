    <textblock>
      Sports-related concussions are a serious problem in football, boxing, and other full contact&#xD;
      sports. After experiencing consecutive concussions, there is an increase in neurological&#xD;
      deficits that can lead to long-term cognitive problems (Dementia pugilistica). To combat this&#xD;
      increase in brain damage, novel strategies need to be developed to protect athletes that are&#xD;
      participating in these full contact sports. The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether&#xD;
      resveratrol decreases brain injury and improves brain function after experiencing a&#xD;
      concussion in boxers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 3 million sports-related concussions occur in athletes. Only about&#xD;
      5% of these concussions are treated in the hospital setting. To date, there are no effective&#xD;
      interventions used at decreasing the levels of oxidant injury and inflammation within these&#xD;
      athletes. The standard form of care in these athletes is usually rest and light exercise for&#xD;
      1 -2 weeks, before returning to the sport. Within this brain injury population,&#xD;
      administration of a neuro-protectant agent immediately following the concussion may alleviate&#xD;
      or prevent secondary injury and subsequent development of long-term cognitive deficits such&#xD;
      as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and Dementia pugilistica (DP). Since sports-related&#xD;
      concussions are a serious problem in our youth, by using safe interventions, we believe that&#xD;
      the levels of oxidant injury and brain inflammation will be decreased. In addition, these&#xD;
      neuro-protective agents may improve cognition in these boxers, and decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following brain injury, the secondary injury that immediately follows consists of heightened&#xD;
      damage by oxygen radicals, which in turn damages vital lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.&#xD;
      This damage is exacerbated by highly acidic conditions with lead to the release of iron and&#xD;
      the production of more harmful oxygen radicals. An increase in these oxygen radicals has been&#xD;
      observed from minutes to hours within the primary injury. In addition, there is an increase&#xD;
      in inflammation as well as excitotoxicity in the brain after traumatic injury. To combat this&#xD;
      secondary injury, the use of anti-oxidants in individuals is warranted to decrease the amount&#xD;
      of brain damage and cognitive decline after experiencing a severe brain injury. For example,&#xD;
      resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) which is a polyphenol compound that is commonly found&#xD;
      in grapes, is a nutritional supplement with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties&#xD;
      with great promise for treating TBI secondary injury. A number of researchers have&#xD;
      demonstrated that resveratrol protect multiple organs (heart, kidney, brain) from ischemia&#xD;
      after injury. With respect to the brain, resveratrol has been shown to protect from oxidative&#xD;
      stress, Huntington's disease, and stroke. Additionally, following TBI in various animal&#xD;
      models, resveratrol protected from severe brain injuries. Results from these brain studies&#xD;
      suggest that resveratrol protects from a plethora of injuries and may afford protection from&#xD;
      secondary injury in individuals suffering from a severe brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot clinical trial, boxers (n=30) will be consented to participate in this study&#xD;
      prior to engaging in a boxing match. The concussion history will be collected before&#xD;
      enrolling. Baseline cognitive testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be&#xD;
      performed to obtain both structural and functional data. Only 12 boxers that have a&#xD;
      concussion will be enrolled in this study. After participating in the boxing match, if the&#xD;
      boxer has been diagnosed with having a concussion by the ringside physician, the boxers will&#xD;
      be treated with an oral dose of the active trans-resveratrol (500 mg) or placebo within 2&#xD;
      hours of completion of the boxing match. The boxer will be treated with either resveratrol or&#xD;
      placebo (depending on the randomization schedule) once a day for 30 days. Cognitive testing&#xD;
      and MRI scans will be conducted on day 7 after the concussion.&#xD;

Average correct reaction time of module 4 (Symbol Match) - Provides the number of correct matches out of 27 when the symbol number pairings are visible. The quicker the response time for each correctly identified symbol match indicates a better outcome.&#xD;
Average correct reaction time of module 5 (Color Match) - is number of correct color matches. The quicker the response time to a correct color match is a better outcome.&#xD;
Each modules is measured in percentage correct</description>
