      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise leads increased&#xD;
      cerebral blood volume in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in a sample of young and older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the US, increased length of life and reduced morbidity and mortality have resulted in a&#xD;
      growing number of older adults, the demographic &quot;time bomb&quot; often referred to in discussions&#xD;
      of public policy. According to the Census Bureau, the population aged 65 and over will double&#xD;
      in size within the next 25 years. Moreover, these older adults will live healthier lives than&#xD;
      their predecessors. While this increased length of a healthy life is an undeniable societal&#xD;
      benefit, it brings with it a major societal problem: an epidemic of aging-related cognitive&#xD;
      decline. The need to develop interventions to address this growing problem is urgent.&#xD;
      Aging-related cognitive dysfunction is not diffuse; rather it targets selected brain areas,&#xD;
      in particular the frontal lobes and the hippocampal formation. The separate but&#xD;
      interconnected subregions of the hippocampus are differentially vulnerable to pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms, including the normal aging process. A range of in vivo and post-mortem studies&#xD;
      have converged on the dentate gyrus (DG) as the hippocampal subregion differentially targeted&#xD;
      by the aging process. As with pathogenic processes, any intervention that improves brain&#xD;
      function does so with regional selectivity. One such intervention is physical exercise, which&#xD;
      has been shown to improve both frontal lobe and hippocampal function. Using a high-resolution&#xD;
      variant of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the investigators have demonstrated&#xD;
      that aerobic training selectively benefitted DG function both humans and mice. In addition,&#xD;
      improvement in DG function was associated with improved performance on a word list learning&#xD;
      task but not in tasks conventionally thought to be frontal lobe dependent. The human part of&#xD;
      the study had significant shortcomings, however: it was small (N = 11), lacked a control&#xD;
      group, enrolled only young subjects (age 20-45 years), and employed only a limited&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing battery. The overall goal of this proposal is to use the&#xD;
      high-resolution variant of fMRI to test the hypothesis that aerobic training will induce&#xD;
      improvements in DG function in a sample of younger (age 20-35) and older (50-65) adults,&#xD;
      assigned randomly to an active training condition or wait list control group. The&#xD;
      investigators will use more comprehensive neuropsychological testing to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between changes in DG function and selected cognitive capacities. Taken together&#xD;
      with the observation that normal aging differentially targets the DG, this research program&#xD;
      will establish that physical exercise is an effective approach for ameliorating the insidious&#xD;
      cognitive slide that occurs in aging. Thus, the potential significance of this application is&#xD;
      substantial.&#xD;
