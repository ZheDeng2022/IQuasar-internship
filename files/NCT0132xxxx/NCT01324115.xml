      RATIONALE: NG-nitro-L-arginine may stop the growth of tumor cells by disrupting blood flow to&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of NG-nitro-L-arginine&#xD;
      in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is a differential effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) on tumor&#xD;
           and normal tissue vasculature (blood flow/volume) in patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
           in order to propose a safe recommended dose range for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the correlation between plasma concentration of L-NNA and toxicity and&#xD;
           vascular effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further determine the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition on tumor&#xD;
           tissue vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of L-NNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety profile of L-NNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential pharmacodynamic effect of NOS inhibition on angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of L-NNA on circulating NOS levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation between expression levels of iNOS and eNOS and&#xD;
           vasoconstrictive effects of L-NNA in tumor tissue (where available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a single dose of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) IV over 10 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      All patients undergo up to 6 dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the expanded cohort study undergo 4 additional scans of dynamic&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) as well as DCE-CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and biomarker studies. Samples&#xD;
      are analyzed for L-NNA levels via a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, NOS&#xD;
      inhibition via cGMP analysis, and VEGF-A and osteopontin levels. Previously collected biopsy&#xD;
      samples are analyzed for iNOS and eNOS expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment and one week assessments, patients are followed up once a&#xD;
      week for 28 days and then monthly thereafter (if required).&#xD;
