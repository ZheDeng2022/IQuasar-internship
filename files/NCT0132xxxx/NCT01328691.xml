  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has its propensity to invade the venous system, with extension&#xD;
      into the renal vein and the inferior vena cava (IVC) in 23% and 7%, respectively. Despite&#xD;
      advances in radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy the reference standard for RCC with&#xD;
      tumor thrombus remains surgical resection. However, the 5-year survival rate for patients who&#xD;
      have RCC with venous tumor thrombus treated with radical nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy&#xD;
      is only 35% - 45%, despite the developments in surgical technique and perioperative care.&#xD;
      Furthermore, even the 5-year survival rate for the patients without the evidence of nodal or&#xD;
      distant metastasis at presentation is just 45% - 65%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome prediction for RCC remains controversial, and although many parameters have been&#xD;
      tested for prognostic significance, only a few have achieved widespread acceptance in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Currently, pathologic stage (T stage), lymph node status (N stage) and&#xD;
      histologic grade represent the main prognostic variables in the patients with RCC and venous&#xD;
      tumor thrombus. Accordingly, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification&#xD;
      is regularly revised and, recently, a new 2009 AJCC TNM stage classification system has been&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCC is more prevalent in developed countries, such as Europe and North America. It is&#xD;
      relatively less common in Asia; however, the incidence in these regions appears to have risen&#xD;
      over the past decade. Recently, a few series have suggested that racial or ethnic differences&#xD;
      in survival persist after controlling for age and stage in some cancers. In the case of renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, it has been demonstrated that the malignancy diagnosed in various ethnic&#xD;
      groups had different clinical characteristics: the presenting symptoms, the course of&#xD;
      disease, and the outcome after standard treatment varied significantly between patients of&#xD;
      Caucasian, Hispanic, African-American, and Asian backgrounds. A recent study has reported&#xD;
      that race as well as established factors has an impact on survival in patients with RCC and&#xD;
      Asian Pacific Islander ethnicity was predictive of improved overall or cancer specific&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to date, there was sparse data on surgical outcome and prognostic factors of survival&#xD;
      after radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy in an Asian population with RCC and venous tumor&#xD;
      thrombus, while most studies have been performed in Western countries. The aim of the present&#xD;
      study was to address the surgical outcome after radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy and to&#xD;
      evaluate the prognostic factors influencing on survival in Korean patients with RCC and tumor&#xD;
      thrombus extension into renal vein or IVC, labeled as T3a and T3b-c by the newly revised 2009&#xD;
      AJCC TNM staging system, respectively.&#xD;
