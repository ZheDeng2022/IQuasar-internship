      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out the highest tolerable dose of an&#xD;
      imaging solution called 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium that can be given before a positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scan. The safety of this solution will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Solution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      18-F-fluoroacetate sodium is designed to be attracted to cells that grow in some tumors. This&#xD;
      imaging solution has a small dose of radiation added to it, which may help the doctor to&#xD;
      &quot;see&quot; cancer cells and their possible spread through the body, during the scans. This is the&#xD;
      first study using 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to an&#xD;
      imaging study date. The first group of 6 participants will receive a smaller dose of solution&#xD;
      (less than one half of the regular PET scan tracer radioactivity). The later 2 groups may&#xD;
      receive the same dose of solution or a larger dose, but the larger dose will still be no more&#xD;
      than what you would receive in a regular clinic PET scan procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Solution Administration and PET Scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, you will receive 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium by vein over 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then have 3 PET scans with a PET/CT scanner. You will be lying down during the PET&#xD;
      scan. Each scanning period will take about 1 hour. You will have a 20-minute rest period&#xD;
      between each scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each PET scan, you will have a CT scan, called a &quot;Scout View&quot;, to check your position&#xD;
      in the machine. This should take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue receiving standard treatment from your regular doctor throughout the entire&#xD;
      time you are in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (the day of the injection and imaging study):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG, your vital signs will be measured, and the injection site will be&#xD;
           checked at 5 minutes before, and 30 minutes and 2 ½ hours after the imaging solution is&#xD;
           injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons total) will be drawn 9 times over 2 ½ hours after the&#xD;
           injection for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of the&#xD;
           imaging solution in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will also be collected to test the amount of radiation that might have been&#xD;
           absorbed by the body. This will be collected during the 10 minute rest periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The injection site will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The injection site will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On about Day 30:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The injection site will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on active study for the day you receive the imaging and 18-F-fluoroacetate&#xD;
      sodium. You will be on follow-up for up to 30 days after the imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium is not FDA approved or&#xD;
      commercially available. At this time, it is being used in research only. The study scans are&#xD;
      also considered investigational when used for this purpose, and will not be used for planning&#xD;
      your cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
