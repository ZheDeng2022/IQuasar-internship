  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy, defined as recurrent, unprovoked seizures, is a common condition, affecting 0.5-1%&#xD;
      of the general population. People with uncontrolled epilepsy suffer poor health and increased&#xD;
      mortality due to their condition. They frequently experience social stigma and are&#xD;
      socioeconomically disadvantaged. It is therefore imperative to help them gain control of&#xD;
      their seizures as quickly as possible. A wide range of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has become&#xD;
      available to treat people with epilepsy. However, despite maximal therapy, approximately&#xD;
      20-40% show pharmacoresistance (PR) and thus continue to have seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not understand why a significant proportion of people with epilepsy have PR. For any&#xD;
      given patient presenting with a first unprovoked seizure, we are unable to predict PR at the&#xD;
      time of presentation. At least 2 different AEDs must be tried at maximum doses for a year&#xD;
      before we can diagnose PR. At this point, surgical therapies become an increasingly urgent&#xD;
      consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in the chronic stages of epilepsy have&#xD;
      shown that patients with PR are more likely to have focal structural lesions in the brain,&#xD;
      and in particular to have signs of damage to the hippocampi. For example, there are&#xD;
      retrospective data suggesting that a decreased hippocampal N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine&#xD;
      ratio (measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]) and hippocampal atrophy (determined&#xD;
      by hippocampal volumetry) correlate with PR. However, it is not clear whether these findings&#xD;
      reflect the underlying pathophysiology of PR, or simply reflect the effects of chronic&#xD;
      seizures and chronic drug treatment on the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The First Seizure Clinic at the Halifax Infirmary represents a unique opportunity for&#xD;
      prospective, longitudinal studies of patients who present with a first seizure or with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed epilepsy. In these patients, advanced neuroimaging techniques at presentation might&#xD;
      show changes that truly reflect the underlying pathophysiology of PR, rather than changes&#xD;
      that develop as a consequence of prolonged seizures and drug treatment. Neuroimaging&#xD;
      follow-up might help us to understand the pathophysiologic changes that accompany the&#xD;
      evolution of PR. Ultimately, it is our hope to combine neuroimaging features and clinical&#xD;
      features of patients with PR in a predictive model that would help us to predict PR at&#xD;
      presentation.&#xD;
