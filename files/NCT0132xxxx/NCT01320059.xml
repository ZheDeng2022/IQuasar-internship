  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an imaging solution called&#xD;
      18F-PEG6-IPQA can help to find tumors when used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans.&#xD;
      The safety of the solution and how the solution is processed by your body will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      18F-PEG6-IPQA is a solution that is designed to be attracted to tumor cells. The imaging&#xD;
      solution has a small dose of radiation added to it, which may help doctors see the cancer&#xD;
      cells better during imaging scans. This is the first study using 18F-PEG6-IPQA in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will visit the clinic on Day&#xD;
      1 for the injection of the study solution and PET scans. This imaging study will be performed&#xD;
      at FDA-cleared PET-CT scanners at MD Anderson sites, including at the Center for Advanced&#xD;
      Biomedical Imaging (CABI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For up to 6 hours before the PET scans and computed tomography (CT) scans, you must not eat&#xD;
      or drink anything except water. This is called fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small tube will be placed in your arm and you will receive an injection of 18F-PEG6-IPQA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the injection, scanning will begin immediately. You will have 3 PET scanning sessions&#xD;
      with a PET/CT scanner. Before each PET scan, you will have a CT scan to make sure you are in&#xD;
      the right position for the PET scans. Each PET scan may last up to 1 hour. Each positioning&#xD;
      CT scan should take about 5 minutes. You will have a 10 minute &quot;rest period&quot; between each PET&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the imaging solution is injected, your vital signs and an ECG rhythm strip will&#xD;
           be collected. The study staff will insert an intravenous (IV) needle and line into each&#xD;
           of your arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right after the injection of the study drug, blood (about 2 tablespoons total) will be&#xD;
           drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing from one of the existing IV lines. PK testing&#xD;
           measures the amount of study solution in the body at different time points. Blood will&#xD;
           be drawn at 1, 3, 8, 16, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 150 minutes after the injection of&#xD;
           18F-PEG6-IPQA for a total of 9 draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 30 minutes after the injection, your vital signs will be measured and the&#xD;
           injection site will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected during the 10 minute rest periods in between scans or at the&#xD;
           completion of the 3-hour scanning period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the scans are completed (about 3 hours after the injection) your vital signs and&#xD;
           injections site will be checked again, and you will have an ECG rhythm strip taken.&#xD;
           Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will also be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2 and 7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs and the injection site will be checked&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having since the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-of-study visit will be about 14 days after the injection of 18F-PEG6-IPQA and imaging&#xD;
      scans. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The injection site will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be in this study for about 14 days. You will be taken off study early if intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. 18F-PEG6-IPQA is not FDA-approved or commercially available&#xD;
      for use in imaging scans. Its use in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scans performed with 18F-PEG6-IPQA are also considered investigational and will not be&#xD;
      used for planning any of your future cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All participants will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
