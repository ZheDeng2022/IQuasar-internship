      A study in which the experimental treatment procedure is compared to a standard (control)&#xD;
      treatment, The use of oxybutynin in the late postoperative thoracic sympathectomy for women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To Evaluate the effect of oxybutynin on plantar hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of oxybutynin in compensatory hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the results of questionnaires on quality of life and specific for&#xD;
           hyperhidrosis to the results of TEWL.&#xD;

      Sweating is the most important mechanism of the body to regulate body temperature, kept at&#xD;
      around 36ºC. The thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus captures data from the blood&#xD;
      that passes through the brain and also the receptors of the skin. Sweat is a response to&#xD;
      thermal variation, but may also appear in situations of anxiety and stress. The sweating&#xD;
      occurs at rest in ambient temperatures greater than 24ºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sweat glands are in greater numbers are located on the palms, soles, face and underarms.&#xD;
      Specifically, these regions, such glands are also influenced by psychological factors,&#xD;
      different glands located on the back and abdomen that respond to heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperhidrosis is a relatively common disorder, affecting between 0.6 to 1% of the&#xD;
      population. It is characterized by increased sweat in certain areas of the body such as&#xD;
      hands, face, feet and armpits. More frequent in young adults and adolescents, mostly females.&#xD;
      This is not a serious illness as life threatening, but this situation is very uncomfortable,&#xD;
      causing deep embarrassment social relationships and psychological disorders in the carrier,&#xD;
      which often isolate themselves socially and acquire habits that conceal their problem.&#xD;
      Primary hyperhydrosis is the most common indication for the performance of thoracic&#xD;
      sympathectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videothoracoscopic sympathectomy is performed for the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis,&#xD;
      axillary or cranial-facial, with improvement ranging from 80 to 95%. Patients with plantar&#xD;
      sweating associated with hyperhidrosis may remain even after the operation. Moreover, the&#xD;
      compensatory effect occurs in most patients (70%), with sweat in the abdomen and back, among&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plant can alleviate hyperhidrosis after thoracic sympathectomy in 50% of patients, by&#xD;
      mechanisms not yet understood. The persistence of this sweat is located a source of frequent&#xD;
      complaint postoperatively, spatially specific occasions such as wearing sandals, slippers or&#xD;
      going barefoot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of hyperhidrosis is exclusively clinical, based on complaints of patients and&#xD;
      their limitations in different areas - social, labor, emotional and psychological. No need&#xD;
      for further examination to determine the existence of the disease. Faced with this, the&#xD;
      assessment after any treatment, is also made subjectively, ie based on patient's opinion and&#xD;
      especially its degree of satisfaction. In an attempt to improve this kind of response to&#xD;
      treatment, specific questionnaires were developed on the most important complaints and more&#xD;
      frequent, and these questions before and after treatment. Currently the investigators have&#xD;
      several questionnaires to assess the treatment of hyperhidrosis, not the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With technological advances, there were devices used to determine the flow of evaporation of&#xD;
      skin - called by capacitance hygrometry analysis of transdermal water loss, known by its&#xD;
      acronym in English TEWL. This is currently the most promising method for objective&#xD;
      measurement of sweat, also used by cosmetics companies for new product research (31,32). The&#xD;
      value is determined in grams per square meter per hour (g/m2/h). Still no data in the&#xD;
      literature to define the limits of TEWL and its application in real hyperhidrosis. But&#xD;
      studies comparing the questionnaires mainly specific quality of life and objective measures&#xD;
      of the amount of sweat and post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no drug class specific use for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Groups of&#xD;
      anticholinergic medications, beta-blockers and psychotropic drugs may lead to a decreased&#xD;
      sweating, not satisfactorily and without support in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxybutynin is a parasympatholytics with relaxant effect on bladder detrusor muscle by action&#xD;
      on muscarinic antagonist. The classic indication is urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of anticholinergic oral drugs in hyperhidrosis is unknown and the experience with&#xD;
      oxybutynin is restricted. The literature supports this assertion, only case reports. Its use&#xD;
      is limited in the U.S. and Europe for treatment of hyperhidrosis. Even without consensus, it&#xD;
      is common to the administration of oxybutynin for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, in&#xD;
      empirical and based on personal knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of oxybutynin in the treatment of plantar hyperhidrosis and its&#xD;
      impact on quality of life in women already done thoracic sympathectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The sample population will be selected by telephone and/or e-mail from patients in&#xD;
      late postoperative (more than six months) of thoracic sympathectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of evaluation and research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific questionnaire for plantar hyperhidrosis Questionnaire of quality of life for&#xD;
      hyperhidrosis Measurement of sweating with TEWL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will be held before the division of the groups and after four weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      The data will be collected: age, length of postoperative BMI and side effects to the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups - placebo and oxybutynin group. Study randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial with placebo. The intervention will be the use of oxybutynin for four weeks at&#xD;
      dosage below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ½ cp oral 12/12h for 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      01 ½ cp oral morning and evening for 3 days Continue 1 cp oral 2x/day for three weeks.&#xD;
      Besides the focus on planting hyperhidrosis, compensatory sweating also evaluate with the&#xD;
      same parameters, this being the secondary outcome.&#xD;
