  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary and secondary prevention trials with statins, as well as with antiplatelet, clearly&#xD;
      demonstrated that these drugs are able to reduce cardiovascular events. Even if the principal&#xD;
      mechanism of action of statins is to lower cholesterol, other effects, the so-called&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects, have been considered as adjunctive properties potentially accounting for&#xD;
      the anti-atherosclerotic effect of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of oxidative stress may be considered an intriguing pleiotropic effect in view of&#xD;
      the fact that oxidative stress is thought to be a key event in the initiation and progression&#xD;
      of atherosclerotic disease. Reduction of several markers of oxidative stress including&#xD;
      isoprostanes, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and nitrotyrosine have been observed after&#xD;
      statin treatment. NADPH oxidase is among the most important sources of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species involved in atherosclerotic disease. The investigators developed an ELISA to evaluate&#xD;
      serum levels of soluble-gp91phox, the catalytic core of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Recently the&#xD;
      investigators showed that statins (30 days treatment) exert an antioxidant effect via&#xD;
      inhibition of soluble gp91phox expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism by which atorvastatin reduces NADPH oxidase, however, is unclear. Recent&#xD;
      study showed that statin treatment inhibits leukocyte ROCK activity, a protein kinase&#xD;
      implicated in the activation of NADPH oxidase, with a mechanism that seems to be independent&#xD;
      from lowering cholesterol. To further study the mechanism(s) implicate in gp91phox&#xD;
      downregulation by statin the investigators planned the present study in patients with high&#xD;
      risk of vascular events such as hypercholesterolemic and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the investigators want to evaluate the synergistic role of atorvastatin with&#xD;
      aspirin treatment.&#xD;

      from lowering cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerated atherosclerosis is a typical feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Thus,&#xD;
      patients with T2DM have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CAD) and 2-&#xD;
      to 6-fold increased risk of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets play a major role in the etiology of atherosclerotic disease, as shown by the&#xD;
      significant decrease of cardiovascular events in patients treated with aspirin, an inhibitor&#xD;
      of COX1 that prevents platelet thromboxane (Tx) A2 formation. Despite this, interventional&#xD;
      trials with aspirin in diabetic patients failed to show a beneficial effect. It has been&#xD;
      previously demonstrated that COX1 inhibition determines a shift in arachidonic acid&#xD;
      metabolism towards other pathways, such as the lipooxygenase system. The investigators&#xD;
      speculate that COX1 inhibition could also be associated with increased conversion of&#xD;
      arachidonic acid to platelet isoprostane formation; the increase of platelet isoprostanes&#xD;
      would balance the inhibition of TxA2, thus hampering the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. As&#xD;
      reported above, statins have been reported to down-regulate systemic isoprostanes with a&#xD;
      mechanism that may involve inhibition of NADPH oxidase,therefore it could be interesting to&#xD;
      examine if statins improve the antiplatelet effect of aspirin via inhibition of platelet&#xD;
      isoprostanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further study the mechanism(s) implicate in gp91phox downregulation by statin the&#xD;
      investigators planned the present study in patients with hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the second part of the study will be addressed to evaluate the synergistic role&#xD;
      of atorvastatin with aspirin treatment in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients.&#xD;
