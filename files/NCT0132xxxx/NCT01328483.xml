  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the role of routine suctioning of the oropharynx&#xD;
      before the delivery of shoulders in preventing breathing difficulty and subsequent lung&#xD;
      disease in babies born through meconium stained amniotic fluid. Normally babies do not pass&#xD;
      meconium while in utero. In response to hypoxic stress babies may pass meconium before birth&#xD;
      and are likely to be candidates for problems related to meconium passage and its inhalation&#xD;
      leading to meconium aspiration syndrome(MAS). It is believed that clearing the airways of&#xD;
      meconium at the time of birth can decrease the risk of MAS. It had been a routine practice to&#xD;
      suction the mouth, pharynx and nose of the baby as soon as the head of the infant is&#xD;
      delivered prior to delivery of the shoulders followed by tracheal intubation and suction in&#xD;
      babies with poor breathing efforts to clear the airways of the meconium. however recent&#xD;
      studies have shown the futility of this procedure in preventing MAS along with an increased&#xD;
      risk of complications to baby due to suctioning. In view of the uncertainty regarding the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this procedure in a resource poor country, the investigators decided to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of intrapartum-oropharyngeal suction in preventing or decreasing the&#xD;
      incidence of MAS in such babies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meconium passage in newborn infants is a developmentally programmed event normally occurring&#xD;
      within first 24-48 hours of birth. Intra uterine meconium passage in near term or term&#xD;
      fetuses has been associated with feto-maternal stress factors and/or infections, whereas&#xD;
      meconium passage in post term pregnancies has been attributed to gastro-intestinal maturity.&#xD;
      Meconium staining of amniotic fluid occurs in 12% of all live births per annuum. Aspiration&#xD;
      of meconium that occurs during intra uterine life or after delivery with the first few&#xD;
      breaths may result in or contribute to respiratory pathology known as meconium aspiration&#xD;
      syndrome (MAS) which represents a leading cause of perinatal morbidity, occurring in 5-20% of&#xD;
      all babies born through MSAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that by clearing the airways of meconium at the time of birth,&#xD;
      meconium aspiration pneumonia can be virtually eliminated. Based on these results, the&#xD;
      American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics had recommended a combined&#xD;
      obstetric and pediatric approach to the infant with MSAF in the year 2000. As per this&#xD;
      approach infants mouth, pharynx and nose were to be suctioned as soon as the head of the&#xD;
      infant is delivered prior to delivery of the shoulders using a 10 french catheter followed by&#xD;
      tracheal intubation and suction in non-vigorous infants to clear the airways of the meconium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence in the form of a large RCT from developed world has shown the futility&#xD;
      of intrapartum-oropharyngeal suction leading to, omission of this procedure from&#xD;
      resuscitation guidelines published in the year 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation recommends no need for IP- OP&#xD;
      suction based on a single RCT conducted in a developed world with universal institutional&#xD;
      deliveries and strict fetal surveillance, the same may not be true in set ups with unbooked&#xD;
      and late second stage arrivals of the mother with prolonged fetal distress and virtually no&#xD;
      perinatal surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence the purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intrapartum-oropharyngeal suction in preventing or decreasing the incidence of MAS in term&#xD;
      neonates born through MSAF in resource poor setting in a developing country.&#xD;
