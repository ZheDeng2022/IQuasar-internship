      AIM OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is the proof of efficacy, measured by progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) in the treatment of metastatic or locally inoperable recurrent breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomisation to disease&#xD;
      progression or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ORR (CR+PR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to next Treatment (TTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today breast carcinoma is the leading cancer type and the second frequent cause of cancer&#xD;
      death in adult women. This tumor remains a challenge in modern oncology despite recent&#xD;
      advances by introducing new classes of chemotherapy like taxanes and antibodies for the&#xD;
      HER-2/neu positive tumors. Recently it was shown that the combination of conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy with a monoclonal antibody against VEGF can further increase the response and&#xD;
      progression free survival by combination with an antiangiogenic therapy. It is supposed that&#xD;
      this effect might result in a prolonged survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib, a new developed oral inhibitor for tyrosine kinases which are responsible for the&#xD;
      signal transduction after binding to the VEGF receptor and the RAS-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway seems&#xD;
      efficient in the treatment of a broad range of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib targets the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf&#xD;
      kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-β, thereby affecting both, the&#xD;
      tumour and the vasculature. Preclinical studies as well as phase I trials showed anti-tumour&#xD;
      activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with single-agent sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre, phase II, open-label, randomised study is designed to assess the potential&#xD;
      prolongation in progression free survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer in&#xD;
      combination with standard chemotherapy paclitaxel compared with the paclitaxel monotherapy.&#xD;
