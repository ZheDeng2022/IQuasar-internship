      Because electrochemotherapy is a quick and effective treatment for cutaneous metastases, a&#xD;
      novel electrode device has been developed for treatment in soft tissue such as the brain. Up&#xD;
      to 18 patients will be treated in this phase I dose-escalating study of electrochemotherapy&#xD;
      for brain metastases. Primary endpoint of the clinical trial is safety and secondary endpoint&#xD;
      is efficacy. One brain metastasis is treated once-only with the electrode device guided&#xD;
      stereotactically through a burr hole using CT monitoring. The patient will be fully&#xD;
      anesthetized during the treatment procedure. Patients are followed up for 6 months with&#xD;
      regard to neurological function, Barthel Index, steroid use and adverse effects registration&#xD;
      (CTCAE). Tumor response will be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

      Electrochemotherapy is a cancer treatment modality comprising of a combination of electrical&#xD;
      pulses delivered by electrodes and chemotherapy supplied either intravenously or&#xD;
      intratumorally. It is a quick and effective treatment for cutaneous metastases &lt; 3 cm with a&#xD;
      complete response rate of 73 % after once-only treatment. The available electrode devices&#xD;
      have so far only been applicable for cutaneous tumors. An electrode has now been developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with a medico-technical company. An increasing number of cancer patients suffer&#xD;
      from metastases to the brain due to e.g. better control of the systemic peripheral cancer&#xD;
      disease. The prognosis for patients with brain metastases remains poor and research into new&#xD;
      treatments are needed in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 patients will be treated in a dose-escalating study of electrochemotherapy for brain&#xD;
      metastases. Primary endpoint of the clinical trial is safety and secondary endpoint is&#xD;
      efficacy. One brain metastasis is treated once-only with the electrode device guided&#xD;
      stereotactically through a burr hole using CT monitoring. The patient will be fully&#xD;
      anesthetized during the treatment procedure. Patients are followed up for 6 months with&#xD;
      regard to neurological function, Barthel Index, steroid use and adverse effects registration&#xD;
      (CTCAE). Tumor response will be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 6 patients will receive an intravenous dose of bleomycin 15.000 IE/m2 before&#xD;
      electric pulses. The following patients will receive an additional intratumoral injection of&#xD;
      bleomycin of increasing concentration. The electrical pulses will consist of a series of high&#xD;
      voltage pulses of 0.1 millisecond duration.&#xD;
