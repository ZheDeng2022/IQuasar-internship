  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This crossover study with six treatment sessions is to evaluate the abuse potential of three&#xD;
      doses of Sativex as compared to Marinol and placebo, in subjects with a history of&#xD;
      recreational marijuana use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects attended a two-session, randomized, double-blind, crossover qualification in which&#xD;
      they received the positive control drug (Marinol 30 mg) and matching placebo 48 hours apart&#xD;
      in a randomized fashion. To qualify, subjects must have discriminated between Marinol and&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects then went on to the main study divided into six treatment sessions each&#xD;
      separated by 7-21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial pharmacodynamic evaluations were taken at each treatment session as well as occasional&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic blood samples to verify proof of exposure. In addition, safety monitoring&#xD;
      included regular assessments of vital signs, telemetry, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests and adverse events (AEs).&#xD;

          -  Healthy male and female subjects, 19 to 45 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current recreational marijuana users, defined as the use of smoked marijuana, hashish,&#xD;
             or oral THC, at least once a week for the 3 months prior to screening and, on at least&#xD;
             one occasion, four times in a given week in the 3 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index within the range of 19 to 30 kg/m2 inclusive and a minimum weight of&#xD;
             at least 50 kg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Free of any clinically significant abnormality, assessed at screening, on the basis of&#xD;
             medical history, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and clinical&#xD;
             laboratory tests, including haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and serology,&#xD;
             as judged by the investigator or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive urine THC drug screen at screening and qualification, which was confirmed&#xD;
             by quantitative analysis; the level must have been at least 50 ng of THC/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative urine drug screen for cocaine, opiates, amphetamine, and benzodiazepines&#xD;
             upon admission to the screening, qualification session, or treatment sessions.&#xD;
             Subjects who had a positive urine drug screen upon presentation to a study visit could&#xD;
             have been rescheduled for another session at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All female subjects were required to have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening&#xD;
             and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to the qualification session and to each&#xD;
             drug treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with reproductive potential could be entered into the study if they had been&#xD;
             using and were willing to continue to use two methods of contraception for the&#xD;

             exception of oral contraceptives, which should have been used for at least 3 months&#xD;
             prior to screening. These methods had to be continually used for 30 days after the end&#xD;
             of the study. Subjects that had been surgically sterilized (tubal ligation,&#xD;
             hysterectomy, or vasectomy) or had been post-menopausal for at least 2 years (by&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects had to pass a qualification session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have understood and provided written informed consent, prior to initiation of any&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Negative breath alcohol test. Subjects who had a positive breath alcohol test could&#xD;
             have been rescheduled at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History or presence of drug or alcohol dependence (excluding nicotine and caffeine),&#xD;
             including subjects who had ever been in a drug rehabilitation program.&#xD;

             (or designee), the medication received would not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
             or data integrity or compromise the safety of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used non-prescription drugs or natural health products other than acetaminophen up to&#xD;

             unless in the opinion of the investigator (or designee), the medication received would&#xD;
             not interfere with the study procedures or data integrity or compromise the safety of&#xD;
             the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension at screening that was judged as clinically significant by&#xD;
