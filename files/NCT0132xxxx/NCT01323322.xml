      The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS) is a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary, community-based, prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining&#xD;
      the influences of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of age-related&#xD;
      health disparities among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.&#xD;
      This study investigates whether health disparities develop or persist due to differences in&#xD;
      SES, differences in race, or their interaction. This study is unique because it will assess&#xD;
      over a 20-year period physical parameters as well as evaluate genetic, biologic, demographic,&#xD;
      and psychosocial parameters of African American and white participants in higher and lower&#xD;
      SES. It also employs novel research tools, mobile medical research vehicles, in hopes of&#xD;
      improving participation rates and retention among non-traditional research participants. The&#xD;
      domains of the HANDLS study include: nutrition, cognition, biologic biomarkers, body&#xD;
      composition and bone quality, physical function and performance, sociodemographics,&#xD;
      psychosocial, neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease. Utilizing data from these&#xD;
      study domains will facilitate understand the driving factors behind persistent black-white&#xD;
      health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HANDLS recruited a fixed cohort as an area probability sample of Baltimore City from August&#xD;
      2004 through November 2009 as Wave 1. HANDLS Wave 2 entitled The Association of Personality&#xD;
      and Socioeconomic status with Health Status - An Interim Follow-up Study began in June 2006&#xD;
      under a separate protocol. It was designed as a follow-up telephone interview approximately&#xD;
      18 months after the initial examination (Wave 1) was complete. Wave 2 provided interim&#xD;
      contact with study participants, and important interim information regarding their health.&#xD;
      Now completed, waves 3 and 4 were the first and second follow-up examinations and&#xD;
      participants second and third visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). The&#xD;
      current protocol outlines Wave 5, the third follow-up examination and participants fourth&#xD;
      visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). Planned as a follow-up after 3-4 years,&#xD;
      Wave 5 consists of health examinations, questionnaires, a telephone dietary-recall interview,&#xD;
      sensory assessments (visual, olfactory), health literacy assessment, skin color analysis,&#xD;
      renal function assessments, environmental assessments and structural MRIs....&#xD;

      The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study is an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary, community-based, prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining&#xD;
      the influences of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of age-related&#xD;
      health disparities among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.&#xD;
      This study investigates whether health disparities develop or persist due to differences in&#xD;
      SES, differences in race, or their interaction. Planned as a 20-year longitudinal study,&#xD;
      HANDLS is unique because it assesses physical parameters as well as evaluating genetic,&#xD;
      biologic, demographic, and psychosocial parameters of African American and white participants&#xD;
      over a wide range of socioeconomic statuses. HANDLS also employs novel research tools, mobile&#xD;
      medical research vehicles, in hopes of improving participation rates and retention among non-&#xD;
      traditional research participants. The domains of the HANDLS study include: nutrition,&#xD;
      cognition, biologic biomarkers, body composition and bone quality, physical function and&#xD;
      performance, psychology, genomics, neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Utilizing data from these study domains will facilitate an understanding of selected&#xD;
      underlying factors of persistent black-white health disparities in overall longevity,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HANDLS recruited a fixed cohort as an area probability sample of Baltimore City from August&#xD;
      2004 through November 2009 as Wave 1 (Figure 1). HANDLS Wave 2 entitled The Association of&#xD;

        The baseline HANDLS sample consists of 3720 community - dwelling African American and white&#xD;
        adults aged 30-64. Participants were drawn from 13 neighborhoods (groups of contiguous&#xD;
        census tracts) in Baltimore City, sampling represently across a wide range of socioeconomic&#xD;
        and income circumstances.&#xD;
