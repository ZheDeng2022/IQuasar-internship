    <textblock>
      By using a new software two consecutive laser treatments have been combined to correct the&#xD;
      distance vision and to provide a near vision component in addition to the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help us to answer 2 questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How accurately this combined technique corrects distance and near vision&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the correction is adequate to remove the complete need for supplementary near&#xD;
           spectacles&#xD;

    <textblock>
      LASIK is a surgical technique where the cornea is reshaped using a laser to provide visual&#xD;
      correction. Typically, this procedure will only correct your long distance vision requiring&#xD;
      the use of supplementary spectacles for reading and near vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Technolas 217z Excimer Laser used to deliver the treatment is approved for use in the&#xD;
      European Community for both treatment versions to correct separately the near vision and the&#xD;
      distance vision for cases which need one or the other correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using a new software two consecutive treatments have been combined to correct the distance&#xD;
      vision and to provide a near vision component in addition to the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help us to answer 2 questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How accurately this combined technique corrects distance and near vision&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the correction is adequate to remove the complete need for supplementary near&#xD;

    <description>All patients will undergo LASIK treatment on their non-dominant eye with a new laser software algorithm designed to treat both the distance and near vision components.&#xD;
The developed software algorithm uses the subjective refraction of the eye to create a treatment for the distance vision correction. This part of the treatment does not show any difference to a regular LASIK treatment for ametropic cases.&#xD;
In addition to the treatment for the distance vision a central ablation component will be added to address the near vision.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have presbyopia as determined by an age-related need for optical aid (&gt;&#xD;

             for at least 3 weeks and soft lenses discontinued for at least 1 week prior to the&#xD;
             preoperative evaluation in the eye to be treated. Contact lens wearers who wear their&#xD;
             contact lenses for any amount of time between the preoperative baseline examination&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned&#xD;
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of&#xD;

          -  Eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a difference of&#xD;
             greater than 0.75D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than 0.50D in cylinder&#xD;
             power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees compared to the&#xD;
             baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of less than 0.75D,&#xD;
