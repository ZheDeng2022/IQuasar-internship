  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a great increase in the incidence of infections caused by bacteria that are&#xD;
      resistant to antibiotic agents. Many of these infections result in worse outcomes of patients&#xD;
      and increased costs to the healthcare system. The study aims to survey two germs that are&#xD;
      resistant to a wide range of antibiotics used today. The investigators are particularly&#xD;
      interested in studying the potential to stop the spread and prevent outbreaks of these germs&#xD;
      through contact isolation of patients affected by these germs. Patients will be included in&#xD;
      the study if they have an antibiotic resistant infection caused by any of the 2 bacteria: E.&#xD;
      coli and K. pneumoniae. The research team will then perform rectal, skin (armpit, groin,&#xD;
      umbilicus), throat, urine, and, if applicable, wound cultures to determine other sites where&#xD;
      the germ may be present but not causing an infection. The study coordinator will furthermore&#xD;
      examine the patient's medical record and conduct a short interview in order to evaluate&#xD;
      specific information about the bacteria that have been recovered. This research does not&#xD;
      involve any interventions beyond collection of specimens and there are no added risks to the&#xD;
      patients from the conduction of the study. Neither will there be a benefit at the patient&#xD;
      level. The benefit will be at the level of the patient population, i.e. at a larger scale&#xD;
      once the information collected is analyzed. Only the principal investigator and study&#xD;
      coordinators will have access to all patient-specific information. Once all information is&#xD;
      collected, all patient identifiers, such as name and medical record number, will be deleted.&#xD;

      The rising incidence of infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)&#xD;
      producing Enterobacteriaceae is of worldwide dimensions, particularly in developing&#xD;
      countries. At the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUB-MC), the proportion of&#xD;
      ESBL producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) and K. pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) strains has risen from 2.5% and&#xD;
      9.8% to 22% and 27%, respectively between 1999 and 2008. The rapid spread of these multi drug&#xD;
      resistant pathogens prompted the study of factors aiming at limiting the ongoing transmission&#xD;
      of these organisms. Infection control interventions, such as contact isolation of infected&#xD;
      patients, have been used to control outbreaks of infections caused by ESBL producing&#xD;
      organisms in settings where the pathogens were isolated from rectal and axillary samples, as&#xD;
      well as from upper respiratory tract secretions. These few reports raise concern for&#xD;
      colonization of infected patients at sites other than the primary site of infection.&#xD;
      Colonization in the absence of outbreaks has so far not been looked at systematically,&#xD;
      especially in a high-endemicity area such as Lebanon. The present study ultimately aims at&#xD;
      assessing the usefulness of placing patients with ESBL-EC and ESBL-KP infections on contact&#xD;
      isolation during their hospital stay, and whether this practice would limit the spread of&#xD;
      such infections. This is a prospective study screening hospitalized patients with ESBL-EC and&#xD;
      ESBL-KP infections for colonization with the same organism at sites other than the primary&#xD;
      site of infection through cultures of the rectum, skin, nasopharynx, urine and, if&#xD;
      applicable, wounds. Cases will be identified through the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at&#xD;
      AUBMC and study subjects will be enrolled according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In&#xD;
      addition to cultures of multiple body sites, molecular analysis will be performed on the&#xD;
      isolated ESBL-producing strains to identify clonal relatedness. Cultures will be repeated&#xD;
      monthly for a period of 6 months. The sample size is estimated at 100 patients over a two&#xD;
      year period. The results of this study will have implications on infection control practices&#xD;
      and will constitute a prerequisite for further studies in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the extent of colonization with ESBL-EC and&#xD;
      ESBL-KP in hospitalized patients with active infections and designing recommendations&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify hospitalized patients with infections due to ESBL-producing organisms at a&#xD;
           primary site&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screen patients for colonization with ESBL-producing organisms at body sites other than&#xD;
           the primary site of infection through cultures of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Skin (axillae, groin, umbilicus)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nasopharynx&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wound (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform susceptibility testing on all the collected isolates to detect ESBL-EC and&#xD;
           ESBL-KP&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform molecular testing on ESBL-producing pathogens isolated from sites of&#xD;
           colonization and compare them to the organisms recovered from the primary site in order&#xD;
           to identify clonal relatedness&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perform follow up cultures from the above mentioned sites after treatment for the&#xD;
           primary infection is completed to determine duration of colonization&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Draw conclusions regarding extent of colonization with ESBL-producing organisms in&#xD;
           hospitalized patients with a primary infection and to evaluate infection control&#xD;
           implications (particularly with respect to placing patients on isolation precautions)&#xD;
