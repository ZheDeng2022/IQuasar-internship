  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adding SOM230 LAR to bortezomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone is better than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and if it should be&#xD;
      investigated further.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed symptomatic MM,&#xD;
             Salmon-Durie Stage II or III, International Staging System II or III, or fulfill the&#xD;
             CRAB criteria (see Appendix A, B). Patients should have previously been treated with&#xD;
             at least one cycle of bortezomib, after which the patient has shown progressive or&#xD;
             refractory disease. Finally, patients must meet at least one of the following&#xD;
             parameters of measurable disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone marrow plasmacytosis with&gt; 10% plasma cells, or sheets of plasma cells, or&#xD;
                  biopsy proven plasmacytoma which must be obtained within 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable levels of monoclonal protein (M-protein): ≥ 1 g/dL on serum protein&#xD;
                  electrophoresis (SPEP) or ≥ 200 mg of monoclonal light chain on a 24 hour urine&#xD;
                  protein electrophoresis (UPEP) or involved FLC ≥ mg/dL (≥ 100 mg/L) which must be&#xD;
                  obtained within 4 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum and urine M-protein levels should be determined by electrophoresis rather&#xD;
                  than by quantitative immunoglobulin (Ig) measurement. Exceptions are made in&#xD;
                  cases in which the M-spike value may be deemed to be unreliable ( e.g.&#xD;
                  co-migrating M-spike). In these cases, quantitative Ig should be used. To assess&#xD;
                  response and progression, however, SPEP values should only be compared to SPEP&#xD;
                  values and quantitative Ig values only to quantitative Ig values.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least two prior anti-MM treatments. The prior&#xD;
             treatments must include at least one IMiD (thalidomide or lenalidomide) and&#xD;
             bortezomib. If patients are unable to tolerate thalidomide or lenalidomide they can be&#xD;
             included without prior IMiD treatment. Patients may be included if they did not&#xD;
             experience grade III neuropathy while on bortezomib. Patients may have previously&#xD;
             received autologous or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum of four weeks since any major surgery, completion of radiation, or completion&#xD;
             of all prior systemic anticancer therapy. Exception: e.g. kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty,&#xD;
             local radiation therapy for symptomatic bone lesions (e.g., uncontrolled pain or high&#xD;
             risk of pathologic fracture).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%; see&#xD;
             Appendix B).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below, obtained&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to registration:&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3 × ULN without liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5 × ULN if documented liver infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal:&#xD;

             of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of&#xD;
             appropriate lipid lowering medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At the principle investigator's discretion, non-eligible patients can be re-screened after&#xD;
        adequate medical therapy has been instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 14 days of the administration of the first study treatment. Further, all&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use a&#xD;
             medically effective contraception method throughout the treatment period and avoid&#xD;
             conception while participating in this study. Women must not be lactating. Post&#xD;
             menopausal patients and patients who had a bilateral oophorectomy need not take a&#xD;
             pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Patient must be informed of the investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
