  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carriers of a BRCA mutation have a significantly increased risk to develop breast cancer in&#xD;
      the course of their lives . They face a difficult choice: either a preventive removal of the&#xD;
      breast(s) or an intensive inspection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After primary treatment of breast cancer, patients will be followed for 5-10 years to&#xD;
      diagnose recurrence or a new primary tumor in an early stage; to support the patient during&#xD;
      hormonal treatment; to educate the patient about risk factors and healthy life style; and to&#xD;
      provide psychosocial support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, follow-up of breast cancer patients and surveillance of BRCA mutation carriers is&#xD;
      offered in regular, one-to-one medical visits. Experience shows that in an individual visit&#xD;
      it is often not possible to give all aspects that are important, enough attention. The group&#xD;
      medical consultation (GMC) is a new form of medical visits where the physician or nurse&#xD;
      practitioner performs a series of one-to-one consultations in the presence of 8 to10 other&#xD;
      patients. A social worker accompanies this process. Patients in group consultations may&#xD;
      gather more information because they learn from each other and there is relatively more time&#xD;
      compared to a regular consultation. Research shows that both patients and caregivers are more&#xD;
      satisfied with care after a group consultation compared to individual visits. After a GMC the&#xD;
      participants from the breast cancer GMCs will be provided with a dedicated iPad for 3 months.&#xD;
      Using this iPad, patients can contact the women they have met during the GMC as well as&#xD;
      health care professionals by several communication channels, including virtual group&#xD;
      meetings. This approach provides a unique combination of both social support and professional&#xD;
      education concerning survivorship in an e-health environment.However, it is also known that&#xD;
      group sessions may be counterproductive for some patients, for example because they are&#xD;
      frightened by the stories of others. The goal of this study is to examine whether group&#xD;
      visits (in combination with dedicated iPads) are beneficial to women with a BRCA mutation and&#xD;
      for patients in follow-up after breast cancer.&#xD;
