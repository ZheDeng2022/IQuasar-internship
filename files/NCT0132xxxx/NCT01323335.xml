      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Uric acid is a substance found in the blood that may contribute to certain chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions and disorders, such as diabetes, insulin resistance, and high blood pressure. High&#xD;
      uric acid concentrations have been associated with stroke and heart disease, as well as&#xD;
      chronic heart failure. In particular, researchers are interested in determining the&#xD;
      relationship between uric acid and inflammatory markers, or chemicals in the blood that can&#xD;
      indicate inflammation and other problems with the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the specific effects of changes in uric acid in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether uric acid contributes to inflammation in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals between 50 and 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve four visits: a screening visit, two study visits, and a followup&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the screening visit, participants will have a physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, and an electrocardiogram. Participants will be divided into two groups based on&#xD;
           the existing amount of uric acid in their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 7 days of the screening visit, participants will have a full-day study visit with&#xD;
           a magnetic resonance imaging scan, followed by a high-fat meal and further blood samples&#xD;
           collected over the following 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 2 days after the first study visit, participants will have the second study&#xD;
           visit, which will require a 2-night stay at the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
           Participants will have a metabolism test, and will receive the following infusions based&#xD;
           on the groups they were assigned to at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (low uric acid) will receive either uric acid or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (moderate to high uric acid) will receive either Rasburicase (a drug that&#xD;
           reduces the amount of uric acid in the blood) or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the infusions and related blood tests, participants will have a high-fat meal with&#xD;
           further blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 2 weeks after the second study visit, participants will have a final&#xD;
           followup visit with additional blood and urine tests to determine whether the levels of&#xD;
           uric acid in the blood have returned to normal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uric acid (UA) is a terminal product of purine metabolism with strong antioxidant properties.&#xD;
      UA has sizeable concentrations in biologic fluids only in humans and primates because they&#xD;
      have a non-functional mutation of the enzyme uricase that, in other animals, transforms UA to&#xD;
      allantoin. It has been hypothesized that this mutation has emerged evolutionarily because&#xD;
      through this mechanism, humans can counteract the excessive oxidative stress that occurs in&#xD;
      many critical pathologic conditions. Partially in contrast with this theory, high levels of&#xD;
      UA have been associated with a number of negative health outcomes, including cardiovascular&#xD;
      as well as all-cause mortality. Although it is possible that the UA elevation is merely a&#xD;
      marker of critical health because it is an inducible antioxidant, researchers have questioned&#xD;
      whether UA has beneficial or detrimental effect on health status. For example, we recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that higher UA levels are cross-sectionally associated with higher levels of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory markers, and predict the increase in inflammatory markers over a 3-year&#xD;
      follow-up. Understanding whether UA exerts a protective or detrimental effect on health is&#xD;
      important in deciding whether mild hyperuricemia should or should not be aggressively&#xD;
      treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, observational studies cannot fully address this question. In fact, we cannot&#xD;
      exclude that the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between UA, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and negative health outcomes, may simply reflect the fact that UA is an inducible&#xD;
      antioxidant that is produced in response to increasing oxidative stress. To verify the&#xD;
      hypothesis that UA activates inflammation, we plan to conduct two complementary randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, each one including 10 treated and 10 control subjects. In the first&#xD;
      trials, subjects with low UA will be administered 500 mg of UA intravenously. In the second&#xD;
      trials, subjects with moderately elevated UA will be administered a single acute dose of&#xD;
      Rasburicase. Then inflammatory markers will be measured at multiple points in time, for a&#xD;
      total of 32 hours. We hypothesize that an acute increase in the circulating levels of UA will&#xD;
      be followed by increasing levels of inflammatory markers. At the same time, an acute&#xD;
      reduction of UA levels will be followed by a progressive reduction of inflammatory markers.&#xD;
      This study should provide information that will help clinicians to decide whether to or not&#xD;
      to treat mild hyperuricemia.&#xD;
