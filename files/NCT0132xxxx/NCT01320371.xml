  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is determine if barbed sutures are more efficient, have&#xD;
      comparable complication rates, clinical outcomes, and cosmesis outcomes versus traditional&#xD;
      knotted sutures when used in the closure of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barbed suture has been associated with improved closure efficiency and safety in TKA in prior&#xD;
      studies. The investigators performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine&#xD;
      the efficiency and safety of this technology in TKA. The investigators prospectively&#xD;
      randomized 411 patients undergoing primary TKA to either barbed running (n=191) or knotted&#xD;
      interrupted suture closure (n=203). Closure time was measured intraoperatively. Cost analysis&#xD;
      was based on suture and operating room time costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) rates have consistently risen in recent years, and demand is&#xD;
      expected to increase by over 600% in the next 20 years. Decreasing reimbursement and&#xD;
      available resources make tangible advances in surgical efficiency and outcomes essential in&#xD;
      meeting current and future demand. Closure time may be one of the best targets in the push to&#xD;
      reduce operative time and cost while increasing operative productivity. Optimizing lengthy,&#xD;
      multilayered wound closures in TKA is a promising means for improving both efficiency and&#xD;
      outcomes by potentially decreasing wound closure time, reducing postoperative wound&#xD;
      complications, and improving cosmetic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Running knotless suture technique utilizing barbed suture technology has recently been shown&#xD;
      to reduce wound closure time in both total hip and knee arthroplasty in a small, prospective,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. Barbed suture technology has also facilitated rapid closure and&#xD;
      soft-tissue repair in plastic-surgery literature. Very few studies have reported on the use&#xD;
      of barbed suture technology for multilayered closure in orthopedics. As a pilot study, the&#xD;
      investigators performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive cohorts before and after&#xD;
      changing to barbed suture. The investigators believed that our published slight improvement&#xD;
      in efficiency and cost savings of a barbed suture closure was underestimated due to the&#xD;
      retrospective nature of our pilot study and the investigators therefore elected to proceed&#xD;
      forward with a prospective randomized trial. Additionally, in the investigators pilot study&#xD;
      we found a potential trend toward lower wound complications with the barbed suture and we&#xD;
      wanted to see if this would be borne out in a prospective randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that a prospective study would show that barbed sutures would&#xD;
      be more efficient, have comparable complication rates, clinical outcomes, and cosmesis&#xD;
      outcomes versus traditional knotted sutures when used in the closure of primary TKA.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators hypotheses were as follows: multilayered closure in TKA with&#xD;
      barbed suture would be associated with (1) shorter closure times; (2) lower cost; (3) similar&#xD;
      closure related perioperative complication rates; and (4) similar Knee Society, cosmesis, and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction scores when compared to standard knotted suture closure.&#xD;

        The study and control groups will be made up of consecutive patients undergoing a median&#xD;
        parapatellar approach primary total knee arthroplasty at the University of Utah Hospital&#xD;
        and Clinics. The control group will undergo two-layer closure utilizing a standard&#xD;
        interrupted, knotted suture technique. The closures will be performed by 2 members of the&#xD;
        team (attending surgeon, resident, fellow, or PA) in ALL closures so as to limit the&#xD;
        possible confounder of closure time variation due to different numbers of people closing&#xD;
        the incision. This will specifically consist of arthrotomy closure using interrupted #1&#xD;
        Ethibond™ in figure of eight fashion and sudermal closure using 2-0 Monocryl™ in&#xD;
        interrupted buried fashion.&#xD;
