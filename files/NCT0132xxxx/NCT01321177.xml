  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how services should be provided to reduce symptoms&#xD;
      and improve life functioning for adolescents and adults who have been recently diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a major mental illness characterized by psychosis, negative symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
      apathy, social withdrawal, anhedonia), and cognitive impairment. Depression and substance&#xD;
      abuse commonly co-occur. These individuals have impaired functioning in the areas of work,&#xD;
      school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure&#xD;
      time. Among adult psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is the most disabling, and its&#xD;
      treatment accounts for a disproportionate share of mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of the National Institute of Mental Health's Recovery After an Initial&#xD;
      Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Project. The RAISE Project seeks to fundamentally change the&#xD;
      trajectory and prognosis of schizophrenia through coordinated and aggressive treatment in the&#xD;
      earliest stages of illness. This study, the RAISE Early Treatment Program (ETP), is one of&#xD;
      the two independent research studies that NIMH has funded to conduct the NIMH RAISE Project.&#xD;
      ETP is being supported in whole or in part with Federal funds from the American Recovery and&#xD;
      Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health&#xD;
      and Human Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETP study aims to compare two early treatment interventions for adolescents and adults&#xD;
      experiencing a first episode of psychosis. The clinical centers have been randomly allocated&#xD;
      to offer one of the two treatment programs. Both treatment interventions are designed to&#xD;
      provide a person with treatment soon after he or she experiences the early signs of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Participants will be offered mental health services such as medication and&#xD;
      psychosocial therapy. These strategies are all aimed at promoting symptom reduction and&#xD;
      improving life functioning. Participation in this study will last between 2 and 3 years. All&#xD;
      participants will first undergo an initial videoconference interview to confirm a diagnosis&#xD;
      of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis NOS, brief psychotic disorder, or&#xD;
      schizophreniform disorder. Eligible participants will then be offered mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the mental health services, participants will participate in a series of&#xD;
      research interviews. Participants will be interviewed every 3 months for the first 6 months&#xD;
      and then every 6 months for up to 3 years. At the research visit, participants will complete&#xD;
      an interview about their symptoms and general quality of life, complete questions about&#xD;
      experiences with their illness, their vital signs will be measured, and a blood draw will be&#xD;
      collected. At the initial, 12 and 24 month visits, participants will also complete a brief&#xD;
      test that assesses skills such as memory, attention and problem solving. Participants will&#xD;
      also have monthly telephone interviews about their illness and services that they have&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
