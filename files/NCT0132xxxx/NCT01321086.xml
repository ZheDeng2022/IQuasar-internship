    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a clinical research trial to determine the role of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (MI) on promoting home-based walking therapy to improve walking&#xD;
      ability in African Americans with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). African Americans are&#xD;
      more than two times as likely as non-Hispanic whites to suffer from PAD. For patients with&#xD;
      PAD, there is a significant risk for poor walking ability and limb loss. One major treatment&#xD;
      for PAD is walking therapy but the traditional methods for the delivery of this treatment&#xD;
      have required frequent visits to a university or hospital-based site. The investigators will&#xD;
      address the role of self-managed walking program, to be conducted at or near the home, to&#xD;
      improve limb function. In order to motivate the participants to walk, the investigators&#xD;
      included two different intervention strategies: MI and patient-centered counseling for&#xD;
      exercise (PACE). The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to the MI arm&#xD;
      will have a greater increase in their walking distance, compared to those receiving&#xD;
      Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE) and the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MI is an effective counseling method in individuals who are less ready to change their&#xD;
      behavior (i.e., low motivation). Thus, MI is an ideal counseling method to promote home-based&#xD;
      walking among AAs with PAD. In our pilot study to promote home-based walking, we used a&#xD;
      counseling protocol, Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE)(Sallis et&#xD;
      al), which targets known modifiable determinants of behavior change (e.g., social support).&#xD;
      Using PACE, we demonstrated an improvement in stair climbing ability and lower limb blood&#xD;
      flow (as measured by the ankle-brachial index). Improvements in these lower limb outcomes&#xD;
      offer support for the use of PACE counseling in PAD, but PACE does not specifically address&#xD;
      low motivation - a critical target for AAs with PAD. In addition, PACE is not culturally&#xD;
      sensitive. In our proposed trial, we hypothesize that MI will improve walking distance and&#xD;
      reduce walking impairment more than PACE in AAs with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a critical need to improve lower limb outcomes in AAs with PAD. Our long-term goal&#xD;
      is to reduce debilitating functional limitations and amputations in AAs with PAD. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this application is to determine the most effective counseling strategy to&#xD;
      improve home-based walking in AAs with PAD. We have assembled an excellent and diverse&#xD;
      research team with the requisite skills and experience needed for this study. Moreover, we&#xD;
      have robust pilot data to support the study hypotheses and ensure successful completion of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will deliver the PACE protocol or MI for 6 months, using both face-to-face visits and&#xD;
      telephone contact. Our primary outcome is walking distance (as measured by the widely used&#xD;
      and well-validated 6-minute walk test) at the end of active intervention (6 months).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are walking distance as measured beyond the active phase of intervention&#xD;
      (12 months), use of home-based walking (as measured by accelerometry), and lower limb blood&#xD;
      flow (as measured by the ankle brachial index - ABI). Our comparison group will receive the&#xD;
      same print material as the two interventions as well as contact every three months to update&#xD;
      any changes in contact information and to assess their health status. We will randomize 204&#xD;
      participants to one of three arms: Control or Treatment One (Tx1); PACE or Treatment Two&#xD;
      (Tx2); or MI, also referred to as Treatment Three (Tx3). In addition, we will determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of PACE (Tx2) to increase walking distance in AAs with PAD, compared to Control&#xD;
      (Tx1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. At 6 months, AAs with PAD randomized to MI (Tx3) will have a greater increase in their&#xD;
      walking distance, compared to those receiving PACE (Tx2) and the control group (Tx1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AAs with PAD randomized to MI (Tx3) will have a greater increase in their walking&#xD;
           distance at 12 months - a follow-up period beyond the six months of active intervention&#xD;
           - compared to those receiving PACE (Tx2) and compared to the control group (Tx1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At 6 and 12 months, AAs with PAD randomized to MI (Tx3) will have a greater increase in&#xD;
           their home-based walking and their lower limb blood flow, compared to those receiving&#xD;
           PACE (Tx2) and to the control group (Tx1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 6 and 12 months, AAs with PAD randomized to PACE (Tx2) will have a greater increase&#xD;
           in their walking distance compared to those randomized to control (Tx1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will explore potential mediators (self-efficacy, social support, intrinsic/extrinsic&#xD;
      motivation) and moderators (co-morbidities, leg symptom type, stage of change) of&#xD;
      intervention effects on walking distance, home-based walking, and lower limb blood flow among&#xD;
      AAs with PAD.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. African American (determined by self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Lived most of their life in the United States&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Resting ABI &lt;0.995&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. English Speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Currently walking for exercise at least 5 days per week (i.e., a PACE score ranging&#xD;
             from 5-8); the rationale is that a person who is currently walking for at least 5 days&#xD;
             per week is already sufficiently active and therefore not a member of the target&#xD;
             population for our motivational home-based walking intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior major amputation (foot or lower leg) or critical leg ischemia (tissue loss,&#xD;
             gangrene, or ulcers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Rest pain with ABI &lt;0.4 and non-palpable femoral pulses without prior evaluation by a&#xD;
             vascular surgeon, given the need for evaluation for the role of more invasive therapy&#xD;
             prior to recommending walking therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Leg revascularization within 3 months of enrollment or plans for revascularization&#xD;
             during the study period; the rationale is that post intervention recovery and&#xD;
             potential complications are likely to limit the patient's ability to adhere to the&#xD;
             study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of supplemental oxygen; the rationale for this is concern for participant safety&#xD;
             and potential limited ability to participate in the study secondary to breathing&#xD;
             difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Myocardial infarction within the preceding 3 months; the rationale for this is&#xD;
             participant safety and the potential risk for complications and/or the need for&#xD;
             supervised cardiac rehabilitation following the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Resting blood pressure &gt; 200/110 mmHg; the rationale for this is participant safety,&#xD;
             as blood pressure may further increase during exercise and increase risk for a&#xD;
             cerebrovascular event or myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Exercise-induced coronary ischemic symptoms, or exercise-induced ST depression &gt; 2.0&#xD;
             mm; the rationale for this is participant safety and the need for further cardiac&#xD;
             evaluation prior to involvement in walking therapy (American College of&#xD;
             Cardiology/American Heart Association, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to walk for 2 minutes; the rationale being that people who cannot walk for 2&#xD;
             minutes would not be able to complete the necessary submaximal treadmill test, which&#xD;
             is used to screen for coronary ischemic symptoms. We will also exclude anyone who can&#xD;
             walk for 20 minutes or more during the submaximal treadmill test. Anyone who can&#xD;
             complete the submaximal test would not have significant walking impairment and would&#xD;
             not get that much out of the study. Short Physical Performance Battery score of 10 or&#xD;
             higher as such persons do not have a clinically significant impairment in mobility;&#xD;
             therefore, we will exclude anyone who scores a 10 or higher (out of a maximum of 12&#xD;
             points).&#xD;
