      The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of acetylsalicylic acid resistance&#xD;
      (ASA-R) among patients under chronic acetylsalicylic acid(ASA) treatment seen at our&#xD;
      outpatient clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) resistance (R) is best defined as an ineffective inhibition of the&#xD;
      platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 pathway, and has been reported in 1 to 61 % of patients&#xD;
      treated with ASA. Impaired response to ASA has been associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      ischemic events in patients with known coronary artery disease. We sought to investigate the&#xD;
      incidence of ASA-R in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients under chronic ASA treatment (100mg/d) seen at our outpatient clinic&#xD;
      were systematically included in the registry. All patients were on acetylsalicylic acid for&#xD;
      CAD for at least 1 month. Patients were informed of ASA testing at start of consultation in&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic. Eligible patients provided written informed consent. Peripheral venous&#xD;
      blood samples were analyzed using the whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry Multiplate&#xD;
      analyzer. The Multiplate analyzer device allows to measure platelet aggregation by the&#xD;
      attachment of platelets to two silver coated copper electrodes leading to a rise of&#xD;
      electrical resistance in the sample. The measurements are expressed as arbitrary aggregation&#xD;
      units (AU) and the manufacturers defined cutoffs were used: normal values were 76-136 AU,&#xD;
      partial antiaggregation was defined as ASA values between 31 and 75 AU and complete&#xD;
      antiaggregation was defined as ASA values &lt; 31 AU.&#xD;
