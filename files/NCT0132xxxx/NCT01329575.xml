      There is no single method to investigate mediastinal LN invasion. Hence, a patient may have&#xD;
      to undergo several tests and procedures. Noninvasive and invasive approaches are employed.&#xD;
      Within the invasive techniques, endoscopic ultrasonography with needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)&#xD;
      and endobronchial ultrasonography with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are&#xD;
      gaining importance in mediastinal staging.5 They provide ultrasonographic images and permit&#xD;
      needle aspiration under direct vision for cytology specimen analysis. As more evidence is&#xD;
      being accumulated on these staging approaches, the number of cervical mediastinoscopies,&#xD;
      considered as the gold-standard for mediastinal staging, is diminishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color Doppler LN characteristics with endoluminal ultrasound (US) is only mentioned in a&#xD;
      small number of studies and needs to be further investigated.13,14 With the good results&#xD;
      obtained with superficial US, it seems reasonable to believe that color Doppler&#xD;
      characteristics would increase accuracy in detecting malignancy of mediastinal LNs with&#xD;
      endoluminal US.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States with a 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of 15,7%.1 In lung cancer and other malignancies, such as esophageal cancer,&#xD;
      accurate staging is essential to establish prognosis and for patient management. Staging will&#xD;
      help determine if surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a combination of these, or a&#xD;
      palliative approach is the most adequate.2,3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of lymph nodes (LNs) for invasion by metastasis is undertaken if patient&#xD;
      management is influenced by a positive or negative result. In non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), mediastinal LN invasion by malignant cells is a critical factor to determine if a&#xD;
      patient is considered as a surgical candidate or not.2 In esophageal cancer, LN metastasis&#xD;
      may be found in the mediastinum, the neck and the abdomen.4 Invasion of these LNs must be&#xD;
      considered in the selection of treatment of esophageal cancer.3,4&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no single method to investigate mediastinal LN invasion. Hence, a patient may have&#xD;
      to undergo several tests and procedures. Noninvasive and invasive approaches are employed.&#xD;
      Within the invasive techniques, endoscopic ultrasonography with needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)&#xD;
      and endobronchial ultrasonography with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are&#xD;
      gaining importance in mediastinal staging.5 They provide ultrasonographic images and permit&#xD;
      needle aspiration under direct vision for cytology specimen analysis. As more evidence is&#xD;
      being accumulated on these staging approaches, the number of cervical mediastinoscopies,&#xD;
      considered as the gold-standard for mediastinal staging, is diminishing.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of benign and malignant LNs using ultrasonography have been described in&#xD;
      various contexts. Cervical and axillary LNs provided accurate characteristics (eg. shape,&#xD;
      short- to long-axis ratio, number of blood vessels in LN, vascularization pattern, etc.) in&#xD;
      predicting malignancy with linear superficial transducers.7-11 LN characteristics using EUS&#xD;
      or EBUS also have established criteria predicting mediastinal LN malignancy (eg. size, shape,&#xD;
      borders and echogenicity).12 Depending on the studies, it has been suggested to obtain&#xD;
      specimens of all accessible LNs without considering their characteristics. It has also been&#xD;
      suggested to proceed to a selective LN aspiration based on LN characteristics, with the&#xD;
      advantage of cost reduction (fewer needles used, less time to carry out procedure, and&#xD;
      specimens needed to be analysed).6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color Doppler LN characteristics with endoluminal ultrasound (US) is only mentioned in a&#xD;
      small number of studies and needs to be further investigated.13,14 With the good results&#xD;
      obtained with superficial US, it seems reasonable to believe that color Doppler&#xD;
      characteristics would increase accuracy in detecting malignancy of mediastinal LNs with&#xD;
      endoluminal US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New processors and probes are more accurate than the ones used in some of the past studies.&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators can possibly obtain more precise findings than the ones the&#xD;
      investigators can find in the literature.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a prospective assessment of LN characteristics in patients&#xD;
      undergoing EUS-FNA and/or EBUS-TBNA for diagnostic purposes. Cytology results will be&#xD;
      considered as the gold-standard. By comparing the LN characteristics with the cytology&#xD;
      results, the investigators will establish a scoring system to accurately predict malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of this study is significant. If clinicians can accurately predict malignancy in&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph nodes using ultrasound characteristics, biopsy of these lymph nodes could&#xD;
      be avoided which would decrease the risk to the patient and the cost to the system&#xD;
      (disposable needle costs, cytological preparation and analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a combination of endoluminal ultrasound characteristics, a simple scoring system can be&#xD;
      established to help predict malignancy in mediastinal lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a scoring system to accurately predict mediastinal lymph node malignancy with&#xD;
           endoluminal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retrospectively evaluate the impact of the established scoring system on the number of&#xD;
           lymph nodes aspirations required for accurate staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, cohort study design. Clinical trial: Intervention - endoluminal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a prospective non-randomized evaluation of endoluminal ultrasound&#xD;
      characteristics in mediastinal lymph nodes using endoluminal ultrasound to predict malignancy&#xD;
      within these nodes. All patients undergoing EUS-FNA and/or EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal LN&#xD;
      staging for any suspected or confirmed malignancy at the CHUM - Hôpital Notre-Dame will be&#xD;
      approached in an attempt to enroll them in the study. Patients will be enrolled and consented&#xD;
      for the study during the pre-operative evaluation in the pre-operative clinic. The&#xD;
      investigators will aim to recruit 100 consecutive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented patients will undergo EUS with or without FNA and/or EBUS with or without TBNA in&#xD;
      the same way as planned or decided during the procedure by the surgeon. During the procedure,&#xD;
      data will be collected, including lymph node size, shape, border, echogenicity, homogeneity,&#xD;
      location, color Doppler characteristics, number of nodes, etc. This will not add additional&#xD;
      steps or time to the procedure. All this data and the cytology results obtained from EUS-FNA&#xD;
      and EBUS-TBNA will be entered in a prospective database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytology results will be considered as the gold-standard and with the collected&#xD;
      characteristics univariate and multivariate logistic regressions will be used to establish a&#xD;
      scoring system to predict malignancy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,&#xD;
      negative predictive value and accuracy will be determined based on the developed model.&#xD;
