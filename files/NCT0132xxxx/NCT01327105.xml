  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Essure procedure, FDA approved since 2002 and CE Mark approved since 2001, is the first&#xD;
      permanent birth control method that can be performed in the comfort of a physician's office&#xD;
      without hormones, cutting, burning or the risks associated with general anesthesia or tubal&#xD;
      ligation. Soft, flexible inserts are placed in a woman's fallopian tubes through the cervix&#xD;
      without incisions. Over the next three months, the body forms a natural barrier around the&#xD;
      micro-inserts to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Three months after the Essure&#xD;
      procedure, a doctor performs an Essure Confirmation Test. In the United States, this test is&#xD;
      called a hysterosalpingogram and evaluates the location of the inserts and whether the&#xD;
      fallopian tubes are blocked. Outside of the United States, a standard x-ray is performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the location of the inserts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a transvaginal ultrasound is an effective&#xD;
      method of confirming micro-insert location.&#xD;
