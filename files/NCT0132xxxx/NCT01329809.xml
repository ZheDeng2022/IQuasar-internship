    <textblock>
      This is a neoadjuvant Phase 2a, open-label trial in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      carcinoma who are undergoing a complete resection of the metastatic colorectal tumors in&#xD;
      their liver.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will receive either an intravenous infusion or an intratumoral injection of JX-594&#xD;
      (Pexa-Vec) directly into one liver lesions at Day 1. Patients will undergo a complete&#xD;
      resection of all liver tumors at Day 15. Patients will then be monitored throughout their&#xD;
      life for disease recurrence and/or general overall survival.&#xD;
