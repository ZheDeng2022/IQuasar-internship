    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) prior to surgery for upper gastrointestinal (oesophageal and&#xD;
      gastric) cancer is associated with improved survival. The investigators propose a prospective&#xD;
      blinded observational cohort study of patients undergoing NAC prior to elective upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer resection (oesophagectomy and gastrectomy) in three NHS teaching&#xD;
      hospitals. The investigators have pilot data showing that NAC reduces objectively measured&#xD;
      exercise capacity (fitness). The literature suggests that a lower level of exercise capacity&#xD;
      is associated with a high risk of adverse outcome (death and serious complications) after&#xD;
      major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to explore the hypothesis that decrease in exercise capacity (fitness)&#xD;
      associated with (NAC) prior to upper gastrointestinal cancer resection may outweigh the&#xD;
      benefits (duration of survival) achieved by NAC in some patients undergoing upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer surgery. The investigators aim to recruit 175 patients from over 36&#xD;
      months. Consenting patients will perform cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and complete&#xD;
      a quality of life questionnaire prior to and 4 weeks after NAC . Postoperative outcomes&#xD;
      measured at set time points will be objective recorded including mortality 1 year after&#xD;
      surgery and short term postoperative harm described by the PostOperative Morbidity Survey&#xD;
      (POMS) as well as Quality of life scores and resource use (e.g. hospital bed utilisation).&#xD;
      Exercise capacity (fitness) before and after NAC will be assessed using CPET and the&#xD;
      relationship between the derived variables (AT, VO2 peak) and clinical outcomes will be&#xD;
      described.&#xD;

      STUDY SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective blinded observational cohort study of patients&#xD;
      undergoing NAC prior to elective upper gastrointestinal cancer resection (oesophagectomy and&#xD;
      gastrectomy) in three NHS teaching hospitals. Exercise capacity (fitness) before and after&#xD;
      NAC will be assessed using CPET and the relationship between the derived variables (AT, VO2&#xD;
      peak) and clinical outcomes will be described. Postoperative outcomes will be objective&#xD;
      recorded clinically meaningful and will include mortality 1 year after surgery and short term&#xD;
      postoperative harm described by the PostOperative Morbidity Survey (POMS) Quality of lifer&#xD;
      using the EQ5D questionnaire and resource use (e.g. hospital bed utilization). The hypotheses&#xD;
      will be tested by constructing predictive models incorporating exercise variables and factors&#xD;
      known to be related to outcome following surgery (e.g. age, gender, open versus laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery). For example, for the Primary Hypothesis, models will be developed to predict the&#xD;
      risk of one year mortality using (i) baseline exercise capacity and (ii) baseline exercise&#xD;
      capacity and the relative decrease in exercise capacity. The aim will be to compare the&#xD;
      predictive ability of both models to ascertain how prognostic the relative decrease in&#xD;
      exercise capacity is, after adjusting for baseline exercise. In addition, Hypothesis 1 will&#xD;
      be investigated by comparing AT before and after NAC using a paired t-test and Hypothesis 2&#xD;
      will be investigated by comparing the risk of 1year mortality between patients who stay in&#xD;
      the same AT band and those who deteriorate using a chi squared test. Logistic regression will&#xD;
      be used to repeat the analysis adjusting for potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Conduct&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be undertaken within Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, Aintree&#xD;
      University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and University Hospitals, Bristol. All research&#xD;
      staff will have evidence of up to date GCP training and investigators with direct patient&#xD;
      contact will undergo a formal consenting course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCESS&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTACT 1: ELIGIBILITY AND RECRUITMENT (SURGEON &amp; STUDY NURSE) Consecutive patients will be&#xD;
      screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria to establish eligibility for study recruitment.&#xD;
      Patients will be approached in surgical clinics following listing for surgery plus NAC.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be approached and the opportunity to discuss the study requested. The&#xD;
      study aims and conduct will be explained along with the process of informed consent. A period&#xD;
      of 24 hours will be offered for the patient to reflect on their decision.&#xD;

&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION OF MEASURES Justification of predictor variables (AT and VO2 peak) The VO2&#xD;
      (oxygen consumption) at AT and VO2 peak are reliably measurable (using CPET) and widely&#xD;
      accepted measures of exercise capacity (or fitness). There is no simpler, or cheaper method&#xD;
      of reliably measuring exercise capacity (fitness) without using CPET. Both LT and VO2 Peak&#xD;
      are known to be associated with outcome following major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of other CPET variables Other CPET derived variables will also be recorded in&#xD;
      order to explore the reasons for limitations in exercise capacity(fitness) in order to inform&#xD;
      on what types of interventions might be effective to mitigate these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of risk measures O-POSSUM is a reliable and valid measure of perioperative risk&#xD;
      which will provide a standard against which to compare the predictive performance of the CPET&#xD;
      derived variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION OF POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOME MEASURES Justification of primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcome variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be all cause mortality 1 year after date of surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators chose this variable for several reasons, including that it:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is meaningful to patients, carers, administrators and policy makers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is readily verifiable, and therefore reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurs with sufficient frequency to allow construction of a predictive model with a&#xD;
           sample size that can be collected within a manageable timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of this variable are that the cause of death may not be directly related to&#xD;
      chemotherapy or surgery but may arise due to disease progression or recurrence. However,&#xD;
      all-cause mortality remains an important outcome to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POMS In order to explore the relationship between NAC, surgery and short-term harm the&#xD;
           investigators propose to monitor short-term postoperative harm using the PostOperative&#xD;
           Morbidity Survey (POMS). POMS is the only validated measure of short term postoperative&#xD;
           harm16 and has been used in outcomes research and effectiveness research. It is in&#xD;
           current use as a primary outcome variable in MRC and NIHR funded studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life (QoL) Measures using EQ5D The impact of NAC and surgery on patient&#xD;
           quality of life will be assessed using A validated questionnaire. The investigators will&#xD;
           assess subjective changes in patient's state using a a questionnaires. The&#xD;
           questionnaires will be self-completed by the patient, taking about 15-20 minutes in&#xD;
           total. The questionnaires to be used will be EQ5D which has been recommended for use as&#xD;
           a generic PROM following major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resource Use In order to obtain a full picture of the clinical course and resource use&#xD;
           of the study patients, additional outcome variables will include: Reoperation,&#xD;
           Readmission to hospital, length of post-operative hospital stay, readmission to&#xD;
           hospital, total postoperative hospital bed usage, length of postoperative critical care&#xD;
           stay, readmission to critical care, total postoperative critical care bed usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE The hypotheses listed in (Aims of the Project) will be tested by constructing&#xD;
      predictive models incorporating exercise variables and factors known to be related to outcome&#xD;
      following surgery (e.g. age, gender, open versus laparascopic surgery). For the primary&#xD;
      hypothesis, models will be developed to predict the risk of one year mortality using (i)&#xD;
      baseline exercise capacity and (ii) baseline exercise capacity and the relative decrease in&#xD;
      exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim will be to compare the predictive ability of both models to ascertain how prognostic&#xD;
      the relative decrease in exercise capacity is, after adjusting for baseline exercise. To&#xD;
      develop reliable prediction models approximately 252 patients are required. This is using the&#xD;
      &quot;Rule of 10&quot; and assumes that the one year mortality rate is 20% (conservative estimate) and&#xD;
      that models contain 5 factors (e.g. age, gender, centre, location of tumour, laparoscopic&#xD;
      versus open).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given a 20% non-completion of NAC and 2 CPET tests (based on Liverpool data), this will be&#xD;
      achievable since approximately 525 patients will attend the centres over the 25month&#xD;
      recruitment period (based on average of last three years patient throughput, with an&#xD;
      anticipated recruitment rate of 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size for Hypothesis 1: A sample of 152 patients would be required to detect a&#xD;
      difference in 1 [unit] of VO2@LT using a paired t-test at the 5% significance level with 90%&#xD;
      power. This is assuming the standard deviation of the difference in VO2@LT values is 3.8&#xD;
      [units].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size for hypothesis 2B: A sample size of 242 is required to detect a difference in one&#xD;
      year mortality rates of 15% (30% versus 15%) between the two LT change groups (no change /&#xD;
      deteriorate) using a chi squared test at the 5% significance level with 80% power. This is&#xD;
      assuming that there are equal numbers of patients in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relationship between exercise capacity changes and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effect of chemo on exercise capacity and other CPET variables. Patients who do not&#xD;
           complete NAC and 2 CPET tests will be eligible to enter the study and their data&#xD;
           collected. The sample size calculation and primary analysis will be of patients who&#xD;
           complete CPET before and after NAC. Secondary analyses will include patients who were&#xD;
           unable to complete CPET before and after NAC, and will compare patients who underwent&#xD;
           surgery and those in whom surgery was subsequently canceled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses (means and proportions) will be carried out to describe the patients'&#xD;
      characteristics including baseline and changes in exercise capacity, and their clinical&#xD;
      outcomes including 1year mortality, morbidity and PROMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation for hypothesis 1 is based on a comparison of fitness (using VO2@AT) before&#xD;
      and after NAC. As this is a within-patient comparison the investigators use the paired&#xD;
      t-test. The standard deviation for the within-patient difference is assumed to be 3.8. This&#xD;
      was estimated from the pilot data in the Background and assumes a correlation of 0.5 between&#xD;
      before and after values. The clinically important difference of 1 was considered conservative&#xD;
      and feasible since the pilot data had a difference of 2.1. The calculation for hypothesis 2B&#xD;
      is based on a dichotomisation of patients in two groups: a) those who deteriorate after NAC&#xD;
      b) those who don't. To compare mortality rates between the two groups the investigators would&#xD;
      use a chi squared test(although a logrank test may be appropriate if dropout is an issue).&#xD;
      It's assumed that the two groups will be approximately equal (this is discussed elsewhere)&#xD;
      and that the mortality rates for the two groups are 30% and 15% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation for hypothesis 2/2A is not based on power but instead is based on&#xD;
      the amount of data required to develop a robust and reliable risk model. The idea is to&#xD;
      develop a risk prediction model based on preNAC factors and quantify its predictive ability&#xD;
      (e.g. using the ROC area). McCulloch (BMJ, 2003) does something similar. Next the&#xD;
      investigators will add postNAC fitness to the model and establish whether this extra data&#xD;
      provides extra predictive ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual approach to calculating the sample size for a risk model is based on the rule of&#xD;
      10, that is the investigators require 10 times as many (mortality) events as there are&#xD;
      predictors in the model. Our models will have 5 factors so the investigators require 50&#xD;
      events. Assuming a mortality rate of 20% suggests that the investigators require 250 patients&#xD;
      in total. Note that this does not give us specific power to detect some predefined clinical&#xD;
      effect (this would be a very difficult calculation since pre- and post-NAC fitness are likely&#xD;
      to be correlated) but rather gives us enough data to fit risk prediction models to quantify&#xD;
      the incremental benefit of post-NAC fitness.&#xD;
