    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation&#xD;
      study of ALT-801 in a biochemotherapy regimen either containing cisplatin and gemcitabine or&#xD;
      containing gemcitabine alone in patients who have muscle invasive or metastatic urothelial&#xD;
      cancer of bladder, renal pelvis, ureters and urethra. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose&#xD;
      (RD), and assess the anti-tumor response of ALT-801 in combination with cisplatin and&#xD;
      gemcitabine or ALT-801 in combination with gemcitabine alone. The pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      ALT-801 in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine will also be assessed. The study&#xD;
      includes a dose escalation phase (Phase Ib) and a dose expansion phase (Phase II). Phase II&#xD;
      has two treatment groups, Expansion Group 1 and Expansion Group 2. Expansion Group 2 is for&#xD;
      platinum-refractory patients, consisting of two treatment arms based on the patient's renal&#xD;
      function. Patients will enroll to Expansion Group 2 after stage 1 of the Group 1 expansion is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in men and the ninth most common in women&#xD;
      in the US, with an estimated 68,810 new cases and 14,070 deaths for the year 2008.&#xD;
      Approximately 90% to 95% of newly diagnosed patients are with transitional cell carcinomas&#xD;
      (TCC). Approximately 20% to 25% contain advanced (muscle invasive or metastatic) disease.&#xD;
      Muscle invasive bladder cancer is life threatening. Clinical trials have demonstrated that&#xD;
      TCC is a chemotherapy-sensitive malignancy. Most current cancer treatment strategies involve&#xD;
      the use of chemotherapeutic or biological drugs that have a low therapeutic ratio. The&#xD;
      limitations are a consequence of effects of the therapeutic drug on normal tissues. One&#xD;
      approach to control systemic exposure effects is to target the drug itself into the site of&#xD;
      the tumor. For example, antibodies have been developed for use as tumor targeting agents and&#xD;
      have had success in the clinic. However, despite the promise of antibody-based immunotherapy,&#xD;
      there are limitations with these class of reagents. Even so, immunotherapy remains a&#xD;
      promising approach to treat cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One strategy that has received attention is treatment with cytokines such as IL-2 to enhance&#xD;
      anti-tumor immunity. IL-2 has stimulatory effects on a number of immune cell types including&#xD;
      T and B cells, monocytes, macrophages, lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) and natural&#xD;
      killer (NK) cells. Based on the ability of IL-2 to provide durable curative anti-tumor&#xD;
      responses, systemic administration of IL-2 has been approved to treat patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma or renal carcinoma. Unfortunately, the considerable toxicity associated&#xD;
      with this treatment makes it difficult to achieve an effective dose at the site of the tumor&#xD;
      and limits the population that can be treated. Thus, there is critical need for innovative&#xD;
      strategies that enhance the effects of IL-2, to reduce its toxicity without compromising the&#xD;
      clinical benefit, and to treat other diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, ALT-801, is a biologic compound of interleukin-2 (IL-2) genetically fused to&#xD;
      a humanized soluble T-cell receptor directed against the p53-derived peptides expressed on&#xD;
      tumor cells. The p53 protein is one of the most important factors that protects from&#xD;
      developing cancer and is also one of the most frequently mutated genes in many cancers, which&#xD;
      include muscle-invasive bladder cancer. For any given cancer type, p53 dysfunction generally&#xD;
      correlates with poor prognosis versus other the same site-of-origin. In some tumors, p53&#xD;
      mutation and over-expression also is associated with resistance to chemotherapy. This study&#xD;
      is to further evaluate whether directing IL-2 activity using ALT-801 to the patient's tumor&#xD;
      sites that over-express p53 results in clinical benefits&#xD;
