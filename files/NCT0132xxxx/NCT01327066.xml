      The purpose of this study is define the electrocardiographic (ECG) effects of Droxidopa at&#xD;
      clinical (600 mg) and supratherapeutic (2000 mg) doses compared with placebo and moxifloxacin&#xD;
      in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double blind, single-site, 4 period crossover study in healthy&#xD;
      male and female subjects to determine if droxidopa administered as a single therapeutic (600&#xD;
      mg) and a single supratherapeutic (2000 mg) dose delays cardiac repolarization as determined&#xD;
      by the measurement of QTc interval. Study drug (droxidopa, placebo, and moxifloxacin) will be&#xD;
      administered in a double blind, double dummy manner. The central ECG laboratory (eResearch&#xD;
      Technology, Inc, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) will be blinded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 52 healthy subjects (approximately 26 women and 26 men) will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a treatment sequence. Subjects will cross over into 4 treatment periods&#xD;
      where each subject will receive single doses of the following treatments under fasting&#xD;
      conditions separated by a minimum 3 day washout period (from Day 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Droxidopa 600 mg (therapeutic dose), oral capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Droxidopa 2000 mg (supratherapeutic dose), oral capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (matched to droxidopa), oral capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moxifloxacin 400 mg (positive control; over encapsulated), oral Subjects will be&#xD;
           screened for study participation from Days -21 to -2 and admitted to the clinic on Day&#xD;
           -2 of Period 1 for prestudy assessments. On Day -1 of each period, subjects will undergo&#xD;
           a full day of continuous 12 lead Holter monitoring; 4 ECGs will be extracted from the H&#xD;
           12+ flash card approximately 1 minute apart at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and&#xD;
           23 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of Day 1 of each period, after at least an 8 hour fast, subjects will receive&#xD;
      a single dose of study drug according to the randomly assigned treatment sequence. After&#xD;
      dosing, subjects will be monitored for 23 hours using a continuous 12 lead ECG Holter&#xD;
      monitor. At the ECG core laboratory, 4 ECGs will be extracted approximately 1 minute apart at&#xD;
      0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 23 hours (Day 2) after dosing. The ECGs will be&#xD;
      extracted from Holter recording flashcards during a 10 minute ECG extraction window that will&#xD;
      end at the onset of each pharmacokinetic (PK) collection nominal time point. Each ECG&#xD;
      extraction window will be preceded by a 10 minute supine rest period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single 12 lead ECG will be performed at Screening for inclusion/exclusion in the study, and&#xD;
      a baseline safety 12 lead ECG will be performed at Check in. In addition, a safety 12 lead&#xD;
      ECG will be recorded and reviewed by the investigator on Day 1 of each period at 2 hours&#xD;
      after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of each period before dosing and&#xD;
      0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 23 hours (Day 2) after dosing. Subjects will be&#xD;
      supine for at least 10 minutes before each of the time points for PK samples. The ECG&#xD;
      extractions will be time matched to the PK samples, but will be obtained before the actual&#xD;
      sampling time to avoid changes in autonomic tone associated with the psychological aspects of&#xD;
      blood collection as well as the reduction in blood volume subsequent to blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal timing and components, activity levels, and general conditions in the Phase I unit will&#xD;
      be as similar as possible on Day -1 and Day 1 of each treatment period. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged on Day 2 of Period 4 (ie, 24 hours after the last dose is administered). The total&#xD;
      study duration will be approximately 34 days.&#xD;
