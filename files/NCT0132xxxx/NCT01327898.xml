    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the 5-year study are to: 1) describe the nature and extent of substance&#xD;
      use and sexual risk behaviors in a sample of 500 sexually active, substance using,&#xD;
      not-in-treatment men who have sex with men (MSM) in urban South Florida (Miami/Ft.&#xD;
      Lauderdale); 2) identify the independent covariates of baseline substance abuse and sexual&#xD;
      risks; 3) evaluate, through random assignment of participants, the relative effectiveness of&#xD;
      two intervention conditions in reducing sexual risks and substance use, as measured at 3-,&#xD;
      6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments: a) an innovative five-session risk reduction&#xD;
      intervention derived from psychological empowerment theory titled Project GOAL; and, b) an&#xD;
      enhanced community standard-of-care HIV counseling Comparison Condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although recent meta-analyses of the HIV prevention intervention literature have demonstrated&#xD;
      that behavioral interventions reduce sexual risk-taking among men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM), interventions for not-in-treatment substance using MSM are lacking. Consequently, and&#xD;
      based upon overwhelming evidence that substance use is a primary driver of HIV infection&#xD;
      among urban MSM, public health authorities have identified the development of efficacious&#xD;
      interventions for substance using MSM as a concern of the highest priority. The proposed&#xD;
      study aims to test a new intervention based upon psychological empowerment theory that, in&#xD;
      preliminary field tests, produced high levels of acceptability and participation, as well as&#xD;
      large reductions in sexual risks and substance use, among a sample of ethnically-diverse,&#xD;
      high risk, substance using, HIV+ and -negative MSM. The intervention to be tested is based&#xD;
      upon a theory of MSM health risk behaviors that posits that urban gay &quot;fast lane&quot; subcultures&#xD;
      present risk environments - including lack of integration with the larger society, normative&#xD;
      hypersexuality and substance use, homophobia, sexual competitiveness, and an emphasis on&#xD;
      entertainment and escapism - that become problematic for a sizable minority of MSM who live&#xD;
      in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project responds directly to the calls by public health authorities for the&#xD;
      development of efficacious risk reduction interventions for substance using MSM. South&#xD;
      Florida consistently ranks in the top three MSAs nationwide in HIV and AIDS incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence. South Florida is also a well-known migration point for MSM of extraordinarily&#xD;
      diverse backgrounds with high rates of non-injection drug use. This setting provides an&#xD;
      excellent context for testing an innovative intervention among high risk substance using MSM&#xD;
      who are in need of HIV prevention services.&#xD;
