  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is a specific approach to treating cancer that has shown promise in adult&#xD;
      patients for the treatment of melanoma, malignant brain tumors, and other cancers. The study&#xD;
      investigators will use the experience they have gained from these studies to try to improve&#xD;
      the outcome for children affected by a recurrent brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase I, approximately 9 patients will be treated with increasing doses of&#xD;
      tumor-specific immune cells to determine the safety of this treatment. Phase I patients will&#xD;
      also receive dendritic cell vaccines to help boost the function of these immune cells and&#xD;
      maintain their growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase II, approximately 35 patients will be treated with tumor-specific immune cells&#xD;
      and dendritic cell vaccines to see what impact they have on the tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant brain tumors now represent the most frequent cause of cancer death in children.&#xD;
      Despite aggressive and highly toxic multi-modality therapy including surgery, craniospinal&#xD;
      radiation, and high-dose chemotherapy coupled with peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, almost half the children diagnosed with the most common malignant brain&#xD;
      tumors, medulloblastoma (MB) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), will still die from&#xD;
      recurrent disease. Furthermore, survivors are often left with severe and lifelong&#xD;
      treatment-associated cognitive and motor deficits. The development of more effective and&#xD;
      tumor-specific therapies that will not add further toxicity to existing treatments is&#xD;
      paramount in improving clinical outcomes for children affected by MB/PNETs. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      targeting tumor-specific antigens expressed within brain tumors is a modality potentially&#xD;
      capable of meeting this clear and urgent need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite considerable advancements and promising clinical results observed in immunotherapy&#xD;
      trials directed against adult malignant brain tumors, efforts in the immunologic treatment of&#xD;
      pediatric brain tumors have been limited to relatively few notable studies. This is due, at&#xD;
      least in part, to the often limited viable tumor tissue available for tumor cell-based&#xD;
      vaccine preparations, and the lack of identification of consistently expressed tumor-specific&#xD;
      antigens within these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of total tumor RNA (TTRNA)-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) was pioneered at Duke&#xD;
      University, as a novel platform for inducing potent immunologic responses against the variety&#xD;
      of uncharacterized and patient-specific antigens present within malignant tumor cells. Duke&#xD;
      demonstrated that sufficient RNA for clinical vaccine preparations can be amplified with high&#xD;
      fidelity using existing molecular technologies from as few as 500 isolated pediatric and&#xD;
      adult brain tumor cells, thus allowing vaccine preparation from surgical biopsies and even&#xD;
      microdissected archival tumor specimens. In this study, the investigators will treat&#xD;
      recurrent MB/PNETs during hematopoietic recovery from chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy administered during recovery from chemotherapy may have tremendous advantages,&#xD;
      as adoptive cellular therapy following lymphodepletive conditioning regimens has emerged as&#xD;
      the most effective treatment strategy for advanced and refractory melanoma. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that DC + ex vivo expanded Autologous Lymphocyte Transfer (xALT) therapy targeting recurrent&#xD;
      MB/PNETs during recovery from myeloablative chemotherapy will be safe and will prolong&#xD;
      survival in children and young adults with recurrent MB/PNETs.&#xD;
