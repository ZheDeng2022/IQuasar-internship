      The purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between brain structure and&#xD;
      depression in adults aged 30 or older with Diabetes. This relationship is determined using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging technology (MRI), a scanner with a magnet that is used to create&#xD;
      images of the brain.&#xD;

      Diabetes is a major health problem affecting approximately 18 million Americans. It is a&#xD;
      growing crisis that has devastating complications including heart disease, peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy and renal failure. According to a literature review by Gavard et al, the&#xD;
      prevalence of major depression in a sample diabetic population in controlled studies was 8.5&#xD;
      to 27.3% (mean prevalence of 14.0%). This was estimated to be up to three times the&#xD;
      prevalence of major depression in the general U.S. adult population. Diabetes and major&#xD;
      depression are mutual risk factors, with diabetic patients more likely to develop major&#xD;
      depression with an odds ratio of 2.5 and depressed patients being more likely to develop type&#xD;
      2 diabetes with an estimated relative risk of 2.2. Depression also has a significant impact&#xD;
      on the course of diabetes, leading to higher rates of hyperglycemia and diabetic&#xD;
      complications. Depression in patients with diabetes is also associated with poor compliance,&#xD;
      decreased quality of life, increased disability and greater health care utilization. A recent&#xD;
      8-year follow-up study of patients with diabetes and depression concluded that the&#xD;
      coexistence of these illnesses is associated with a significantly increased risk of death&#xD;
      from all causes beyond that due to either depression or diabetes alone. In this study,&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and depression had a 1.3-fold increased risk of death from all causes&#xD;
      when compared with patients with diabetes alone and a 2-fold increased risk of death when&#xD;
      compared with patients with only depression. Reports from a prospective, community-based&#xD;
      study in western Australia suggest that the behavioral consequences of depression, including&#xD;
      non-compliance with medication and exercise regimens, contribute to increased mortality in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Specific Aim 1: To study the biophysical properties of the white&#xD;
      and gray matter in critical cortical and subcortical regions using magnetization transfer in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes and MDD, non-depressed diabetic controls, patients with&#xD;
      unipolar depression without diabetes and nondiabetic healthy controls. The investigators are&#xD;
      interested in the separate and cumulative effects of both diabetes and depression on&#xD;
      Magnetization Transfer Ratios (MTR) in different brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The overarching hypothesis is that both diabetes and depression have the effect&#xD;
      of lowering magnetization transfer ratios (MTR) in the anterior cingulate cortex, subcortical&#xD;
      nuclei (head of the caudate nucleus and putamen) and the frontal white matter. These effects&#xD;
      are cumulative and may not be additive in some regions. Our pilot data suggest that MTR will&#xD;
      be lower in these regions in patients with type 2 diabetes (both with and without depression)&#xD;
      when compared with healthy controls. In some regions (eg. head of the caudate nucleus - see&#xD;
      preliminary data) the investigators anticipate that patients with diabetes and MDD will have&#xD;
      the lowest and healthy controls will have the highest MT ratios. The group with unipolar&#xD;
      depression without diabetes and the diabetic controls will have MT ratios that fall between&#xD;
      these two groups. In other regions of interest, both groups with diabetes will have values&#xD;
      significantly different from healthy controls, with patients diagnosed with unipolar&#xD;
      depression falling between the healthy and diabetic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To examine levels of glutamate and aspartate (creatine ratios) in two regions&#xD;
      involved in the regulation of mood and cognition - the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex&#xD;
      and the left subcortical region (the head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen) in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes and our three comparison groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Levels of glutamate and aspartate (creatine ratios) will be lower in patients&#xD;
      with combined Type 2 Diabetes and MDD when compared with non-depressed diabetic patients and&#xD;
      healthy controls. Our pilot data provide little basis to expect a simple effect of diabetes&#xD;
      alone but do not rule out an interaction such that effects are only seen, or are worsened, by&#xD;
      the combination of diabetes and depression. The inclusion of a depressed non-diabetic group&#xD;
      in the current design will make it possible to evaluate whether the observed effect in the&#xD;
      doubly-diagnosed group is best viewed as an effect of depression alone or as an interaction&#xD;
      in which diabetes plays a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To examine the relationship between regional MTRs and specific cognitive&#xD;
      domains in subjects in all four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be direct correlations in all study groups between MT ratios in the&#xD;
      subcortical nuclei, anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral white matter and&#xD;
      performance on specific cognitive domains, including attention, executive functions, learning&#xD;
      and memory and psychomotor processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 1: In an exploratory manner the investigators will estimate cerebral blood&#xD;
      volume, a measure of the cerebral microvasculature, in critical brain regions involved in&#xD;
      frontal-subcortical circuitry (anterior cingulate, dorsolateral white, head of the caudate&#xD;
      nucleus and the putamen) in subjects in our depressed diabetic group and the three comparison&#xD;
      groups using dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging (perfusion-weighted MR imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 2: A comparison of blood samples from healthy controls, diabetic subjects,&#xD;
      depressed subjects and subjects with both depression and diabetes to see if there is evidence&#xD;
      of differences in plasma neurotransmitter levels, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenals (HPA) axis,&#xD;
      and immune function between these four subject groups&#xD;

        Patients of all subject types will be recruited through the general medical, psychiatric,&#xD;
        and endocrinology clinics associated with the UIC Medical Center. Patients will be first&#xD;
        cleared for participation in the study by their primary physicians. The patient and family&#xD;
        will be approached by the PI or another investigator who will explain the research and its&#xD;
        goals. We also plan to recruit subjects through flyers and advertisements.&#xD;
