      The purpose of this study is to compare the decision making of hospitalized subjects having a&#xD;
      verbal discussion about CPR compared to subjects using a video.&#xD;

      A.1. Aim 1: To recruit 150 subjects admitted to the inpatient general medicine ward with an&#xD;
      overall prognosis of one year or less and randomly assign these subjects to: 1. a video&#xD;
      visually depicting CPR preferences or 2. the current standard of care without the use of&#xD;
      video (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: It is feasible to recruit and randomize 150 hospitalized subjects with an&#xD;
      overall prognosis of one year or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.2. Aim 2: To compare the care preferences for CPR and intubation among subjects randomized&#xD;
      to video and subjects randomized to the current standard of care without the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to the video intervention will be significantly more likely&#xD;
      to opt against CPR and intubation compared to those who do not see the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.3. Aim 3: To compare code-status documentation in the electronic medical records between&#xD;
      subjects randomized to the video and those who are receiving the current standard of care&#xD;
      without the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Subjects randomized to the video are more likely to have their code-status&#xD;
      documented in the electronic medical records compared to those who do not see the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.4. Aim 4: To compare the decisional conflict of subjects randomized to video and subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the current standard of care without the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: When compared to subjects randomized to the current standard of care, subjects&#xD;
      in the video intervention group will have lower decisional conflict (lower decisional&#xD;
      conflict scores) when asked to choose CPR and intubation preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.5. Aim 5: To compare knowledge assessment of CPR of subjects randomized to video and&#xD;
      subjects randomized to current standard of care without the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: When compared to subjects randomized to the current standard of care, subjects&#xD;
      in the video intervention group will have higher knowledge assessment scores when asked&#xD;
      questions regarding their understanding of CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.6. Aim 6: To compare code-status (CPR, and intubation) preferences in the electronic&#xD;
      medical record on future hospitalizations up to one year post-hospital discharge of subjects&#xD;
      randomized to video and subjects randomized to current standard of care without the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 6: Subjects randomized to the video are more likely to opt against CPR and&#xD;
      intubation in the future compared to those who do not see the video.&#xD;
