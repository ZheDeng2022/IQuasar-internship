      Rationale: B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone released from cardiomyocytes in&#xD;
      response to myocyte stretching and serves as a reliable biomarker in the diagnosis of cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction and heart failure. Recent observations speak for a distinct connection between&#xD;
      chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The study was set out to investigate the role of BNP on parameters of glucose&#xD;
      metabolism in a placebo controlled cross-over study in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Results: Ten participants (25±1 years; BMI 23±1 kg/m2; fasting glucose 83±2&#xD;
      mg/dL) received either placebo or 3 pmol/kg/min BNP 32 intravenously for 4h. One hour after&#xD;
      beginning the BNP/placebo infusion, a 3h intravenous glucose tolerance test (0.33 g/kg&#xD;
      glucose + 0.03 U/kg insulin at 20 min) was performed and plasma glucose, insulin and C&#xD;
      peptide were frequently measured. BNP increased the initial glucose distribution volume (13±1&#xD;
      %BW vs. 11±1, P&lt;0.002), leading to an overall reduction of glucose concentration (P&lt;0.001)&#xD;
      especially during the initial 20 min of the test (P=0.001), accompanied by a reduction of the&#xD;
      initial C peptide levels (4.3±0.4 ng/mL vs. 4.9±0.3, P=0.015). BNP had no impact on beta cell&#xD;
      function, insulin clearance or insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Intravenous administration of BNP increases glucose initial distribution volume&#xD;
      and lowers plasma glucose concentrations after a glucose load without affecting beta cell&#xD;
      function or insulin sensitivity what speaks for the concept that BNP is not diabetogenic, but&#xD;
      improves the metabolic status in patients with heart failure. This opens new questions&#xD;
      regarding BNP induced differences in glucose availability and signalling in several&#xD;
      organs/tissues.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In one of our recent studies we investigated insulin sensitivity (OGIS index) and insulin&#xD;
      secretion (beta cell function with the insulinogenic index, IGI) in patients with heart&#xD;
      insufficiency by frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance test (21). Insulin sensitivity was&#xD;
      impaired in CHF compared to control (OGIS: 354±14 ml/min/m2 vs. 450±20; p&lt;0.003). Also beta&#xD;
      cell function was reduced (IGI: 100±14 vs. 150±45 pmolINS/pmolGLUC). Interestingly a&#xD;
      significant inverse correlation exists between BNP and IGI (r=0.41, p&lt;0.05) (21). The&#xD;
      relationship between BNP and glucose metabolism has only been partially investigated. Plasma&#xD;
      BNP rises in response to hyperglycemia, but is not influenced by hyperinsulinemia (22, 23).&#xD;
      On the other side, the physiological role of BNP on beta cell function and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity has not been investigated to date. As BNP levels rise with the degree of heart&#xD;
      insufficiency and insulin resistance correlates to the degree of cardiomyopathy, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that BNP influences glucose metabolism in healthy men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One gold standard investigation of both beta cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      is the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). The&#xD;
      FSIGT consists in giving intravenously a glucose bolus at time point 0 followed by an&#xD;
      intravenous administration of insulin at time point 20 minutes (18,19, 20). The determination&#xD;
      of glucose, insulin and C-peptide at frequent intervals till time point 180 minutes allows&#xD;
      the calculation of the acute insulin response, glucose effectiveness, insulin clearance and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity through the minimal model analysis (13) The intravenous administration of&#xD;
      3 pmol/kg/min BNP achieves a plateau of increased BNP plasma concentrations after 60 minutes.&#xD;
      In previous publications, this infusion was administered during 4 hours, achieving a steady&#xD;
      state plasma BNP between time points 60 minutes and 240 minutes (17). Using this already&#xD;
      established protocol, we aim to maintain constantly high plasma BNP levels throughout the&#xD;
      three hours of the FSIGT. The combination of both BNP (17) and FSIGT (13) protocols in an&#xD;
      interventional study will be an adequate means of investigating the impact of BNP on glucose&#xD;
      metabolism in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to investigate the effect of intravenous infusion of BNP-32 (American&#xD;
      Peptide, Calif., US) on the beta cell function and insulin sensitivity during FSIGT in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -65, -60, -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19, 22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120,&#xD;
      140, 150 and 180 min for the measurement of glucose, insulin and C-peptide (8 ml per time&#xD;
      point: time points -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19, 22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 100, 140&#xD;
      and 180 min), for the measurement of BNP and NT-proBNP (4 ml per time point: time points -65,&#xD;
      -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min) and for the measurement of plasma sodium,&#xD;
      potassium and creatinine (8 ml per time point: time points -60, 60 and 180 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameter is area under the curve of insulin (AUCinsulin) from time point -30&#xD;
      to 180 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome parameters are AUCglucose and AUCc-peptide from time point -30 to 180 min,&#xD;
      BNP- and NT-proBNP levels from time point -65 to 180, plasma sodium, potassium and creatinine&#xD;
      from time point -60 to 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study days volunteers will come to the study room at around 07:45 a.m. after an overnight&#xD;
      fasting. After being weighed, they will remain in bed throughout the study, except when&#xD;
      standing to pass urine. Two vein flow needles (Venflon, Helsingborg, Sweden) will be inserted&#xD;
      in the antecubital veins of the right and left arm for the administration of infusions and&#xD;
      blood sampling respectively. The subjects will rest for approximately 15 minutes before&#xD;
      obtaining baseline blood samples (at time point - 65 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 pmol/kg/min human BNP-32 (American Peptide, Calif., US) which is solved in Haemaccel (10&#xD;
      mL/h), or placebo (Haemaccel, 10 mL/h, alone) will be continuously administered for 4 hours,&#xD;
      between time points -60 and 180 minutes, using a syringe pump (Treonic, Vickers Medical,&#xD;
      Basingstoke, United Kingdom). A washout period of at least 2 weeks will be between the&#xD;
      administration of BNP and placebo on the two different study days. This protocol has been&#xD;
      used in the study of Lainchbury et al. (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      330 mg/kg body weight glucose will be administered as a bolus during 30 seconds at time point&#xD;
      0-0.5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.03 IU/kg rapidly acting insulin (Actrapid, Novo-Nordisk, Denmark) will be infused&#xD;
      intravenously for 5 minutes starting at time point 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at time points: -65, -60, -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19,&#xD;
      22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120, 140, 150 and 180 min for the measurement of&#xD;
      glucose, insulin and C-peptide (8 ml per time point: time points -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,&#xD;
      14, 19, 22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 100, 140 and 180 min), for the measurement of BNP and&#xD;
      NT-proBNP (4 ml per time point: time points -65, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180&#xD;
      min) and for the measurement of plasma sodium, potassium and creatinine (8 ml per time point:&#xD;
      time points -60, 60 and 180 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final safety blood sample will be collected at time point 270 min for plasma sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, creatinine and BNP, NT-proBNP, sodium, potassium, creatinine, GPT, gamma-GT, total&#xD;
      bilirubin to ensure that (NT-pro)BNP levels returned to baseline and other parameters are&#xD;
      within the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total volume of blood withdrawal will be about 230 ml. When voiding, the subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to collect the urine excreted during the study period (-65 till 180 minutes). for the&#xD;
      measurement of sodium, potassium and creatinine excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate and blood pressure will be continuously monitored during the whole study. If the&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure is lower than 85 mmHg or the heart rate is less than 50 beats per&#xD;
      minute BNP infusion will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis for estimating insulin sensitivity, ß-cell secretion, insulin clearance,&#xD;
      insulin hepatic extraction and insulin appearance rate will be done by minimal model computer&#xD;
      analysis of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test&#xD;
