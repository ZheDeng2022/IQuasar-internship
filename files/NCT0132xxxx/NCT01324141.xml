  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for anal cancer can cause irritation of the skin that&#xD;
      can lead to redness and tenderness, and in some cases can be so severe that it results in&#xD;
      blistering or peeling of the skin during treatment. These conditions cause discomfort and may&#xD;
      require breaks from radiation treatment. Researchers are interested in determining whether&#xD;
      MTS-01, a drug that protects cells and tissues from the effects of radiation, can be given&#xD;
      before radiation treatment to prevent these side effects and reduce the irritation of the&#xD;
      skin during chemotherapy and radiation for anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of topical MTS-01 given before radiation in the&#xD;
      groin and gluteal cleft of patients receiving combined radiation and chemotherapy for anal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer of the anal canal&#xD;
      and are eligible to receive radiation and chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,&#xD;
           imaging studies and physical examination of the anal canal, and biopsies as needed to&#xD;
           evaluate eligibility for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be scheduled for radiation and chemotherapy treatments on the&#xD;
           following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, with topical MTS-01 treatment on the skin&#xD;
           in the groin areas and between the buttocks before each treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitomycin C given intravenously on days 1 and 29 of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-Fluorouracil given intravenously over 4 days (first week and fifth week) during&#xD;
           radiation treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored throughout the treatment for side effects, with&#xD;
           photographs of the treatment area and frequent blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the end of radiation, participants will have followup visits for 1 year with&#xD;
           blood tests and imaging studies to evaluate the response to treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with non-metastatic carcinoma of the anal canal are treated with concurrent&#xD;
           mitomycin C (MMC), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and radiotherapy (RT) in the curative setting&#xD;
           in an attempt to preserve the anal sphincter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation dermatitis is a uniform complication of this therapy which frequently results&#xD;
           in treatment delay due to pain and discomfort. High grade dermatitis may also become&#xD;
           superinfected in the setting of decreased blood counts from chemotherapy and diarrhea&#xD;
           from radiation proctitis, further delaying therapy. Approaches that decrease toxicity&#xD;
           may be particularly important in patients infected with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MTS-01 (tempol, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) is a piperidine&#xD;
           nitroxide known to act as a chemical radioprotector with selective protection of normal&#xD;
           versus tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tempol gel (tempol 70 mg/mL plus water, ethanol, and hydroxypropyl cellulose) has been&#xD;
           evaluated as a topical radioprotector in pilot trials that included a variety of sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of topical MTS-01 on a daily&#xD;
           basis prior to irradiation in the groin and gluteal cleft of patients receiving combined&#xD;
           therapy with MMC, 5-FU, and RT for carcinoma of the anal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives will include evaluation of the following endpoints in a preliminary&#xD;
           fashion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To describe the rates and severity of skin toxicity in patients treated with this&#xD;
                regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To describe the need for toxicity related treatment breaks with this regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To describe the opiate requirements in patients treated with this regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To describe 12-month progression-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall&#xD;
                survival in patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and&#xD;
                MTS-01&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the effects of antiretroviral therapy, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and&#xD;
                radiation on low level persistent HIV viremia and HIV genetic diversity during&#xD;
                therapy and recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the feasibility of collecting HIV RNA and mononuclear cells from rectal&#xD;
                associated lymphoid tissue for correlative studies&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect and store anal cytology and core needle biopsies of tumor for future HPV&#xD;
                and tumor based analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed carcinoma of the anal canal without evidence of distant&#xD;
           metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No contraindications to definitive chemoradiotherapy for carcinoma of the anal canal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot trial of topical MTS-01 in patients receiving MMC, 5-FU, and IMRT for&#xD;
      definitive management of carcinoma of the anal canal. Fifteen patients will be enrolled. MMC&#xD;
      will be delivered at a dose of 10mg/m(2) on days 1 and 29. 5-FU will be delivered as&#xD;
      1000mg/m(2)/day as 96 hour continuous infusion beginning on day 1 and 29. RT will be&#xD;
      delivered to a total dose of 50-54 Gy based on tumor characteristics. Tempol gel will be&#xD;
      applied to the bilateral groins and the gluteal cleft, avoiding a 3 cm radius from the anal&#xD;
      verge, immediately prior to each fraction of RT. RTOG grading will be used to evaluate skin&#xD;
      toxicity in both the groin and gluteal cleft weekly during treatment and at 4 weeks, 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months after completion of treatment. The duration of treatment, number of treatment&#xD;
      breaks, opiate requirements, and level of pain will be evaluated weekly during treatment and&#xD;
      at 4 weeks and 3 months after the completion of treatment. Disease control will be assessed&#xD;
      at 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
