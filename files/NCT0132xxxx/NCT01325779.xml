      Study hypothesis: Subcutaneous enoxaparin is more effective than subcutaneous heparin in&#xD;
      preventing the development of DVT in the general surgical intensive care unit population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients are at increased risk for the development of blood clots in the legs,&#xD;
      known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Surgical patients are in a higher risk category than&#xD;
      the general hospital population due to a number of factors including undergoing surgery and&#xD;
      increased risk of immobility. The highest risk patients are in the surgical intensive care&#xD;
      unit, where their surgical risks for blood clots are combined with issues such as sepsis,&#xD;
      acquired blood clotting disorders, and increasing age, each of which are factors that&#xD;
      contribute to the risk of blood clot development. 1. Patients who develop these blood clots&#xD;
      (DVTs) are at risk for chronic leg swelling, pain, and in some cases, chronic ulcer&#xD;
      development on the leg. In the worst case scenario, these blood clots can break away and&#xD;
      migrate to the lungs where they cause a pulmonary embolism (PE), a clot in the lungs that can&#xD;
      cause significant breathing difficulty requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, and&#xD;
      in some cases, death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent research, DVTs account for over 200,000 patient deaths each year&#xD;
      nationwide. 2. A large amount of data has supported the use of medication called heparin or&#xD;
      enoxaparin in low doses to prevent these blood clots from forming while in the hospital. Both&#xD;
      of these medications are considered standard of care for use patients considered moderate and&#xD;
      high risk for the development of DVT. 3. While both of these medications have been shown to&#xD;
      significantly reduce the occurrence of DVT in appropriate doses, 4. there has never been a&#xD;
      direct comparison of the two medications in the highest-risk population of the surgical&#xD;
      intensive care unit. Our own preliminary data suggests patients may have a lower incidence of&#xD;
      DVTs with the use of enoxaparin versus heparin. Part of the reason for this may be the&#xD;
      requirement for three times daily dosing of the heparin compared to once daily dosing for&#xD;
      enoxaparin. There may also be some inherent differences in the efficacy of the medications&#xD;
      themselves.&#xD;
