  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medications that lower blood pressure and cholesterol are known to improve the shape and&#xD;
      function of our blood vessels. These improvements include a reduction in the thickness of the&#xD;
      wall of the carotid artery (the main artery that runs up the neck to supply the brain) and a&#xD;
      reduction in the stiffness of arteries generally including the main central artery -the&#xD;
      aorta. Such medications are in the polypill (the Red Heart Pill) that is being used in the&#xD;
      UMPIRE Study. In UMPIRE, patients' reported adherence to taking the single, once daily&#xD;
      polypill is being compared to adherence to medications taken as separate tablets (usual&#xD;
      care).The aim of the PESCA sub-study is to see whether or not the polypill differs from&#xD;
      'usual care' in its direct effects on blood vessels as shown by ultrasound examination of the&#xD;
      carotid arteries and assessment of central (aortic) blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PESCA is a substudy of the UMPIRE clinical trial which is evaluating a 'polypill' treatment&#xD;
      strategy for subjects with established cardiovascular disease or at high risk. All PESCA&#xD;
      subjects will have already been recruited to UMPIRE and randomised to taking either a single&#xD;
      'polypill' (comprising low dose aspirin, a cholesterol-lowering statin, and one of two blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering medicines) or their usual treatment consisting of similar medication in&#xD;
      more than one separate tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PESCA will evaluate whether: 1) progression of atherosclerosis (fatty deposits which narrow&#xD;
      the arteries and impair blood flow to vital organs); and 2) central systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (the pressure in the body's main artery, the aorta, when the heart pumps out blood), are&#xD;
      reduced in 'polypill' recipients compared to those who continue their usual treatment.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis and central blood pressure are both strongly associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of heart attacks and stroke. Atherosclerosis will be assessed by ultrasound scanning of the&#xD;
      carotid (neck) arteries to look at thickness of the artery walls (carotid intima media&#xD;
      thickness)and plaques(fatty deposits). Direct measurement of central blood pressure is&#xD;
      impractical but it will be estimated using a computerised &quot;pulsecor&quot; device. This uses an&#xD;
      inflatable cuff on the arm but provides a detailed recording of the pressure wave as the cuff&#xD;
      is deflated which enables &quot;pulsecor&quot; to calculate central blood pressure. Results from both&#xD;
      ultrasound and blood pressure investigations will be reviewed by investigators who do not&#xD;
      know whether the subjects have been randomised to the polypill or their usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PESCA assessments will be conducted at 2 visits:baseline (as soon as possible after&#xD;
      recruitment to the UMPIRE study); and at the end of both studies (which will coincide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel studies are being undertaken in the three European sites (UK, Eire and Netherlands)&#xD;
      participating in the UMPIRE trial with each site aiming to recruit 300 participants.&#xD;

    <description>The polypill will be taken once/day in the form of a hard capsule, to be taken orally. There are two versions of the polypill (Red Heart Pill):&#xD;
Version 1 contains aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, Lisinopril 10mg and Atenolol 50mg; Version 2 contains aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, Lisinopril 10mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg.&#xD;
Red Heart Pill Version 1 and Red Heart Pill Version 2. In general, participants with a history of coronary heart disease will be given version 1, and those with a history of stroke or cerebrovascular disease will be given version 2.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients must meet the inclusion criteria for the UMPIRE trial, and be consented to take&#xD;
        part in the PESCA sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals are eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria are satisfied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults (≥ 18 years) The participant is able to give informed consent. Established&#xD;
        atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or high cardiovascular risk, defined as;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, or coronary revascularisation procedure), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic&#xD;
             attack), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of peripheral vascular disease (peripheral revascularisation procedure or&#xD;
             amputation due to vascular disease), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For individuals without established cardiovascular disease, a calculated 5 year CVD&#xD;
             risk of 15% or greater (calculated using the 1991 Anderson Framingham risk equation&#xD;
             with adjustments as defined by the New Zealand Guidelines Group recommendations) The&#xD;
             trial Investigator considers that each of the polypill components are indicated at the&#xD;
             doses in the Red Heart Pill The trial Investigator is unsure as to whether a&#xD;
             polypill-based strategy or usual care is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will NOT be eligible if one or more of the following criteria are satisfied:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to any of the components of the polypill (e.g. known intolerance to&#xD;
             aspirin, statins, or ACE inhibitors; pregnancy or likely to become pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding women during the treatment period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The treating doctor considers that changing a participant's cardiovascular medications&#xD;
             would put the participant at risk (e.g. symptomatic heart failure, high dose β-blocker&#xD;
             required to manage angina or for rate control in atrial fibrillation, accelerated&#xD;
             hypertension, severe renal insufficiency, a history of severe resistant hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other potential reasons for exclusion include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known situation where medication regimen might be altered for a significant length of&#xD;
             time, e.g. current acute cardiovascular event, planned coronary bypass graft&#xD;
             operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unlikely to complete the trial (e.g. life-threatening condition other than&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease) or adhere to the trial procedures or attend study visits (e.g.&#xD;
             major psychiatric condition, dementia).&#xD;
