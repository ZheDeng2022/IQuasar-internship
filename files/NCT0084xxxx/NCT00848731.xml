      This study will test the hypothesis that patients with acute PE and dyspnea can safely inhale&#xD;
      NO. The secondary hypothesis is that patients who are blinded to the inhaled NO concentration&#xD;
      will sustain subjective improvement in their perception of dyspnea based upon their reported&#xD;
      Borg dyspnea score, during inhalation of NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test if patients with acute PE and shortness of breath of severity ≥ 5 on a 0-10 scale&#xD;
           called the Borg score can have inhaled nitric oxide administered via nasal cannula or&#xD;
           face mask in a titration protocol that increases concentration by 5 ppm in 5 min steps&#xD;
           to a maximum of 25 ppm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will measure the number of patients who meet an absolute safety endpoint during&#xD;
           titration. An absolute safety endpoint requires execution of a rapid weaning protocol (2&#xD;
           ppm decrease per minute to 0 ppm).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Absolute safety endpoints: Two consecutive SBP measurements more than one min apart with&#xD;
           both readings &lt; 80 mm Hg;SaO 2 &lt;80% for more than 15 seconds; Patient deterioration as&#xD;
           defined by: Clinical decision for need of inotropic or pressor support for any reason,&#xD;
           seizure, new altered mental status, focal neurological signs suggestive of cerebral&#xD;
           ischemia, evidence of myocardial ischemia, protracted vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test if the patient-reported Borg score decreases with administration of NO. Patients&#xD;
           will not be told any details about the timing of the titration and will not be made&#xD;
           aware of their iNO concentration when the Borg score is assessed.&#xD;

      We propose to enroll a total of 25 patients with recently diagnosed pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will include moderate to severe shortness of breath as rated by the&#xD;
      patient on a standard scoring system, a systolic blood pressure of &gt;89 mm Hg unless the&#xD;
      patient has a known prior history of low blood pressure, and blood oxygen saturation of &gt;80%.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include: altered mental status, inability to use a nasal cannula, a&#xD;
      large need for supplemental oxygen, pregnancy, pneumothorax, recent use of nitrate-containing&#xD;
      medications, recent use of thrombolytic drugs, requirement for inotropic or pressor support,&#xD;
      or a level of methemoglobin greater than 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, subjects will have blood drawn and vital signs will be&#xD;
      obtained. They will subsequently begin to breathe oxygen and NO supplied through a nasal&#xD;
      cannula delivered from the iNOvent device. The patients will undergo serial measurements of&#xD;
      their blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation and will have their serum methemoglobin&#xD;
      level monitored via a non-invasive probe. Titration of the amount of NO delivered will be&#xD;
      made periodically based on the patient's vital signs. If an absolute safety endpoint is&#xD;
      reached, NO will be rapidly weaned. Based on the patient's response to NO as determined by&#xD;
      their vital signs, a maintenance dose of NO, not to exceed 25 ppm, will be reached. Subjects&#xD;
      will continue to receive this concentration for up to 2 hours prior to weaning. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked once more to rate the severity of their shortness of breath and blood will be drawn&#xD;
      just prior to weaning. Should the patient reach a safety endpoint, the NO will be weaned at&#xD;
      an earlier timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will determine the percentage of patients able to complete the full protocol without&#xD;
      reaching a safety endpoint, the percent change in methemoglobin level, the trend in&#xD;
      patient-reported shortness of breath, percent change in SBP and oxygen saturation and the&#xD;
      number of patients who withdraw during induction for any reason.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of acute PE requires symptoms of PE present &lt;14 days with CT angiography&#xD;
             interpreted as positive for acute PE. Initial evaluation for PE must be predicated&#xD;
             upon the investigation of new or unexplained cardiopulmonary or chest-related clinical&#xD;
             features consistent with PE, including shortness of breath, chest pain, respiratory&#xD;
             distress, dizziness, unexplained tachypnea, tachycardia, syncope, cough or hemoptysis.&#xD;
             All patients must have CT chest angiography with &lt;2 mm collimation,(36) with or&#xD;
             without indirect venography. Pulmonary arterial opacification will be achieved with&#xD;
             power injection of non-ionic, low osmolar contrast in an antecubital vein with a&#xD;
             timing run; the pitch, voltage, gantry speed and other technical details appropriate&#xD;
             for each scanner.(37;38) Images will be interpreted as positive for intrapulmonary&#xD;
             arterial filling defect consistent with acute PE using our published&#xD;
             definitions(37;38) by a board-certified radiologist with specialty training in body CT&#xD;
             or emergency medicine imaging in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. SBP (SBP)&gt; 89 mm Hg at the time of enrollment. We will allow enrollment for a patient&#xD;
             with an SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg prior to enrollment, or a patient with a SBP&gt;80 mm Hg, if the&#xD;
             patient has a documented or patient-identified history of low blood pressure and has&#xD;
             no symptoms of shock, as described by Jones et al.(39)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. SaO2% &gt;80% at time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have a Borg score greater than 4/10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Altered mental status such that they are unable to provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to use a nasal cannula or face mask (e.g., anatomic defect)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Supplemental oxygen requirement greater than can be administered via nasal cannula or&#xD;
             face mask in order to maintain SaO2 &gt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pneumothorax with decompression&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A serum mtHb greater than 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Concurrent therapies including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Viagra® (sildenafil) use within the past 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Levitra® (vardenafil) use within the past 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Cialis® (tadalafil) use within the past 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Use nitroprusside or nitroglycerine with in the past 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Concomitant use of pressor or inotropic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Use of fibrinolytic agent with in the past 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Use of nitrates within the past 24 hours&#xD;
