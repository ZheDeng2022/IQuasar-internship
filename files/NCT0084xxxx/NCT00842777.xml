      Long term effects of treatment of childhood obesity are not well documented but there is&#xD;
      growing evidence that parental involvement and behavioral changes are strong predictors of&#xD;
      children weight loss. However, which form and content of parental involvement are most&#xD;
      effective is not studied. In the present randomized controlled study we compare the effect of&#xD;
      parent manualized group treatment (&quot;experimental group&quot;) to the effect of parent self-help&#xD;
      groups on changes in children Body Mass Index, food intake, physical activity, quality of&#xD;
      life and self esteem. We pose the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parents participating in the experimental group will have children who achieve a larger&#xD;
           reduction in BMI than children with their parents in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This treatment effect will be mediated by changes in one of several elements of parents'&#xD;
           cognition: outcome expectancies, perceived control, perceived value of outcome,&#xD;
           self-efficacy, perceived reduction in barriers, and subjective norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduction in BMI will correlate with increased quality of life, reduced number and&#xD;
           severity of mental health problems, and increased self-concept.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity as increased dramatically in substantial parts of the world during&#xD;
      the last decade, a weight increase also seen in children. This epidemic has also reached&#xD;
      Norway, with a worrying increase in the prevalence of overweight and obese school aged&#xD;
      children. Reports from US studies show a substantial increase in diabetes II among overweight&#xD;
      children. Such an increase is currently not detected among Norwegian children. However, if&#xD;
      the increase in childhood obesity continues or worsens, we should expect the onset of weight&#xD;
      related disorders such as Diabetes II and Cardio-vascular to take place earlier in life. In&#xD;
      addition, there would be an expected increase in psychosocial problems (poor self-concept,&#xD;
      social isolation) and psychiatric symptoms and disorders associated with obesity (e.g. eating&#xD;
      problems and depression). Hence, both preventive and treatment efforts are called for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents need to be included The treatment of obesity among children has traditionally&#xD;
      addressed the child by means of diet and exercise, often involving in-patient treatment.&#xD;
      Slowly, the evidence concerning the importance of including the parents in the treatment have&#xD;
      emerged as well as the need for addressing the child's wider social context. Hence, childhood&#xD;
      obesity should first and foremost be conceived of as a behavioral problem. Generally,&#xD;
      behaviorally oriented approaches have emerged as the most successful. Such behavioral&#xD;
      procedures have been conducted within a framework of individual consultations to each&#xD;
      child/family. It was reported that after family oriented behavioral treatment 30 % of the&#xD;
      previously overweight children no longer qualified for overweight, whereas 34 % had sustained&#xD;
      minimum 20 % reduction in their overweight. The best predictors of the long term course of&#xD;
      overweight reduction were the family eating and exercise environment, in addition to support&#xD;
      from friends and family. Notably, the intervention group targeting both children and parents&#xD;
      fared best. Such a finding concurs with the conclusion that family and parent based&#xD;
      approaches are associated with weight loss among obese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less is known concerning the specifics of effective parental involvement, that is which form&#xD;
      of parental involvement are most effective and the content of effective interventions.&#xD;
      Therapies targeting individual families are costly to undertake and time consuming for the&#xD;
      family. We therefore need to balance the benefits of family treatment with their costs,&#xD;
      aiming at an optimal intervention level that provides the best therapeutic results with the&#xD;
      lowest degree of investments. We will therefore adopt a group treatment paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lessons should be learned from the treatment of other childhood behavioral problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, interventions within pediatric obesity has to a surprisingly little extent drawn&#xD;
      upon the mounting knowledge from successful interventions regarding other types of childhood&#xD;
      behavioral problems, e.g. conduct problems. Such interventions generally try to strengthen&#xD;
      general parenting practices (e.g. limit setting, consistency, anger management, affective&#xD;
      availability) in order to increase the parents' competencies in regulating the child's&#xD;
      problem behavior. The behavioral techniques that traditional obesity intervention programs&#xD;
      try to get parents to adapt at home (e.g. getting their children to exercise more or eat&#xD;
      smaller portions) seem to require some basic parenting skills. When parents fall short of&#xD;
      actually doing what they have learned, it may be due to the fact that regarding eating and&#xD;
      physical activity, the behavior of obese children are especially demanding and putting&#xD;
      parenting skills to the test. Hence, specific training of skills that increase the likelihood&#xD;
      of behavioral change in the parent and in the child should be included in intervention&#xD;
      programs. In doing so, manualized treatment should be encouraged in order to facilitate&#xD;
      replications and clinical use, but is often left wanting. Although some exception do exist,&#xD;
      many studies only include short-term post-treatment outcomes only. Thus, children need to be&#xD;
      followed for longer time periods, due to the fact that short-term weight reduction is&#xD;
      achieved by numerous intervention strategies, whereas long-term weight reduction should be&#xD;
      the primary goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lessons should be learned from general models of health behavior Within a preventive&#xD;
      framework several theoretical models have been devised pinpointing the cognitive and social&#xD;
      factors determining health promoting behaviors, also including health behaviors important for&#xD;
      the development of adiposity in childhood. The predictive power of such models in determining&#xD;
      future health behaviors is high, also when eating and physical activity in children and&#xD;
      adolescents are considered. Such basic knowledge has only to a very limited extent been&#xD;
      integrated into treatment models of obesity in childhood. We hence aim at targeting those&#xD;
      behaviors in parents that may facilitate health promoting behavior in their offspring.&#xD;
      Numerous models of health behaviors exist. Their construct overlap to some extent, but each&#xD;
      have some merits of their own. Our vantage point has therefore been the arguably most widely&#xD;
      accepted model of health behavior, namely Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior, and&#xD;
      supplementing it with the barriers towards health promoting behavior element stemming from&#xD;
      the &quot;Health Belief Model&quot; and Bandura's concept of self-efficacy (1977), viz. the person's&#xD;
      beliefs in her/his ability to perform the behavior in question. Figure 1 depicts our&#xD;
      theoretical model for the content of the parent based group intervention program. In&#xD;
      addition, we expect that weight reduction will imply additional positive outcomes for the&#xD;
      child including increased quality of life, increased self-concept and reduction in&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms. However, we should expect that such characteristics of the child may&#xD;
      moderate the effect of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The considerations above imply that treatment programs for childhood obesity should:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim for enduring life-style changes with respect to eating and physical activity. The&#xD;
           treatment should target the family members' habits and cognitions. Low intensity&#xD;
           interventions are the ones that are applicable in most practical contexts, and such&#xD;
           programs demand less extensive efforts and changes of the family's way of living, are&#xD;
           ones that also have the potential for success in the long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Target the children's behavior by means of involving their parents. We contend that it&#xD;
           is more effective to have the parents regulating their child's eating and exercising&#xD;
           behavior than having health personnel trying to do this directly by treating the child&#xD;
           on his or her own. Parents can thus regulate the stimulus conditions that govern the&#xD;
           child's eating and exercising behavior by reducing cues and possibilities for excessive&#xD;
           intake of fattening foods, and increasing cues and opportunities for physical activity&#xD;
           and healthy eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Strengthen general and specific parenting skills. Teaching parents about the importance&#xD;
           of healthy eating, meal preparation, and physical activity is not enough to achieve&#xD;
           enduring effects. The main challenge is not for parents not knowing what to do, but&#xD;
           rather actually being able to carry through the behavior in front of challenges or&#xD;
           barriers (e.g. being bereaved of the opportunity to having a snack themselves;&#xD;
           guilt-inducing behavior from the child). By addressing their own behavior and by&#xD;
           teaching specific skills to overcome such barriers, parents may learn new parenting&#xD;
           skills that alter the conditions for their child's behavior in a long-term perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Target the parents' cognitions about the effect of their own behavior. The treatment&#xD;
           should address those cognitions that maintain their weight related behavior towards the&#xD;
           child. These cognitions are outlined in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treat parents in groups. Group treatments are cost-effective. In addition, parents of&#xD;
           obese children may learn from the experience of other parents, and they may provide&#xD;
           emotional and social support. Finally, the social control element of reporting of&#xD;
           completion or failure to perform homework between sessions should not be underestimated.&#xD;
           However, in order to secure that the needs of each family/child are met, individual&#xD;
           sessions including weight control should be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Focus on mastery and solutions. In order to promote treatment optimism the treatment&#xD;
           should address what the family actually has achieved at the expense of failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present we have little knowledge about the demographics and psychosocial characteristics&#xD;
      of clinic-referred children with adiposity in Norway. We will provide descriptive information&#xD;
      about this population concerning medical conditions and nutritional status, as well as&#xD;
      psychological factors and potential psychiatric symptoms associated with overweight.&#xD;
      Moreover, we will address the issue whether successful treatment also will alleviate&#xD;
      psychosocial problems such as self-concept problems and increases quality of life. Finally,&#xD;
      we ask whether weight reduction in the child are associated with changes in the parents'&#xD;
      health beliefs, whether the expected changes in parental health beliefs mediate the effect of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
