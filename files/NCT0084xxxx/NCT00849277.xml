  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether probiotic treatment improves the protection&#xD;
      against respiratory infections after influenza vaccination in elderly living in nursing&#xD;
      homes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus is a member of the orthomyxovirus family and causes an acute viral disease of&#xD;
      the respiratory tract. The illness is usually self-limiting. Hospitalization and deaths&#xD;
      mainly occur in high-risk groups (elderly, chronically ill). Response to vaccination is&#xD;
      subject to high levels of variability due to age, stress, nutritional stage, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactic acid bacteria are naturally commensal bacteria in the small and large intestines.&#xD;
      These bacteria protect the host against potential pathogens by competitive exclusion and also&#xD;
      by the production of antibacterial agents known as bacteriocins. It has only been recently&#xD;
      shown that another mechanism whereby probiotic bacteria may provide a health benefit is by&#xD;
      modulating immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) is widely consumed in fermented milk products.&#xD;
      Several studies, in animals as wells as in humans, report on the immunomodulatory functions&#xD;
      of LcS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicentre, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study (RCT) is to&#xD;
      assess if probiotic treatment with Lactobacillus casei Shirota improves the protection&#xD;
      against influenza(-like) infections after vaccination with trivalent influenza vaccine in&#xD;
      elderly residing in nursing homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical outcome: difference in incidence in upper respiratory tract infections&#xD;
           (influenza-like illness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serological outcome: difference in influenza vaccine specific serum IgG between&#xD;
           probiotic and control treatment&#xD;
