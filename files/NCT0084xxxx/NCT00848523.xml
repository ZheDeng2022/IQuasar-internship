    <textblock>
      The drug LBH589 (panobinostat) is an experimental (investigational) drug that is being tested&#xD;
      for recurrent (returning) malignant gliomas. An investigational drug is one that has not been&#xD;
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It belongs to a new class of drugs&#xD;
      called &quot;histone deacetylase inhibitors.&quot; Histones are proteins located in the nucleus of&#xD;
      cells that bind to DNA, the chemical that makes up genes. These proteins help control which&#xD;
      genes are turned &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off.&quot; Studies have shown that drugs like panobinostat (LBH589) may&#xD;
      lead to tumor cell death.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for recurrent malignant gliomas remains dismal despite advances in neurological&#xD;
      surgery, radiation oncology and chemotherapy. Median overall survival remains a mere 14.6&#xD;
      months and 2 yr survival 25% (Stupp et al.) Novel treatments are clearly needed for recurrent&#xD;
      gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggests that histone deacetylase inhibition may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for recurrent malignant gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1999, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Saito reported that&#xD;
      MS-27-275, a benzamide derivative and inhibitor of histone deacetylase, inhibited the growth&#xD;
      of several different human tumor cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug you are being asked to take is called LBH589 or panobinostat. It belongs to a new&#xD;
      class of drugs called &quot;histone deacetylase inhibitors.&quot; Histones are proteins located in the&#xD;
      nucleus of cells that bind to DNA, the chemical that makes up genes. These proteins help&#xD;
      control which genes are turned &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;. Studies have shown that drugs like&#xD;
      panobinostat (LBH589) may lead to tumor cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting on-study, we will require that some standard blood tests be done. You may&#xD;
      have other tests done as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LBH589 (panobinostat) is a drug that you will take three times weekly by mouth on Monday,&#xD;
      Wednesday and Friday. You will take the capsules with an 8 ounce glass of water (not&#xD;
      grapefruit or orange juice) on an empty stomach at least 2 hours after meals and 2 hours&#xD;
      before next meal. Cycles are twenty eight (28) days long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug may affect your heart rhythm. Therefore, we will closely monitor your heart by&#xD;
      doing an electrocardiogram (ECG) while you are taking the study drug. On the first day that&#xD;
      you start taking the drug, we will record your ECG at several different time points: three&#xD;
      ECG's at 5 minute intervals before you take your first dose and then again at 2 hours, 4-6&#xD;
      hours and 24-32 hours after you take your first dose. On days 5 and 19 of the first cycle&#xD;
      (the first twenty eight days) we will also obtain (3) more ECG's: one before you take your&#xD;
      daily dose and then two more at 2 hours and 4-6 hours after taking the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On future cycles (cycle 2 and thereafter) we will obtain single ECG's on days # 5 and 22 if&#xD;
      there had been no prior abnormal readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will return to clinic for follow-up examination midway through the first cycle and then&#xD;
      again upon completion of the first cycle and each following cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up blood tests will be obtained at the end of the first, second and fourth weeks of&#xD;
      the first cycle and then at the end of each following cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up MRI (or CAT) scans will be obtained according to standard of care after each second&#xD;
      cycle unless medically indicated at other time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other scans, such as PET scans, may be obtained if medically indicated as per standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
