  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Carnitine is the essential cofactor for various enzyme activities of human&#xD;
      metabolism, especially for the mitochondrial carnitine shuttle that transfers long-chain&#xD;
      fatty acids as acylcarnitine esters across the inner mitochondrial membrane for&#xD;
      Beta-oxidation and energy production. Intracellular carnitine deficiency induces an&#xD;
      impairment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation. In human, approximately 75% of carnitine comes&#xD;
      from the diet and 25% from endogenous liver synthesis. In the neonatal period, more&#xD;
      specifically in the premature, liver synthesis capacity is reduced because of immaturity of&#xD;
      the biosynthetic pathway, and carnitine levels are related to exogenous sources.&#xD;
      Traditionally, carnitine is not added to parenteral nutrition. Indeed, without enteral feeds&#xD;
      and carnitine supplementation of parenteral nutrition, preterm infants' plasma carnitine&#xD;
      levels fall during the first weeks of life, particularly in subjects requiring a prolonged&#xD;
      exclusive parenteral nutrition. The potential deleterious role of carnitine deficiency has&#xD;
      not been clearly demonstrated in these infants. However, most patients with primary carnitine&#xD;
      deficiency, a genetic defect of carnitine transport inducing a severe carnitine deficiency,&#xD;
      commonly develop liver symptoms (encompassing visceral steatosis, hyperammonemia and&#xD;
      recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycemias) and/or cardiomyopathy and myopathy. In these latter&#xD;
      patients, carnitine supplementation improves all the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Carnitine deficiency of the premature and very low birth weight infants may be&#xD;
      one of the factors involved in the liver disease frequently associated with prolonged&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition, and may have deleterious effects on cardiac and muscle metabolism and&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To demonstrate beneficial effects of parenteral carnitine supplementation in premature&#xD;
      neonates for liver, heart and muscle metabolism and functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: Multicentric prospective and randomised study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Premature and very low birth weight neonates, defined by gestational age minor or&#xD;
      equal to 28 weeks and/or birth weight minor or equal to 1000 grams, 80 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled during 2.5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Arm 1 (experimental): parenteral carnitine supplementation (9 ± 1 mg/kg/d),&#xD;
      from day 4, until than enteral nutrition provides sufficient carnitine source; Arm 2 (Placebo&#xD;
      comparator): parenteral supplementation with an equivalent volume of sterile water.&#xD;

      Study Type: Multicentric prospective and randomised study&#xD;

      Subjects: Premature and very low birth weight neonates, defined by gestational age minor or&#xD;
      equal to 28 weeks and/or birth weight minor or equal to 1000 grams, 80 subjects will be&#xD;

      comparator): parenteral supplementation with an equivalent volume of sterile water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Plasma Gamma Glutamyl Transferase level after 21 days of parenteral&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Short- (during parenteral supplementation) and long- (3 to 5 months of&#xD;
      age) term outcomes: 1) Liver function (levels of ammonemia, hyaluronic acid, bilirubin,&#xD;
      prothrombin time test, ursodeoxycholic acid therapy), 2) cardiac function (echocardiography,&#xD;
      EKG), 3) muscle integrity (CK levels), 4) neurological injuries (brain ultrasound and MRI),&#xD;
      5) respiratory immaturity, 6) acylcarnitine profile and other fatty acid derivatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Findings: Systematic parenteral carnitine supplementation will prevent systemic&#xD;
      carnitine deficiency, and will improve liver dysfunction (decreased duration and severity of&#xD;
      liver disease) associated with prolonged parenteral nutrition, will improve cardiac and&#xD;
      muscle functions, and will prevent cerebral injury in premature infants with very low birth&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
