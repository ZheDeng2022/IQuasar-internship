      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and how the body affects&#xD;
      the drug CNTO 136 in healthy Japanese and Caucasian volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of CNTO 136. In a randomized trial, study medication (CNTO 136 or placebo)&#xD;
      is assigned by chance. Double-blinded means that neither the investigator nor the volunteer&#xD;
      know which of the study medication they have been assigned to receive. Pharmacokinetics is&#xD;
      the study of levels of CNTO 136 circulating in your blood over time. The study population&#xD;
      will all be male and consist of 30 Japanese and 30 Caucasian volunteers. Three dose levels of&#xD;
      study agent will be assessed. Participants will be required to stay at the research center&#xD;
      after study agent administration for the inpatient portion of the study and then required to&#xD;
      return for out-patient visits. One of 3 dose levels of CNTO 136 will be given just under the&#xD;
      skin (subcutaneous (SC)). The length of this study will be about 20 weeks.&#xD;

             physical examination, blood chemistry assessments, hematologic assessments including&#xD;
             complete blood count (CBC), coagulation tests, urinalysis, measurement of vital signs,&#xD;
             and ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese volunteers must have been born in Japan, have resided outside of Japan for no&#xD;
