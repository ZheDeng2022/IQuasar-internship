      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with a genetic defect in the ability to burn fat can also develop a problem with the&#xD;
      nerves in their feet. The nerve problem, or neuropathy, can limit their ability to walk. Part&#xD;
      of the treatment of their genetic defect in the ability to burn fat is to eat a very low fat&#xD;
      diet. Vitamin E is found only in fatty foods like oils and nuts. People with a genetic defect&#xD;
      in the ability to burn fat may have low vitamin E because of their low fat diet. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to test whether vitamin E supplements can improve the nerve function in the&#xD;
      feet of people with a genetic defect in the ability to burn fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn at the beginning of the study, after 2 months and after 6 months&#xD;
      of vitamin E supplements. The blood will be analyzed for plasma vitamin E concentrations.&#xD;
      Around the time of each blood draw subjects will record all the food and beverages he or she&#xD;
      consumes for three days. The subject will send the record to the investigator. Subjects will&#xD;
      have a physical exam by a doctor specializing in nerves, a neurologist before and after&#xD;
      taking vitamin E. They will have nerve function measured with a test called a nerve&#xD;
      conduction velocity or NCV. Subjects will be given 800 international units (IU) of vitamin E&#xD;
      per day for 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People with long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) or mitochondrial trifunctional&#xD;
      protein (TFP) deficiency, inherited disorders of fatty acid ÃŸ-oxidation, lack an ability to&#xD;
      fully oxidize fatty acids for energy. Progressive peripheral neuropathy is a chronic&#xD;
      complication of these disorders that can lead to loss of the ability to walk in about 1/3 of&#xD;
      the subjects. Current therapy for people with these disorders is based on frequent meals and&#xD;
      consuming a low fat, very high carbohydrate diet. Severe restriction of dietary fat may lead&#xD;
      to an iatrogenic fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin found in&#xD;
      cooking oils, salad dressings, and nuts. Deficiency of vitamin E can result in a peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy similar to that described in subjects with LCHAD and TFP deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Subjects with LCHAD or TFP deficiency are vitamin E deficient due to following a&#xD;
      very low fat diet. Vitamin E deficiency exacerbates the peripheral neuropathy observed in&#xD;
      this disease. High dose vitamin E supplementation will replete the vitamin E deficiency and&#xD;
      improve neurological function in subjects with LCHAD or TFP deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Measure vitamin E concentrations and neurological function at baseline in 10 subjects&#xD;
      with LCHAD or TFP deficiency. Following baseline measures, all subjects will be supplemented&#xD;
      with high dose vitamin E (400 IU capsules 2 times per day) for 6 months. Vitamin E&#xD;
      concentrations and neurological function studies will be repeated at the end of 6 months.&#xD;
      Data from before and after vitamin E supplementation will be compared by students T-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin E functions as an antioxidant and has been used in multiple large supplementation&#xD;
      trials. The upper limit of intake recommended as safe by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) is&#xD;
      600 mg or approximately 900 IU of vitamin E for children 9-13 years of age. We previously&#xD;
      reported dietary intake of this vitamin was extremely low in children with LCHAD and TFP&#xD;
      deficiency and should be supplemented (5). An iatrogenic vitamin E deficiency may exacerbate&#xD;
      and/or accelerate neuropathic symptoms in subjects with LCHAD or TFP deficiency. This&#xD;
      open-label trial tests the hypothesis that high dose vitamin E will improve neurological&#xD;
      function in subjects with LCHAD and TFP deficiency who have progressive peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design: This is an open-label supplementation trial of vitamin E in subjects&#xD;
      with LCHAD or TFP deficiency. Subjects diagnosed with LCHAD or TFP and with documented&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy will be recruited to participate. A fasting baseline blood sample will&#xD;
      be analyzed for plasma vitamin E concentrations. A neurological exam and nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies (NCV) will be performed by a neurologist as a baseline measure of neuropathy.&#xD;
      Subjects will begin high dose vitamin E supplementation for 6 months. 400 IU (268 mg)&#xD;
      capsules of will be provided for the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to take one&#xD;
      capsule with meals 2 times per day. The supplement is absorbed better when consumed with some&#xD;
      fat from food. At the end of the 2 months of supplementation, another blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed for plasma vitamin E concentrations. At the end of 6 months, a 3rd&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected and the neurological studies repeated. Differences in function&#xD;
      and NCV from baseline will be correlated with plasma vitamin E concentrations. During the 6&#xD;
      months subjects will complete 2 3-day diet records to estimate vitamin E consumption from&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Measures: Subjects will arrive to the clinic or lab for blood sampling after an&#xD;
      overnight fast of a minimum of 8 hours but not more than 12 hours. Greater than 12 hours of&#xD;
      fasting is not recommended for subjects with a fatty acid oxidation disorder. Six milliliters&#xD;
      of venous whole blood will be collected . Plasma will be separated and frozen until analysis.&#xD;
      Samples will be given a unique code in the laboratory of the principal investigator and&#xD;
      shipped to Dr. Traber's laboratory in Corvallis, Oregon. Dr. Traber, at Oregon State&#xD;
      University, will measure plasma vitamin E and vitamin E metabolites. The principal&#xD;
      investigator will maintain the code to link data to patient information. Results from Dr.&#xD;
      Traber's lab will be reported back to the principal investigator for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological Studies: A standard neurological examination will be carried out with an&#xD;
      emphasis on the sensory exam, muscle weakness exam and deep tendon reflex exam. An&#xD;
      electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction studies will also be carried out. For an EMG, a&#xD;
      needle electrode is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity&#xD;
      detected by this electrode is displayed on an oscilloscope, and may be heard through a&#xD;
      speaker. The observations of the wave forms by the physician will determine whether the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the muscle is normal or whether pathological change such as&#xD;
      denervation is present. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) is a test of the speed of signals&#xD;
      through a nerve. Patches called surface electrodes, similar to those used for ECG, are placed&#xD;
      on the skin over the nerve at various locations. Each patch gives off a very mild electrical&#xD;
      impulse, which stimulates the nerve. The nerve's resulting electrical activity is recorded by&#xD;
      the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical&#xD;
      impulses to travel between electrodes are used to determine the speed of the nerve signals.&#xD;
      Further, the amplitude of the electrical discharge will be measured and the time that the&#xD;
      impulse takes to cross the muscle-nerve junction will be determined. The electrical testing&#xD;
      will involve both the motor and sensory nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Difference in plasma vitamin E concentrations and neurological studies&#xD;
      between baseline and 6 months will be compared by student's T-test. Correlation between&#xD;
      neurological outcomes and plasma vitamin E concentrations will be evaluated with linear&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
