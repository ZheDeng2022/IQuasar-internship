  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      GSK2231395A candidate vaccine in adults and elderly adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease. Subjects will be vaccinated 3 times with an interval of respectively 2 and 10&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             exacerbations, including multiple exacerbations in the 24 months prior to Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a baseline chest X-ray obtained while untreated/off systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids for at least 30 days duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is able to perform baseline pre- and post-bronchodilator pulmonary function&#xD;
             tests while untreated/off systemic corticosteroids for at least 30 days duration and&#xD;
             not participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the subject is female, and of childbearing potential, she agrees to use acceptable&#xD;
             contraception and not become pregnant for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is established by both a screening PFT and clinical history as having very severe&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is diagnosed with a respiratory disorder other than chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a primary diagnosis of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is prescribed/receiving systemic antibiotics in the last 30 days.&#xD;

             interfere with the study, such as CAP, tuberculosis, or lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had pneumonia within 3 months prior to first vaccination.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has past or current malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders.&#xD;
