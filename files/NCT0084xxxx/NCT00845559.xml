  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of exenatide on daily glycemic&#xD;
      excursions obtained by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The CGMS summary&#xD;
      parameters that we are most interested in include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The percent of glucose values above 140 mg/dl and/or AUC of glucose values above 140&#xD;
           mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUC of glucose values over 100 mg/dl during three days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal meal-related glucose excursions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three-day mean glucose (including low readings - below 100 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  glucose tolerance status as assessed by OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular function scores as assessed by PAT, FMD and step test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical markers of vascular health, including inflammatory markers, markers of&#xD;
           oxidative stress and microalbuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in BMI&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obese insulin resistant adolescents with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or evidence of&#xD;
      glucose excursions ≥ 140 mg/dl on CGMS will be enrolled in a two armed randomized, parallel&#xD;
      group - open label study. There will also be a lean control group for baseline assessments&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One arm will be exenatide the other arm will be no drug. Subjects will be stratified&#xD;
      according to state of glucose tolerance. Stratification will also occur according to gender&#xD;
      and family history of premature cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese adolescents age 16-25 years with a family history of type 2 diabetes, whom have&#xD;
      completed or reached tanner IV stage of pubertal development and have normal or impaired oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance. Obese adolescents age 13-15 with a family history of type 2 diabetes, whom&#xD;
      have completed or reached tanner III stage of pubertal development and have impaired oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance with a 2-hour glucose of 180-199 mg/dl will also be invited to participate.&#xD;
      For cardiovascular assessment only age matched lean control subjects without diabetes will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese subjects will have a baseline and post intervention oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT),&#xD;
      screening labs (liver/kidney functions, lipid profile, thyroid function tests, CBC, metabolic&#xD;
      and cardiovascular laboratory parameters -- such as inflammatory cytokines and pro-thrombotic&#xD;
      factors), wear a CGMS for 3-days on 3 separate occasions (baseline, 2-month and 4-month),&#xD;
      have a standardized snack once during each CGMS session, collect urine samples for&#xD;
      microalbumin and have vascular tests (PAT, FMD and exercise step test) done at baseline and&#xD;
      post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to treatment will undergo a four month intervention with exenatide on the&#xD;
      following dosing schedule: exenatide - 5 μg twice a day for 7 days, followed by exenatide 10&#xD;
      μg twice a day for the remainder of the four month intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lean Control Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for obese subjects, lean subjects will be asked to bring in first morning voids for&#xD;
      testing of microalbuminuria. They will also have endothelial function tests (PAT, FMD and&#xD;
      step test) as well as CGMS placement. A set of screening labs will also be drawn (fasting&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, thyroid function and lipid profile will be drawn). Furthermore blood will&#xD;
      be collected for analysis of novel cardiovascular parameters (such as inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and pro-thrombotic factors). However lean subjects will not have an OGTT done and will not be&#xD;
      offered drug intervention. The endothelial function testing in the lean controls will serve&#xD;
      as control data for the vascular function testing in the obese children. The CGMS data of the&#xD;
      lean controls will allow us to better interpret changes in the post-meal excursions seen in&#xD;
      obese children after exenatide intervention. Similar to obese subjects, lean subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to take a standardized snack in the afternoon prior to returning for CGMS removal.&#xD;
      The snack will be provided for them to take home at the end of their CGMS placement visit and&#xD;
      will include two pop-tarts and an orange soda. Lean control subjects will wear the CGMS for&#xD;
      three days. At the end of the monitoring period the subject will return for their CGMS&#xD;
      removal visit.&#xD;
