      This study will evaluate whether standardized aerobic exercise is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      depression in adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disabling form of depression in which sadness and&#xD;
      inability to feel pleasure prevent people from living their normal lives. MDD is common in&#xD;
      adolescents, and depression experienced early in life can lead to long-term psychological and&#xD;
      social impairment or suicide. Studies of depressed adults show that regular aerobic exercise&#xD;
      can result in recovery from mild to moderate MDD. Studies also show that adolescents who&#xD;
      exercise regularly have lower rates of depression, but no randomized, controlled studies have&#xD;
      examined exercise as a treatment for depression in adolescents. This study will compare a&#xD;
      standardized aerobic exercise routine to a stretching control group to determine whether&#xD;
      aerobic exercise is an effective treatment for MDD in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 12 weeks, with follow-up interviews taking place after&#xD;
      6 and 12 months. Participants will first undergo screening procedures, during which&#xD;
      adolescent participants and their parents will complete interviews and questionnaires about&#xD;
      the adolescent's mood and behavior. Participants will also need to provide physician-written&#xD;
      letters confirming that they are healthy enough to participate in the exercise program. After&#xD;
      screening, participants will be randomly assigned to either an exercise program or a&#xD;
      stretching program. At the first study visit, a course of exercise or stretching will be set&#xD;
      for each participant. Participants in both groups will spend the same amount of time doing&#xD;
      physical activity. They will complete three to four exercise or stretching sessions per week&#xD;
      for 12 weeks, with each session lasting 20 to 30 minutes. Participants will be able to&#xD;
      complete some sessions at home, but they will need to return to the study exercise center for&#xD;
      weekly study visits. At these study visits, participants will be weighed to determine if the&#xD;
      level of exercise needs to be adjusted, and they will complete questionnaires about their&#xD;
      depression. Over the course of the study, participants will wear a wrist-watch-like device&#xD;
      called an Actical, which will monitor energy use. Participants will also undergo heart rate&#xD;
      monitoring while exercising and complete an exercise log online. A set of questionnaires and&#xD;
      interviews similar to those at screening will also be repeated at 6- and 12-month follow-ups.&#xD;
