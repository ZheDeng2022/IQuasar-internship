      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of a trial on induced hypertension to&#xD;
      improve neurological outcome in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage that developed the&#xD;
      serious complication &quot;delayed cerebral ischemia&quot;, and to assess whether induced hypertension&#xD;
      results in improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured by means of perfusion-CT.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) is a major complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage (SAH). The proportion of SAH patients who develop DCI is around 30%. Many centres&#xD;
      around the world use induced hypertension, alone or in combination with haemodilution and&#xD;
      hypervolaemia, so called Triple-H, as standard therapy in the treatment of DCI, but the&#xD;
      efficacy of induced hypertension in reducing DCI is based on case series only, and not on a&#xD;
      randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the feasibility of a trial on induced hypertension to improve neurological outcome,&#xD;
      and to assess whether induced hypertension results in improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) as&#xD;
      measured by means of perfusion-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the UMC Utrecht after recent SAH, who develop DCI. Twenty four patients&#xD;
      will be randomised into a standard care group or one of the intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention groups are treated with induced hypertension (30 mmHg increase&#xD;
      in mean arterial pressure) in order to improve CBF. Patients in the standard care group are&#xD;
      treated according to the standardised SAH treatment protocol of the UMC Utrecht by monitoring&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure and preventing dropping of mean arterial pressure to under 80 mmHg.&#xD;
      24-36 hours after instalment of the treatment, a perfusion CT scan is performed. In patients&#xD;
      that do not show any neurological improvement within 24 hours after starting the hypertensive&#xD;
      treatment, the administration of norepinephrine will be tapered. In patients who show&#xD;
      improvement, induced hypertension will be continued for a total period of 72 hours, after&#xD;
      which norepinephrine will be gradually tapered. Measurement of CBF is performed in all&#xD;
      participants with perfusion CT-scanning of the brain at the beginning of the study (as part&#xD;
      of regular patient care) and after 24-36 hours after starting .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients with the diagnosis of DCI after SAH, in which the intervention&#xD;
      (induced hypertension) was adequately performed, included within 18 months after the start of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Our RCT recently started. The RCT is similar to the feasibility trial, so it was terminated to&#xD;
    avoid 2 trials running simultaniously.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Induced hypertension with norepinephrine</intervention_name>
    <description>Hypertension will be induced with norepinephrine. Administration of norepinephrine results in vasoconstriction, leading to an increase in blood pressure. The normal blood pressure of the patient will be calculated as the average MAP of the day before the start of the study. To achieve the intended hypertension (30 mmHg above the normal MAP for patients allocated to index group 2) in most cases a dose of 100-300 ng/kg/minute must be administered. Norepinephrine will be started on a dose of 100 ng/kg/minute, after which the dosing will be adjusted to achieve the desired blood pressure level. The maximum dose to be used in the study is 1000 ng/kg/minute. Norepinephrine is administered through the central venous catheter.</description>

             treatment.(26)&#xD;
&#xD;
