    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial for women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if the addition of a drug called azacitidine (VidazaÂ®)when added to&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel will change the genetic material of the tumor so that the&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also determine what the maximum tolerated dose of azacitidine that may be&#xD;
      safely used in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a highly chemosensitive tumor with good responses to first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The problem is the high rate of relapse, especially in advanced disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapses are likely due to the presence of chemoresistant cells that escape from first line&#xD;
      platinum and taxane based regimens. Therefore, outcomes may be improved by adding treatment&#xD;
      to initial standard therapy that makes resistant cells sensitive to chemotherapy. There are&#xD;
      multiple targeted pathways that may achieve this goal. One promising path is epigenetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for this trial are multifold. First, methylation pathways have been proven in&#xD;
      tissue models to be integral to ovarian cancer pathogenesis. Second, cisplatin and&#xD;
      azacitidine are synergistic, and therefore would be promising in combination to improve&#xD;
      ovarian cancer outcomes by combating cisplatin resistance, which is a major cause of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer mortality. It has been proven that azacitidine/decitabine reverses platinum&#xD;
      resistance. Third, azacitidine has shown tolerable toxicity and promise in clinical trials to&#xD;
      date. Ideally, ovarian cancer outcomes are likely to be improved by the addition of treatment&#xD;
      that wipes out chemoresistant cells, thus preventing relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase I, non-randomized, dose escalation treatment study using azacitidine in&#xD;
      combination with intravenous chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the chemotherapy drugs Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. Patients will&#xD;
      then be randomized to receive one of three different doses of Azacitidine.&#xD;
