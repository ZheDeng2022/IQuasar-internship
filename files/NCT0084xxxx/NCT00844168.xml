    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sorafenib tosylate in treating&#xD;
      patients with liver cancer who have undergone a liver transplant. Sorafenib tosylate may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by&#xD;
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib after liver transplant may be an effective&#xD;
      treatment for liver cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the safety and toxicity profile of sorafenib administered daily to&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine explant and allograft expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),&#xD;
      platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), microvessel density (CD34) and Ki67&#xD;
      (proliferation marker).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
