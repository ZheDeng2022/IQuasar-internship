  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are having a bone marrow or SCT for either a type of cancer of the blood called&#xD;
      Leukemia or a cancer of the lymph nodes called non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Although a transplant&#xD;
      can cure leukemia or lymphoma, some people will relapse. In those who relapse, current&#xD;
      treatment cures only a very small percentage. Although giving patients a dose of donor immune&#xD;
      cells before relapse can prevent relapse of the leukemia or lymphoma, DLI can also cause a&#xD;
      serious complication called graft versus host disease (GVHD). This is a gene transfer&#xD;
      research study using special immune cells which are specific for these cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. This study combines 2 of those&#xD;
      ways, antibodies and T cells. T cells (CTLs or cytotoxic T cells) are infection-fighting&#xD;
      blood cells that can kill cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used&#xD;
      to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but haven't been strong enough to&#xD;
      cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells&#xD;
      because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. For this study, the&#xD;
      anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now&#xD;
      joined to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it's called a chimeric&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, investigators found that T cells that are trained to recognize common&#xD;
      viruses can stay in the blood stream for many years. By joining the anti-CD19 antibody to&#xD;
      CTLs that recognize viruses, they believe that they will also be able to make a cell that can&#xD;
      last a long time in the body, provide protection from viruses, and recognize and kill&#xD;
      leukemia. The CTLs which we will join the anti-CD19 antibody to attack 3 viruses&#xD;
      (trivirus-specific CTLs), CMV, EBV, and adenovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that trivirus-specific CTLs grown from the stem cell donor can be given&#xD;
      safely to transplant recipients and can stop these viruses from causing severe infections.&#xD;
      These CD19 chimeric receptor trivirus specific T cells are an investigational product not&#xD;
      approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe, to&#xD;
      assess the side effects, to see how long the T cells last and to evaluate whether this&#xD;
      therapy might help prevent infections and relapse in people with CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma&#xD;
      having a SCT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The donor gave us blood to make CD19 chimeric receptor trivirus specific T cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen for the subject. To make these special T cells&#xD;
      they are grown with stimulator cells. Stimulator cells are also made from the donor's blood&#xD;
      but they are irradiated so that they can no longer grow. Stimulator cells have been infected&#xD;
      with viruses so that they carry proteins from 3 viruses (CMV, adenovirus, and EBV). These&#xD;
      cells are cultured with the T cells so that they can learn to see and attack cells infected&#xD;
      with CMV, EBV and adenovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get the CD19 antibody to attach to the surface of the T cell, an antibody gene was&#xD;
      inserted into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made&#xD;
      for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps to&#xD;
      find the T cells in the blood after injected. Once sufficient numbers of T cells are made,&#xD;
      the investigators freeze the cells and test them to make sure they kill CD19+ tumors cells&#xD;
      and cells infected with CMV, EBV and adenovirus. Once testing is completed the cells will be&#xD;
      ready to give to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the subject enrolls on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD19 chimeric&#xD;
      receptor trivirus specific T cells. The subject will be given an injection of cells into the&#xD;
      vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. The injection will take about 20 minutes.&#xD;
      Investigators will monitor the subject in the clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours.&#xD;
      The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's&#xD;
      Hospital or The Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the CD19 chimeric receptor trivirus specific T cells are working&#xD;
      and how long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. The total blood drawn during&#xD;
      this study will not exceed 300 tsp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects receiving the CTLs for treatment of their disease: If the subject has stable&#xD;
      disease (the tumor did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the tumor on imaging&#xD;
      studies or by blood count after the T-cell infusion, the subject can receive up to six&#xD;
      additional doses of the T cells if they wish. After each T-cell infusion, the subject will be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the subject will have received cells with a new gene in them the subject will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene&#xD;
      transfer.&#xD;
