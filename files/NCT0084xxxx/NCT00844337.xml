  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to establish the non-inferiority of several simplified, home-based&#xD;
      antibiotic regimens compared to the standard course of parenteral antibiotics for the empiric&#xD;
      treatment of suspected sepsis in Bangladeshi young infants whose parents refuse&#xD;
      hospitalization. Three alternative regimens will be compared with a standard (reference)&#xD;
      regimen of injectable procaine-benzyl penicillin and gentamicin once daily each for seven&#xD;
      days. Alternative regimens are (1) injectable gentamicin once daily and oral amoxicillin&#xD;
      twice daily for seven days; (2) injectable penicillin and gentamicin once daily for two days&#xD;
      followed by oral amoxicillin twice daily for five days; and (3) injectable gentamicin once&#xD;
      daily and oral amoxicillin twice daily for two days followed by oral amoxicillin twice daily&#xD;
      for five days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion who fails treatment will be 10 percent in the reference group and the&#xD;
      alternative treatment groups. An alternative therapy will be considered non-inferior to the&#xD;
      standard therapy if the failure rate in the alternative therapy exceeds the failure rate in&#xD;
      the injectable therapy by less than 5 absolute percentage points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify baseline clinical predictors of treatment failure in severe infections in&#xD;
           young infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of relapse (young infants who were considered cured by day 7&#xD;
           but developed any of the signs of suspected severe infection by day 14).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many developing countries have witnessed declines in both post-neonatal and 1-4&#xD;
      year-old child deaths, neonatal death rates have remained relatively constant, with an&#xD;
      estimated 4 million annual neonatal deaths globally (Lawn et al, 2005). Almost all of the&#xD;
      neonatal deaths (99%) occur in developing countries (Bryce et al., 2005; Ahmad et al., 2007).&#xD;
      In many of these settings, the rate of home delivery is high and the attendance at birth by&#xD;
      skilled personnel is low, leading to many babies being born in unhygienic conditions (Bhutta&#xD;
      et al., 2005). Birth in these settings is accompanied by a high rate of infections in both&#xD;
      mothers and newborns. It has been estimated that about 1 out of 5 neonates develop life&#xD;
      threatening infections (Stoll, 1997). Several preventative interventions against neonatal&#xD;
      infections including tetanus toxoid immunization to pregnant women, early and exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding, and use of clean delivery kits have been identified and incorporated in many&#xD;
      programs (Bhutta et al., 2005). Yet, neonatal infections remain the most important cause of&#xD;
      neonatal deaths. Globally, an estimated one-third of the neonatal deaths are attributed to&#xD;
      infections (Lawn 2005). In settings characterized by high neonatal mortality rates, the&#xD;
      proportion of neonatal deaths due to infections has been estimated at approximately 50% (Bang&#xD;
      1999; Lawn 2005; Baqui 2006). These infectious deaths include sepsis, pneumonia, tetanus,&#xD;
      meningitis and diarrhea. A further 27% of the neonatal deaths are related to premature birth&#xD;
      and infections are the direct cause in many of these premature neonates. Therefore,&#xD;
      strategies for timely identification and management of infections in young infants (0-59&#xD;
      days) including neonates are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Treatment Options: Hospital care The WHO recommends that all cases of suspected&#xD;
      severe infection in young infants (0-59 days old) are treated in hospitals with a 7-10 day&#xD;
      course of injectable antibiotics - penicillin (or ampicillin) and gentamicin. However, in&#xD;
      many developing countries, this care is often not available or accessible, or not acceptable&#xD;
      to families. Furthermore, in low-resource settings, reliance on a strategy of hospitalization&#xD;
      of young infants with suspected severe infections has a number of inherent disadvantages.&#xD;
      First, in many settings, a vast majority of young infants who are referred may not be able to&#xD;
      get to the hospital (Peterson et al., 2004) and may not receive the treatment, increasing&#xD;
      their risk of dying. Second, routine hospitalization and the use of injectable antibiotics,&#xD;
      either intravenously or intramuscularly substantially increases the cost of health care&#xD;
      (Al-Eidan et al., 1999) and often hospital beds are not available to admit all young infants&#xD;
      with suspected serious infections. Third, hospitalization increases the risk of exposure to&#xD;
      multi-drug resistant nosocomial pathogens that are increasingly difficult to treat (Jarvis&#xD;
      WR, 2004; Pong et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of alternative approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies for community-based management of infections in young infants have been developed&#xD;
      and evaluated in several research settings (Bang et al., 1999; Baqui et al., 2007; Kanal et&#xD;
      al., 2007). Our group, known as Projahnmo, has recently completed a trial of a package of&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal interventions in Sylhet district, Bangladesh, and demonstrated&#xD;
      significant reduction of neonatal mortality (Baqui et al., 2008b). In one of the intervention&#xD;
      arms, we trained village-based community health workers to assess newborns and manage&#xD;
      newborns with severe infections using an algorithm similar to the one used in Integrated&#xD;
      Management of Childhood and Neonatal Illness (IMNCI). Management included referral of&#xD;
      neonates with signs of severe infection to a qualified provider and home treatment in&#xD;
      referral failure cases. If referral failed but parents consented to home treatment, CHWs&#xD;
      treated neonates with severe infections using injectable procaine penicillin and gentamicin.&#xD;
      For severe infections, the rate of referral compliance was only 34%, and home treatment&#xD;
      acceptance was 43%. The case fatality rate was 4.4% for those treated by CHWs, 14.2% for&#xD;
      those treated by qualified medical providers, and 28.5% for those who either received no&#xD;
      treatment or who were treated by untrained providers. After controlling for differences in&#xD;
      background characteristics and illness signs among treatment groups, newborns treated by CHWs&#xD;
      had a hazard ratio of 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.07-0.71) for death during neonatal&#xD;
      period and those treated by qualified providers had a hazards ratio of 0.60 (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of 0.37-0.99), compared to newborns who received no treatment or were treated by&#xD;
      untrained providers (Baqui et al., 2007; Baqui et al., 2008a). These data suggest that&#xD;
      treatment of neonates by CHWs was generally acceptable to the community. Home treatment of&#xD;
      suspected sepsis in neonates by CHWs is effective in low-resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are, however, major challenges associated with current community-based strategies for&#xD;
      injectable therapy. First, it is difficult to ensure availability of trained health workers&#xD;
      who are able to safely and optimally administer injectable antibiotics daily for 7 to 10&#xD;
      days, and to ensure supplies and quality assurance. Second, a 7 to 10-day regimen of&#xD;
      parenteral antibiotic therapy presents specific challenges to community acceptance and&#xD;
      compliance. Third, unsupervised use of injection at the community level may be unsafe and can&#xD;
      increase the risk of transmission of HIV, hepatitis and other viral diseases through the use&#xD;
      of contaminated needles (Simonsen et al., 1999). Therefore, it is important to reduce the&#xD;
      number of injections to be used in the community. Furthermore, the rationale for 7-10 days of&#xD;
      parenteral antibiotic therapy is not fully established. Injectable therapy is chosen because&#xD;
      of the perception that it is the most efficacious regimen in the treatment of severe disease.&#xD;
      For some neonatal infections, however, alternative regimes such as a combination of&#xD;
      parenteral and oral therapy or switching to an oral antibiotic after initial treatment for&#xD;
      2-3 days with injectable antibiotics may be equally effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the disadvantages of hospitalization and challenges of community-based injectable&#xD;
      therapy, recent research has looked at the potential use of oral treatment for severe&#xD;
      pneumonia in older infants. Hazir et al (2008) recently reported the results from an&#xD;
      open-label equivalency trial conducted at seven study sites in Pakistan. 2,037 children aged&#xD;
      3-59 months with severe pneumonia were randomly allocated to either initial hospitalization&#xD;
      and parenteral ampicillin (100 mg/kg per day in four doses) for 48 h, followed by 3 days of&#xD;
      oral amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg per day in two doses; n=1012) or to home-based treatment for 5&#xD;
      days with oral amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg per day in two doses; n=1025). Follow-up assessments&#xD;
      were done at days 1, 3, 6, and 14 after enrolment. There was no difference in treatment&#xD;
      failure rates (clinical deterioration) by day 7 between the hospitalized (8.6%) and the&#xD;
      ambulatory group (7.5%; risk difference 1•1%; 95% CI -1•3 to 3•5). This result suggests&#xD;
      empowering first-level health workers to manage severely ill children when referral is&#xD;
      difficult. High failure rates were associated with young age, very fast breathing, and low&#xD;
      weight for age. These findings suggest that it may not be safe to treat young infants with&#xD;
      suspected severe infection with oral antibiotic alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global research priority: Simplified antibiotic regimen for infections in young infants&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the fall of 2007, Saving Newborn Lives (SNL) of Save the Children-US, USAID and WHO&#xD;
      convened a global consultation to review the new study findings on infection management in&#xD;
      young infants in community-based settings and to guide future research priorities. Based on&#xD;
      the existing research findings at that time, the consultation participants concluded that&#xD;
      there was still insufficient evidence to make policy recommendations for global programs. The&#xD;
      consultation charged future research to test optimal combination of oral and intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) antibiotic regimens that would be feasible to implement in first-level facilities and&#xD;
      community and will be acceptable to families for settings characterized by weak health&#xD;
      systems. We designed this study with these recommendations in mind.&#xD;
