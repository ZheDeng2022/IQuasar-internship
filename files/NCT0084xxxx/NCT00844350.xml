      The specific aims of this study were to assess whether letrozole as an aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
      plus hCG or OT alone, or in combination compared with CC, improves ovarian response.Ethical&#xD;
      design of this study is based on the ethical guidelines of the Iranian Medical and Health&#xD;
      Ministry which is accepted by Tabriz medical university ethical committee .&#xD;

      In a randomized controlled prospective clinical study, a total of 177 infertile women with&#xD;
      CC+hCG-resistant PCOS included. The candidates were selected for this study in the clinics of&#xD;
      Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, East Azarbayejan Province, North West of Iran, from&#xD;
      Oct. 2006 to Sep. 2007. Infertile women who had chronic anovulation and classical PCOS with&#xD;
      CC+hCG failure were age &lt;40 y , had patent tubes on hysterosalpingography, and no other&#xD;
      pelvic pathology, participated in this study. The patients who had hypersensivity to any&#xD;
      oxytocic medications, history of cardiovascular disease, and took anti-hypertensive&#xD;
      medications were excluded. In addition, women with blood pressure less than 90/60 mmHg,&#xD;
      abnormal spermogram, anxiety, excess prolactin levels, and other causes of infertility were&#xD;
      excluded. All participants were given adequate information, and consent was obtained from&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The candidates were randomly divided into five groups including; letrozole + hCG (36&#xD;
      patients) (group 1), letrozole + OT (35 patients) (group 2), letrozole +OT + hCG (35&#xD;
      patients) (group 3), CC + OT (35 patients) (group 4), and CC + OT + hCG (36 patients) (group&#xD;
      5). Participants received letrozole 2.5mg at first month and 5mg at the second and third&#xD;
      month. Also, CC was used 50 mg at the first month, to 150 mg at the third month to stimulate&#xD;
      follicular growth. Oxytocin (OXYTIP; manufactured by IPDIC, Rasht, Iran), 5 IU and hCG&#xD;
      (Choriomon; manufactured by IBSA Institute Biochimique SA, CH-6903 Lugano), 5000 IU were also&#xD;
      administrated to induce ovulation. All patients underwent transvaginal sonography on day 13&#xD;
      to document the numbers of follicles and endometrial thickness. Participants were evaluated&#xD;
      for three courses of intervention. Oxytocin was injected intramuscularly after CC or letrozol&#xD;
      stimulation had induced enlarged ovarian follicles ( &gt;18 mm in diameter to 30 mm). Decision&#xD;
      to give a 5 IU dose of OT was made according to the pilot study (30). The patients who had&#xD;
      larger follicles (more than 30mm in diameter), were withdrawn. The patients, who achieved&#xD;
      pregnancy at the first or second month, were also withdrawn. All participants were evaluated&#xD;
      for the levels of plasma progesterone one week after the injection of OT, hCG, or combination&#xD;
      of them. A follow-up visit was arranged for each group every month at the second day of&#xD;
      menstruation until 3 months after recruitment or at any time during the trial if pregnancy&#xD;
      was achieved.&#xD;
