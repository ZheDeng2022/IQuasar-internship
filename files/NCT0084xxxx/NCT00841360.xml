  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with a cross-sectional research design to recruit Hispanic/Latina and&#xD;
      African American adolescent and young adult women, aged 13-24 years to serve as index&#xD;
      recruiters, who will in turn recruit members of her female friendship network, aged 13 years&#xD;
      and older to undergo HIV screening. This approach seeks to identify new HIV infections in the&#xD;
      target population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will utilize a cross-sectional research design to recruit&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latina and African American young women to undergo HIV screening. The research&#xD;
      design will consist of a friendship-based, female network recruitment approach that&#xD;
      incorporates a dual method of incentives for index recruiters and network members as a&#xD;
      strategy for identifying new HIV infections in the target population. Among sexually&#xD;
      experienced young women (many of whom who reside in communities with a high prevalence of&#xD;
      STIs and HIV), 50 who self-identify as HIV positive, 50 who self-identify as HIV negative&#xD;
      (based on receiving a negative HIV test within 12 months prior to study consent), and 50&#xD;
      whose HIV status is self-reported as unknown (who have no history of prior HIV testing or who&#xD;
      had HIV screening more than 12 months prior to date of study consent) will be recruited.&#xD;
      These women will serve as index recruiters to recruit two or more (on average four) female&#xD;
      friendship network members to undergo HIV screening. The index recruiters will be recruited&#xD;
      through three participating ATN sites utilizing the existing infrastructure within the AMTUs&#xD;
      and their community and clinical partnerships. Index participants that agree to take part in&#xD;
      this research will be asked to self-disclose their HIV status, to complete a risk assessment&#xD;
      and indicate their willingness to recruit their close female friends to undergo HIV&#xD;
      screening. In addition, index recruiters who self-identify as HIV negative and those who do&#xD;
      not know their HIV status will be invited to undergo HIV screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index recruiters will be given up to four months to recruit members of their friendship&#xD;
      network. At the end of this recruitment period or after successful recruitment of two or more&#xD;
      friendship network members, whichever comes first, all index recruiters will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a brief questionnaire that describes factors that both facilitated and hindered&#xD;
      their ability to recruit the friendship network members. Sexually experienced friendship&#xD;
      network members who agree to participate in the study will also complete a risk assessment&#xD;
      regardless of whether or not they agree to undergo HIV screening. Participation in this study&#xD;
      will be strictly on a voluntary basis.&#xD;
