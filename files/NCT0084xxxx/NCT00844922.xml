      Patients who participated in the previous trial 28130, who were eligible, were entered into&#xD;
      this trial. Patients who were randomized to placebo in the previous trial 28130 continued on&#xD;
      placebo while patients who were randomized to Org 34517 (SCH 900636), regardless of dose,&#xD;
      were titrated to 900 mg Org 34517. Patients in this trial took their study medication for 2&#xD;
      weeks in order to study the safety and tolerability of Org 34517.&#xD;
