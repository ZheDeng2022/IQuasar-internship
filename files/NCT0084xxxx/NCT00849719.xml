  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After major surgery, such as abdominal or thoracic surgery, the majority of patients&#xD;
      experience moderate to severe pain that may not be optimally controlled. Inadequate pain&#xD;
      relief may lead to complications that can hinder rehabilitation and slow recovery. Morphine&#xD;
      (MO) is the most commonly used opioid for the treatment of post-surgical pain (14). The&#xD;
      preferred method of administration nowadays is intravenous patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA). In contrast, Continuous infusion of intravenous morphine (CIVM) is seldom used in&#xD;
      Post-Anesthesia Care Units (PACUs) for acute postoperative pain, due to concerns of&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory deterioration, even though different studies have found this technique of&#xD;
      administration effective and safe (in terms of opioid-related symptoms.As part of our efforts&#xD;
      to improve postoperative pain management in the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center's PACU, we&#xD;
      wish to determine if combining CIVM with IV PCA will be superior over IV PCA only for the&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative pain following major abdominal or thoracic surgery.Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the continuous infusion, even if given at a relatively low dose, would enable the&#xD;
      build-up of pharmacologically effective MO blood level, thus providing an overall better&#xD;
      control of pain.&#xD;

      Study objective To compare the efficacy of two MO administration-protocols: PCA MO (only) vs&#xD;
      combination of continuous background infusion plus PCA MO (combined dosage) in patients after&#xD;
      abdominal and thoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Inclusion criteria The study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized, double&#xD;
      blinded one, into which we will enroll patients aged 18-80 years undergoing major abdominal&#xD;
      procedures (e.g. laparotomy, nephrectomy, gastrectomy, gastric bypass, pancreatectomy,&#xD;
      splenectomy, and abdominal aortic aneurysm) or thoracic surgery (segmentectomy, lobectomy or&#xD;
      pneumonectomy) in our institution during the years 2008-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria We will exclude from the study patients with a history of drug or alcohol&#xD;
      abuse, psychiatric disturbances, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, seizures or suicide&#xD;
      risk, use of psychotropic drugs, pregnancy or nursing, hypersensitivity to MO, or to non&#xD;
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or their excipients, chronic or acute pain of any&#xD;
      origin, respiratory failure or insufficiency, uncompensated or congestive heart or hepatic&#xD;
      failure and those scheduled for an emergency or palliative procedure. We will also exclude&#xD;
      patients using antidepressants, anticonvulsants or muscle relaxants, and patients using any&#xD;
      monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 2 weeks of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post enrollment dropouts Patients will be dropped from the study for one of the following&#xD;
      reasons: need for immediate postoperative artificial ventilation lasting over 4 h, lack of&#xD;
      coherence (&lt;5/10) or constant sedation (&gt;5/10 VAS), or combative behavior in the PACU,&#xD;
      postoperative requirement for re-intervention and/or transfer to an intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU). Other suitable patients will be recruited to replace the ones that were dropped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-study non-replaced dropouts will include protocol violation, patient's decision to&#xD;
      withdraw or ineffective drug protocol (pain &gt;5/10 VAS despite full and evidenced protocol&#xD;
      implementation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative management Anesthetics and surgical management will be performed similarly in&#xD;
      all patients. All patients will receive prophylactic antibiotics. All will be premedicated&#xD;
      with oral 10 mg diazepam the night before surgery and 40-75 min preoperatively. After a&#xD;
      sedative dose of IV midazolam (1.5-2 mg) and fentanyl (1.5 μg/kg), propofol (1-2 mg/kg) will&#xD;
      be slowly injected IV until the patient losses consciousness. A non-depolarizing muscle&#xD;
      relaxant will enable endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be maintained according to institutional protocol, using nitrous&#xD;
      oxide/oxygen 2/1 L/min enriched with isoflurane, aiming at delivering 1 MAC anesthesia. A&#xD;
      non-depolarizing muscle relaxant and fentanyl will be continually infused or given by&#xD;
      repeated portions to maintain muscle relaxation and analgesia, and hemodynamic and&#xD;
      ventilatory stability. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters will be monitored in the&#xD;
      standard manner, and intraoperative fluid administration and blood replacement will follow&#xD;
      common cardiovascular, renal and laboratory indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towards the end of surgery, all drugs will be turned off and minimal doses of atropine and&#xD;
      neostigmine will be administered to reverse muscle relaxation and obtain the return of normal&#xD;
      spontaneous respiration. All patients will then be transferred to the PACU for observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Consented postoperative patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups&#xD;
      (by using a closed-envelope technique): Group 1 will receive PCA bolus injections of MO, as&#xD;
      practiced in our institution, whereas group 2 will receive both a basal (infusion)&#xD;
      administration and PCA bolus injections. Dosage of the basal infusion and the PCA combination&#xD;
      will be based on a preliminary dose-response pain control study and data obtained during a&#xD;
      previous study, where the technique provided satisfactory reduction or even elimination of&#xD;
      pain along with a tolerable level of side effects. For reasons of both safety and efficacy,&#xD;
      we will maintain the doses of both basal (infusion) and demand (bolus) portions on a body&#xD;
      weight basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phase and drug use Upon arrival in the PACU, each patient will be connected to an&#xD;
      oxygen face-mask and a vital signs monitor. Upon the first complaint of moderate or severe&#xD;
      rest pain (≥5/10 on a visual analog scale [VAS]), and after the PACU drug-blinded attending&#xD;
      physician had established that the patient is coherent and cooperative, a PCA system will be&#xD;
      connected to the patient's IV line. The physician will start device, and deliver the first&#xD;
      bolus. The subsequent drug boluses will be self-administered by the patient. Group 1 patients&#xD;
      will receive MO infusion (10 μg/kg/h) + MO bolus (10 μg/kg/bolus, by request), whereas group&#xD;
      2 will be administered with only boluses of 1.5 mg/bolus of MO. A 7 min lockout time after&#xD;
      each bolus will prevent excessive dispensing of the drug. If needed, the physician could&#xD;
      administer two extra boluses for optimal pain control within the first 15 min&#xD;
      postoperatively. Rescue diclofenac 75 mg IM will be allowed once to help prompt start&#xD;
      analgesia instead of opioid titration, and 6h later. No hourly dose limit will be set for the&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated according to their designated study protocol for as long as they&#xD;
      need; no use for 12 h after will prompt the patients to the standard pain care of the&#xD;
      surgical department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment Outcome measurements will be assessed and documented every 15 min during&#xD;
      the first 2 h of the study and then hourly, until POD3. Primary outcomes will include the&#xD;
      demand/delivery ratio for MO and rescue drug (assessed by the hourly activation of the IV-PCA&#xD;
      device, and the 12 h total drug consumption). Secondary outcomes will be: pain intensity&#xD;
      (evaluated by both by the patients' self-rated pain, and via VAS by a blinded assessor),&#xD;
      self-rated levels of sedation and satisfaction, time of dependence of the device and urinary&#xD;
      catheter, time to discharge, and time until the patient sits, stand and leaves bed. Adverse&#xD;
      effects that we will evaluate are: respiratory depression (respiratory rate, room air&#xD;
      saturation, time to extubation in re-intubated patients); vomiting/nausea; allergic events,&#xD;
      severe complications (e.g. morbidity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic data (age, gender, weight), background characteristics (pre-study heart and&#xD;
      respiratory rates, SpO2, systolic and diastolic blood pressures), patients' American Society&#xD;
      of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical class, duration of surgery and intraoperative fentanyl&#xD;
      usage will also be recorded; all will be analyzed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis and benefits The present study aims at assessing whether the addition of MO&#xD;
      infusion to the commonly used PCA, although both at a total dose that is inferior to that&#xD;
      currently used in our institution, will provide better pain control compared to the commonly&#xD;
      used technique. We believe that if this occurs, it will be safer for the patient and possibly&#xD;
      allow earlier recovery, rehabilitation and home discharge.&#xD;
