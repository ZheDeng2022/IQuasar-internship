      This study examined a brief intervention to improve medication knowledge and compliance in&#xD;
      family medicine patients. The study was conducted in a network of six family medicine&#xD;
      residency programs in South Texas, funded by a grant from the Health Research Services&#xD;
      Administration. Family medicine patients were invited to participate in the study if they&#xD;
      took medicines for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia and responded &quot;yes&quot; to&#xD;
      the screening question: &quot;Do you sometimes have trouble taking all your medications as&#xD;
      prescribed?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, clinic staff administered a Medication Survey to patients to assess the&#xD;
      variables: readiness to change, reported medication knowledge; reported compliance, and&#xD;
      predictors of knowledge and compliance. Self-reports of compliance were validated with a&#xD;
      social desirability scale, and with physician impressions. Six and twelve weeks&#xD;
      post-enrollment, interviewers administered followup surveys by telephone to assess change&#xD;
      over time in medication knowledge and compliance. One year post-enrollment, investigators&#xD;
      conducted a chart review to examine changes in health outcomes: blood pressure or HbA1c or&#xD;
      cholesterol levels, and number of hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three physicians per clinic site (18 total) conducted medication interventions for the&#xD;
      purpose of this study. This intervention was brief behavior change counseling done in the&#xD;
      context of a routine office visit, guided by simple strategies outlined in Rollnick et al&#xD;
      (1999). First, physicians reviewed subjects= medication regimen and addressed their concerns.&#xD;
      We selected a simple strategy from Rollnick et al. - a brainstorming session - that built&#xD;
      patients' confidence to change health behaviors. Afterward, physicians offered pillboxes to&#xD;
      patients who desired them, and reviewed potential adverse reactions to medicines. One week&#xD;
      after the intervention, physicians telephoned patients to reinforce behavior change and to&#xD;
      answer questions about the medications. Prior to training physicians to conduct this&#xD;
      intervention, we enrolled five subjects per physician into a control group. We attempted to&#xD;
      blind physicians to these patients= enrollment status; usual care was provided to control&#xD;
      subjects. After training, enrollees' charts were flagged so that physicians knew to conduct&#xD;
      the intervention. We sought five patients per physician to receive the intervention.&#xD;
