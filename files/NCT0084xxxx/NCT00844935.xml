      This research proposal has two main objectives. The first is to increase understanding of the&#xD;
      underlying physiological interactions that occur between the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and&#xD;
      ANS during transition between positive pressure mechanical ventilation (MV) and spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing. The second is to determine if heart rate variability, (HRV) a reflection of&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, and autonomic information flow (AIF), a set of&#xD;
      nonlinear measures derived from HRV, both measured in the intensive care unit (ICU) can&#xD;
      predict patient outcomes including successful weaning and in-hospital recovery time after an&#xD;
      episode of cardiopulmonary compromise requiring MV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. Transitions between mechanically supported ventilation and spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing will disturb cardiovascular synchrony, altering the relationship of HRV, AIF,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, and blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. More normal HRV and AIF values, measured during baseline MV and sedation&#xD;
      awakening (a period immediately prior to SBT when sedative medications are discontinued) will&#xD;
      be associated with easier weaning, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths&#xD;
      of stay; more abnormal measurements will be associated with longer lengths of stay;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. AIF is a more sensitive predictor of successful weaning from MV than HRV.&#xD;
