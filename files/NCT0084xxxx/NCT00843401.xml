      1.0 BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common method for assessing the respiratory status of hospitalized pediatric and neonatal&#xD;
      patients is the use of pulse oximetry. This noninvasive device uses a light emitting diode&#xD;
      (LED) emitter, which is applied to an area of the body with good local blood flow. Red and&#xD;
      infrared light is shined through the blood-perfused tissue under the sensor and the detected&#xD;
      light information is sent back to a signal processing unit, or monitor, for calculation of&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2)1. Typically the sensor may be placed either on the forehead, a&#xD;
      finger, or in neonates - the foot, palm or toe. Use of this noninvasive method provides&#xD;
      continuous information on the oxygenation status of patients and has greatly reduced the&#xD;
      number of arterial blood gas punctures or samples required for patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the advantages of noninvasive pulse oximetry are significant, there are a number of&#xD;
      factors that can negatively impact the performance of the device2. Patient monitoring during&#xD;
      low saturation episodes has been one of the challenges to optimal device performance.&#xD;
      Improvements to sensor technology over the last 20 years have progressively improved the&#xD;
      accuracy and reliability of the device. Since their introduction to clinical care in the&#xD;
      1980's, a number of improvements have been made to increase the accuracy of pulse oximetry in&#xD;
      oxygen saturations of 80% and below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, while much of the clinical research on pulse oximetry sensors over the years has&#xD;
      evaluated device accuracy and reliability, limited data are available in these conditions1,6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of new pulse oximetry sensors&#xD;
      specifically designed for low saturation episodes in pediatric and neonatal patients. Results&#xD;
      of this study will provide basic information to drive further improvements in the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy and performance of&#xD;
      pediatric and neonatal oximetry sensors over clinically relevant ranges of arterial&#xD;
      saturations between 60-100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the accuracy of a neonatal sensor in the saturation range of 70-80% in the&#xD;
           following weight category: 0-5kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the accuracy of neonatal and pediatric transmission (digit/foot/hand)&#xD;
           sensors in the saturation range of 60-80% in the following weight categories: 0-5kg;&#xD;
           and, 5-40kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the accuracy of neonatal and pediatric transmission (digit/foot/hand)&#xD;
           sensors in the saturation range of 80-100% in the following weight ranges: 0-5kg; and,&#xD;
           5-40kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These objectives will be achieved by enrolling hospitalized patients from several neonatal&#xD;
      and pediatric units, including cardiac cath lab, OR and intensive care areas. Table 1 below&#xD;
      outlines the specifics for data collection.&#xD;

      (30 data points targeted)&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Data required for 70-80% saturation range only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data may be collected continuously from the test and reference devices by a validated&#xD;
      computer data acquisition system and/or by Case Report Form (CRF) recording, for direct&#xD;
      comparison to measurements taken from Co-Oximetry (or arterial blood gases (ABGs) if&#xD;
      Co-Oximetry is not an option). Arterial blood sampling will be obtained as necessary for&#xD;
      patient management as defined by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Pulse oximetry sensors: Pulse oximetry sensors are devices, which are attached to the&#xD;
      skin (hand, forehead, finger, toe, foot) with or without an adhesive material and connected&#xD;
      to a signal-processing unit for the purpose of noninvasive oxygen saturation monitoring. For&#xD;
      the purposes of this study, three different sensors will be simultaneously placed on each&#xD;
      enrolled patient: a reference sensor and two test sensors (Nellcor Puritan Bennett LLC,&#xD;
      Boulder, CO, and Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA). The Masimo sensor will be a rainbow R25,&#xD;
      R25-L, R20 or R20-L, and the Nellcor sensor will be an OxiMax MAX-A, MAX-P, MAX-I or MAX-N.&#xD;
      All sensors are currently available on the market but the Masimo sensors have not been&#xD;
      compared to the Nellcor sensors in head-to-head tests. During the study, a Masimo sensor will&#xD;
      be connected to a Masimo bedside pulse oximetry monitor (the Radical-7) via a standard&#xD;
      patient cable, and a Nellcor sensor will be connected to a Nellcor bedside pulse oximetry&#xD;
      monitor (the N-600x) via a standard patient cable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Sensor accuracy: Sensor accuracy is the capability of the tested sensor to reflect oxygen&#xD;
      saturations that are consistent with those obtained directly from arterial blood sampling and&#xD;
      evaluated with Co-Oximetry. 3.3 Skin color: For the purposes of this study, skin color will&#xD;
      be assessed with Nellcor's visual inspection rating scale (i.e., 1 very light, 2 olive hue, 3&#xD;
      dark olive, 4 extremely dark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Data point: Paired data value from Co-Oximetry and the test sensor. 3.5 Transmission&#xD;
      sensor: A sensor where the emitter and photodetector are opposite of each other, with the&#xD;
      measuring site (i.e., digit) in-between 3.6 Reflectance sensor: A sensor where the emitter&#xD;
      and photodetector are next to each other and on top of the measuring site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS 4.1 Study Design. This is a multicenter observational study wherein&#xD;
      the information collected on the test devices will not be used for clinical management. A&#xD;
      repeated-measures experimental design will be used to compare the test sensors with&#xD;
      conventional oximetry and Co-Oximetry, the defined &quot;Gold Standard&quot;. Both of the test sensors&#xD;
      and a reference sensor will be simultaneously applied to each subject. The reference sensor&#xD;
      will be applied for the patient's clinical management, while the test sensors will be applied&#xD;
      to an extremity as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 50 subjects with a minimum of 100 data points across sites will be necessary to&#xD;
      address subject-to-subject variability and to yield a statistically significant RMSD.&#xD;
      Enrollment in the study will be suspended as soon as both minimums are achieved. A data point&#xD;
      is defined as a paired data value from Co-Oximetry and the test sensors. If high variability&#xD;
      is observed, a need for more subjects or data-points may be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 STUDY PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the study, after having signed the&#xD;
      Informed Consent will have the following procedures carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 The reference sensor will be applied according to the product Directions For Use7 (DFU),&#xD;
      while the test sensor or sensors will be applied to a recommended site per the test sensor's&#xD;
      DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Demographic (the patient's physical characteristics) and baseline data will be collected.&#xD;
      5.3 Skin color. For the purposes of this study, skin color will be assessed with Nellcor's&#xD;
      visual inspection rating scale (i.e., 1 very light, 2 olive hue, 3 dark olive, 4 extremely&#xD;
      dark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 The date, time, and test sensor tracking numbers will be recorded on the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Each sensor will be connected to a patient cable, which will be connected to a SpO2&#xD;
      monitor. The monitors connected to the Nellcor and Masimo test sensors will not be used for&#xD;
      patient care management decisions. Alarms on the test sensors/monitors will be inactivated&#xD;
      prior to study use to avoid patient management confusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.6 Test sensors and data collection will be discontinued five to fifteen minutes after the&#xD;
      last anticipated arterial blood draw. The date and time of sensor discontinuance will be&#xD;
      recorded on the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample study procedure can be found in Attachment A. A sample Adverse Event Form can be&#xD;
      found in Attachment B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse oximetry measurements of saturation from the test devices (sensors) will be compared to&#xD;
      Co-Oximetry measurements of arterial oxygen saturation to demonstrate that the test sensors&#xD;
      meet the oxygen saturation accuracy specifications for SpO2 when used on neonatal and&#xD;
      pediatric populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2 accuracy will be determined by calculating the root mean square of the differences&#xD;
      (RMSD) between test sensor and SaO2 CO-oximeter (or ABG) value to the following equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMSD = where d is the difference between SpO2 and SaO2. Paired data values may then be&#xD;
      plotted comparing the Pulse-Oximetry values and Co-Oximetry values, across the saturation&#xD;
      range of interest (i.e., ≤80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING All known and anticipated adverse events associated with this&#xD;
      study are identified in Section 8.0, Risk Analysis. All reportable anticipated, and&#xD;
      unanticipated, adverse events will be documented on the Adverse Event Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 RISK ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks to participation in this study are primarily physical. Involvement in this study&#xD;
      requires the addition of two additional pulse oximetry sensors to the extremities of the&#xD;
      subjects. There are no psychological, social, economic, legal or other risks that have been&#xD;
      identified. We believe that the risks from the devices and the study procedure are&#xD;
      non-significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical risks from the use of the devices may consist principally of a burn to the skin.&#xD;
      Pulse oximetry sensors are attached to the fingers or other skin surfaces, and use light to&#xD;
      measure saturation, generating a small amount of heat. Because of the low amount of current&#xD;
      required to power the LED's, risk of burn is minimal. The long history of safe performance of&#xD;
      Nellcor and Masimo Pulse Oximetry in the marketplace is evidence that this risk is very low.&#xD;
      In addition, the short duration of this study makes this risk extremely unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application and removal of oximetry or other non-invasive tissue sensors present a&#xD;
      minimal risk to the subject. There may be minor discomfort associated with removal of&#xD;
      adhesive sensors or a reaction to the standard adhesive. Injury from a reaction to a sensor&#xD;
      adhesive is rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no direct benefits to subjects who participate in these studies. Benefits from the&#xD;
      study will be the overall improvement of patient care, as a sensor can be developed which is&#xD;
      expected to be accurate and reliable in reporting saturations below the 80% saturation range.&#xD;
      Future patients will benefit from the accurate and reliable products that are developed using&#xD;
      the procedure described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.0 STATEMENT OF NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nellcor believes that this is a &quot;non-significant risk&quot; device study due to the nature of the&#xD;
      devices being tested. Utilizing the information presented in Section 9.0 and the FDA criteria&#xD;
      listed below to distinguish between significant and non-significant risk devices, Nellcor has&#xD;
      determined that the devices referred to in the Protocol present no potential for serious risk&#xD;
      to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and are NOT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implants; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Used in supporting or sustaining human life; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or in&#xD;
           preventing impairment of human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nellcor requests that the IRB indicate its agreement with this determination of risk in its&#xD;
      letter of approval for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      No therapeutic modifications are proposed in this study. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from each participating patient. If the patient is a minor, written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from the subject's parents or legal guardian(s) and their permission sought&#xD;
      for participation in this study. Federal policies for protection of human subjects will be&#xD;
      followed at all times8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.0 CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject confidentiality will be kept at all times. Patient records may be made available to&#xD;
      employees from Nellcor and the United States of America Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for data review only. The results of this study may be presented at meetings or in&#xD;
      publications; however, subject identity will not be disclosed.&#xD;
