      The principal purpose of this study is to identify hyper-responsive, responsive and&#xD;
      non-responsive groups of healthy human subjects based on their airway neutrophilic response&#xD;
      to ozone exposure, and to perform micro-array analyses on DNA collected from recovered airway&#xD;
      cells to explore possible differences in gene expression profiles between the three groups&#xD;

      Sputum assessment day: Subjects meeting the required health status following the medical&#xD;
      screening will be provided with a verbal and written description of all experimental&#xD;
      procedures and possible risks involved in their participation. All subjects will be required&#xD;
      to provide written informed consent to participate in the study. The ability of subjects to&#xD;
      produce adequate induced sputum samples will also be determined. Therefore the subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to produce sputum following inhalation of hypertonic saline (3, 4 and 5%). Subjects&#xD;
      should be able to produce at least 50 mg of sputum (selected plug) per sample. Each sputum&#xD;
      sample must contain a total cell count of at least 100,000 cells, a differential cell count&#xD;
      containing less than 40% squamous epithelial cells, and cell viability of at least 50%, thus&#xD;
      minimizing variability in cell recovery and squamous cell contamination. Subjects who are&#xD;
      effective sputum producers will then be scheduled for a training session. Subjects may still&#xD;
      be excluded from the study if unable to perform adequate pulmonary function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training session: Training session will occur no less than 2 days prior to exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests, including spirometry and plethysmography (body box measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introduction to the ozone exposure chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instruction on how to use the treadmill, including a minute ventilation measurement to&#xD;
           reach the level of exercise required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitric oxide measurement - this measures the amount of nitric oxide (NO) present in&#xD;
           expired air. An increased concentration of NO in exhaled air may be found in normal&#xD;
           persons with acute inflammation during upper respiratory tract infections and in&#xD;
           association with symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis. Thus, measurement of the&#xD;
           concentration of NO in expired air may be useful as an indirect assessment of airway&#xD;
           inflammation. Lung production of NO will be measured by collection of a sample of&#xD;
           exhaled gas. Nasal production of NO will be measured directly by connecting a NO&#xD;
           analyzer sampling line to one nostril with the other nostril open to ambient air. During&#xD;
           the nasal measurement the subject will exhale through a cardboard, disposable tube with&#xD;
           a resistance in order to close the palate and prevent contamination of the nasal sample&#xD;
           with. The entire procedure should be completed in less than 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure and testing protocol: Upon arrival at the laboratory, subjects' clinical health&#xD;
      status will be ascertained by medical personnel, including base line heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, evaluation of respiratory symptoms (breath sounds) and general health. All female&#xD;
      subjects will be required to provide a menstrual cycle history and a urine sample will be&#xD;
      required for pregnancy testing. Each pregnancy test will be considered valid for 7 days.&#xD;
      Testing will be postponed if a subject exceeds previously established limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 0.4 ppm ozone exposure will be conducted in an ozone exposure chamber. Each subject will&#xD;
      be exposed to ozone for 2 hours. During the exposure, subjects will perform four 15 minute&#xD;
      bouts of moderate exercise (minute ventilation or VE = 30 40 L/min) on a treadmill, each&#xD;
      separated by 15 minutes of seated rest. Before and after exposure, lung function and breath&#xD;
      sounds will be assessed for any signs of bronchial constriction. Venipuncture (as noted&#xD;
      above) will occur prior to exposure. Measurements of cardiorespiratory performance will be&#xD;
      obtained during each exercise period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 4-6 hours following ozone exposure, venipuncture will occur. Subjects will&#xD;
      perform the sputum induction procedures described above with nebulized inhaled hypertonic&#xD;
      saline (3, 4 and 5%). The subject will remain under medical supervision until pulmonary&#xD;
      function (spirometry) returns to within 5% of pre-exposure baseline values before leaving the&#xD;
      laboratory. Approximately 24 hours after the ozone exposure, subjects will return to the&#xD;
      laboratory for lung function testing and sputum induction, in addition to a venous blood&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each time point (pre and post exposure, and 24 hours post exposure), blood will be drawn&#xD;
      from the vein in forearm into clinical lab tubes. During one of these blood draws the&#xD;
      additional 5ml will be drawn for genotyping. Plasma will be separated from 4 ml and frozen at&#xD;
      70 degrees C for future analysis of mediators of interest, such as cytokines, as well as&#xD;
      other systemic effects of ozone. The remaining blood will be assessed by whole blood assays&#xD;
      for markers of inflammatory and immune activation (CD11b, CD14, CD64, CD16, HLA-DR, CD45,&#xD;
      CD3, CD80, CD86) and function (phagocytosis and oxidative burst) by two colour flow&#xD;
      cytometry. RNA will be extracted from sputum inflammatory cells for microarray analysis,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of participation all subjects will be required to abstain from; ingestion&#xD;
      of Vitamins C and E, aspirin or any other anti-inflammatory medication, exposure to cigarette&#xD;
      smoke or other irritants. In addition, subjects will be asked to have nothing by mouth for 2&#xD;
      hours before sputum induction. They will be asked to arrive in the research lab NPO x 2 hours&#xD;
      on training day and post exposure day, and will have lunch on exposure day at a time that&#xD;
      will allow for the 2 hour NPO requirement.&#xD;
