      Objective: Symptomatic pan-labral or circumferential (360 degree) tears of the glenohumeral&#xD;
      labrum are an uncommon injury. The purpose of this study is to report the prospective&#xD;
      surgical results of circumferential lesions of the glenoid labrum using validated outcome&#xD;
      instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: From July 2003 to May 2006, 41 shoulders in 39 patients with mean age of 25.1 years&#xD;
      (range, 17 to 38) were prospectively enrolled in a multi-center study (3 surgeons) and&#xD;
      treated for a circumferential (360-degree) lesion of the glenoid labrum. There were 34 men&#xD;
      and 5 women, all with a primary diagnosis of pain and recurrent shoulder instability. All&#xD;
      patients underwent arthroscopic repair of the circumferential labral tear with a mean of 7.1&#xD;
      suture anchors (range, 6 to 9). The outcomes in 39 of 41 shoulders (92.7% follow-up) were&#xD;
      assessed at a mean final follow-up of 31.8 months (range, 24 to 53 months) with VAS pain and&#xD;
      instability scales (0 to 10), a physical examination, the Single Assessment Numeric&#xD;
      Evaluation Score (SANE), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES), and the SF-12&#xD;
      score.&#xD;

      Patient Demographics A total of 41 shoulders (34 men, 5 women) with mean age of 25.1 years&#xD;
      (range, 17 to 38 years) were prospectively enrolled. The outcomes in 39 of 41 shoulders&#xD;
      (92.7% follow-up) were assessed at a mean final follow-up of 31.8 months (range, 24 to 53&#xD;
      months). Thirty-seven of 39 patients were right handed. The dominant shoulder was affected in&#xD;
      30 shoulders, non-dominant in 11. Every patient had a primary chief complaint of shoulder&#xD;
      pain with a history of anterior and/or posterior shoulder instability. All had a traumatic&#xD;
      onset of their symptoms, twelve as a result of contact sports and had failed initial&#xD;
      non-operative management. Two patients had had a previous operation, including one patient&#xD;
      with a previous open Bankart, 4 years prior to index operation, and another that had a&#xD;
      previous posterior arthroscopic &quot;labral repair&quot; which subsequently sustained an anterior&#xD;
      dislocation. This was revised with open inferior capsular shift, 2 years prior to index&#xD;
      operation. Twenty-six shoulders presented with clear evidence of primary anterior&#xD;
      instability. These patients clearly remembered the initial dislocation event and&#xD;
      demonstrating an abducted-externally rotated arm at the time of dislocation. Twenty-four of&#xD;
      these patients also had pre-reduction radiographs showing anterior dislocation. An additional&#xD;
      five patients in the group had variable levels of glenoid bone loss (5-10%), with small&#xD;
      Hill-Sachs injuries. Nine shoulders had clear evidence of posterior instability as evidenced&#xD;
      by these patients clearly remembering their initial dislocation event, and demonstrating a&#xD;
      forward flexed, adducted, and internally rotated position of the arm at the time of&#xD;
      dislocation. The remaining six shoulders could not discern between anterior or posterior&#xD;
      instability as a primary direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All physical examinations were performed by the treating orthopedic surgeon. All shoulders&#xD;
      were compared to the contralateral side for range of motion, strength, tenderness, and&#xD;
      provocative maneuvers. Range of motion was examined in forward flexion, abduction, and&#xD;
      external and internal rotation at 00 and 90 0 of abduction. As part of our normal protocol,&#xD;
      values not significantly different from the contralateral side were recorded as &quot;normal&quot;. Any&#xD;
      value noted to be abnormal was to be recorded in degrees, or in the case of internal rotation&#xD;
      at 00, the spinal level. On physical examination no patient was noted to have a significant&#xD;
      loss of active or passive motion in flexion, abduction, internal rotation, or external&#xD;
      rotation at 00. Thirty-nine of the 41 shoulders demonstrated a positive apprehension sign20,&#xD;
      and thus arms were not taken to maximum external rotation in the abducted position in these&#xD;
      patients. Strength testing was accomplished with manual muscle testing compared to the&#xD;
      opposite arm in all 39 patients. Specific testing included shoulder abduction, internal and&#xD;
      external rotation at 00, resisted scaption, lift-off and belly press testing20, as well as&#xD;
      elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, and interosseous muscle testing. No&#xD;
      significant deficit was noted in any of these positions. All patients had pain induced&#xD;
      limitation of strength testing during an active compression test20. Provocative maneuvers&#xD;
      included anterior and posterior load and shift testing, an anterior apprehension test, a&#xD;
      push-pull test for posterior instability, and an active compression test20 . Thirty-nine of&#xD;
      41 shoulders had a positive apprehension test20. Care was taken to place the patient with&#xD;
      their arm in 90 degrees of abduction and increasing external rotation. Patients were asked to&#xD;
      discern when they became symptomatic, and then asked whether the shoulder felt like it was&#xD;
      &quot;coming out&quot; or if their symptoms were just pain. A positive apprehension test was defined as&#xD;
      a sensation of the former. All 39 patients had a positive push-pull test for posterior laxity&#xD;
      20and pain. This test is performed by placing the patient supine on the examining table with&#xD;
      the arm placed in 90 degrees of abduction and neutral rotation. The wrist is grasped and&#xD;
      &quot;pulled&quot; by the examiner with one hand, while the other hand is used to &quot;push&quot; the shoulder&#xD;
      backward. A positive test is signified by subluxation of the joint with a reproduction of the&#xD;
      patient's symptoms. Impingement signs including Neer's sign, Hawkin's sign, and painful arc&#xD;
      were performed on all 39 patients 20. At least one of the signs was positive in all patients.&#xD;
      An active compression test was performed on all 39 patients, and noted to be positive with&#xD;
      pain and weakness in all patients. No patient demonstrated an increased sulcus sign, or any&#xD;
      sign of hyperlaxity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRIs were obtained in all 41 shoulders and all radiologic reports were reviewed. Thirty of 41&#xD;
      of these MRI's were done in conjunction with a gadolinium contrast arthrogram.&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, all patients underwent an examination under anesthesia with particular&#xD;
      attention directed toward anterior and posterior laxity examinations compared to the opposite&#xD;
      side according to the grading system for instability established by the American Shoulder and&#xD;
      Elbow Surgeons 21,22. Inferior laxity was measured by a sulcus sign measured in centimeters&#xD;
      from the edge of the acromion to the top of the humeral head. At arthroscopy, all patients&#xD;
      demonstrated complete circumferential tear of the glenoid labrum. One patient had an&#xD;
      additional complete radial split of the labrum at the 1 o'clock position (anteriorly), which&#xD;
      was repaired. The average patient had 7.1 anchors placed (range, 6-9). Post-operative&#xD;
      examination while still under anesthesia showed restoration of normal anterior and posterior&#xD;
      glenohumeral translation &quot;to the rim&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, patients were seen at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months, 6 months, one year,&#xD;
      and yearly after that. History was taken with particular attention to recurrence of&#xD;
      dislocation or feelings of apprehension or pain. Physical examination beginning at 3 months&#xD;
      assessed range of motion, anterior apprehension, and posterior reproduction of symptoms using&#xD;
      a push-pull test20. In addition, strength testing was accomplished, as was an active&#xD;
      compression test. Patient outcomes were re-accomplished for the SANE, modified ASES and SF-12&#xD;
      visits at each follow-up visit beginning at 6 weeks. In addition, each patient was asked if&#xD;
      he or she would undergo the surgery again. All surveys were administered using a standard&#xD;
      form, and entered into the SOMOS database. Data was combined among surgeons using&#xD;
      de-identified patient data.&#xD;
