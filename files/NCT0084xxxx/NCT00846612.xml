  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study registration at clinicaltrials.gov is divided into 2 records. This record&#xD;
      (NCT00846612) is for pharmacokinetics of Doxil. Another record (NCT00945139) describes the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment upon diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) consists of surgery to achieve&#xD;
      maximal tumor debulking followed by platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel).&#xD;
      Recently, optimally (e.g., &lt; 1 cm residual disease) debulked patients appear to benefit from&#xD;
      regimens that include intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin. While complete response&#xD;
      (CR) is frequently achieved, by two years 50% of the patients show signs of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When EOC presenting at an advanced stage recurs, even after a CR had been achieved, it can no&#xD;
      longer be totally eradicated. Nevertheless, a number of drugs lead to objective responses,&#xD;
      patients benefit with a prolongation of survival. Anti-tumor activity of Doxil against&#xD;
      ovarian cancer was noted in a phase I study, and this was followed by a phase II study that&#xD;
      demonstrated activity in platinum and paclitaxel refractory disease. In the expanded phase II&#xD;
      experience at the University of Southern California, responses to Doxil occurred preferably&#xD;
      in disease that was not bulky and after fewer prior treatments. Typically, several cycles&#xD;
      were required for maximum response, and some patients had prolonged stable disease.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the study of Gordon et al established the preferred role of this drug&#xD;
      formulation in the 2nd line-setting. It is logical, therefore, to build on this agent in&#xD;
      trying to improve the outcome of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, and in particular,&#xD;
      to consider a combination with Avastin, since Avastin has shown agent activity in&#xD;
      retrospective data and recent studies in EOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of Doxil with Avastin has several aspects of interest to ovarian cancer&#xD;
      treatment: 1) independent single-agent activity, 2) enhanced localization of Doxil is&#xD;
      possible via increased half-life (if liposomal egress is diminished) and decreased tumoral&#xD;
      interstitial pressure, 3) improved Doxil distribution, and 4) likely favorable toxicity&#xD;
      profile since Doxil's only common problematic toxicity is to the skin (palmar-plantar&#xD;
      erythrodysesthesia or PPE). Pharmacokinetic issues will be addressed in selected patients, by&#xD;
      comparing cycle 1 (without Avastin) with cycle 2 (with Avastin).&#xD;
