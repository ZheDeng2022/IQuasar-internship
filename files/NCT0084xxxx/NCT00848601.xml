      Patients with hormone and docetaxel refractory prostate cancer or relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for which no available standard therapy or therapy which may provide&#xD;
      clinical benefit is available will be enrolled. Primary objectives: estimate the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary objectives: Response rate,&#xD;

      elimination.&#xD;
