      The purpose of this study is to assess the correlation of the predicted post-operative lung&#xD;
      function with the observed post-operative lung function (FEV1 and DLCO) in patients who&#xD;
      underwent surgical resection (FEV1 = Forced expiratory volume in 1-second. DLCO = Diffusion&#xD;
      capacity for carbon monoxide. ppo = predicted postoperative.)and versus the gold standard&#xD;
      QRRVP (Quantitative Radionuclide Study of Regional Lung Ventilation and Perfusion)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard lung function test uses radioisotopes (materials that produce radiation)&#xD;
      injected in a vein and breathed into the lungs, which can show images of the function of the&#xD;
      lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI system uses pressure sensors that act like electronic stethoscopes (tools used by&#xD;
      doctors to listen to the heart and other sounds in the body). These sensors can record the&#xD;
      energy (vibrations) created by the airflow in the lungs during the breathing process, which&#xD;
      can then be visually imaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start this study, there will be a screening evaluation. The study doctor will&#xD;
      review your medical record to find out if you are eligible to take part in this study.&#xD;
      Information that will be viewed will include whether you have a skin lesion that might&#xD;
      interfere with sensor placement, whether you have a cardiac pacemaker, and/or pregnancy test&#xD;
      results. The study doctor will review with you the other types of information that will be&#xD;
      viewed from your medical record to find out if you are eligible to take part in this study.&#xD;
      For women who are able to have children, if you do not have a negative pregnancy test result&#xD;
      in your medical record, you will not be able to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible and you agree to take part in this study, you will have a&#xD;
      lung function test with the VRI system immediately before or after the standard lung function&#xD;
      test. To perform the VRI test, you will be asked to remove your shirt and put on a garment to&#xD;
      cover the front of your body. You will also be asked to remove your jewelry and other body&#xD;
      accessories. You will then be asked to sit on a backless chair, and you will be instructed&#xD;
      how to sit with the proper posture and breathe correctly for this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before recording starts, the sensors will be cleaned and then placed on your back. You will&#xD;
      be instructed to breathe deeply for up to 12 seconds (about 2-3 times), and the vibration&#xD;
      responses will be recorded. You will have a total of 3 recording sessions, one after the&#xD;
      other. Once all the recording is done, the sensors will be removed. The VRI image of the&#xD;
      vibrations will then be examined by the operator in order to check the quality of the image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signals recorded from the sensors will be transferred to a computer so that researchers&#xD;
      can study the images. The results of the recordings will be compared with the standard lung&#xD;
      function test results. This will help researchers learn the level of accuracy of the VRI&#xD;
      system in predicting how the lungs will function after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not be told of the results from the VRI testing because the results will not be used&#xD;
      to diagnose your medical condition, nor will any medical decisions be made based on the VRI&#xD;
      results. The VRI system is only used for investigational purposes in this study and will not&#xD;
      replace the current diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you undergo surgery, as part of your standard care, you will also return to the clinic for&#xD;
      standard tests to check your lung function 4-12 weeks and 4-12 months after your surgery.&#xD;
      Researchers will compare your pre-surgery test results (both the standard test results and&#xD;
      the VRI results) with the results of the tests after surgery (standard tests) to learn the&#xD;
      level of accuracy of the VRI system in predicting how the lungs will function after surgery.&#xD;
