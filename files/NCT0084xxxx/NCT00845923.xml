      This proof of concept study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically&#xD;
      administered Civamide Patch for the treatment of moderate to severe daily pain associated&#xD;
      with postherpetic neuralgia localized to the trunk, and with localized post-incisional&#xD;
      neuropathic pain syndromes on the trunk.&#xD;

      There will be up to approximately 20 evaluable subjects in this open-label study. The study&#xD;
      is composed of a 1-week non-treatment Baseline Period (Day -7 to -1), during which subjects&#xD;
      will be required to complete a Daily Diary assessing overall pain and sleep interference. The&#xD;
      1-week Baseline Period will be followed by a 4-week Treatment Period, in which subjects will&#xD;
      apply the Civamide Patch (0.015%) daily 12 hours per day, for a period of 4 weeks, complete a&#xD;
      Daily Diary assessing overall pain and sleep interference, followed by a 2-week&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Observation Period. In the course of the study, subjects will visit the clinic&#xD;
      a total of five times for physical examinations, vital signs, review of diaries, and&#xD;
      distribution and collection of test patches. Efficacy assessment will be the mean change from&#xD;
      Baseline Period in efficacy variables during the course of the study.&#xD;
