  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of long-acting&#xD;
      injectable risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic medication used for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia, when it is administered as an intramuscular injection via the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle, compared with intramuscular injection via the gluteal muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized, open label, single dose, multicenter, 2-way crossover study comprising&#xD;
      a screening phase, 2 open-label treatment periods, and end-of-study evaluations. The study&#xD;
      population will comprise patients with chronic stable schizophrenia. Patients will be allowed&#xD;
      to continue on their existing oral antipsychotic treatment throughout the study, if not&#xD;
      receiving disallowed mediations, per protocol. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive&#xD;
      treatment in 1 of 2 panels. In each panel, patients will receive a single intramuscular&#xD;
      injection of long-acting injectable risperidone in each treatment period, in a 2-way&#xD;
      crossover design. In Panel I, patients will receive 25 mg long-acting injectable risperidone&#xD;
      via the gluteal muscle and 37.5 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the deltoid muscle&#xD;
      during the study period. In Panel II, patients will receive 50 mg long-acting injectable&#xD;
      risperidone via the gluteal muscle and 50 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle. There will be a washout period of 85 days between each administration of&#xD;
      study drug. The primary outcome will be comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for 37.5 mg deltoid versus 25 mg&#xD;
      gluteal, and for 50 mg deltoid versus 50 mg gluteal. Safety will be assessed at screening,&#xD;
      throughout the open-label treatment phase, and at the end of study or early withdrawal using&#xD;
      a combination of adverse events (including occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms as assessed&#xD;
      by the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale), clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum&#xD;
      chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), vital signs, physical examinations,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, and injection site evaluation. The study hypothesis is that intramuscular&#xD;
      injections of long-acting injectable risperidone via the gluteal and deltoid sites will be&#xD;
      bioequivalent routes of administration, as measured by peak and total drug concentrations in&#xD;
      the plasma, and that the safety and tolerability profiles of the 2 injection sites will be&#xD;
      comparable. The patients will receive a single injection of long--acting injectable&#xD;
      risperidone (25 mg, 37.5 mg or 50 mg) in their gluteal or deltoid muscle in 2 treatment&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
