    <textblock>
      An exploratory Phase-II trial with intradermal RN1001 (Avotermin) to investigate scar&#xD;
      prevention and reduction and acceleration of healing. The trial has an additional objective&#xD;
      to evaluate several different scar assessment techniques that can be used in future clinical&#xD;
      trials in the prevention and reduction of scarring.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Double blind, randomised, Placebo and Standard Care controlled, single centre study. Each&#xD;
      subject receives a total of 6 wounds, two incisions and four punch biopsies. Each subject&#xD;
      serves as their own control, i.e. Arm 1 incisions/biopsies randomly received one of two&#xD;
      treatments and Arm 2 incisions/biopsies received the same treatments as for Arm 1 but in&#xD;
      reverse. The randomisation of the treatment allowed for control of possible positional&#xD;
      effects on healing/scarring. Healed scars from incisional wounds excised from Arm 1 and Arm 2&#xD;
      after 6 months for histological analysis.&#xD;

          -  Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality following review of pre trial&#xD;
             laboratory data and physical examination (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;

             topical or inhaled corticosteroid therapy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or&#xD;

          -  Subjects who have evidence of drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are known to have or had serum hepatitis or who are carriers of the&#xD;

             vaccination against Hepatitis B are not excluded per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are known to have or had serum hepatitis or who are carriers of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have previously had a positive result to the test for HIV antibodies, or&#xD;
             who admit to belonging to a high-risk group.&#xD;
