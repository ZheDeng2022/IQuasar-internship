      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and bevacizumab, can block cancer growth&#xD;
      in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving&#xD;
      fludarabine phosphate together with rituximab and bevacizumab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine phosphate together with&#xD;
      rituximab and bevacizumab works in treating patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
      that has relapsed or not responded to treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate PFS at 2 years after FR plus Avastin (A) induction followed by Rituximab plus&#xD;
      Avastin (RA) maintenance therapy for relapsed/refractory CLL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate response rates after FR-A induction and RA maintenance therapy. II. To&#xD;
      eliminate residual disease (documented by flow cytometry and/or PCR) in patients who have&#xD;
      achieved a CR after FR-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the rate of conversion of PR to CR after FR-A. IV. To determine the safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of FR-A and RA maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 20-30 minutes once daily on&#xD;
      days 1-5 and rituximab IV once daily on days 4 or 5. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 6&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 8 of&#xD;
      course 1, patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving complete response, partial response, or nodular partial response proceed&#xD;
      to maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 2 months after completion of induction treatment, patients&#xD;
      receive rituximab IV every 3 months and bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment continues for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;
