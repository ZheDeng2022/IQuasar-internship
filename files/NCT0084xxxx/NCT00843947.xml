    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of RIST, conditioned&#xD;
      with fludarabine and busulfan, using G-CSF mobilized PBSC from an HLA-matched sibling or an&#xD;
      unrelated volunteer donor. The primary endpoint of this study is day 100 TRM (Treatment&#xD;
      Related Mortality). Secondary endpoints include response, engraftment times, acute and&#xD;
      chronic GVHD, chimerism, toxicities, progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy and toxicity of Reduced Intensity Transplant (RIST) for patients&#xD;
           with hematological malignancies, conditioned with fludarabine (Fludara®) and busulfan&#xD;
           intravenous (Busulfex™).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine donor chimerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the risk of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).&#xD;

        Disease Subtype Disease Status Leukemia Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) Recurrent disease&#xD;
        in remission* OR CR1 with poor-risk cytogenetics, antecedent hematological disease (i.e.&#xD;
        myelodysplasia) or treatment-related leukemia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Recurrent&#xD;
        disease in remission* OR CR1 with Philadelphia chromosome or poor risk cytogenetics Chronic&#xD;
        myelogenous leukemia (CML) First or second chronic phase. There must be documented disease&#xD;
        progression after imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) therapy OR documented lack of cytogenetic&#xD;
        response 6 months post-imatinib initiation OR imatinib intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient - Inclusion criteria (Continued) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Recurrent&#xD;
        disease after fludarabine-based therapy. Patients must have chemosensitive** disease at the&#xD;
        time of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lymphoma Recurrent Hodgkin's Lymphoma&#xD;

&#xD;
        Transformed NHL Patients must have had prior autologous transplantation and received&#xD;
        cytoreductive therapy at the time of relapse to achieve complete remission (CR) or&#xD;
        CR/unconfirmed (CRu) as defined by the International Workshop&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient with relapsed disease and required &gt;2 salvage regimens to achieve CR or CRu.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Multiple Myeloma Recurrent Myeloma Patients must have had prior autologous transplantation&#xD;
        and demonstrate chemosensitivity** at the time of relapse Myelodysplastic Syndrome #&#xD;
