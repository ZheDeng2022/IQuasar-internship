  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. It is a disease that can be&#xD;
      prevented if it is found early. Colonoscopy is still the best screening tool for colon cancer&#xD;
      and the polyps that turn into colon cancer. However, due to a variety of factors, including&#xD;
      affordability, time, and age, not all patients are able to be screened. Researchers are&#xD;
      working on other options for early detection that are as accurate as colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study if to determine if stool or blood can be used to detect colon&#xD;
      cancers as early or earlier than colonoscopy. The researchers plan to use these samples to&#xD;
      learn about specific proteins (also known as biomarkers) that may indicate colon polyps,&#xD;
      colon cancer or an increased risk of developing colon cancer. In order to learn more about&#xD;
      preventing and detecting colon and rectal cancer, we are collecting samples from subjects&#xD;
      with cancer, adenomas, and colonoscopies who may be at risk for polyps.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recognition of the fact that novel potential biomarkers are continually being identified&#xD;
      and will need to be validated in a rapid, efficient and scientifically rigorous manner, the&#xD;
      NCI has made an enormous commitment to the development of a network that will facilitate&#xD;
      biomarker development and validation in multiple organ sites. As part of the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute-funded Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), the Great Lakes-New England&#xD;
      Clinical Epidemiological Center (GLNE CEC) proposes a research study that validates potential&#xD;
      molecular markers (&quot;biomarkers&quot;) for the detection of precancerous and cancerous conditions&#xD;
      and cancer risk assessment. Although examples of such biomarkers are currently in clinical&#xD;
      use (i.e. CEA, CA-125), there are limitations to all of them. Our consortium focuses on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal neoplasia. The goals of this phase of the proposed research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, serum-based and urine-based&#xD;
           biomarkers for discriminating between patients with adenocarcinomas, patients with&#xD;
           adenomas, patients without adenomas and normal subjects both at normal and high risk for&#xD;
           developing colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Construction of a panel of markers from those considered in Objective 1 to discriminate,&#xD;
           under a number of assumptions concerning prevalence and cost of misclassification,&#xD;
           between:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subjects with normal colons versus patients without adenomas, patients with&#xD;
                adenomas and patients with cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects with normal colons, patients without adenomas and patients with adenomas,&#xD;
                versus subjects with cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects with normal colons versus patients without and patients with adenomas&#xD;
                versus patients with cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of the characteristics of individual markers and panels as discriminators to&#xD;
           those of the established current standard, fecal immunochemical test (FIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Continued support of a renewal of a bank of stool samples linked to serum, tissue, and&#xD;
           clinical data from patients with colorectal cancer, adenomas and normal controls for&#xD;
           validation of stool-based markers that may be developed in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To build our collection, we propose to collect stool, FIT, serum, plasma, and tissue samples&#xD;
      from 1200 new subjects. Each biomarker will be analyzed individually and considered as a&#xD;
      potential panel marker to be used for future largescale screening longitudinal trials. (This&#xD;
      protocol previously recruited an additional 682 subjects from January 2006 to June 2010.)&#xD;
