  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of anti-VEGF treatments such as Bevacizumab in cases of HHT can be considered&#xD;
      because of the molecular mechanisms implied in angiogenesis and HHT, as well as the&#xD;
      mechanisms of action of this type of treatment. Two articles that have recently reported&#xD;
      spectacular improvement thanks to Bevacizumab in patients with HHT complicated with severe&#xD;
      liver involvement and cardiac effects support us in this sense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, the only treatment recommended in the severe hepatic forms of HHT is a liver&#xD;
      transplant, the disadvantages of which are both multiple and well known: long waiting lists,&#xD;
      surgical morbidity and mortality, immunosuppressive treatment for life. Furthermore,&#xD;
      treatment with Bevacizumab is not a contraindication, should the drug be ineffective, for a&#xD;
      subsequent liver transplant if necessary.&#xD;
