  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy (how well it works) of&#xD;
      exenatide as a treatment for weight gain associated with olanzapine in obese adults with&#xD;
      Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exenatide has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has not been approved for the treatment of weight gain associated with olanzapine in obese&#xD;
      adults with bipolar disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective&#xD;
      Disorder&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind studies suggest that olanzapine is highly effective for the treatment of&#xD;
      individuals with bipolar disorder. However, weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance remain&#xD;
      significant concerns associated with olanzapine. Exenatide is an anti-diabetic medication&#xD;
      that is associated with weight loss and improved glucose regulation. Therefore, the overall&#xD;
      goal of the proposed study is to conduct a 16-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      exenatide for the treatment of weight gain associated with olanzapine in 60 obese adults with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder treated with olanzapine. We propose to conduct the study over the course of&#xD;
      24 months, with an expected enrollment of approximately 3 patients per month. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be change from baseline to endpoint in weight. The secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will include changes from baseline to endpoint, in body mass index (BMI), abdominal&#xD;
      circumference, metabolic parameters, clinical global improvement of psychiatric symptoms, and&#xD;
      change in manic, depressive and psychotic symptoms. Rates of adverse events also will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
