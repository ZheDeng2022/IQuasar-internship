        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Only patients with measurable disease (According to RECIST) at baseline should be&#xD;
             included in protocol where Disease Control Rate (DCR) is the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient requires Sorafenib as First line therapy as the patient is unsuitable for&#xD;
             another approved first line therapy for advanced RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient must be, in the Investigator's opinion, reasonably likely to benefit from&#xD;
             treatment with Sorafenib as a single agent.&#xD;
