      To determine the EFFICACY and the SAFETY PROFILE and TOXICITY of Zarnestra® in the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma not appropriate for autologous bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation. 27 evaluable subjects will be enrolled for an analysis in 2 stages&#xD;
      (11 for the first stage, 16 for the second).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive at least one dose of Zarnestra® and have at least one post-baseline&#xD;
      response assessment of discontinued study frug for early progression are evaluable. Subjects&#xD;
      not evaluable for response will be replaced, up to 35 patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zarnestra® will be administered at 300 mg administered orally twice daily for the first 21&#xD;
      days of each 28-days cycle. Tipifarnib treatment stops no later than day 21 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a total of 4 cycles of treatment. Two additional cycles might be&#xD;
      administered for patients showing improvement to PR after 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After testing the drug on 11 patients in the first stage, the trial will be terminated if 1&#xD;
      or fewer respond and the drug will not be considered as effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If two or more patients respond in the first stage, the trial goes on to the second stage to&#xD;
      include a total of 27 patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient not able to receive high dose autologous stem cell transplantation with&#xD;
             relapsed, refractory or progressive MCL after prior anti-neoplastic treatment. Relapse&#xD;
             or progression since previous anti-neoplastic therapy must be documented by new&#xD;
             lesions or objective evidence of progression of existing lesions. Biopsy is not&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
