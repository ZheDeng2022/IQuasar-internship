  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of an investigational drug, sunitinib malate in patients&#xD;
      with advanced malignant paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma cancer. Paragangliomas (PGs) are&#xD;
      tumours that arise from the para-sympathetic system in the head and neck and sympathetic&#xD;
      system in the thorax and abdomen. Paragangliomas that secrete hormones (catecholamines) from&#xD;
      the adrenal glands are called pheochromocytomas (PCs). In this study, patients whose disease&#xD;
      has advanced or spread despite prior standard therapy, will receive sunitinib for 4-weeks&#xD;
      followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 months, in the absence of disease progression.&#xD;
      Sunitinib is an investigational drug, which has been shown to shrink tumours in several&#xD;
      tumour models. The study will evaluate the efficacy as well as the toxicity profile of&#xD;
      sunitinib when used as an alternative treatment for patients with PG/PC tumours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single arm, open-label, phase II trial of sunitinib in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or locally advanced malignant paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma. Oral sunitinib&#xD;
      (50 mg) will be administered to all patients daily for the first four weeks of a six week&#xD;
      study cycle, followed by a 2-week rest. Patients will be assessed for response to study&#xD;
      treatment using MRI/CT scans as well as bio-chemical tests, and will receive the study&#xD;
      treatment for up to 12 months or until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study outcomes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy (response rate) of sunitinib given orally daily for 4 out of every 6&#xD;
      weeks in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document effects of sunitinib on markers of biochemical activity of advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
