  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if adding a home exercise program to a clinic&#xD;
      physical therapy program will improve the fatigue experienced by patients being treated with&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy for high grade gliomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in patients undergoing outpatient&#xD;
      therapies to treat their cancers. Despite a consistent increase in both awareness and&#xD;
      research, cancer-related fatigue remains poorly understood and poorly treated by the&#xD;
      worldwide medical community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical and emotional impact of cancer-related fatigue on Activities of Daily Living and&#xD;
      Independent Activities of Daily Living can be profound. Simple tasks such as preparing meals&#xD;
      and performing household chores become laborious. Walking up and down the aisles of grocery&#xD;
      stores may send a patient directly to bed for the rest of the day upon returning home. In&#xD;
      addition, if cancer-related fatigue contributes to prolonged bed rest, the secondary&#xD;
      development of other medical problems can further impact quality of life and possibly length&#xD;
      of life. Furthermore, the economic impact of cancer-related fatigue includes patients taking&#xD;
      more days off work and reducing the number of hours they are able to work. Lastly,&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue often impacts the psychosocial well-being and family dynamics of&#xD;
      patients, caregivers and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is the strongest non-pharmacological intervention for management of cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue. Certain exercises have specifically demonstrated reduction in fatigue. An exercise&#xD;
      program that incorporates strengthening and aerobic conditioning can decrease fatigue scores.&#xD;
      Improvements in patient-reported cancer-related fatigue through the use of exercise has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in various diseases, such as anemia, and several cancer types, most notably&#xD;
      breast cancer. Furthermore, home exercise programs have shown meaningful improvements in&#xD;
      patient reported fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the effect that the addition of a 6-week Physical&#xD;
      Therapist-directed home exercise program has on the pattern, severity, and quality of life of&#xD;
      patient reported fatigue.&#xD;
