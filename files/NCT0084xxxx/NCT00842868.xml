      The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between novel blood tests for&#xD;
      heart function (including hormones and heart enzymes measured in the blood), and assess for&#xD;
      kidney damage before and after angiography (cardiac catheterization). We hypothesize that&#xD;
      these novel tests will enable us to predict possible complications of catheterization&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between (novel) cardiac and&#xD;
      renal biomarkers before and after angiography. Clearly, having data immediately forewarning&#xD;
      the clinician that cardiomyocyte injury has occurred, or that impending renal failure is&#xD;
      ahead would allow for therapeutic intervention to reduce the likelihood for severe&#xD;
      complications, and would ultimately pave the way for opportunities to derive methods to&#xD;
      better prevent these complications. With the rapid evolution of organ-specific markers of&#xD;
      injury comes an opportunity to explore new venues for their application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to myocardial injury, a new highly sensitive troponin molecule testing assays&#xD;
      have recently been validated which enables to detect extremely small concentrations of&#xD;
      troponin released in the circulation. With these assays, it may be possible to detect&#xD;
      possible troponin release as early as minutes after injury has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, as a primary goal of the CASABLANCA study, we will examine the release of high&#xD;
      sensitivity troponin assays during catheterization and correlate with clinical and standard&#xD;
      biochemical measures in order to see if a gradient of change during catheterization would be&#xD;
      associated with subsequent recognition of peri-procedural myocardial infarction; it is the&#xD;
      expectation that ultra high-sensitivity troponin methods will allow for nearly immediate&#xD;
      recognition of complications following heart catheterization, when compared to the standard,&#xD;
      non-high sensitivity methods currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to peri-procedural renal injury, at present, several serum markers are being&#xD;
      studied as potential markers or predictors in contrast induced nephropathy (CIN): Neutrophil&#xD;
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is highly accumulated in the kidney cortical tubules&#xD;
      and leaks into the circulation after nephrotoxic and ischemic injuries. Up-regulation of the&#xD;
      neutrophil adhesion receptor CD11b has also been associated with acute renal injury after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery, while carbamylated hemoglobin performed quite well in differentiating acute&#xD;
      kidney injury from elevated creatinine due to chronic kidney disease. Finally, Cystatin-C has&#xD;
      shown to have a good accuracy for the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury before the&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, blood will be stored for future testing of novel and experimental biomarkers in&#xD;
      'bench-to-bedside' collaborations, as a final yet crucial step in translational research.&#xD;
