      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that erlotinib improves overall survival in selected patients&#xD;
      with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC. Furthermore, pre-clinical and phase II studies have shown a&#xD;
      potential for synergism between erlotinib and docetaxel. This study will further evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of combination treatment on overall survival in selected NSCLC patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on recent published data, the treatment cycle in this study will be 22 days with two&#xD;
      infusions (Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle). This is different from the standard therapy care&#xD;
      of 28-day cycle (three infusions on Days 1, 8 and 15). The shorter 22-day cycle was shown to&#xD;
      be just as effective as the 28-day cycle and is expected to increase subject compliance and&#xD;
      decrease chemotherapy-induced toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority in progression-free-survival, when&#xD;
      erlotinib is added to docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (defined as the time period from the start of first-line therapy to&#xD;
           death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to treatment failure or disease progression (defined as the time period from the&#xD;
           start of first-line therapy to investigator assessed disease progression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor response rate and duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  microRNA profile (assessed from human lung biopsy and/or cytology samples) at screening&#xD;
           for prognostic purposes&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a Phase II, open-label, single-center, repeat dose, study. After a two-week&#xD;
      screening phase, eligible subjects will receive combined docetaxel and erlotinib treatment&#xD;
      over six cycles. Each 22-day treatment cycle will consist of two infusion of docetaxel,&#xD;
      one-week apart followed by one week rest, and daily administration of erlotinib. Subjects,&#xD;
      who complete six cycles of combination therapy, will continue receiving erlotinib monotherapy&#xD;
      for as long as they are benefiting from this therapy in the opinion of the investigator (i.e.&#xD;
      until continued toxicity or disease progression or withdrawal from the study). Subjects will&#xD;
      be evaluated for safety and radiologic tumor assessment throughout the study until death. The&#xD;
      study will be terminated after every living patient has had a follow up of at least 6 months&#xD;
      after stopping TarcevaTM, or when all patients have died.&#xD;
