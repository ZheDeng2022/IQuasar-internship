    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine if oral administration of Pariet (proton pump inhibitor, 20mg tablets, twice&#xD;
           daily for 5 days) before Endoscopic mucosal resection(EMR) exhibits preventive effects&#xD;
           of ulcer bleeding compared with placebo group (preoperative administration of placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects on the suppression of acid secretion of preoperative&#xD;
           administration of an Proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is less invasive than surgery and is known to be&#xD;
           general treatment for early gastric cancer or gastric adenoma when patients' quality of&#xD;
           life is taken into consideration. However, major complications such as bleeding and&#xD;
           perforation remain to be problematic.1-5 The incidence of these complications is&#xD;
           expected to rise as the size of lesions for which EMR is indicated has enlarged.&#xD;
           Histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been used&#xD;
           for the bleeding,1-3 but the bleeding rate following EMR has been reported to be still&#xD;
           high as 1.4% to 24%.1,4 Green et al and Berstad et al cited in their research that&#xD;
           intragastric PH should be sustained above 5.4 to prevent bleeding, and PPIs should be&#xD;
           administered instead of H2RAs to keep PH above 5.4. Being studied are administration&#xD;
           modalities to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PPIs or H2RAs.1-3 Several studies have&#xD;
           already demonstrated that high-dose PPI therapy, for which a PPI was administered twice&#xD;
           daily, effectively blocks acid secretion by increasing intragastric pH to neutral.3 Our&#xD;
           study team also suggested in a previous study that high-dose PPI therapy was adequate to&#xD;
           maintain intragastric pH above 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PPIs are known to induce the suppression of acid secretion because they destroy a proton&#xD;
           pump, yet it takes 5 days to achieve their maximum effects.7,8 It's been suggested that&#xD;
           the onset of PPIs is slow to prevent bleeding with administration of a PPI after EMR.4&#xD;
           Therefore, our investigators expect that 5-day administration of an oral PPI before EMR&#xD;
           would increase intragastric pH to above 6 and would be at least equal to or superior to&#xD;
           intravenous PPIs currently being used in terms of the suppression of acid secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective, randomized, comparative study to substantiate that oral&#xD;
           administration of rabeprazole (Pariet tablets) 20mg twice daily before and after EMR (PO&#xD;
           RBP group) will show similar effects on the prevention of bleeding compared with the&#xD;
           conventional treatment with iv administration of pantoprazole after EMR but no special&#xD;
           medication given before EMR (Placebo group). In addition, we are going to measure&#xD;
           intragastric pH among part of study subjects and then to evaluate if the effect of acid&#xD;
           suppression in the PO RBP group is superior to that in the placebo group.&#xD;
