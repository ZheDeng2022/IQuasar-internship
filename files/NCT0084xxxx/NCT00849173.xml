  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis, a condition in which the lining of the uterus grows on nearby tissues, is a&#xD;
      common condition that affects women of reproductive age worldwide. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The most common symptom is pelvic pain. This pain&#xD;
      may occur at the same time as menstrual bleeding, at other times of the cycle, or during or&#xD;
      after sexual intercourse. Previous studies reveal the diagnosis of endometriosis is often&#xD;
      delayed between 8 and 12 years after the first symptoms. Women with chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      report a lower quality of life. No studies, however, have been conducted to assess whether&#xD;
      women with endometriosis-related pelvic pain are affected differently than those with pelvic&#xD;
      pain from other or no identifiable causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This large-scale study is designed to gather prospective epidemiological data on the impact&#xD;
      of and risk factors for endometriosis across countries worldwide. A study of this scale and&#xD;
      scope has never been performed; it is anticipated that the study will provide novel insights&#xD;
      into the effects of the condition and associated symptoms on women s lives across different&#xD;
      countries, as well as explore differences in the effects of various potential risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an international study conducted at more than 20 sites worldwide and coordinated by&#xD;
      Oxford University in the United Kingdom. At the National Institutes of Health, 250&#xD;
      premenopausal women between 18 and 45 years of age who are having their first diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy or laparoscopy for tubal sterilization will participate. None will have had a&#xD;
      prior diagnosis of endometriosis through surgery. Women will be informed about the study when&#xD;
      their laparoscopy is scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient completion of an online questionnaire before scheduled surgery. The following&#xD;
           will be assessed by the questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General gynecologic and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of health care services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgeon completion of questionnaire about surgical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: Women who consent will be contacted every 1 2 years.&#xD;

      This large-scale study is designed to gather prospective epidemiological data on the impact&#xD;
      of and risk-factors for endometriosis across countries world-wide. A study of this scale and&#xD;
      scope has never been performed; it is anticipated to provide novel insights into the effects&#xD;
      of the condition and associated symptoms on women s lives across different countries, as well&#xD;
      as explore (differences in) the effects of various potential risk-factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a clinic-based patient survey of prospectively recruited women&#xD;
      undergoing a laparoscopy for symptoms suggestive of endometriosis or for tubal sterilization.&#xD;
      Descriptive, as well as nested case-control studies will be conducted using information&#xD;
      collected from patients in the registry to investigate the impact of endometriosis and&#xD;
      associated symptoms, and test etiological hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: The primary purpose of this survey is to collect systematic, comprehensive&#xD;
      epidemiological information on the impact of endometriosis among women world-wide, in terms&#xD;
      of prevalence, diagnostic delay, quality of life, economic effect indicators, health care&#xD;
      utilization, and risk-factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: A secondary purpose of the register is to provide a frame-work for future&#xD;
      follow-up studies of women diagnosed with endometriosis, allowing the investigation of&#xD;
      indicators of effectiveness of different treatment options; long-term quality of life issues,&#xD;
      as well as personal and economic (productivity) costs of endometriosis. The multi-center&#xD;
      nature of the study should allow variability of endometriosis illness outcomes and&#xD;
      associations to be assessed across participating countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic descriptive analyses will include prevalence estimates according to different age and&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, across countries. The analyses of most outcomes will be&#xD;
      conducted by comparing women with endometriosis (cases) to those without (controls), both of&#xD;
      which will have been recruited through the same process. To avoid bias, cases will be matched&#xD;
      to controls on characteristics such as age, country of residence and clinic attended. The&#xD;
      analysis of the data will take into consideration this matching; in addition, adjustment for&#xD;
      symptoms for which the laparoscopy was indicated (pelvic pain, infertility) will be included.&#xD;
      Continuous variables and categorical variables will be analyzed with the appropriate&#xD;
      statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Patient Participation: Women are informed about the study at the consultation&#xD;
      during which their laparoscopy is scheduled. If they accept to participate, they are asked to&#xD;
      fill in an online questionnaire any time before their scheduled surgery. Unless they consent&#xD;
      to being contacted sometime in the future for follow-up surveys, their active participation&#xD;
      in the study ends. If they wish to participate in future surveys, they will be contacted at&#xD;
      most every 1-2 years.&#xD;
