      The purpose of this study is to compare different forms of treatment for substance abuse.&#xD;
      This study will involve a type of treatment called contingency management, in which patients&#xD;
      receive incentives (prizes) for attending outpatient treatment. This study will compare&#xD;
      contingency management to standard treatment that does not involve incentives. This study&#xD;
      will also compare contingency management treatment that lasts 6 weeks to contingency&#xD;
      management that lasts 12 weeks. Finally, this study will compare contingency management&#xD;
      treatment delivered at the beginning of outpatient treatment to contingency management&#xD;
      treatment delivered later during outpatient treatment. The investigators hypothesize that (1)&#xD;
      a 12-week attendance-based contingency management intervention will improve retention and&#xD;
      enhance drug abstinence versus standard treatment, (2) initial short-term exposure to&#xD;
      attendance-based contingency management (in weeks 1-6 only) will improve substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment outcomes compared to standard treatment alone, and (3) contingency management in&#xD;
      weeks 7-12 will be particularly useful for those with sporadic attendance or continued drug&#xD;
      use during initial stages of treatment.&#xD;
