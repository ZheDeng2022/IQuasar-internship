      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of&#xD;
      compound 1278863A in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through&#xD;
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is&#xD;
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. Compound 111427 was the first administration of&#xD;
      compound 1278863A to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of single oral doses up to 300 mg in healthy adult subjects. This study,&#xD;
      PHI112842, will be the first administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of repeat oral doses up to 300 mg for 14&#xD;
      days in healthy adult subjects. At least 6 subjects will complete each cohort. Multiple blood&#xD;
      samples for pharmacokinetic analyses will be obtained post-dose in each cohort. Safety will&#xD;
      be assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse event&#xD;
      assessments and laboratory safety tests. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
