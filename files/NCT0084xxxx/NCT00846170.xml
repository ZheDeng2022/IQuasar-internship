  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are defined as 'mono- or mixed cultures of live micro-organisms which, when&#xD;
      applied to animal or man, beneficially affect the host by improving the properties of the&#xD;
      indigenous flora'. Certain probiotics possess potent antibacterial and antiviral properties.&#xD;
      Probiotic antibacterial activity may derive from the direct secretion of bacteriocins, the&#xD;
      elaboration of proteases directed against bacterial toxins or through their ability to adhere&#xD;
      to epithelial cells and thus exclude pathogens. The antiviral properties of some probiotic&#xD;
      organisms, including the stimulation of interferon production, together with the&#xD;
      well-documented efficacy of certain probiotics in the therapy of rotavirus diarrhea suggests&#xD;
      the potential for a role for these agents in PI-IBS. The efficacy of some probiotics in&#xD;
      preferentially relieving 'gas-related' symptoms may be related to qualitative changes in the&#xD;
      colonic flora, as described earlier, or through the suppression of Small intestinal bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth (SIBO) , as there are reports of efficacy of probiotics in SIBO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to investigate whether the probiotic preparation &quot;co biotic&quot;&#xD;
      can change the composition of fecal bile acids, fatty acids and bacterial composition, and&#xD;
      whether such changes, if they occur, are correlated to a change in the symptoms of patients&#xD;
      with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed as having IBS by the Rome III criteria will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be interviewed by a physician who will asses the diagnosis of IBS&#xD;
      according to the Rome III criteria. Subjects will sign an informed consent and fill an IBS&#xD;
      questionnaire and a health related quality of life questionnaire,&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fecal sample will be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will receive the probiotic product in a dose of 2 tablets/day, or a placebo&#xD;
      containing all the active ingredients in the probiotic capsule, besides the bacteria, for 4&#xD;
      weeks. They will then enter a washout period of 2 weeks in which they will not receive&#xD;
      anything, and then another 4 weeks in which they will receive the probiotic product in a dose&#xD;
      of 2 tablets/day, or a placebo. Patients will be randomized so that they will receive the&#xD;
      study drug for 4 weeks and the placebo for 4 weeks, in a double-blinded fashion. Thus each&#xD;
      patient will be his own control.&#xD;
