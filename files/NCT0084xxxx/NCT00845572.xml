  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish a bi-weekly Consta Club. Participants will begin taking Risperdal&#xD;
      Consta after being recommended by their treating physician. As a part of the Consta Club&#xD;
      attendees will receive their injection of Risperdal Consta and be educated about important&#xD;
      mental health issues. Interviews with study participants will be completed every three months&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness of the change to Risperdal Consta and the bi-weekly group. The&#xD;
      overall hypothesis is that the individuals in Consta Club will have a decrease in walk-in&#xD;
      visits, emergency procedures and hospitalizations. It is also believed that individuals in&#xD;
      Consta Club will have fewer symptoms and better levels of functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to oral antipsychotic medication leads to rehospitalization, derails the&#xD;
      process of recovery, and contributes to the high cost of treating schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, poor adherence is common for individuals with this diagnosis. An organizing&#xD;
      hypothesis of our research program is that forgetfulness and failure to establish a routine&#xD;
      that facilitates medication adherence are prominent reasons for non-adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have established a thirty minute bi-weekly Consta Club in which individuals will attend a&#xD;
      social group and and also receive their injection of Risperdal Consta. Consta Club will&#xD;
      educate individuals about the importance of medication adherence as well as establish a&#xD;
      routine that facilitates adherence. The club will provide the opportunity for the club&#xD;
      members to discuss their mental illness, develop goals to recovery, establish a means of&#xD;
      transportation to the club and participate in drawings to win prizes. The overall hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the individuals in Consta Club will experience a decrease in walk-in visits,&#xD;
      emergency procedures and hospitalizations. It is also hypothesized that individuals in Consta&#xD;
      Club will demonstrate lower levels of symptomatology, higher levels of quality of life and&#xD;
      improvements in functioning when compared to their baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of twenty-five individuals will be recruited to switch from an oral atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication to Risperdal Consta which will be supplied by Janssen Pharmaceutica&#xD;
      at no cost to the individual or the clinic. Individuals will be recruited prior to hospital&#xD;
      discharge if inpatient at time of recruitment OR from the local mental health clinic.&#xD;
      Hospitalized individuals will be started on Risperdal Consta prior to discharge and&#xD;
      outpatients will switch from oral atypical antipsychotics within two weeks. Individuals will&#xD;
      be receiving a single injection of Risperdal Consta every two weeks. Prior to the switch and&#xD;
      every 3 months for a period of 9 months the individual will be assessed.&#xD;
