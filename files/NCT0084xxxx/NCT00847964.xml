    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the Algisyl-LVR™ device. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate Algisyl-LVR™ employed as a method of left ventricular&#xD;
      restoration in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who are scheduled to undergo routine open&#xD;
      heart surgery. Algisyl-LVR™ will be injected into the myocardium under direct visualization&#xD;
      during the surgical procedure. This clinical evaluation is intended to provide the initial&#xD;
      evidence of the safety and feasibility of the device as well as the procedure used to deploy&#xD;
      the device. The results of the initial trial will also help to establish the utility of&#xD;
      various assessments in evaluating and following the effects of the device.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) is a progressive condition that has diverse etiologies with only 50&#xD;
      percent of patients presenting at diagnosis with a defined reason for developing the disease.&#xD;
      However, estimates are that over half of all patients presenting with HF have coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD) as the primary etiology. The most common etiologies among HF patients without&#xD;
      CAD have been reported to be systemic hypertension and valvular disease. Irrespective of the&#xD;
      etiology, the majority of patients with HF have symptoms due to an impairment of left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) myocardial function. HF is a progressive condition that results from&#xD;
      myocardial damage. This damage can be caused by predisposing conditions or an acute event&#xD;
      that leads to cardiac remodeling. The principal manifestation of such progression and cardiac&#xD;
      remodeling is a change in the geometry and structure of the left ventricle (LV), such that&#xD;
      the chamber dilates and/or hypertrophies and becomes more spherical. The cardiac remodeling&#xD;
      is maladaptive and its progression leads to worsening of the clinical symptoms of HF,&#xD;
      characterized by limited exercise tolerance and edema. Despite optimal medical management, HF&#xD;
      is progressive in nature and patients have a mortality rate of over 50 percent in 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural heart abnormalities are known to play a central role in HF, and clinical evidence&#xD;
      supports a strong causal relationship between cardiac chamber dilation and heart failure.&#xD;
      Because dilation, and not contractile dysfunction, appears to be responsible for the severity&#xD;
      of the disease, the mitigation or prevention of the deleterious dilation process appears to&#xD;
      be an important therapeutic target for HF patients. Hence, a therapy that specifically&#xD;
      targets progressive LV dilatation and remodeling by reshaping and reducing the LV chamber&#xD;
      size may offer an important new alternative in the treatment of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algisyl-LVR™ is a single use, multiple component device under development for the indication&#xD;
      to prevent or reverse the progression of heart failure (HF) by providing implanted&#xD;
      space-occupying material in the myocardium to affect LV shape and prevent or reverse LV&#xD;
      enlargement. The intended clinical benefits of Algisyl-LVR™ are to improve the failing&#xD;
      heart's structure and function with an associated improvement in the patient's clinical&#xD;
      status and quality of life. Data from this current study will be used to evaluate the initial&#xD;
      feasibility of this novel therapeutic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the&#xD;
      Algisyl-LVR™ device. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be used to summarize operator (surgeon) experience and patient outcomes. The results of&#xD;
      the study will be used to assess the design of the device and feasibility of the procedures&#xD;
      to use the device. The study will also guide the design and sample size of future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at a several centers in Europe. The surgeon's experience with&#xD;
      the use of the device will be collected and evaluated. Measures of safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Algisyl-LVR™ will be evaluated through analysis of adverse experiences, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, echocardiographic measures and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI). Measurements at specified time intervals will be compared to&#xD;
      baseline values obtained prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated prior to the procedure, during the immediate post operative&#xD;
      period, and then, return to the clinic at 8 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months&#xD;
      and 24 months after the procedure for follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
