      The purpose of the investigators study is to investigate the correlation between naturally&#xD;
      occurring chemicals, called reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the blood of human patients and&#xD;
      the development of an abnormal heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation (AF). The&#xD;
      development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased medical problems like stroke.&#xD;
      Many factors seem to cause the development of AF, and this rhythm occurs frequently after&#xD;
      open heart surgery. When patients develop AF after cardiac surgery they are at increased risk&#xD;
      for cognitive changes, infections, the development of kidney failure, and increased length of&#xD;
      hospitalization. ROS are chemicals in blood and tissues that tend to cause microscopic blood&#xD;
      vessel and heart damage. These chemicals occur naturally as the result of chemical reactions&#xD;
      that occur in states of stress and inflammation, like tissue trauma and as the result of&#xD;
      smoking. Patients who undergo cardiac surgery may have higher levels of ROS because of their&#xD;
      underlying medical conditions. In addition, the organized tissue trauma that occurs in the&#xD;
      setting of surgery may serve to increase ROS levels further. In turn, the higher ROS levels&#xD;
      may put patients at even higher risk for the development of AF. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that increased levels of ROS may help potentiate a patient's development of AF. Accordingly&#xD;
      the investigators aim to measure ROS levels before and after surgery to see if there are&#xD;
      particular levels that predict the development of this abnormal heart rhythm. By developing a&#xD;
      better knowledge of the relationship between ROS and AF, the investigators hope to better&#xD;
      understand another possible method of detecting patients who are at the highest risk of&#xD;
      developing AF before it occurs after surgery. If these patients are better identified, this&#xD;
      may eventually lead to medical treatment to prevent AF; and hopefully this will result in a&#xD;
      decrease of the malicious effects that result from developing this abnormal heart rhythm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common occurrence after cardiac surgery. This arrhythmia is&#xD;
      reported to occur in up to 40% of patients following coronary bypass graft (CABG) surgery.&#xD;
      The incidence of AF is even higher in patients who have undergone both CABG and valvular&#xD;
      surgery during the same operation. In cardiac surgery patients, the occurrence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation post-operatively lengthens hospitalization and adds to postoperative&#xD;
      complications like renal dysfunction, infection, and cognitive defects. Postoperative AF is a&#xD;
      known major risk factor for the development of stroke after cardiac surgery. Additionally,&#xD;
      there is data to suggest that the development of AF after cardiac surgery is related to both&#xD;
      reduced survival after CABG, and this dysrhythmia may also serve as an independent predictor&#xD;
      of long-term mortality. Many studies have investigated the role of prophylactic&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy to prevent post-operative AF after cardiac surgery. Despite this, the&#xD;
      complete pathogenesis of AF in the post-cardiac surgery population remains unknown, is likely&#xD;
      to be multifactorial, and includes clinical, structural, and biochemical risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical risk factors such as inflammation and elevated markers of oxidative stress seem&#xD;
      to be related to the development of AF. Also, It has been shown that AF is associated with&#xD;
      decreased activity of nitric oxide synthases. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), a common&#xD;
      marker of inflammation, has been shown to be associated with chronic AF at one year follow&#xD;
      up. Additionally, elevated CRP levels drawn just prior to electrical cardioversion have been&#xD;
      found to predict the development of recurrent AF after cardioversion. This relationship&#xD;
      between this elevated marker of inflammation - CRP - and AF has been found to be independent&#xD;
      of clinical risk factors for the development of AF, such as age, diabetes, and left&#xD;
      ventricular function. Inflammation is a known source of oxidative stress at the cellular&#xD;
      level; and it has been proposed that both inflammation and oxidative stress play a role in&#xD;
      electrical remodeling of the atria, which promotes perpetuation of AF. Moreover, it has been&#xD;
      proposed that CRP levels may directly reflect the condition of increased oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative Stress and Arrhythmia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between AF and arrhythmias has been suggested by an array of evidence.&#xD;
      Moreover, the pathogenesis likely involves both changes in the atrial architecture, such as&#xD;
      dilation and fibrosis, and alterations in the electrophysiological substrate of atrial&#xD;
      tissue. Oxidative stress markers are believed to be involved in remodeling of the atrial&#xD;
      electrophysiological substrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a correlation between AF and oxidative stress markers has been established. In one&#xD;
      study, a correlation between the oxidative stress markers reduced glutathione, cysteine, and&#xD;
      derivatives of reduced oxidative metabolites has been found. Although the relationship&#xD;
      between AF and oxidative stress remains unclear, it is known from this human population study&#xD;
      that oxidative stress markers are elevated in those with persistent AF. This relationship&#xD;
      holds true even after controlling for conditions that promote oxidative stress: hypertension,&#xD;
      smoking, and congestive heart failure. It has also been shown that atrial tachycardias are&#xD;
      associated with increased hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. These species are believed to&#xD;
      cause myofibril damage and reduced myofibrillar creatine kinase activity in those with&#xD;
      chronic AF. Similarly, superoxide free radicals were shown to be elevated in the porcine&#xD;
      heart left atrial appendage when subjected to rapid atrial pacing and AF. Of further interest&#xD;
      in this study by Dudley et al., was the role of an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, in its&#xD;
      ability to reduce superoxide production. This suggests that the NADPH oxidase plays a&#xD;
      prominent role in the development of reactive oxidative species. In turn, such reactive&#xD;
      oxidative species are thought to be related to inflammation and atrial electrical remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that electrical remodeling leads to changes such as shortening of the&#xD;
      effective refractory period (ERP), loss of rate adaptation of the refractory period, and&#xD;
      prolonged atrial conduction. Rapid atrial conduction likely results in increased calcium&#xD;
      (Ca2+) accumulation. This causes decreased inward L-type Ca2+ current (ICa), resulting in a&#xD;
      shorter action potential duration (APD). Additional cellular mechanisms may include&#xD;
      inactivation of the fast sodium current (INa) at more positive membrane potentials, and&#xD;
      increased inward potassium rectifier (IK1) and acetylcholine dependent potassium currents&#xD;
      (IKAch). Though these currents logically oppose one another, the net effect is that of&#xD;
      increased repolarization heterogenicity and shortened APD. Moreover, experimental models have&#xD;
      shown that rapid atrial pacing leads to decreased ERP and reduced of L-type Ca2+ channel and&#xD;
      transient outward K+ ion currents. Shortening of the ERP leads to decreased conduction&#xD;
      wavelengths, and shortened wavelengths have been proposed to increase the propensity for the&#xD;
      development of AF because they reduce the mass of atrial tissue required to sustain reentry&#xD;
      circuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the changes above, it has been postulated that intracellular calcium overload as a&#xD;
      result of AF is a trigger for electrical remodeling in AF. Nevertheless, further studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that blockade of L-type calcium channels alone with verapamil in canine hearts&#xD;
      is not sufficient to prevent atrial electrical remodeling. Additional triggering mechanisms&#xD;
      may include oxidative stress and inflammation. Simvastatin, a drug that has both anti-oxidant&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory properties has been shown to attenuate the development of AF from&#xD;
      tachycardia induced atrial remodeling in dogs. More specific evidence of ion channel&#xD;
      remodeling from free radicals was proved by Caouette et al. who showed that addition of&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide directly delayed ultra-rapid rectifier potassium currents in the Chinese&#xD;
      Hamster Ovary cell line. These changes are mediated by Kv1.5 gene expression, which accounts&#xD;
      for voltage-gated potassium repolarization currents that are similarly expressed in human&#xD;
      atrial and ventricular myocytes. Further ion channel studies have demonstrated that lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation causes Na+ channel dysfunction in cultured atrial myocytes when exposed to the&#xD;
      oxidizing agent tert-butyl-hydroperoxide . Additionally, it is believed that reactive&#xD;
      oxidative species may promote respiratory chain dysfunction in atrial myocytes by way of&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the relationship between oxidative stress and atrial fibrillation is complex and&#xD;
      incompletely understood on the molecular level. Nevertheless, it is clear that this&#xD;
      relationship does exist, and therefore serves as a potential focus for medical therapy. In&#xD;
      fact, Carnes et al. clearly demonstrated that using ascorbate perioperatively to blunt the&#xD;
      effects of oxidative stress results in both decreased peroxynitrite formation and a lower&#xD;
      incidence of AF after CABG. Therefore, investigators propose to do more work in this arena to&#xD;
      better elucidate the relationship of oxidative stress and AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative Stress Markers in the Research Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery leads to high oxidative stress and inflammation and is associated with&#xD;
      postoperative AF. This is the ideal situation in which to better define oxidative stress&#xD;
      markers and their correlation with AF. There are several ways to measure oxidative stress in&#xD;
      humans. A minimally invasive method is the measurement of lipid peroxides (derivatives of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen metabolites, dROMs) and oxidized and reduced thiol ratios. Glutathione is an&#xD;
      important water-phase antioxidant and essential cofactor for antioxidant enzymes. It provides&#xD;
      protection endogenous oxygen radicals. Since glutathione can exist in oxidized and reduced&#xD;
      forms, it can serve as a buffer for increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the relative&#xD;
      amounts of these two forms are a reflection of the oxidative state of humans. This balance&#xD;
      can be measured out of blood. Measurement of this ratio has been validated by Neuman et al.&#xD;
      and is known to be associated with AF. Additionally, these measurements have been validated&#xD;
      in states that are thought to increase oxidative stress, such as diabetes, older age, and&#xD;
      cigarette smoking.&#xD;
