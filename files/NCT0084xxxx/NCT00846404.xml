      This study is to look at the differences between people who have evidence of abnormal heart&#xD;
      relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) on sound wave pictures of the heart (an echocardiogram)&#xD;
      compared to those who do not. If you have abnormal relaxation, it can be a cause of shortness&#xD;
      of breath or can be present without knowing about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A condition known as oxidative stress mayb e associated with this abnormal relaxation. This&#xD;
      condition occurs when abnormal oxygen injures heart cells. We would like to learn if patients&#xD;
      with abnormal relaxation have increased oxidative stress.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) has been increasing significantly. Between&#xD;
      1971 and 1994, the crude hospitalization rate for heart failure increased from 8.2 to 33.8&#xD;
      per 1000 suggesting a marked rise in the prevalence of this condition.1,2 Furthermore, data&#xD;
      from the Framingham study suggest that the incidence of CHF doubles with each advancing&#xD;
      decade of age after 45.2 About 43% of individuals with CHF have normal systolic function, or&#xD;
      diastolic heart failure.3 The occurrence of diastolic heart failure is more frequent in women&#xD;
      and individuals with hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, and diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and is associated with a significant increase in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diastolic heart failure and diastolic dysfunction are common disorders, characterized by&#xD;
      delayed ventricular relaxation and increased diastolic stiffness in the absence of systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO•) may contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders as&#xD;
      well as many other processes. In peripheral tissue, NO is a potent vasodilator produced by&#xD;
      endothelial cells and is thought to mediate vascular relaxation in response to acetylcholine,&#xD;
      bradykinin, and substance P. In multiple animal model studies, endothelial production of NO•&#xD;
      has disproportionately enhances diastolic left ventricular function without a substantial&#xD;
      effect on early systolic pressure development. This was shown in ferret papillary muscles in&#xD;
      response to Substance P and recapitulated in mouse models using a cGMP analogue as a&#xD;
      surrogate for NO•.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both diastolic dysfunction and diastolic heart failure are intimately related to&#xD;
      hypertension. Recently, we have observed increased oxidative stress and decreased NO•&#xD;
      availability in a mouse model that develop diastolic dysfunction. Specifically, in a&#xD;
      deoxycorticosterone-induced hypertensive mouse, in which diastolic dysfunction develops,&#xD;
      there is evidence of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) dysfunction that can be&#xD;
      prevented by addition of a reduced cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). It is well known that&#xD;
      hypertension is associated with increased oxidative stress and BH4 oxidation. When BH4 is&#xD;
      oxidized, eNOS ceases to make NO•. We believe that when this happens in the myocardium, the&#xD;
      lack of cardiac NO• results in diastolic dysfunction that will be treatable with BH4&#xD;
      supplementation. A corollary of this hypothesis is that humans with diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      will be more oxidized than those case matched controls without diastolic dysfunction (figure&#xD;
      1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several ways to measure oxidative stress in humans. Among the most convenient and&#xD;
      least invasive are to measure lipid peroxides (derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites,&#xD;
      dROMs), isoprostanes, and oxidized and reduced glutathione ratios. Glutathione is an&#xD;
      important water-phase antioxidant and essential cofactor for antioxidant enzymes. It provides&#xD;
      protection endogenous oxygen radicals. Since glutathione can exist in oxidized and reduced&#xD;
      forms, it can serve as a buffer for increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the relative&#xD;
      amounts of these two forms are a reflection of the oxidative state of humans. Recently, we&#xD;
      have submitted a manuscript showing that we can effectively measure oxidative stress out of&#xD;
      the blood of patients and that this measure differentiates between people with an without&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart beat for which there is growing evidence that&#xD;
      oxidative stress plays a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the discussion above, we hypothesize that patients with diastolic dysfunction will&#xD;
      show higher levels of blood oxidative stress than a case matched control group. This will be&#xD;
      tested by comparing oxidative stress markers from the blood of patients with and without&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction. The study design will be a case-control format with controls matched&#xD;
      for age (by decade), smoking, and diabetes. If the hypothesis is true, it could lead to new,&#xD;
      more effective treatments for cardiac diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
