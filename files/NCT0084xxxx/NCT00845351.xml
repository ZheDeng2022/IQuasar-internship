      The objective of this pilot study is to establish the safety and tolerability of short-term&#xD;
      therapy with bexarotene in patient's with Cushing's disease, and study the clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical, and cellular effects of a preoperative five-day course of bexarotene in these&#xD;
      patients before undergoing transsphenoidal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's disease refers to a condition of glucocorticoid excess caused by an&#xD;
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) producing pituitary tumor, which account for 10-15% of all&#xD;
      pituitary tumors. The majority of corticotroph tumors are microadenomas at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, and accurate surgical and histologic identification of these tumors can be&#xD;
      challenging. ACTH is produced in corticotroph cells within the anterior pituitary via the&#xD;
      precursor pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). In both physiologic and pathologic conditions the&#xD;
      promoter for POMC is regulated by multiple transcription factors which include AP-1 and&#xD;
      Nurr77. Retinoic acid has been shown to inhibit activation of the POMC promoter in&#xD;
      corticotroph tumor cell culture via disruption of Nurr77 transcriptional activity. The&#xD;
      expression of the orphan nuclear receptor termed chicken ovalbumin upstream&#xD;
      promoter-transcription factor I (COUP-TFI) antagonizes retinoic acid signaling, and has been&#xD;
      reported to be present in normal corticotroph cells, but lacking in adenomatous corticotroph&#xD;
      cells in tissue culture studies. Through the retrospective analysis of 34 human corticotroph&#xD;
      tumors we have demonstrated a consistent lack of COUP-TFI in 100% of the microadenomas that&#xD;
      were not visible, or measured less than 5 millimeters by preoperative MRI. In total, 85% of&#xD;
      all tumors studied showed absence of COUP-TFI. Based on in vitro data from rat and human&#xD;
      corticotroph tumors, cells lacking COUP-TFI are vulnerable to retinoid-induced cell death via&#xD;
      Nurr77-mediated apoptosis, an effect that is reversed by COUP-TFI gene transfection. In 2006,&#xD;
      Castillo et al. published the results of a six-month trial which randomized 44 dogs with&#xD;
      Cushing's disease to an RXR agonist (9-cis retinoic acid), or to ketoconazole. RXR agonist&#xD;
      therapy outperformed ketoconazole for all endpoints, resulting in normalization of ACTH and&#xD;
      cortisol levels in 100% of subjects that completed the study, and improved morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. All of the dogs treated with the RXR agonist remained in remission for the&#xD;
      duration of the 6 to 12 month post-treatment followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will involve inpatient admission to our General Clinical Research Center for&#xD;
      5 days prior to scheduled transsphenoidal surgery. During the five days of the study each&#xD;
      individual will receive the RXR-agonist bexarotene at the FDA approved dose of 300 mg/m2/day.&#xD;
      Clinical signs and symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency will be monitored routinely&#xD;
      throughout each 24-hour period. Baseline and twice-daily biochemical analysis for ACTH and&#xD;
      cortisol will be performed. 24-hour urine collection for cortisol will be obtained&#xD;
      pre-treatment and in the last 24-hours of treatment. Laboratory safety analysis will include&#xD;
      serial comprehensive metabolic panels to monitor liver and kidney function, complete blood&#xD;
      count to monitor for neutropenia, as well as thyroid function studies to monitor for central&#xD;
      hypothyroidism which can develop with therapy.&#xD;
