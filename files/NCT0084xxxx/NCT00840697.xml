  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a usual condition in the western countries and several treatments available&#xD;
      for patients with &quot;non-specific low back pain&quot;. According to the European guidelines both&#xD;
      Brief intervention and exercise/cognitive intervention are effective treatments with regard&#xD;
      to pain and function (www.backpaineurope.org), but none have documented effect on return to&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenges for health personnel is not cure of the patients back pain, but to build up&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs which focus on disability and work incapacity, in patients which are&#xD;
      at risk of loosing their work. Dr. P. Loisel, Montreal, Canada&quot;, has since 1995 treated&#xD;
      patients with back pain according to the &quot;The PREVICAP model - (PREVention of work&#xD;
      handICAP)&quot;, where the main purpose with work-related program is to prevent prolonged&#xD;
      disability and to help patients back to work. Loisel demonstrated that the PREVICAP models&#xD;
      accelerated the &quot;return to work&quot; factor by a factor 2.4 (p=0.01). The PREVICAP model had also&#xD;
      been evaluated in Amsterdam, by Dr. Anema with the same results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Back Clinic, Ullev√•l University Hospital we are presently involved in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial after the PREVICAP model, where patients are randomized to Brief&#xD;
      intervention including a work-related intervention or usual care. All included patients in&#xD;
      both groups, will have a clinical examination by specialist in Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and advice from a physiotherapist. The current study replaces Brief&#xD;
      intervention with an exercise - and a work-related program, so patients with non-specific LBP&#xD;
      will be randomized to an exercise and work-related program or usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate if rehabilitation programs specifically focusing on the return to work&#xD;
           process will reduce sickness absence and disability pension in patients with neck and&#xD;
           low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the work-, individual- and health factors and their interrelationship&#xD;
           predicting sickness absence and work disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare results from the rehabilitation program with results from rehabilitation&#xD;
           program in Toronto&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to which extent are the patients met by actions from employers and employment services,&#xD;
           and does is influence sickness absence and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  do these actions represent favourable cost benefit for the work places and the society&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Norway has the highest sickness absence of the Scandinavian countries, with a cost of about&#xD;
      40 milliard kr each year. In addition about 500 000 receive rehabilitation or disability&#xD;
      pension comprising a cost of 75 milliard kr. Musculoskeletal pain is the most common cause of&#xD;
      sickness absence and among the 3 most common causes of disability pension in Norway [1]. For&#xD;
      young subjects (&lt;40 years) musculoskeletal disorders also represent the most common cause for&#xD;
      disability pension [2]. Neck and low back pain comprise the majority of patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders. Hence, several actions have been initiated in order to reduce&#xD;
      sickness absence and improve participation in the working life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The agreement about &quot;including work life&quot; (&quot;IA avtalen&quot;) was introduced in 2001, and&#xD;
      represented a joint effort from the government, the employers' organizations and the labor&#xD;
      organizations. The superior aim was to prevent sickness absence and promote the inclusion in&#xD;
      the working life despite sickness and disability. However, it soon became clear that there&#xD;
      was a contradiction between the goals of reducing sickness absence and including subjects&#xD;
      with diseases and disabilities. In addition it became clear that the knowledge about the&#xD;
      factors facilitating participation in working life was scarce. Groups with low education&#xD;
      level, foreign origin, women and subjects with chronic diseases dominating the sickness&#xD;
      absence statistics were not reached [3], and effective strategies to improve also these&#xD;
      groups employment were sought. Hence, a committee leaded by the prime minister granted above&#xD;
      600 mill kr in order to reduce the sickness absence about 2.5 %. The committee recognized the&#xD;
      need of reinforcing the collaboration between the employers and the employed. However, the&#xD;
      main focus the need of a coordinated effort from the health care system and the social&#xD;
      security and employment service. The latter two are fused to one organisation in Norway&#xD;
      termed &quot;NAV&quot; (Nye arbeids og velferds etaten). Necessary health services need to be provided&#xD;
      immediately and a close collaboration with the social security and employment service as well&#xD;
      as the employers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the patients with neck and low back pain have benign and self-limited conditions,&#xD;
      which they nevertheless experience as pain full and disabling [4;5]. According to the&#xD;
      European guidelines, exercise and cognitive intervention has good effects on pain and&#xD;
      function for patients with low back pain [6] (www.backpaineurope.org). Multimodal treatment&#xD;
      including exercises has also been shown effective for patients with neck pain [7]. However,&#xD;
      these treatment modalities do not seem sufficiently effective in order to improve return to&#xD;
      work [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck and low back pain is a multifactorial problem, which is not only due to workers' medical&#xD;
      characteristics, but is also closely related to environmental factors, such as the workplace&#xD;
      and individual factors. Physical factors like heavy lifting, vibration and posture demands&#xD;
      may be of importance for low back pain [9;10]. The working life of today demanding&#xD;
      increasingly use of computers is a risk factor for neck, shoulder and arm disorders.&#xD;
      Particularly, where the work station is poorly designed and the duration of the computer use&#xD;
      above 4 hours a day there is a risk for pain development [10]. Even more important is the&#xD;
      psychosocial environment at work. Factors such as control over the work situation, demands&#xD;
      and support from the colleagues and leader are of importance [11]. The compensation system&#xD;
      and the interaction between all stakeholders in the disability problem and the health care&#xD;
      system are of importance for the return to work [12;13]. In addition time is a significant&#xD;
      factor, with reduced return to work after longer periods of sick leave [14]. Among the&#xD;
      individual factors of major importance is educational level [15], which of course is related&#xD;
      to socioeconomic class. Age, gender and cultural background are also well known predictors&#xD;
      for sickness absence and disability pension [16], which adds to the higher prevalence of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain in these groups [17]. Interventions at the work place coordinated with&#xD;
      early contact with worker by workplace, contact between healthcare provider and workplace has&#xD;
      also been shown to improve return to work [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, return to work is not dependent on one single step, but a challenging process where the&#xD;
      patient, health professionals, employers and employment system must interact. A particular&#xD;
      challenge is to build up rehabilitation-programs for patients at risk of loosing their work&#xD;
      [19]. Dr. P. Loisel, Montreal, Canada&quot; [20], have since 1995 treated patients with low back&#xD;
      pain according to the &quot;The PREVICAP modell - (PREVention of work handICAP)&quot;. The main purpose&#xD;
      with work-related program is to prevent prolonged disability and helping patients to return&#xD;
      to work. This process includes identification of factors on the workplace which contribute to&#xD;
      the absence of work. These factors include physical, ergonomic, psychosocial, interpersonal&#xD;
      conflicts and administrative problems. Subsequently &quot;workplace intervention&quot; is initiated.&#xD;
      This is a rehabilitation-program centered at the workplace, allowing a graded transition from&#xD;
      the clinical setting to the workplace. Parallel with the workplace intervention the patients&#xD;
      enter into a short exercise-program, adjusted to the workplace intervention. The Previcap&#xD;
      models have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials and accelerated the return to work&#xD;
      by a factor 2.4 and the most important effect came from the workplace intervention, which&#xD;
      accelerated the return to work with a factor 1.9. Patients randomized to the Previcap model&#xD;
      had 60 days absence from work, compared to 120 days in the control group [20;21]. The&#xD;
      Previcap-model have also been evaluated in Amsterdam, by Dr. Anema and he demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant difference in the return to work rate between patients randomized to &quot;Workplace&#xD;
      intervention&quot; and to usual treatment. This type of interventions has not been tried on&#xD;
      patients with neck pain, and in general the knowledge regarding neck pain is poorer than for&#xD;
      low back pain. Hence, Sconstein et al [8] performing a Cochrane review, concluded that there&#xD;
      is an urgent need for well designed randomised studies trying to facilitate return to work in&#xD;
      patients with neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also important to take into account that the predictors for sickness absence are&#xD;
      different from the factors determining return to work [22]. This is largely embezzled in the&#xD;
      intervention strategies. Another shortcoming is failure to meet the needs of the employees&#xD;
      with disabilities [23]. That may be chronic back conditions that cannot be cured, or the&#xD;
      combined cause of back pain and comorbidity which is frequent in this population [24]. This&#xD;
      is particularly important as employment seems to be a very important factor for mental health&#xD;
      in subjects with disabilities [25]. Research focusing on the interrelationship between these&#xD;
      different factors is lacking. This type of knowledge is needed in order to improve the&#xD;
      intervention strategies. It is also obvious that success can only be achieved if the&#xD;
      employment services and stakeholders contribute. Hence, the research in this field calls for&#xD;
      a joint effort between the health care services, employers and employment services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Ulleval University Hospital (UUH) and at St Olavs hospital the health care for patients&#xD;
      with neck-and back pain has been organised in multi-professional units, taking care of a&#xD;
      about 4000 and 2000? patients, respectively, at an annual basis. Within this system it is&#xD;
      possible to provide necessary diagnostic evaluation and medical treatment. The ongoing NAV&#xD;
      projects at both institutions provide the possibility to offer medical care within 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Multimodal treatments including exercises are also provided. At UUS, the PREVICAP model is&#xD;
      implemented and evaluated against usual treatment for patients with low back pain in a&#xD;
      randomized trial. However, patients with neck pain are not included. Hence, a main intention&#xD;
      is to evaluate the PREVICAP model in a randomized trial including patients with neck pain. In&#xD;
      a worker population the psychosocial factors at work including relationship between demand&#xD;
      and control [26] as well as the balance between effort and rewards [27] are shown to be of&#xD;
      importance. Such a comprehensive assessment of patient reported work-related factors has not&#xD;
      previously been performed in the specialized health care. These factors will be combined with&#xD;
      the medical assessment and personal factors in the multiple prediction models, in order to&#xD;
      single out combinations of factors of importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, The PREVICAP model had shown good results on Return to work, in Montreal, and&#xD;
      Amsterdam, it is unknown how this model will work out in other countries, due to differences&#xD;
      in culture, working terms and compensatory system? So, we will collaborate with the research&#xD;
      group in Toronto (D.Cassidy, Health Network Rehabilitation Solutions,Toronto Western&#xD;
      Hospital) to up multinational studies for Return to work-Rehabilitation for patients with&#xD;
      neck and back complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of returning to work can only be completed when the identified problems can be&#xD;
      met with adequate actions at the work place and NAV. These actions also reduce costs&#xD;
      associated with work disability duration [18;28]. Few studies have addressed how the&#xD;
      collaboration between the health care system and both employers and employment services.&#xD;
      Hence, to which extent the advised adaptations at the work place are taken care of as well as&#xD;
      the support given by NAV need to be assessed and related to the outcome of participation in&#xD;
      working life. And at last, the costs and potential socioeconomic consequences of these&#xD;
      actions need to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to combine the knowledge of the medical aspect of neck-and&#xD;
      back pain with the knowledge of organizational and compensatory structure, occupational- and&#xD;
      socioeconomic factors for investigating these factors influence and cause of the phenomenon&#xD;
      sick-leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the work-, individual- and health factors and their interrelationship&#xD;
           predicting sickness absence and work disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate if rehabilitation programs specifically focusing on the return to work&#xD;
           process will reduce sickness absence and disability pension in patients with neck and&#xD;
           low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare results from the rehabilitation program with results from rehabilitations&#xD;
           program in Toronto&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to which extent are the patients met by actions from employers and employment services,&#xD;
           and does is influence sickness absence and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  do these actions represent favorable cost benefit for the work places and the society&#xD;

The workplace intervention includes two steps:&#xD;
Evaluations of the work site: The occupational ergonomists task is to identify conditions at the work site, as for instance ergonomic, work demand and relations to the employer and colleagues.&#xD;
Therapeutic Return to work: The occupational ergonomists will organize contacts and meetings between the employer and the patients and make a schedule for return to work. The therapeutic return-to-work-process will take place at the work place, with progressively more days at work and progressively increasing tasks.&#xD;
Exercises comprises of treatment in groups. The treatment includes exercises, both strength and fitness, in addition to cognitive intervention of how to manage pain and work.</description>
