    <textblock>
      Most of the neonatal deaths that occur worldwide every year are associated with low birth&#xD;
      weight (LBW), caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and/or preterm delivery.&#xD;
      Accurate assessment of fetal growth and gestational age for timely identification and&#xD;
      management of growth restriction are therefore public health priorities, especially in&#xD;
      developing countries where 98% of all neonatal deaths occur. Every year, more than 50 million&#xD;
      women become pregnant in malaria endemic regions. Malaria infection at any time during&#xD;
      pregnancy reduces birthweight. However, little is known about the relationship between the&#xD;
      timing of infection during pregnancy and the extent of the impact on birth weight. The&#xD;
      mechanisms by which malaria causes LBW also remain unclear. Reduced placental blood flow,&#xD;
      placental changes, red blood cell changes, severe anaemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines have&#xD;
      all been implicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed, longitudinal, observational, minimal risk study, which will take place in&#xD;
      SMRU antenatal clinics on the Thai-Burmese border, the effect of malaria infection during&#xD;
      pregnancy on fetal growth will be determined. Women will be screened before 13+6 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation and followed with regular ultrasound examinations during pregnancy. When a woman&#xD;
      has a malaria infection an extra ultrasound scan will be done to measure growth retardation&#xD;
      or placental blood flow changes. Bloodsamples will be taken to detect changes in red blood&#xD;
      cell properties and putative markers of malaria infection. For this study the maximum amount&#xD;
      of blood taken during pregnancy is 13 cc in an uninfected woman. For each malaria episode an&#xD;
      additional 7 cc blood will be taken. After delivery a placenta and a cord sample will be&#xD;
      taken to detect placental changes. The investigators aim to recruit four hundred pregnant&#xD;
      women over the course of two years. This study involves minimal risk to participants as&#xD;
      ultrasound examination is part of routine antenatal care in many countries in the world.&#xD;
