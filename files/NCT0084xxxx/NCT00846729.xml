  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is our purpose in this study to compare the kidney structure and function of older&#xD;
      patients to that of young patients before and after removal of a single kidney for transplant&#xD;
      donation and to examine the remaining kidney's ability to adapt and maintain function over&#xD;
      time. More specifically, we aim to examine the effect of uninephrectomy on adaptive&#xD;
      hyperfiltration in the remaining kidney. A secondary aim is to investigate whether subjects&#xD;
      in the aging population undergo compensation to the same extent as younger subjects. We will&#xD;
      also examine the compensatory rise in GFR (glomerular filtration rate) that follows&#xD;
      uninephrectomy in both groups, and, again, compare the results in the aged versus young&#xD;
      subjects. This will help in delineating the extent to which the aging population can be a&#xD;
      potential source of living kidney donors for kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also our purpose with this study to refine the tests to be used in the donor evaluation&#xD;
      process so as to accurately identify ideal candidates for safe kidney donation.&#xD;

      Screening Procedures: Patients will be identified after acceptance by Stanford's kidney&#xD;
      transplant team as appropriate candidates for living kidney donation prior to their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed over the course of 4 years for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Informed Consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. A Cimetidine Blocked 24 hour urine collection will be obtained prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. DETAILED KIDNEY FUNCTION STUDIES will be performed using iothalamate, and PAH at three&#xD;
      different times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to surgery for uninephrectomy (the night before to months before surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6 months to 1 year post kidney donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 4 years after kidney donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. The Structure of the Kidney will also be assessed at three different times during this&#xD;
      protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cortical and whole kidney volumes will be determined using the clinical MRI or CT&#xD;
           performed routinely for kidney donor evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the time of surgery, in the operating room: A single wedge biopsy of the kidney will&#xD;
           be taken for morphometric and later genetic analysis. *NOTE: Genetic analysis is for the&#xD;
           genetics of ageing not disease. In this procedure, a small wedge kidney biopsy is&#xD;
           excised under direct visualization by the transplant surgeon after the kidney has been&#xD;
           removed from the donor and before the kidney is transplanted into the recipient. The&#xD;
           area of excision is then oversewn and checked for bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The size (volume) of the Tx kidney will be measured by water displacement in a graduated&#xD;
           cylinder immediately before Tx. This volume will be used in our calculations to estimate&#xD;
           the number of glomeruli in youthful vs ageing kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A second MRI or CT will be obtained 6 months to 1 year after kidney donation to measure&#xD;
           the kidney's overall compensatory growth and increase in cortical volume for comparison&#xD;
           with the pre-operative volumes.&#xD;
