      1. To explore the pathology of nerve, vascular, and skin in the amputated leg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To diagnose small-fiber sensory neuropathy of the contralateral leg by investigating the&#xD;
           skin intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To search for (1) mechanisms of amputation and (2) prevention measures for further&#xD;
           amputation in the currently healthy-looking limb&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot occurs in 15% of diabetic population (3) and 15% of the diabetic foot patients&#xD;
      end up with lower limb amputation. Peripheral neuropathy (sensory, motor and autonomic),&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease, trauma, infection and poor wound healing all contribute to&#xD;
      diabetic foot problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathy could be evaluated in a variety of ways, including vibratory&#xD;
      thresholds, thermal thresholds, pressure perception thresholds, muscle strength. All these&#xD;
      predict foot ulceration to some degree(1). Motor nerve conduction velocity is an independent&#xD;
      predictor for the development of new foot ulcer in diabetic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more detailed structural study of neuropathy in diabetic patient, we could use skin&#xD;
      biopsy method. Skin biopsy with PGP9.5 immunohistochemistry has been demonstrated by&#xD;
      ultrastructural studies to label the terminal portions of both small myelinated and&#xD;
      unmyelinated nerve in the epidermis . Intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density is reduced&#xD;
      in patient with impaired glucose tolerance and clinically overt diabetes . Previous IENF&#xD;
      density study was performed in diabetic patients with sensory symptom but no foot ulcer. Now&#xD;
      we tried to evaluate IENF density in severe diabetic foot patient who received below knee&#xD;
      amputation. Skin biopsy willl be performed at amputated leg. The skin biopsy area will be&#xD;
      located at lateral side of distal leg, 10 cm above the lateral malleolus as previous protocol&#xD;
      of our group . Underlying sural nerve and posterior tibial nerve will be also harvested for&#xD;
      further ultra-structural study. The result will be compared to the control group which were&#xD;
      recruited from a previously described cohort matched by gender and age.&#xD;

      After amputation, sural nerve, posterior tibial nerve, and the accompanying vasculature will&#xD;
      be harvested from the amputated leg. 3mm-puch skin will be taken from the amputated leg, 10&#xD;
      cm above the lateral malleolus.&#xD;

        Diabetic foot wound patient who underwent below-knee amputation due to poor wound healing&#xD;
        and severe infection condition. The patient population often receives leg revasculariztion&#xD;
