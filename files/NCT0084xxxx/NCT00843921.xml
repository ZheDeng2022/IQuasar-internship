    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that a new drug N-carbamylglutamate (Carbaglu®) will&#xD;
      enhance the ability of the liver to dispose of toxic ammonia which accumulates in several&#xD;
      metabolic diseases including urea cycle disorders and organic acid disorders.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hyperammonemia associated with several rare inherited disorders frequently causes mental&#xD;
      retardation, developmental disabilities and death. The overall goal of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of the orphan drug, N-Carbamyl-L-glutamate&#xD;
      (Carbaglu®, abbreviated as NCG), for the treatment of hyperammonemia in rare inherited&#xD;
      disorders: carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) deficiency, NAGS deficiency, ornithine&#xD;
      transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether 3-day treatment with NCG can improve or restore ureagenesis&#xD;
           capacity in patients with NAGS, CPSI or OTC deficiency using as surrogate markers: [13C]&#xD;
           label incorporation into urea and plasma levels of ammonia, urea and glutamine. In&#xD;
           addition, to determine whether treatment with NCG in OTC deficiency increases the&#xD;
           production of a nitrogen containing intermediate, orotic acid, as a mechanism for&#xD;
           eliminating nitrogen in lieu of urea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether ureagenesis capacity is deficient in patients with PA and MMA and&#xD;
           whether 3-day treatment with NCG can improve or restore ureagenesis capacity in all or&#xD;
           some of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the safety of short-term (3-day) treatment with NCG in the above patients&#xD;
           using clinical and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that ureagenesis capacity as evidenced by [13C] incorporation into urea is&#xD;
      deficient in each of these five disorders and that treatment with NCG will improve or restore&#xD;
      ureagenesis in patients affected by them. The study will be conducted in the General Clinical&#xD;
      Research Centers (GCRC) of the Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C. and the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Patients (1 day to 70 years of age) with any of the five&#xD;
      disorders are eligible for the study. They will all be tested in a short-term trial using&#xD;
      surrogate markers (incorporation of [13C] label from Na-acetate into urea, and plasma levels&#xD;
      of ammonia, urea and glutamine) before and immediately following 3 days of treatment with&#xD;
      NCG. The patients will also be evaluated for short-term safety of NCG using clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters. The results of this study will provide important efficacy data, which&#xD;
      should help to bring Carbaglu®) to the US market for the benefit of patients with any of&#xD;
      these orphan diseases found to be responsive to NCG in this trial.&#xD;
