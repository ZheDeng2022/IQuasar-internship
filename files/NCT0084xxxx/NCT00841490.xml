      The purpose of this study is to determine if the bacteria that cause gastric infections can&#xD;
      be found in the mouths of intellectually and developmentally disabled persons. If the&#xD;
      bacteria that causes gastric infections is found in the mouth it may be swallowed and&#xD;
      contribute to gastric infections.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria play a significant role in the etiology of gastric&#xD;
      and duodenal ulcers, gastro-esophageal reflux disease and gastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      Intellectually disabled/developmentally disabled (ID/DD) adults are reported to have H.&#xD;
      pylori infection at approximately twice the rate of the general population and experience&#xD;
      recurrence at a seven-fold higher rate, contributing to increased mortality due to gastric&#xD;
      cancer. The oral cavity may serve as a reservoir for H. pylori and subsequently contribute to&#xD;
      the recurrence of gastric infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have identified H. pylori in dental plaque, an environment that is&#xD;
      relatively resistant to systemic antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics are used to treat H.&#xD;
      pylori infections but do not appear to eradicate H. pylori in the mouth. The oral status of&#xD;
      ID/DD adults is reported to be poor due to inadequate oral hygiene, leading to increased&#xD;
      plaque, caries and periodontal disease. Furthermore, poor oral status (periodontal disease)&#xD;
      has been associated with H. pylori seropositivity. While ID/DD adults have elevated rates of&#xD;
      H. pylori gastric infections, nothing is known about the prevalence of H. pylori in their&#xD;
      oral cavities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed exploratory research will address the following questions in this disadvantaged&#xD;
      population: 1) What is the prevalence of H. pylori in the dental plaque in ID/DD adults?, 2)&#xD;
      Is poor oral status associated with H. pylori gastric infection?, and 3) Does H. pylori&#xD;
      persist in the dental plaque of ID/DD adults after systemic antibiotic treatment, and if so,&#xD;
      is it associated with recurrence of gastric infection? This epidemiological study of 112&#xD;
      institutionalized ID/DD and 112 control subjects will involve oral examinations, indices,&#xD;
      dental plaque sampling, and C13 Urea Breath Tests at baseline to determine prevalence. Nested&#xD;
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analyses will be used to detect H. pylori in the dental&#xD;
      plaque. For those ID/DD subjects who have a positive gastric H. pylori test at baseline,&#xD;
      repeated oral sampling and gastric tests will be performed over 1 year to determine&#xD;
      persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If poor oral health status and oral H. pylori prevalence are correlated with gastric H.&#xD;
      pylori infections, a future pilot clinical trial will be conducted to investigate the&#xD;
      concordance between genetic strains of H. pylori in the mouth and stomach, the effect of&#xD;
      various interventions on oral health, oral H. pylori prevalence, and H. pylori gastric&#xD;
      infections in ID/DD adults. The proposed research responds to the Surgeon General's National&#xD;
      Call to Action to conduct studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and determine any causal&#xD;
      associations between oral infections and systemic conditions. The proposed research also&#xD;
      addresses the need to reduce health disparities, improve quality of life, and reduce&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations.&#xD;

        A study involving 110 intellectually disabled and/or developmentally disabled (ID/DD)&#xD;
        participants aged 18 to 90 years of age at a facility in Kentucky will be conducted. An age&#xD;
        and gender matched control group (n = 110) will also be evaluated for oral H. pylori&#xD;
        prevalence and H. pylori gastric infections. The control group will be recruited and&#xD;
        enrolled from the general dental clinics at the University of Louisville School of&#xD;
        Dentistry.&#xD;
