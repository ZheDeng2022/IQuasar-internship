      This protocol is a multicenter, national, open-label, single-arm, non-controlled study&#xD;
      designed to establish the efficacy (in terms of response and survival) and safety of&#xD;
      panobinostat in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine and in monotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with newly-diagnosed AML aged 65 years or older.&#xD;

      A phase Ib will be initially performed to establish the MTD of panobinostat that can be&#xD;
      administered in combination with the classic regimen of idarubicin and cytarabine in patients&#xD;
      aged 65 years or older. This MTD will be established in the induction cycle. For this&#xD;
      purpose, the first patients enrolled in the trial will be successively distributed into three&#xD;
      cohorts of patients for each dose level of panobinostat (20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg) in combination&#xD;
      with idarubicin and cytarabine, according to the classical 3+3 schedule (vid section 5.2). In&#xD;
      case of an unacceptable toxicity in the first dose step (20 mg), a dose reduction to a -1&#xD;
      step will be considered (10 mg). Patients included in the phase Ib part of the study will&#xD;
      continue throughout the treatment with the starting dose of panobinostat corresponding to the&#xD;
      step to which they were initially assigned (except for those patients receiving a dose higher&#xD;
      than the MTD which will be deescalated to the MTD). 9 additional patients will be included at&#xD;
      the MTD dose level to confirm the safety of this dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD of panobinostat is determined, during the phase II of the study, up to a total&#xD;
      of 46 patients will be recruited (40 of them at the MTD dose) and the scheduled assessments&#xD;
      and visits will be carried out in three periods: Pre-treatment, Treatment, and Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-treatment period includes the screening visit where the written informed consent for&#xD;
      participating in the study is obtained. Then, during the screening visit that is completed 14&#xD;
      days before the baseline visit (Days -14 to -1), patients are assessed for eligibility. The&#xD;
      patients eligible for inclusion in the study will start the treatment period where they will&#xD;
      receive two or three cycles of cytarabine and idarubicin in combination with panobinostat&#xD;
      (induction and consolidation, or induction, re-induction and consolidation) followed by&#xD;
      treatment with panobinostat as monotherapy (vid. schema in appendix 4). The induction cycle&#xD;
      will comprise of cytarabine 100 mg/m2 (Day 1 to 7) and idarubicin 8 mg/m2 (Days 1 to 3)&#xD;
      followed by panobinostat administered three times a week for three weeks (Days 8, 10, 12, 15,&#xD;
      17, 19, 22, 24, 26) (Table 4 ). The patients will be assessed by bone marrow aspiration on&#xD;
      day +14 and at the moment of the recovery from aplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient experiences an unsatisfactory response, i.e. partial remission or resistant&#xD;
      disease after the first cycle, a second induction cycle, identical to the first one&#xD;
      (re-induction cycle), will be administered not sooner than seven days after receiving the&#xD;
      last dose of panobinostat (in the induction cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient reaches a complete morphological remission (or CRi) after the induction or the&#xD;
      re-induction cycles, then, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, a consolidation cycle,&#xD;
      identical to the induction cycle, will be administered once recovered from aplasia and always&#xD;
      leaving the seven days of Panobinostat treatment free interval. If a patient does not reach a&#xD;
      CR or CRi after the re-induction, she/he will be removed from the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, after the recovery from the aplasia caused by the last consolidation, all patients will&#xD;
      be assessed for efficacy and safety, and, in the absence of relapse (i.e. patients in CR or&#xD;
      CRi) or unacceptable toxicity will turn to the maintenance phase, during which they will&#xD;
      receive single agent panobinostat at a dose of 40 mg with the following treatment regimen:&#xD;
      three times a week for a total duration of three weeks (Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17 and&#xD;
      19), followed by a rest period of 9 days (Table 5). This cycle will be repeated every 28 days&#xD;
      and a total of six cycles will be administered in the absence of relapse or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. During this period, patients will be assessed monthly for efficacy based on the&#xD;
      hematimetric values (bone marrow aspirate will be performed every three months and when&#xD;
      relapse is suspected) and toxicity/vital signs until the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, during the follow-up period that starts once the patient completes the treatment,&#xD;
      patients will be assessed for efficacy based on the hematimetric values (bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
      will be performed every six months and when relapse is suspected) and toxicity every 3 months&#xD;
      for one additional year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring all adverse events, physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
      cardiological examinations, and blood and biochemical tests. The left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction (LVEF) will be assessed by echocardiography. The response to treatment will be&#xD;
      assessed according to the standard Cheson response criteria. Furthermore, the impact of MRD&#xD;
      in the prognosis of these patients will be assessed. For this purpose, MRD changes at&#xD;
      different treatment time points will be tested by multiparametric flow cytometry: at Day +14&#xD;
      post-induction, before starting the first consolidation cycle (this is to say at the moment&#xD;
      of achieving CR), at the start of maintenance therapy, every three months during this phase&#xD;
      and every six months during the follow-up period.&#xD;
