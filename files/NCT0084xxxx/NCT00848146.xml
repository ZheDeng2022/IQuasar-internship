      Refinements in laparoscopic surgery, coupled with advancements in therapeutic flexible&#xD;
      endoscopy, have set the stage for surgery to move to even less invasive techniques to treat&#xD;
      conditions in the GI tract and peritoneal cavity. Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic&#xD;
      surgery (NOTES) offers a means of reducing and ultimately eliminating the need for abdominal&#xD;
      incisions to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. In NOTES, a flexible endoscope and&#xD;
      accessory instruments are inserted through a natural body orifice and passed through the wall&#xD;
      of an organ to reach the abdominal cavity. By reducing or eliminating the need for abdominal&#xD;
      incisions, NOTES may provide a least invasive surgical option that can reduce pain, recovery&#xD;
      time, complications, and systemic inflammatory response when compared to a laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgical approach. In this study, we propose to use the NOTES technique to eliminate the need&#xD;
      for a 1.5-2.5 cm umbilical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that a combined endoscopic and laparoscopic approach will be&#xD;
      able to eliminate a 1.5 to 2.5 cm infraumbilical incision when performing a laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Closure of the gastrotomy will be facilitated with the Ethicon TAS system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, we propose to use a surgical technique that eliminates the need for a 1.5-2.5&#xD;
      cm umbilical incision. All patients will receive pre-operative antibiotics. A Veress needle&#xD;
      will be used to create pneumoperitoneum with insufflation of carbon dioxide gas by a standard&#xD;
      laparoscopic insufflator. A 5 mm laparoscopic port will be inserted through the abdominal&#xD;
      wall in the right mid-abdomen and a 5 mm laparoscope inserted for viewing the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity. A flexible endoscope, positioned within a multi-lumen 18 mm therapeutic access&#xD;
      device, will be inserted through the mouth and into the stomach. Using commercially available&#xD;
      endoscopes, endoscopic instruments and accessories, a small incision will be made in the&#xD;
      gastric wall and the endoscope will be advanced into the insufflated peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
      Additional laparoscopic trocars may be placed through the abdominal wall for laparoscopic&#xD;
      instrument insertion to manipulate, retract and cut tissue. The flexible endoscope will&#xD;
      provide visualization of the surgical field and flexible endoscopic instruments may be used&#xD;
      to augment surgical manipulation with the laparoscopic instruments. Intraoperative&#xD;
      cholangiogram or laparoscopic ultrasound will be performed at the discretion of the surgeon.&#xD;
      Once dissected free, the gallbladder will be removed through the stomach and out of the mouth&#xD;
      with the aid of an endoscopic retrieval bag. Commercially available endoscopic clips, or FDA&#xD;
      approved tissue anchors will be used to close the gastrotomy. Additionally, the gastrotomy&#xD;
      closure will be tested for leaks and laparoscopically oversewn with suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative and recovery room times as well as hospital length of stay will be collected.&#xD;
      During the hospital stay, severity of pain, use of pain medications and complications will be&#xD;
      recorded. Patients will be discharged per the standard of practice for a laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. All study patients will receive a call from a surgery clinic nurse on&#xD;
      post-op day 2 and 7. We will develop a check list that will contain the following (yes/no)&#xD;
      elements to be used prior to discharge, on the post-op day 2 and 7 phone calls, and the 2&#xD;
      week post-op clinic visit: pain controlled with meds, nausea, emesis, fever, chills, redness&#xD;
      of incisions, drainage from incisions, shortness of breath, chest pain, yellow eyes, dark&#xD;
      urine, clay-colored stools. If there are any &quot;yes&quot; responses to this checklist prior to&#xD;
      discharge, the patient will not be discharged from the hospital. If there are any &quot;yes&quot;&#xD;
      responses to this checklist at the post-op day 2 or 7 phone call, the patient will be advised&#xD;
      to immediately come to the GI surgery clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. If there&#xD;
      are any &quot;yes&quot; responses to this checklist at the 2 week clinic visit, the patient will&#xD;
      undergo the necessary standard of care medical evaluation (labs, tests, etc.) and may be&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital. These checklists will be reviewed by one of the investigators,&#xD;
      collected and stored in a locked file cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return and be evaluated by their surgeon two weeks following their procedure.&#xD;
      At this visit, any post-operative complications will be noted in the patient's medical&#xD;
      record. Additionally at this visit and at the preoperative visit, patients will complete a&#xD;
      standardized Quality of Life (QOL) assessment (i.e., SF-36). Perceived pain levels and type&#xD;
      and frequency of pain medications will be recorded in the patient's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential advantages to the patients entered into this study include those mentioned&#xD;
      above regarding elimination of post-operative wound infection and hernia but also the lack of&#xD;
      abdominal incisions greater than 5 mm in length may reduce pain and recovery time and likely&#xD;
      have a cosmetic advantage as well. Potential risks of this study involve the risks of the&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic procedure including bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding&#xD;
      structures and port/trocar site pain. Potential risks associated with use of flexible&#xD;
      endoscopic instruments include esophageal perforation, bleeding and sore throat. In addition,&#xD;
      there is the possibility that there may be new, unanticipated complications from this&#xD;
      modified surgical technique. Patient risks will be mitigated by having the procedure&#xD;
      performed by a surgeon with expertise in both laparoscopic surgery and flexible endoscopy, as&#xD;
      well as having involvement of a skilled interventional gastroenterologist if deemed&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will initially evaluate the potential benefit, risks and impact on the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life of this modified surgical technique in 10 patients. Once a&#xD;
      standardized technique is established and risks are shown to be low, a prospective&#xD;
      comparative evaluation is planned to compare this modified technique to the standard&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach.&#xD;
