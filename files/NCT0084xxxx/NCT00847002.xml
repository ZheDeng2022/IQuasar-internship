    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare the healing process of venous stasis ulcers when the Flexitouch®&#xD;
      system is added to the standard treatment of venous ulcers. We hypothesize that adding the&#xD;
      Flexitouch® system to standard venous ulcer treatment will result in&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. greater complete healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. greater percentage reduction in ulcer area&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reduced time to complete healing, as compared to the use of standard treatment alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. a greater reduction in affected leg volume as compared to standard treatment alone.&#xD;

      A pilot randomized trial of Flexitouch® as an adjunctive treatment for venous ulcers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To determine if the Flexitouch® compression therapy system, when added to standard&#xD;
      venous ulcer (VU) treatment, results in: 1. Greater complete healing at 12 weeks as compared&#xD;
      to standard treatment alone. 2. Greater percentage reduction in ulcer area at 12 weeks as&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment alone. 3. Less time to complete healing as compared to&#xD;
      standard treatment alone 4. A greater reduction in the leg volume of the affected leg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that adding the Flexitouch® system to standard venous ulcer&#xD;
      treatment will result in&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) greater complete healing, 2) greater percentage reduction in ulcer area 3) reduced time to&#xD;
      complete healing, as compared to the use of standard treatment alone, and 4) a greater&#xD;
      reduction in affected leg volume as compared to standard treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment, eligibility, and exclusions Patients who present at our clinic with a&#xD;
      venous leg ulcer, as judged by clinical presentation and history, will be recruited for&#xD;
      participation in this research study. For this pilot study a total of 16 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol and Procedures After verifying eligibility and administering an approved informed&#xD;
      consent, patients will be randomized to one of the study arms (A or B). Study patients will&#xD;
      be seen one or two times per week (per physician's discretion) for 12-weeks for standard&#xD;
      wound care and treatment. For both groups, sustained compression will be achieved with the&#xD;
      FarrowWrap™ Classic device. This device will be worn continuously except during the&#xD;
      twice-weekly treatments and when Flexitouch therapy is being undertaken (Group B only). Group&#xD;
      B will use Flexitouch at home every day (twice daily); Group A will not use Flexitouch. Once&#xD;
      per week, treatment and parameter assessments will be undertaken as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Wound Care and Treatment Standard wound care treatment will include gentle wound&#xD;
      ulcer cleansing with saline solution at each visit, maintaining moisture balance in the wound&#xD;
      and periwound with appropriate dressings (e.g Acticoat, Aquacel Ag, or Mepilex Ag foam&#xD;
      dressings), reminding subjects of the importance of proper nutrition, leg elevation at rest&#xD;
      and activity, including frequent ambulation and ankle range of motion exercises through the&#xD;
      day. The FarrowWrap Classic device is applied over the dressing to achieve suitable&#xD;
      compression pressures as an important component of the standard treatment. For venous ulcer&#xD;
      treatment it is applied at full stretch. The patient will be given instructions as to how to&#xD;
      apply the FarrowWrap at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexitouch System and its Use Patients who have been randomized to Group B will be provided a&#xD;
      home Flexitouch unit. They will be given instructions to use it on a twice daily basis. They&#xD;
      will be instructed to remove the FarrowWrap during the time they are using Flexitouch. The&#xD;
      Flexitouch System works by applying dynamic low-pressure compression to the trunk and&#xD;
      affected limbs using gentle, rhythmic massage action. The system consists of a controller&#xD;
      unit with four eight-port connectors and a garment set for the trunk and leg. The garments&#xD;
      are placed around the trunk and affected limbs and are connected to the controller by a&#xD;
      tubing harness. The controller inflates and deflates the air chambers within the garments in&#xD;
      a pre-determined pattern to assist the lymphatics in moving the fluid into adjacent lymph&#xD;
      node regions of the trunk. The controller inflates individual chambers in the garments for&#xD;
      1-3 seconds per inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Treatment modifications The patient's welfare, as determined by the principal&#xD;
      investigator, will take precedence over any study procedures. Any interventions necessary for&#xD;
      the patient's welfare will be undertaken as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Photography The wound will be photographed using a digital camera with zoom capability&#xD;
      supplied by the sponsor of this study. All photographs will be taken with the camera pointing&#xD;
      directly down to the wound such that the angle between the camera and the plane-of-the wound&#xD;
      is as near to 90o as possible. Flash will be avoided if there is adequate lighting. The&#xD;
      vertical distance from the wound to the camera is not critical but a distance of about 20 cm&#xD;
      will be used when possible. Prior to taking photographs, a suitable dimensional scale or&#xD;
      calibration standard will be placed in contact with the skin near, but outside a wound&#xD;
      margin. In the case of a one-dimensional scale, it will be placed above or below the wound,&#xD;
      and positioned along the long dimension of the wound. A suitable calibration standard will be&#xD;
      supplied by the sponsor of this study. The framing of the photo will be such as to include 1)&#xD;
      the complete wound bed, 2) a small sampling of the surrounding periwound tissue and 3) the&#xD;
      calibration standard or scale. The composed image, as viewed through the camera LCD viewport,&#xD;
      will be as large as possible while still including the required elements. The camera will be&#xD;
      oriented such that the horizontal dimension of the LCD viewport is parallel to the horizontal&#xD;
      calibration scale on the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Tracing After photographing, the wound margins will be traced by placing a transparent&#xD;
      grid over the wound. The grid is a commercial product (E-Z Graph) that is designed for this&#xD;
      purpose. It consists of two layers; a bottom layer which is in contact with the wound and an&#xD;
      upper layer on which tracing is done using a colored pen. The upper layer has a grid system&#xD;
      with 1 x 1 cm squares imbedded into the material. After tracing the bottom layer is&#xD;
      discarded. The patient's study ID, visit number and visit date are then recorded on a space&#xD;
      provided on the upper tracing grid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Leg Volumes Leg volumes of both right and left legs from ankle to knee will be&#xD;
      determined. This is done using a calibrated tape measure (Gulick-type) to measure&#xD;
      circumferences at 4 cm intervals starting at the malleoulus and progressing toward the knee.&#xD;
      From these circumference measurements, limb volumes will be determined using the well&#xD;
      established truncated cone model together with a validated software algorithm. Using this&#xD;
      method the wound assessor enters the circumferences into a standardized form and the&#xD;
      appropriate volumes are automatically determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Complete Wound Healing At each visit the wound will be carefully inspected by&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator and the presence or absence of complete wound healing noted and&#xD;
      recorded. For this study, wound healing will be considered to occur when the wound is fully&#xD;
      covered with epithelium and there is no drainage. In addition, at each visit, a study-related&#xD;
      case report form will be completed by the Principal Investigator to document various clinical&#xD;
      features of the wound and to note any relevant study-related actions or events. This form&#xD;
      will be embedded within password protected software so that most wound descriptors will be&#xD;
      able to be entered and documented with a simple mouse click.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Wound Areas and Related Parameters Wound Areas by Photo Images: The digital&#xD;
      images of the wound will be coded by the Principal Investigator by suitably renaming each&#xD;
      photographic image file with a unique identifier. He will keep a record of these coded file&#xD;
      names and the group, patient, and visit date and number to which they correspond. A copy of&#xD;
      each image file will be made and stored on a CD. The CD will be sent to a scientific advisor&#xD;
      who works with the study sponsor. The advisor will be responsible for the analyses of the&#xD;
      images, including the determination of wound areas via computerized planimetry and for&#xD;
      subsequent data and statistical analyses. The analyst will blind as to which actual group the&#xD;
      images correspond. At the completion of the data acquisition phase of the study, the analyst&#xD;
      will be told which images belong to common groups, but he will still not know which of the&#xD;
      common groups belong to which arm of the study. He will thus remain blind during the&#xD;
      subsequent statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Areas by Tracings: As a complementary comparison approach, wound areas will also be&#xD;
      assessed from the wound tracings. The analyst will be supplied with copies of the coded&#xD;
      tracings. The tracings will then be scanned and the wound areas determined by computerized&#xD;
      digital planimetry as previously described. Areas determined by this method will serve as a&#xD;
      check measurement and will be used as a backup in those cases (if any) in which photographic&#xD;
      quality is inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leg Volumes: In addition to photographs and tracings, the analyst will be supplied with coded&#xD;
      electronic copies of the leg circumference forms. This data will be used to determine if, and&#xD;
      to what extent, changes in leg volume or edema occur, and if there are differences in these&#xD;
      parameters between groups A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Descriptors: A coded electronic version of the case report form, containing wound&#xD;
      descriptor parameters data, will be supplied to the analyst. This information will be used&#xD;
      primarily in the final analysis to summarize the clinical progression of the wounds.&#xD;
