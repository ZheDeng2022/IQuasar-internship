  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, large oral doses of phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) are the standard&#xD;
      treatment of patients with familial hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). While this therapy is&#xD;
      effective in healing the rickets, it is often limited by development of complications due to&#xD;
      the high dose of medications required to achieve cure. Among them are the development of&#xD;
      calcifications in the kidneys and secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) which in some patients&#xD;
      may cause complications like high blood calcium level, high blood pressure and damage to the&#xD;
      kidney. A drug to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism was just developed. In a short term&#xD;
      study we found that it might help the treatment of XLH, by allowing the use of lower doses of&#xD;
      the both phosphate and calcitriol. In the present study we will learn if indeed the addition&#xD;
      of this new medicine (Cinacalcet) to the long-term treatment will allow the use of lower&#xD;
      doses of both phosphate and calcitriol and consequently lower the risk of complications.&#xD;
