  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims at understanding better the role of the frontal lobe of the brain in our&#xD;
      capacity to perceive visual information consciously, and also, in our capacity to perceive&#xD;
      others' actions. It includes a test where we ask subjects to detect visual information in&#xD;
      front of a computer screen, and another test where we ask them to imitate finger movements.&#xD;

      This project is a twofold exploration of the functions of the premotor cortex, concerning, on&#xD;
      the one hand, its role in conscious visual perception, and on the other hand, the part it may&#xD;
      play in the perception and imitation of other people's movements. Healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      compared with subjects suffering from focal lesions within the premotor cortex, on two tasks:&#xD;
      in the first task, the subjects will have to make a decision concerning the absence or&#xD;
      presence of a visual item in their field of vision. They will make (virtual) bets based on&#xD;
      the subjective certainty of their perceptions - they will be told that these bets are purely&#xD;
      virtual, and will not result in any financial gain or loss. This study will help us&#xD;
      understand the contribution of the prefrontal cortex to subjective weighing of perceptual&#xD;
      certainty. In the second task, the subjects will imitate a finger movement, based either on a&#xD;
      fixed picture, or on a short motion picture. Previous studies have shown that whether the&#xD;
      movement is copied from a fixed picture or a moving picture changes reaction times and types&#xD;
      of mistakes. Neuroimaging studies have shown that a premotor area is involved in this effect.&#xD;
      The comparison of brain-damaged and healthy subjects will tell us what exactly the&#xD;
      contribution of the prefrontal consists in.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects chosen from a pool of adult subjects, recruited through ads.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the second group, the subjects are recruited from a pool of brain-damaged patients&#xD;
             treated at the hospital de la Pitié-Salpétrière. They must suffer from a focal lesion&#xD;
             in the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the healthy group: any previous brain-related medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Widespread brain-damage, extending beyond the prefrontal cortex, that is to say,&#xD;
             lesions that are not really focal.&#xD;
