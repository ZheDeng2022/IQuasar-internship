  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine changes in sugar metabolism that may occur in&#xD;
      subjects who have previously had part of their pancreas removed due to a benign lesion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta cells of the pancreas are the insulin producing cells. People with impaired fasting&#xD;
      glucose have a beta cell mass ~50% of that of normal glucose tolerant subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2006 canine study by Dr. Peter Butler's group at UCLA demonstrated that glucose stimulated&#xD;
      insulin secretion was deficient after 50% decrease in beta cell mass after distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy compared to those dogs who had sham surgery. The pancreatectomized dogs had&#xD;
      impaired fasting glucose with impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The&#xD;
      decreased insulin secretion was a result of decreased insulin secretory pulses or bursts with&#xD;
      no change seen in pulse frequency, the same pattern seen in humans with Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Conclusions derived from this study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When beta cell mass declines to ~50% the capacity for the remaining beta cells to&#xD;
           secrete insulin in appropriate secretory bursts is compromised, leading to a deficit in&#xD;
           insulin secretion most obvious on glucose stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The decreased insulin burst mass results in an additional component of insulin&#xD;
           resistance, and this together with the compromised capacity for insulin secretion leads&#xD;
           to decompensation of glucose regulation and diabetes onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How does this translate in humans who have had partial pancreatectomy? In 1990, Kendall and&#xD;
      colleagues published a study looking at the effects of hemipancreatectomy in healthy human&#xD;
      subjects on insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. These subjects were donors for&#xD;
      pancreatic transplantation. They showed that fasting insulin and c-peptide levels were lower&#xD;
      one year after hemipancreatectomy. Seven of the 28 donors had abnormal glucose tolerance one&#xD;
      year after hemipancreatectomy, but all 28 had normal fasting plasma glucose levels. This&#xD;
      study and others like it confirm the development of impaired glucose tolerance after partial&#xD;
      pancreatectomy, but pulsatile insulin secretion and hepatic insulin clearance were not&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, the main objective of this pilot study is to establish and quantify the&#xD;
      impact of a deficit in beta cell mass, due to partial pancreatectomy for benign tumors, on&#xD;
      glucose tolerance. Results of this study may be used to develop a future metabolic study that&#xD;
      uses glucose isotopes to establish the effects of partial pancreatectomy on glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, basal and stimulated insulin secretion as well as hepatic and extrahepatic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity under conditions of usual physiology. This will enable us to further understand&#xD;
      the relationship between loss of beta cells, decreased insulin secretion and increased&#xD;
      insulin resistance in humans.&#xD;
