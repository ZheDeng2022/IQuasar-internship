  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the majority of patients, metastatic HCC is incurable and patients should be considered&#xD;
      candidates for clinical trials when appropriate. Till recently there was no worldwide,&#xD;
      approved local or systemic therapy for advanced HCC and the available therapies for advanced&#xD;
      unresectable and/or metastatic HCC have limited clinical values, with low response rates and&#xD;
      little impact on the natural history of the disease. Furthermore, the toxicities associated&#xD;
      with these agents can be severe, requiring careful patient selection, and this dramatically&#xD;
      decreases the number of patients who may benefit from therapy. The SHARP trial established&#xD;
      the survival benefit of Sorafenib in Advanced HCC but the results yet remain humble. The need&#xD;
      for more effective therapies is still there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Sorafenib and Gemcitabine combination in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data and limited efficacy data will be collected for this combination in the study.&#xD;
      All Drug-Related Adverse Events, all Adverse Events NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 Grade 3 or higher,&#xD;
      and all Serious Adverse Events regardless of causal relationship to study drugs will be&#xD;
      recorded in this study.&#xD;

      Over-all Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, open-label treatment protocol for patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 Patients will be treated with 400 mg oral sorafenib twice a day on a continuous basis with&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 administered on day 1 &amp; 8 of a 4 week cycle. Patients in this protocol&#xD;
      may continue to be treated with this combination for a minimum of 4 cycles until any of the&#xD;
      following criteria for protocol discontinuation is reached:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient is unlikely to benefit from further treatment as&#xD;
&#xD;
           Judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intolerable toxicity of the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Withdrawal of consent for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage, administration and duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses of study drugs may be delayed or reduced in case of clinically significant toxicities&#xD;
      that are possibly, probably or definitely related to protocol therapy. Toxicities will be&#xD;
      graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria Version 3.0 (see Appendix 10.6). If a&#xD;
      patient experiences several toxicities and there are conflicting recommendations, the&#xD;
      recommended dose adjustment that reduces the dose to the lowest level should be used. All&#xD;
      dose modifications will follow pre-defined dose levels as indicated below for study drugs,&#xD;
      respectively. The dose modifications of sorafenib will follow the following dose levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level 1 (starting dose): 400 mg (2 x 200 mg) p. o. twice daily Dose level 2: 400 mg (2 x&#xD;
      200 mg) p. o. once daily Dose level 3: 400 mg (2 x 200 mg) p. o. once every other day If a&#xD;
      dose reduction by more than two dose levels from the 400 mg twice daily schedule is required,&#xD;
      the patient should be discontinued from the study treatment. Also, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator, the dose may be re escalated to a higher dose level up to up to a maximum of&#xD;
      400 mg twice daily following the resolution of the Adverse Event or an improvement in the&#xD;
      Adverse Event to a level which permits the re-escalation of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Gemcitabine the potentially dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression, dose delays are&#xD;
      allowed for Grade 3 and 4 toxicities. Growth factors will not be administered unless delay is&#xD;
      more than 2 weeks in recovery of hematological toxicity.&#xD;
