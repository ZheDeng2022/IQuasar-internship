      This study is a multicentric trial evaluating the efficacy of the CVP chemotherapy +&#xD;
      Interferon (IFN) + Rituximab induction regimen in patients aged 18 to 75 years with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed follicular NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicular non Hodgkin's lymphoma's (FL), as defined by the REAL Classification, are usually&#xD;
      characterized by a slowly progressive clinical course, a transient control by standard&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regimen and a pattern of repeated relapses until ultimately progressive and&#xD;
      fatal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most standard first line treatment for advanced FL consists of alkylating-based (CVP) or&#xD;
      anthracycline containing regimens, in association with immunomodulating agents such as&#xD;
      interferon alpha or the unconjugated chimeric anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) to target the&#xD;
      CD20 antigen highly expressed on follicular lymphoma cells. This strategies have&#xD;
      significantly increased the survival of the patients, but relapses still occur. Thus, the&#xD;
      treatment of the patients with FL, requires improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IFN alpha has antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties. Moreover, it has been&#xD;
      described a synergistic effect when IFN is given with chemotherapy. This association has&#xD;
      significantly improved progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Our prior&#xD;
      results with 12 weeks of IFN plus CVP as induction treatment, significantly increased PFS&#xD;
      when compared with CVP alone (60% median PFS vs. 24%, p: 0.0004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also performed a prospective study to analyze the correlation between the duration of&#xD;
      remission and MRD in patients who were treated with CVP+IFN . Ninety four percent of patients&#xD;
      had a molecular marker (60% bcl-2 translocation and 34% IgH rearrangement). Molecular&#xD;
      response, defined as achieving a negative molecular MRD, was achieved in 76% of patients and&#xD;
      it was associated with clinical remission. There was also a significant correlation between&#xD;
      the duration of remission and a sustained indetectable MRD Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (Rituximab) mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody dependent cellular&#xD;
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis. Rituximab has also shown to sensitize drug-resistant&#xD;
      lymphoma cell lines to killing by cytotoxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some &quot;in vitro&quot; studies that have tested the effect of Rituximab and IFN&#xD;
      combination. It's been described that when IFN is given with Rituximab, it favours the&#xD;
      expression of CD20 and therefore increases its cytotoxic effect - . Preliminary phase II&#xD;
      studies show an increase in response rate with duration of response going up to 12 months.&#xD;
      Moreover, there are two clinical studies that have tested the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      Rituximab added to IFN-alpha vi- ix. The Nordic Lymphoma Group showed a significant increase&#xD;
      in ORR (up to 94%) by adding 5 weeks of IFN to re-treatment with 4 doses of Rituximab in&#xD;
      patients who had achieved only a minimal or partial remission. Most of these patients,&#xD;
      maintained their responses for more than 24 months. With a similar trial design, Sacchi et&#xD;
      al. showed an ORR of 74% (33% of CR) and a median duration of response of 19 months. The&#xD;
      combination was safe and most grade 3-4 adverse events (15%) were hematologic toxicity&#xD;
      (leuko-neutropenia and thrombocytopenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of rituximab, with our standard induction regimen&#xD;
      using IFN plus CVP might lead to synergistic / additive induction of apoptosis through&#xD;
      different pathways in poor prognostic patients with FL, improving our previous results. We&#xD;
      also hypothesize that this combination will be able to achieve higher molecular remissions,&#xD;
      determined by real-time PCR of Bcl-2 translocation.&#xD;
