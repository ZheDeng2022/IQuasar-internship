    <textblock>
      This single-arm, open-label, multi-center study enrolled 65 patients from approximately 20&#xD;
      centers. All patients who met the study criteria and were taking, beginning or resuming&#xD;
      treatment with Deferasirox were allowed. The study will began with a one month run-in phase,&#xD;
      where all patients were instructed to take Deferasirox according to their physician's&#xD;
      prescribing information.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the run-in phase, patients entered a three month, assessment phase. During the&#xD;
      assessment phase, patients were given five general options for taking Deferasirox including&#xD;
      with or without meals, crushed and added to a soft food or mixed in a liquid of choice.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Differing Palatability Scores at Week 8 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Palatability was assessed by participants based on a five-point Facial Hedonic scale defined as: dislike extremely; somewhat dislike; neither like or dislike; somewhat like; like extremely for the meal and method of administration. For participants under 5 years of age, the scale was completed by parent or caregiver.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Discontinuation and Interruption</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgement of investigators represent significant hazards. Subjects who had permanently terminated from the treatment or kept the treatment on hold/deviated from protocol due to adverse event were defined as subjects with permanent discontinuation and temporary interruption, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Trough Plasma Concentration of Deferasirox at Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0), 1, 2, 4 and 6 hour (post-dose) at Week 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were drawn at every visit as close as possible to 24 hours post dose from each subject participating in the study and trough plasma concentrations were estimated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serum Ferritin at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 (End of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Ferritin protein stores iron and provides overall iron levels. Higher ferritin in blood showed higher iron content. Fluctuations from normal serum ferritin levels (500 ng/mL) observed at two consecutive visits led to dose adjustment of deferasirox.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>82 participants were screened, out of which 65 participants enrolled into study. Study design comprised of a one-month run-in period where participants took deferasirox according to the physician, followed by a three-month assessment period. In assessment period, participants were instructed to document the selected method of administration and meal (breakfast, dinner, or no meal). Method of administration and meal type were kept same over week, but allowed to change once a new week began.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Discontinuation and Interruption</title>
        <description>Adverse events (AEs) were defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgement of investigators represent significant hazards. Subjects who had permanently terminated from the treatment or kept the treatment on hold/deviated from protocol due to adverse event were defined as subjects with permanent discontinuation and temporary interruption, respectively.</description>
