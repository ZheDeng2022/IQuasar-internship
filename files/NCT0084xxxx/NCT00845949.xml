      Rheumatoid arthritis is a common chronic destructive arthritis. Major pathology change in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis is synovium hyperplasia with bone and cartilage erosion. Infiltrates in&#xD;
      synovial tissue included type one and type two synoviocytes, B cells, T cells and&#xD;
      fibroblasts. These cells will release many cytokines and chemokines, which will induce&#xD;
      expression of adhesion molecules, release of variable enzyme from fibroblast and osteoclast&#xD;
      and result in bone erosion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study revealed that fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) have some role in pathogenesis&#xD;
      of rheumatoid arthritis.We believed CXCL12/CXCR4 ligand/receptor pair is important in&#xD;
      chronicity of rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CXCL12 polymorphism is studied in many disease. There is no related CXCL12 polymorphism study&#xD;
      in rheumatoid arthritis. Our study intended to clarify the relationship between pathology,&#xD;
      serology factor, CXCL12 polymorphism in rheumatoid arthritis in hope that new direction of&#xD;
      therapy will be elucidated.&#xD;

      Rheumatoid arthritis is a common chronic destructive arthritis. Many patients suffered from&#xD;
      disability from this disease. There is no satisfactory therapy for every patient. Present&#xD;
      prognostic factor only explained the disease course partially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major pathology change in rheumatoid arthritis is synovium hyperplasia with bone and&#xD;
      cartilage erosion. Infiltrates in synovial tissue included type one and type two&#xD;
      synoviocytes, B cells, T cells and fibroblasts. These cells will release many cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines, which will induce expression of adhesion molecules, release of variable enzyme&#xD;
      from fibroblast and osteoclast and result in bone erosion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study in rheumatoid arthritis focused mainly in role of lymphocytes and osteoclast.&#xD;
      Recent study revealed that fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) have some property which is&#xD;
      similar but not identical to dendritic cells in lymph nodes. They are also important provider&#xD;
      of IL-7 and IL-15 and play an important role in persisted activation of synovial tissue.&#xD;
      Fibroblast will guide B cell infiltration and has intimate mutual interaction with T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stromal derived growth factor/CXCL12 is an effective lymphocyte chemokine. CXCR4 is&#xD;
      corresponding receptor. CXCL12 has been associated with autoantibody production in lupus&#xD;
      murine model animal. FLS can express stromal cell-derived factor 1 SDF-1/CXCL12, inducing&#xD;
      persisted infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell. Furthermore, migration, proliferation and&#xD;
      matrix mental proteinase secretion of FLSis regulated by CC and CXC chemokine. CXCL12&#xD;
      production by SLF is regulated by TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and TGF-beta1, but there is still some&#xD;
      inconsistency in literatures. CXCL12 itself also induce expression of CXCR4 and secretion of&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8 in FLS. Express of CCR4 in T cell is regulated by IL-2,IL-4,IL-7,IL-10 and cell&#xD;
      contact. CXCL12 produced by SLF is also presented by endothelium cell and inducing&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Clinical study also indicated that CXCL12 level is related to cartilage&#xD;
      destruction. CXCL12 level is decreased after synovectomy. Therefore we believed CXCL12/CXCR4&#xD;
      ligand/receptor pair is important in chronicity of rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently CXCL12 polymorphism is studied in many disease, such as prognosis of HIV&#xD;
      patients„ÄÅchronic myeloproliferative disease, and AML metastasis. There is no related CXCL12&#xD;
      polymorphism study in rheumatoid arthritis. Our study intended to clarify the relationship&#xD;
      between pathology, serology factor, CXCL12 polymorphism in rheumatoid arthritis in hope that&#xD;
      new direction of therapy will be elucidated.&#xD;
