  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of clinically N0 neck in malignancies of oral cavity is controversial. The&#xD;
      options include the policy of &quot;wait and watch&quot;(close observation and follow-up), elective&#xD;
      irradiation of the neck, elective surgery of the neck (neck dissection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In elective neck dissections, the procedures commonly performed are modified radical neck&#xD;
      dissection-III (functional neck dissection) and selective (supraomohyoid) neck dissection&#xD;
      depending on the site of the primary lesion within the oral cavity. There are no trials of&#xD;
      IIb preserving neck dissection in cancers of the oral cavity.&#xD;

      Surgery of the cervical lymphatic system has evolved a lot since the introduction of&#xD;
      classical radical neck dissection by Crile in 1906, which was later established by Martin&#xD;
      (1945). It includes the removal of cervical lymphatic levels I-V along with removal of&#xD;
      non-lymphatic structures namely submandibular gland, tail of parotid, omohyoid muscle,&#xD;
      cervical plexus of nerves, spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein and&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid muscle. The main morbidity of the radical neck dissection was the&#xD;
      trapezius muscle dysfunction with shoulder drop, resulting in pain and shoulder dysfunction.&#xD;
      The other morbidities of radical neck dissection were cosmetic deformity of neck, painful&#xD;
      neuromas, increased facial swelling, numbness of neck and ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last three decades, many modifications of the classical radical neck dissection&#xD;
      (modified radical neck dissections), had been described and are increasingly applied. The&#xD;
      main modifications have been the preservation of one or more of the non-lymphatic structures&#xD;
      that were removed in classical radical neck dissection mainly the spinal accessory nerve,&#xD;
      internal jugular vein, sternocleidomastoid muscle (Bocca and Pignataro, 1967). The reasons&#xD;
      for developing these modifications were functional and cosmetic, while preserving the&#xD;
      oncological safety of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much later in 1980s, the concept of selective neck dissection, for which Lindberg (1972) and&#xD;
      Skolnik (1976) laid down important basis, was introduced. In selective neck dissections only&#xD;
      those groups of lymph nodes are removed, which, depending upon the location of the primary&#xD;
      tumour, are most likely to contain metastasis (Shah, 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first selective neck dissection introduced was the supraomohyoid neck dissection, which&#xD;
      includes the removal of lymph node levels I-III, while preserving the non-lymphatic&#xD;
      structures as functional neck dissection. Medina and Byers in a prospective study have&#xD;
      demonstrated the utility of this supraomohyoid neck dissection in patients with clinically&#xD;
      negative neck nodes (N0) with malignancies of oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The posterolateral neck dissection removes lymph node levels II-V as well as retroauricular&#xD;
      and suboccipital nodes, which is used primarily for treatment of tumours of scalp and post&#xD;
      auricular skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lateral neck dissection, which includes removal of lymph node levels II-IV, is done for&#xD;
      tumours of larynx or hypopharynx with N0 neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anterior compartment neck dissection includes removal of only lymph node level VI which&#xD;
      is done in thyroid malignancies when there is no evidence of lateral lymphadenopathy, and is&#xD;
      combined with lateral neck dissection(anterolateral) if there are lymphnodes involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the concept of superselective neck dissections has been introduced. It is less&#xD;
      radical than selective neck dissections, removing lesser number of at-risk lymph nodal&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H Coskun (2004) found IIb preserving superselective neck dissection as oncologically safe&#xD;
      procedure in N0 laryngeal cancer, with more functional preservation of trapezius muscle and&#xD;
      hence negligible shoulder disability. In this study, it was found that even in selective neck&#xD;
      dissection, some degree of spinal accessory nerve dysfunction and shoulder disability occurs&#xD;
      as a result of retraction of the nerve during the clearance of the lymph nodes posterior and&#xD;
      superior to the nerve (IIb). If these lymph nodes were not removed and left in place, there&#xD;
      would be no stretching of spinal accessory nerve during the neck dissection and shoulder&#xD;
      disability could be avoided&#xD;
