  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human study. The overall purpose of the study is to assess whether&#xD;
      the drug is safe and well tolerated after single, increasing doses. At different doses, we&#xD;
      will look to see how much of the drug gets into the bloodstream, how the drug is broken down&#xD;
      and excreted and whether this is affected by the presence of food.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GSK1482160 is a new drug to be developed for treating inflammatory pain (for example,&#xD;
      arthritis). It acts on structures on inflammatory cells, known as P2X7 receptors. Blocking&#xD;
      these receptors reduces the release of important inflammatory chemicals which exists within&#xD;
      the body and are thought to play an important role in promoting inflammatory pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will start with a very low dose of study drug, which will then be gradually&#xD;
      increased in subsequent doses. This is known as dose-rising and is the way to assess safety&#xD;
      and tolerability (any side effects that make taking the drug unpleasant). Effects will be&#xD;
      compared to those seen when a placebo (a &quot;dummy&quot; drug) is taken. Up to 4 groups of 8 healthy&#xD;
      male or female volunteers will be enrolled into the study. In addition, part of the study&#xD;
      will be used to check if there is a difference in the blood levels of the study drug when&#xD;
      taken with or without a high fat meal.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac&#xD;
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the&#xD;
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female aged between 18 and 55 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
             tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous&#xD;
             amenorrhoea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and oestradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is&#xD;
             confirmatory.]1&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication until 5 x terminal half-lives after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. The written informed consent&#xD;
             form should be signed and dated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. A&#xD;
             12-lead ECG at pre-study screening, which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise safety in this study.&#xD;
             The specific inclusion criterion with regard to QT interval (either QTcb or QTcf,&#xD;
             machine or manual over-read, males or females) is that QTc should be less than 450msec&#xD;
             (based on single or average QTc of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording&#xD;
             period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No abnormality on relevant clinical chemistry or haematology examination at the&#xD;
             pre-study medical examination. Subjects with laboratory parameters outside the&#xD;
             reference range for this age group will only be included if the principal Investigator&#xD;
             or designee considers that such findings will not introduce additional risk factors.&#xD;
             Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is required before such subjects may be&#xD;
             included. In any case, liver function tests (including bilirubin, ALT, AST or alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase) and markers of renal function (including urea and creatinine) must be&#xD;
             strictly within the normal range at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Normal physical examination (providing no evidence of clinically active disease or&#xD;
             physical or mental impairment). A subject with a clinical abnormality may be included&#xD;
             only if the Principal Investigator or physician designee considers that the&#xD;
             abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with&#xD;
             study procedures. Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is required before such&#xD;
             subjects may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A 24-hour Holter at pre-study screening, which in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
             investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise safety in&#xD;
             this study. If a rhythm abnormality is detected, the subject may be included in the&#xD;
             study only if the Principle Investigator or physician designee considers that the&#xD;
             abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with&#xD;
             study procedures. Consultation with Principal Investigator, GSK medical monitor and,&#xD;
             if required, a specialist cardiologist will occur before such a subject may be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that&#xD;
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,&#xD;

             history of any clinical condition or surgical procedure that places them at higher&#xD;
             risk of TB (e.g. diabetes, sarcoidosis, gastrectomy and vagotomy, malignancy,&#xD;
             leukaemia), (iv) a history of mycobacterial infection, including TB, (v) recent close&#xD;
             contact (within the previous 48 months) with an individual known to be infected with&#xD;
             TB, (vi) recent immigrants or residents (within the previous 48 months) from countries&#xD;
             where TB is considered to be of high-prevalence. For the purposes of TB screening&#xD;

             14 units or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is&#xD;
             equivalent to a half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass&#xD;
             (125ml) of wine.&#xD;
&#xD;

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 90 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
