      A prospective open-label case-control study will be performed aiming to assess the utility of&#xD;
      thromboelastometry (ROTEM) for identification of hemostatic changes, goal-directed&#xD;
      coagulation management, and prognosis of intracranial hemorrhagic injury progression as well&#xD;
      as clinical outcome in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      craniotomy to treat traumatic brain injury will be enrolled. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      standard perioperative coagulation analysis (APTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen levels, platelet&#xD;
      count), whereas ROTEM-guided group will additionally be tested with ROTEM. &quot;Cases&quot; will be&#xD;
      managed according to a ROTEM-based algorithm, and &quot;Controls&quot; will be treated as usual (based&#xD;
      on clinical judging). Comparative analysis of acquired demographic, clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      data will be performed. The investigators believe that ROTEM results could provide better&#xD;
      insight into perioperative coagulation changes, be beneficial to patient blood management,&#xD;
      and result in better outcome.&#xD;

      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the utility of thromboelastometry for identification of hemostatic changes,&#xD;
      goal-directed coagulation management, and prognosis of intracranial hemorrhagic injury&#xD;
      progression as well as clinical outcome in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate perioperative prevalence and characteristics of thromboelastometry identified&#xD;
      coagulopathy in neurosurgical patients with isolated traumatic brain injury; To assess the&#xD;
      correlation between routine laboratory test results and thromboelastometric findings; To&#xD;
      evaluate the influence of thromboelastometric findings and goal-directed coagulation&#xD;
      management on the progression of intracranial hemorrhagic injury; To evaluate the utility of&#xD;
      thromboelastometry for goal-directed coagulation management, and its possible influence on&#xD;
      clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic brain injury still accounts for a considerable proportion of preventable deaths&#xD;
      worldwide. The prevalence of coagulation derangements among patients with traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI) is high and approximates 30 % (1,2). The main hypothesis explaining the&#xD;
      development of coagulopathy in the absence of massive bleeding is extensive release of tissue&#xD;
      factor from the damaged brain tissue and subsequent over-activation of coagulation leading to&#xD;
      consumption of coagulation substrates. The presence of coagulopathy in the setting of TBI is&#xD;
      associated with high risk of intracranial hemorrhagic insult progression and death (3,4).&#xD;
      Many authors investigating coagulopathy associated with traumatic brain injury have used&#xD;
      routine coagulation tests, such as APTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen levels. However, those tests do&#xD;
      not reflect the overall clot quality and reflect only separate parts of the coagulation&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Craniotomy for traumatic brain injury is an urgent high-risk procedure presenting a serious&#xD;
      challenge for the anesthesiology team. Significant, diffuse bleeding is not infrequent, and&#xD;
      the spectrum of neurosurgical hemostatic options is limited. Moreover, even small amounts of&#xD;
      intracranial blood may be life-threatening. Therefore the maintenance of optimal physiologic&#xD;
      clotting capacity is crucial. Literature data investigating the use of ROTEM in TBI patients&#xD;
      is still limited (5,6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that thromboelastometry could provide novel insights into the&#xD;
      dynamic coagulation changes of TBI patients. Moreover, it could serve as a clinical tool for&#xD;
      targeted coagulation management in the perioperative period of patients undergoing&#xD;
      craniotomies for intracranial traumatic hematomas, and prove beneficial for patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective open-label case-control study will be performed. Adult isolated traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury patients undergoing craniotomy and will be enrolled. Required sample size was&#xD;
      calculated based on the average number of craniotomies performed to treat traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury during the past five years in a tertiary neurosurgical centre. The investigators plan&#xD;
      to enroll 70 patients into the ROTEM-guided group (Cases), and 70 patients into the&#xD;
      conventional therapy group (Controls). All patients will undergo standard coagulation&#xD;
      analysis (APTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen levels, platelet count) preoperatively, and 3 days&#xD;
      postoperatively, whereas ROTEM-guided group patients will additionally be tested with ROTEM&#xD;
      (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM, APTEM). Coagulation management decisions in the ROTEM-guided group&#xD;
      will be made according to a ROTEM-based algorithm for goal-directed hemostatic therapy.&#xD;
      Conventional therapy group will be treated as usual. Perioperative demographic, clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data of study patients will be registered. Early neurological state (on&#xD;
      postoperative days 1,2,3,7, and until discharge) will be assessed according to the Glasgow&#xD;
      coma scale. Late neurological outcome (6 and 12 months postoperatively) will be assessed&#xD;
      according to Glasgow outcome scale. Comparative analysis of Case and Control groups will be&#xD;
      performed. Perioperative prevalence and characteristics of coagulopathy in neurosurgical&#xD;
      patients with isolated traumatic brain injury will be estimated. Correlation between routine&#xD;
      laboratory test results and thromboelastometric findings will be assessed. The influence of&#xD;
      thromboelastometric findings and goal-directed coagulation management on the progression of&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhagic injury will be assessed. The influence of goal-directed coagulation&#xD;
      management on clinical outcome will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated scientific and clinical benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that ROTEM results could provide better insight into perioperative&#xD;
      coagulation changes, be beneficial to patient blood management, and result in better outcome.&#xD;
