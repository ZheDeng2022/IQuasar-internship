  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To learn about individual glycemic response to physiological and psychological conditions&#xD;
      across a diverse population, the investigators will collect sensor and lifestyle data&#xD;
      directly from participants as they engage in daily activities. The investigators will collect&#xD;
      real-time glucose data from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) system; accelerometer,&#xD;
      aggregated activity, and sleep data from a wrist-worn activity tracker; mood and experiential&#xD;
      data; and food information. Non-sensor data will be collected using a paper log, or via a&#xD;
      study app when available.&#xD;
