      Non Traumatic Coma in children is an important pediatric emergency. It has been an enigma for&#xD;
      clinicians for many years. To find the cause of coma and to determine the prognosis is a&#xD;
      taxing question for the attending clinicians and the primary concern for relatives in every&#xD;
      case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-traumatic coma in childhood accounts for high morbidity and mortality in pediatric age&#xD;
      group. It can result from wide range of primary etiologies. Etiology of coma and clinical&#xD;
      status at the time of admission are likely outcome predictors. Infection is the commonest&#xD;
      etiology for coma in all age groups .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coma in children is recognized to be a non-specific sign with a wide potential differential&#xD;
      diagnosis. Among various etiological factors identified for non-traumatic coma, considerable&#xD;
      regional diversity exists in them with infectious problems suggested to be more common in&#xD;
      developing countries. There has been few case series in developing countries with specific&#xD;
      reference to infective etiology and there are also differences in infective agents between&#xD;
      developing and developed countries. Similarly prediction of outcome of coma is difficult&#xD;
      early in the course of the illness, especially in children. There have been many studies&#xD;
      suggesting prognostic parameters of coma in adults, but limited reviews are available for&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiologically it can be divided into two broad categories: those without focal neurologic&#xD;
      signs (e.g., metabolic encephalopathies); meningitis syndromes, characterized by fever or&#xD;
      stiff neck and an excess of cells in the spinal fluid (e.g., bacterial meningitis,&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage); and conditions associated with prominent focal signs (e.g., stroke,&#xD;
      cerebral hemorrhage). In most instances coma is part of an obvious medical problem such as&#xD;
      drug ingestion, hypoxia, stroke, trauma, or liver or kidney failure. Conditions that cause&#xD;
      sudden coma include drug ingestion, cerebral hemorrhage, trauma, cardiac arrest, epilepsy, or&#xD;
      basilar artery embolism. Coma that appears subacutely is usually related to a preceding&#xD;
      medical or neurologic problem, including the secondary brain swelling of a mass lesion such&#xD;
      as tumor or cerebral infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central nervous infections are the most common cause . Toxic-metabolic, status-epilepticus,&#xD;
      hypoxic-ischemic, intracranial bleed etc. are other main causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological outcome is often the foremost concern of parents and physicians .Etiology of&#xD;
      coma and clinical status at the time of presentation are the most likely predictors of&#xD;
      outcome. Simple clinical signs have been found as good predictors of outcome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-traumatic coma is an important source of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric age&#xD;
      group. Accurate diagnosis of etiology of childhood coma in resource poor countries is&#xD;
      complicated by overlap in clinical presentation, limited diagnostic resources, disease&#xD;
      endemicity and co-morbidity . Considerable skill is required to distinguish the group at high&#xD;
      risk for further deterioration, potentially leading either to death or severe handicap. This&#xD;
      study attempts to identify the common etiological factors of pediatric comatose patients as&#xD;
      well as the predictors of poor outcomes in these patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodes were defined on the basis of a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of less than 12 for more&#xD;
      than six hours . Many acutely ill children are not fully conscious because pathologic&#xD;
      processes may affect the parts of the central nervous system that mediate consciousness;&#xD;
      alteration in the state of consciousness is a common feature of many different conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these children make a full neurological recovery. However, depending on the&#xD;
      underlying etiology non-traumatic coma may cause considerable mortality and morbidity in&#xD;
      pediatric age group .&#xD;
