  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the early stages of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), oocyte retrieval was&#xD;
      performed via laparoscopy, a cumbersome and expensive process requiring general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Today, transvaginal oocyte retrieval for ART is a routine procedure performed under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. Double-lumen retrieval needles, which are capable of flushing ovarian&#xD;
      follicles, were developed to overcome the possibility of oocyte retention within the ovarian&#xD;
      follicles and retrieval collection system. Single lumen needles have been introduced and are&#xD;
      routinely used by most groups due to their supposed ability to retrieve the same number of&#xD;
      oocytes in a shorter operation time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a long period in which Humanitas department used double lumen needles for oocytes&#xD;
      retrieval in the last four years the choice of the needle is an operator choice, usually&#xD;
      influenced by the number of follicles present at human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to highlight differences&#xD;
      between Double Lumen Aspiration Needle and Single Lumen Needle among 2 double lumen and 2&#xD;
      single lumen needles commonly used in Humanitas' clinical practice in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte recovery percentage per aspirated follicles, recovery&#xD;
      time for single oocyte, percentage of Metaphase II (MII) oocytes retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard protocols will be used for controlled ovarian hyper stimulation. Trans vaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours ± 2 after hCG injection with&#xD;
      the patient under deep sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients per each needle will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
