    <measure>General Patient Profile - Number of Patients by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2019 Spirometric Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years prior to study visit, auto-calculated at study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>General patient profile for patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and not treated with ICS - Number of patients by GOLD 2019 spirometric classification. GOLD 2019 spirometric classification was auto-calculated according to the information recorded in the eCRF. While the protocol of the study planned to use GOLD 2017 guidelines, guideline updates were expected and it was planned to consider these updates for analysis purposes. For this reason, given that the GOLD 2019 guidelines were updated and effective, this guideline was used for auto-calculation. Spirometric data was collected from clinical records. To determine the severity of all subjects with COPD, patients were categorized into four levels based on their airflow limitation severity (based on post-bronchodilator FEV1 value): Gold 1 (mild): FEV1 (%) ≥ 80% predicted; Gold 2 (Moderate): 50% ≤ FEV1 (%) &lt; 80% predicted; Gold 3 (Severe): 30% ≤ FEV1 (%) &lt; 50% predicted; Gold 4 (Very serious): FEV1 (%) &lt; 30% predicted.</description>

    <description>General patient profile for patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and not treated with ICS - Number of patients by GOLD 2019 patient group (group A, group B, group C, group D).&#xD;
The GOLD 2019 patient group was auto-calculated according the information recorded in the eCRF.&#xD;
According to GOLD 2019 classification, four different types of patient groups were considered regarding their symptom burden and risk of exacerbation (exacerbations, Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores obtained from the eCRF):&#xD;
Group A: 0 or 1 exacerbations (not leading to hospital admission) and mMRC 0-1 and CAT &lt; 10; Group B: 0 or 1 exacerbations (not leading to hospital admission), and mMRC ≥ 2 or CAT ≥ 10; Group C: ≥ 2 exacerbations or ≥ 1 exacerbation leading to hospital admission, and mMRC 0-1 and CAT &lt; 10; Group D: ≥2 exacerbations or any ≥ 1 exacerbation leading to hospital admission, and mMRC ≥ 2 or CAT ≥ 10.</description>

    <measure>General Patient Profile - Body Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exacerbations (BODEx) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years prior to study visit, auto-calculated at study visit (1 day).</time_frame>
    <description>General patient profile for patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and patients not treated with ICS - BODEx index. The BODEx index is used to predict the mortality rate from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The BODEx index was auto-calculated according the information recorded in the eCRF.&#xD;
It includes the body mass index (BMI), the degree of dyspnea measured with the mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) scale, the pulmonary function measured with the FEV1 (%) post-bronchodilation and the number of severe exacerbations (only visits to hospital emergencies and admissions are included).&#xD;
For each item, a score (0-3) is calculated. BODEx index is obtained as the sum of the scores of all items.&#xD;
The index ranges from 0 to 9, with a higher index indicating a higher risk of death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Patient Profile - COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Data measured at study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>General patient profile for patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and patients not treated with ICS - CAT score.&#xD;
The CAT score was obtained from the sum of 8 items (cough, mucus, chest pressure, dyspnea, limitation in domestic activities, social limitation, sleep, energy). Each item ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 points (highest symptoms). To obtain a valid score, no missing values or missing answers were allowed. The total score was obtained as the sum of the scores of all items, ranging from 0 - 40.&#xD;
The score was grouped into two categories:&#xD;
CAT &lt;10: Low impact of COPD (Most days are good, the illness prevents the patient from doing one or two things he or she would like, coughing several days a week);CAT ≥10: Medium / high impact of COPD in the patient.</description>

    <measure>General Patient Profile - Number of Patients by Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Data measured at study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>General patient profile for patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and patients not treated with ICS - mMRC score.&#xD;
The mMRC score was used to assess severity of breathlessness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.&#xD;
Patients were asked to answer the breathlessness scale (Mmrc), a single item (0-4) scale assessing current level of dyspnea. The mMRC comprised of five statements that describe almost the entire range of respiratory disability from none (grade 0) to almost complete incapacity (grade 4). A lower (higher) grade is considered a better (worse) outcome.&#xD;
Grade 0: None severity Grade 1: Mild severity Grade 2: Moderate severity Grade 3: Severe severity Grade 4: Very severe severity</description>

        <description>General patient profile for patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and not treated with ICS - Number of patients by GOLD 2019 spirometric classification. GOLD 2019 spirometric classification was auto-calculated according to the information recorded in the eCRF. While the protocol of the study planned to use GOLD 2017 guidelines, guideline updates were expected and it was planned to consider these updates for analysis purposes. For this reason, given that the GOLD 2019 guidelines were updated and effective, this guideline was used for auto-calculation. Spirometric data was collected from clinical records. To determine the severity of all subjects with COPD, patients were categorized into four levels based on their airflow limitation severity (based on post-bronchodilator FEV1 value): Gold 1 (mild): FEV1 (%) ≥ 80% predicted; Gold 2 (Moderate): 50% ≤ FEV1 (%) &lt; 80% predicted; Gold 3 (Severe): 30% ≤ FEV1 (%) &lt; 50% predicted; Gold 4 (Very serious): FEV1 (%) &lt; 30% predicted.</description>

The score was grouped into two categories:&#xD;
CAT &lt;10: Low impact of COPD (Most days are good, the illness prevents the patient from doing one or two things he or she would like, coughing several days a week);CAT ≥10: Medium / high impact of COPD in the patient.</description>

      <desc>The study design is of non-interventional nature and the study is conducted within the conditions of the approved marketing authorizations. As no investigational product was used, but patients could have been treated with BI drugs, adverse events were reported on the safety analysis set, which included all enrolled patients treated with at least on dose of SPIOLTO®, STRIVERDI®, SPIRIVA® or ATROVENT® during the study period. Adverse events were reported as single arm align with the study design.</desc>
