  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Ethiopia, great majorities (95%) of households rely on solid biomass fuels such as wood,&#xD;
      muck, crop residues, and charcoal burned in highly polluting stoves to meet the basic&#xD;
      household energy needs with its severe health consequences due to emission of toxic indoor&#xD;
      air pollutants. Correspondingly, household air pollution (HAP) from biomass fuel use is now&#xD;
      estimated to be responsible for nearly 3.5 million premature deaths annually, with the&#xD;
      highest disease burdens experienced by countries in sub-Saharan Africa. HAP ranks as the&#xD;
      highest environmental risk factors to premature deaths globally and 2nd leading risk factor&#xD;
      next to childhood underweight in most of sub-Saharan Africa countries as well as 3rd leading&#xD;
      risk factor of disease next to childhood underweight, and suboptimal breastfeeding in&#xD;
      Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually prevention efforts aimed at reducing HAP and related health burdens have been focused&#xD;
      on the use of energy efficient cookstoves. There is, however, rigorous lack of evidence in&#xD;
      Ethiopia or in other similar settings whether it is possible to achieve adequate HAP&#xD;
      reduction and improve health with locally made energy efficient baking stoves from a public&#xD;
      health point of view. Particularly, the popular Ethiopian energy efficient &quot;Injera&quot; baking&#xD;
      stove has not been researched through stove trial inquiry. Therefore, research studies are&#xD;
      required in Ethiopia on health benefits achieved when households adopt energy efficient&#xD;
      baking stoves. In view of that, cluster randomized controlled trial will be employed with&#xD;
      experimental study design for one year to test the effectiveness of the Ethiopian improved&#xD;
      &quot;Injera&quot; baking stove intervention on reducing HAP and childhood acute respiratory infection&#xD;
      (ARI) through comparing equal size groups of children before and after part of households&#xD;
      received an improved &quot;Injera&quot; baking stove.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the proposed stove trial aims to address an important research gap by&#xD;
      determining whether the Ethiopian improved &quot;Injera&quot; baking biomass stove intervention can&#xD;
      adequately reduce HAP exposure to prevent childhood acute respiratory infection. With this&#xD;
      objective, the proposed stove trial will test the hypothesis that there is a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference in HAP levels and incidence of childhood ARI when using traditional&#xD;
      versus improved &quot;Injera&quot; baking stove in Northwest Ethiopia&#xD;

      1. Study area:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The implementation of the study project has been started among rural and urban&#xD;
           communities of Mecha Health &amp; Demographic Surveillance System (MHDSS) Site in Northwest&#xD;
           Ethiopia. MHDSS site is a field research center established by Bahir Dar University&#xD;
           (BDU) to conduct field researches &amp; support major graduate level research projects&#xD;
           principally. The field research center is located at 525 km far away from the capital&#xD;
           city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, towards Northwest. This field research center has been&#xD;
           selected as study area in light of the following particular rationales:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relevance of the project to the community in terms of current biomass fuel use,&#xD;
                climatic diversity &amp; local acceptability of the improved stove intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Strategic research importance of the locality to achieve the mission's of BDU to be&#xD;
                one of the ten premiere research universities in Africa by the year 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Opportunities to be benefited from the existing field research infrastructures of&#xD;
                MHDSS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Availability of local collaborators with experience of improved stove technology&#xD;
                transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Availability of improved baking stove initiatives already operating in the study&#xD;
                area&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Good field experience of investigators at the study area&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cluster randomized controlled study will be employed to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
           improved &quot;Injera&quot; baking biomass stove intervention in reducing both household air&#xD;
           pollution (HAP) &amp; childhood acute respiratory infection (ARI) incidences through&#xD;
           comparing children living in households (HHs) with different baking stoves over one year&#xD;
           follow-up period. With this study design, HAP &amp; childhood ARI outcomes will be measured&#xD;
           before the improved baking stove is installed and again after part of the HHs received&#xD;
           an improved baking stove. The overall study procedures will involve the following three&#xD;
           major phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Base line data collection using HH interview and air monitoring methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Installing improved &quot;Injera&quot; baking biomass stove in the main cooking area of the&#xD;
                intervention HHs to be used as primary baking stove at least for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consecutive data collection using the HH interview method every 2 weeks and measure&#xD;
                the new amounts of indoor particulate matter in the main cooking area using&#xD;
                standard HAP monitoring device every 3 months for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the primary outcome, the sample size was calculated by applying the two-sample&#xD;
           comparison of proportions formula using STATA with equal participants in both arms&#xD;
           considering 21% proportion of childhood ARI, detectable difference of 20%, &amp; two-tailed&#xD;
           alpha of 0.05, power of 80%, intra-cluster correlation coefficient (Ƿ) value of 0.01,&#xD;
           coefficient of variation of 0.6 for cluster sizes, 55 average number of children within&#xD;
           each cluster (m') and over sampling of 10%; the required sample size with cluster&#xD;
           randomization becomes about 2750 within 50 clusters per arm. Similarly, for the&#xD;
           secondary outcome, the sample size was calculated by considering detectable difference&#xD;
           of 60% in mean indoor PM2.5 concentration (µg/m3), correlation coefficient (Ƿ) of 0.5&#xD;
           for indoor PM2.5 measurement variations in biomass using HHs, 2-sided alpha of 0.05,&#xD;
           power of 80% and 55 average number of children within each cluster (m'), 0.6 coefficient&#xD;
           of variation for cluster sizes and over sampling of 10%; the required sample size&#xD;
           becomes about 990 within 18 clusters per arm. Thus, among the HHs included in the&#xD;
           primary outcome study, only part of the HHs will be included for the secondary outcome&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sampling method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using cluster sampling technique, clusters/&quot;Gotes&quot; will be selected randomly to&#xD;
           represent the total population &amp; then all HHs with under 4 years old child with in the&#xD;
           selected clusters will be included. A cluster is defined as the small village, termed as&#xD;
           &quot;Gote&quot; for rural or &quot;Ketena&quot; for urban settings in Amharic (both national &amp; local&#xD;
           language), used as the smallest unit of enumeration area by Ethiopian national census.&#xD;
           According to the update data report of MHDSS at the end of 2017, each cluster/&quot;Gote&quot;&#xD;
           includes about 55 average number of children. To set the randomisation list in advance&#xD;
           based on eligibility criteria, the sampling frame (list of HHs with children less than 4&#xD;
           years old) is established form the MHDSS update report data. Finally, the selected HHs&#xD;
           will be identified for data collection using the specific MHDSS house number &amp; the&#xD;
           youngest child equal or less than 4 years old will be recruited for study from each HH.&#xD;
           In situations where there are 2 or more under-four children living in the same HH, only&#xD;
           the youngest child will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participant recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To facilitate the participant enrolment process, community sensitization will be&#xD;
           conducted through public communications during local gatherings &amp; regular health&#xD;
           development army (HDA) meetings as well as through home visit by health &amp; agricultural&#xD;
           extension workers to let people know that childhood ARI &amp; HAP studies will be carried&#xD;
           out. The actual participants will be recruited at HH level by field health workers&#xD;
           during baseline survey after ensuring whether the HHs meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
           When HH meets the eligibility criteria, the study will be explained to parent/s of the&#xD;
           index child &amp; they will be asked whether the HH is willing to participate in the studies&#xD;
           or not. When both parents agreed to be involved, the field staff will administer a&#xD;
           written consent form in local language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participant allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An independent epidemiologist was performed the allocation to control &amp; intervention&#xD;
           arms which will be revealed after all baseline measurements have been completed as well&#xD;
           as all study HHs recruited &amp; assigned to their respective arm to ensure allocation&#xD;
           concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Intervention adherence and compliance monitoring strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To avoid the potential detrimental effects of non-adherence, a variety of strategies&#xD;
           will be used. In view of that, timely response to trial-related difficulties such as&#xD;
           rapid maintenance or replacing of defective stoves will be used as strategy to improve&#xD;
           adherence to the intervention protocol. Regarding trial protocol compliance monitoring,&#xD;
           visual inspection through unannounced visit of HHs will be conducted to enhance validity&#xD;
           of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the primary objective, data collection will be carried out by local nurses through&#xD;
           face-to-face interview with index child mothers/caregivers using questionnaire &amp; through&#xD;
           direct verification whenever essential &amp; possible. After baseline HH survey, the follow&#xD;
           up survey will be carried out for one year through HH visits every 2 weeks. Concerning&#xD;
           the duration, since seasonal factors typically have a major effect on HAP level in&#xD;
           Ethiopia the duration of the follow-up period will be one year to cover the major&#xD;
           Ethiopian periods of annual weather changes. Data collection manual containing a&#xD;
           detailed description of the questions &amp; other administrative issues will be used to&#xD;
           facilitate data collection process. For the secondary objective, baseline HAP exposure&#xD;
           (indoor PM2.5 concentration) will be measured in the main cooking area using standard&#xD;
           HAP monitoring device and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) by trained household air&#xD;
           monitoring team. In addition, independent variables data will be collected at baseline&#xD;
           through face-to-face interview with index child mothers/caregivers using structured&#xD;
           questionnaire. After baseline survey &amp; implementation of improved stove intervention,&#xD;
           subsequent indoor PM2.5 concentration measurements &amp; other covariates data collection&#xD;
           will be carried out every 3 months for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Data handling and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All original participant files will be stored in a secured manner for a period of at&#xD;
           least 2 years after completion of the study. Data integrity will be enforced through a&#xD;
           variety of mechanisms such as double data entry; valid values checks &amp; consistency&#xD;
           checks against data already stored in the database (i.e., longitudinal checks).&#xD;
           Considering the underlying design of the study, assumptions regarding the&#xD;
           inter-relationship between the independent &amp; outcome variables under investigation as&#xD;
           well as the repeated &amp; dependent nature of the data, Generalized Estimating Equation&#xD;
           modeling method of data analysis will be applied to determine the effect of improved&#xD;
           baking stove intervention on both HAP &amp; childhood ARI incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Ethical consideration and trial registration:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposal had been reviewed &amp; approved on May 08/2018 by Institutional Ethical Review&#xD;
           Board of Bahir BDU. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The&#xD;
           informed consent process emphasizes that participation in the study is voluntary &amp;&#xD;
           consent to participation can be withdrawn at any time, without giving a reason as well&#xD;
           as without affecting their current or future benefits to which the participants are&#xD;
           entitled. Moreover, to maintain justice control HHs will be offered improved baking&#xD;
           biomass stove at the end of their participation. Whenever ARI illness is occurred, field&#xD;
           health workers will refer the child to the nearest health institution for proper&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Close-out procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be terminated at the planned target of one year after the last participant has&#xD;
      been randomized or at an earlier or later date if the circumstances necessitate. Regardless&#xD;
      of the timing &amp; circumstances of the end of the study, close-out will proceed in 2 stages:&#xD;
      the first stage covers the interim period for analysis &amp; documentation of study results which&#xD;
      is expected to take about 3 months. The second stage will comprise debriefing of participants&#xD;
      &amp; dissemination of study results.&#xD;
