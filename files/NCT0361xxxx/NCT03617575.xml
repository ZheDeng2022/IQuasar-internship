  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure iron absorption from maize-based porridge fortified&#xD;
      with either apo-lactoferrin, holo-lactoferrin or ferrous sulfate and to test whether there is&#xD;
      an effect of these. Additionally, iron absorption from maize-based porridge containing 12 mg&#xD;
      ferrous sulfate will be measured when consumed every other day versus every third day.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa have high rates of iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      (IDA), which adversely affects their growth and cognitive development. In-home iron&#xD;
      fortification of complementary foods using micronutrient powders (MNPs) reduces risk for IDA&#xD;
      by ensuring that the iron needs of infants and young children are met without changing their&#xD;
      traditional diet. Oral iron syrups, typically containing iron as ferrous sulfate, can also be&#xD;
      given to prevent/correct IDA. However, iron absorption from MNPs and iron syrups,&#xD;
      particularly when given with complementary foods high in inhibitors of iron absorption, is&#xD;
      low. Thus, there is a need to find iron formulations with higher bioavailability for use in&#xD;
      African infants. In a recent trial in Kenya, the investigators demonstrated that a prebiotic&#xD;
      could improve iron bioavailability from an iron-containing MNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to assess the human milk compound lactoferrin (Lf) as a&#xD;
      possible enhancer of iron absorption. Lf is an important iron-binding protein in human milk,&#xD;
      which has been thought to be responsible for the high bioavailability of breast-milk iron. It&#xD;
      has many biological functions, including iron absorption, antimicrobial activity,&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects and stimulatory effect on cell proliferation. Lf has different iron&#xD;
      binding statuses: the iron free form (apo-Lf) and the iron-saturated form (holo-Lf). One of&#xD;
      the two main biological activities of Lf provided by the diet is the control of iron uptake,&#xD;
      which is mediated by the Lf receptor (LFR) as undigested Lf can bind to LFR and facilitate&#xD;
      the uptake of iron. Therefore, Lf may be a nutritional iron source and may enhance iron&#xD;
      absorption in infants. To evaluate the possible role of Lf on the availability of iron, iron&#xD;
      absorption will be measured from bovine Lf (bLf). BLf has GRAS (generally considered as safe)&#xD;
      status by the US Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To optimize iron absorption, timing of supplementation might as well be important. Hepcidin,&#xD;
      a key regulator of systemic iron balance and a single dose of iron can increase hepcidin&#xD;
      levels and potentially inhibit iron absorption from a second dose, consumed close in time to&#xD;
      the first dose. The investigators will conduct two studies, where 24 infants aged 3-14 months&#xD;
      in Msambweni, Kenya, will be enrolled. In study 1, on three alternate mornings, these infants&#xD;
      will consume maize porridge containing a low iron dose (1.5 mg) to compare iron absorption&#xD;
      between meals with apo-Lf, holo-Lf and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) as a reference; and whether&#xD;
      the addition of either apo- or holo-Lf has a beneficial effect on iron absorption. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that iron absorption will be higher when holo-Lf is present in the&#xD;
      meal compared to apo-Lf. In study 2, the investigators want to compare two different dosing&#xD;
      regimens, in which they measure iron absorption after one-day washout period and after a&#xD;
      two-day washout period, and hypothesize that absorption will be higher after 2 days of&#xD;
      washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this project will provide valuable information towards the development of new,&#xD;
      highly bioavailable iron formulations and dosing regimen that is most efficient.&#xD;
