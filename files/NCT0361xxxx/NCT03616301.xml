  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence,&#xD;
      two-period, crossover, comparative study, where each subject will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      reference or the test formulation in each period of the study (sequences RT or TR), in order&#xD;
      to evaluate if both formulations are bioequivalent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish if two formulations of amoxicillin + clavulanic&#xD;
      acid combination are bioequivalent. Also monitoring, registration and evaluation of adverse&#xD;
      events will be performed. The test formulation is Clavamox, powder for oral suspension, 400&#xD;
      mg + 57 mg / 5 ml (Pharmtechnology LLC, Belarus). The reference formulation is Augmentin®,&#xD;
      powder for oral suspension, 400 mg + 57 mg / 5 ml (GlaxoSmithKline Trading CJSC, Russia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      56 healthy adult volunteers of both genders, with age ranging from 18 to 45 years old, will&#xD;
      be divided into two cohorts with equal number of subjects (28). Each subject in a cohort will&#xD;
      receive single dose (5 ml containing 400 mg of amoxicillin and 57 mg of clavulanic acid) of&#xD;
      the test or the reference formulation with 200 ml of water after an overnight fast of at&#xD;
      least 10 hours, according to the pre-defined randomization list, i. e. 14 subjects in each&#xD;
      cohort will receive the test product and 14 subjects in each cohort will receive the&#xD;
      reference product. Subjects will fast 4 hours after administration of the study drugs during&#xD;
      each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each study period. Water will not&#xD;
      be accessible to the subjects 1 hour prior to administration of the study drugs and 2 hours&#xD;
      after administration of the study drugs in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each period blood samples will be collected before dosing and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25,&#xD;
      1.5, 1.75, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.5, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 7.00, 8.00, 10.00 hours after&#xD;
      dosing (total number: 19). The washout period is 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A validated HPLC/MS/MS method will be used to determine plasma concentrations of two analytes&#xD;
      (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA will be performed on log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and 90%&#xD;
      confidence interval will be constructed for the ratio of geometric least square means of the&#xD;
      test and the reference products, obtained from the log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will&#xD;
      be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its 90% confidence interval for each analyte,&#xD;
      both falls within the acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax and AUC0-t.&#xD;
