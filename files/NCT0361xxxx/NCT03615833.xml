  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is greater than 15%. PAD is associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, coronary heart disease and stroke, with a&#xD;
      mortality rate of 5% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most clinical evidence supports the idea that having normal vitamin D reduces cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk. The data suggests that normalizing vitamin D levels would have a significant impact on&#xD;
      public health, reduce costs and help control the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a plausible physiological theory, supported by numerous observational studies,&#xD;
      that vitamin D supplementation should be effective in improving cardiovascular outcomes, such&#xD;
      as blood pressure, arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, endothelial function, and clinical&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that routine screening for vitamin D deficiency and&#xD;
      supplementation in case of hypovitaminosis D is effective for improving the maximum walking&#xD;
      distance after 12 weeks of treatment in stage 2 PAD patients .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At admission eligible patients are proposed to participate. Written consent is signed after&#xD;
      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed. Vitamin D level will be&#xD;
      assessed : Patients without vitamin D deficiency will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of vitamin D supplementation on the evolution of walking distance in 12 weeks&#xD;
      will be studied by comparing the spontaneous evolution of this walking distance, in not&#xD;
      supplemented patients (period 1 ), and the evolution under treatment with vitamin D (period&#xD;
      2, afer 3 months ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spontaneous evolution of the walking distance will be evaluated by the difference in&#xD;
      walking distance observed between the beginning and the end of the first Period (3 months) .&#xD;
      The evolution of walking distance under vitamin D treatment will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      difference in walking distance between between the beginning and the end of the second Period&#xD;
      (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participation for a subject is equal to 6 months (2 periods of 3 months )&#xD;
