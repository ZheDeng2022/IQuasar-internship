    <description>Clinical evaluation to assess changes over time from pre-op through 10 years post-op. The EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire is an instrument that derives a single index for Quality of Life (QoL) and has two sections. The first section consists of five questions covering the dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The second part consists of a 20-centimeter vertical VAS ranging from 0 to 100. It records the respondent's self-rated health where the endpoints are labeled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. EQ-5D-5L is completed by the subject.</description>

    <time_frame>Collect retrospectively from medical records preoperatively and at 1 year, and prospectively at 2, 5, and 10 years post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>HOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related QOL. The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>
