  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vismodegib (ERIVEDGE®) at the standard dose of 150 mg/day orally is indicated for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and is associated with many adverse effects.&#xD;
      Cramps, alopecia, dysgeusia, weight loss and others observed in clinical practice, compromize&#xD;
      compliance and often lead to treatment discontinuation. Currently, it is the only drug&#xD;
      available in this indication. Our main objective is to assess the relationship between plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of vismodegib, and the occurrence of adverse effects within 6 months of&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients treated with the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway inhibitor, vismodegib, for Basal&#xD;
      Cell Carcinoma (BCC), intolerance to this drug is a cause of non-compliance to treatment and&#xD;
      often requires therapy discontinuation in spite of its potent anticarcinomic action. Indeed,&#xD;
      vismodegib, at the standard dose of 150 mg/day, leads to many heavy side effects often 1&#xD;
      month after therapy initiation. The major side effects are daily or multiple daily cramps&#xD;
      (associated with hypometabolism) in 60% of patients, dysgeusia, ageusia and alopecia (related&#xD;
      to stem cells), and tiredness. Currently, there is no recommendation for dose adjustment&#xD;
      against the occurrence of these adverse effects, so that clinicians propose temporary or&#xD;
      definitive therapeutic discontinuation for around 30% of patients. The management of these&#xD;
      therapeutic pauses is a challenge for clinicians, as no data are available on their impact on&#xD;
      treatment long-term response. We hypothesize that vismodegib side effects are related to high&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of drug in many patients. To date, there is no data from phase 3 study,&#xD;
      sparse pharmacokinetic data emanating from Phase 1 and 2 studies in various solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included are treated with vismodegib (Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor) for&#xD;
      symptomatic metastatic BCC, or for advanced BCC when surgery and radiotherapy are not&#xD;
      appropriate. Included patients are new patients initiating a treatment with vismodegib or&#xD;
      patients already on vismodegib. The study of the relationship between plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of vismodegib and tolerance, requires at each monthly follow-up visits, monitoring of:&#xD;
      concentrations of free (unbound to the α1-GPA) and total (bound and unbound) forms of&#xD;
      vismodegib, α1-GPA plasma concentrations, patient's status, data on safety and efficacy, and&#xD;
      clinical and biological data (covariates that may modulate the vismodegib pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      resulting in increased plasma concentrations). Patients will be followed for 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Vismodegib 150 mg capsules is administered daily with or without food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed in the dermatologic unit of Bordeaux University Hospital (Saint André Hospital) every month. At each consultation, clinical and biological datas, and two blood samples are collected just before taking the drug. One sample is for vismodegib quantification (pharmacokinetic protocol), and the other for the determination of alpha-1 glycoprotein acid level</description>
