    <textblock>
      Childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses significant impairment in children's executive&#xD;
      functions (EFs) for moderate to severe injuries, yet interventions specifically designed for&#xD;
      children's EF rehabilitation post-TBI and rigorous clinical trials to establish the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of such interventions remain unavailable. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a small-scale pilot randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based training program for EF rehabilitation for&#xD;
      mild complicated to severe childhood TBI. Knowledge from this research will provide empirical&#xD;
      evidence for a larger-scale RCT after the conclusion of this pilot study, with the aim to&#xD;
      improve the long-term health and quality of life in children with TBI, as well as promote&#xD;
      efficiency and effectiveness of future psychological rehabilitation for children with TBI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired disability in U.S. children, with&#xD;
      an estimated 700,000 cases every year, presenting in 75% of children with trauma and&#xD;
      accounting for 70% of deaths from childhood trauma. Childhood TBIs often result in&#xD;
      significant impairment in cognitive functions, particularly in core executive functions (EFs)&#xD;
      due to the vulnerability of the frontal lobes, especially after a moderate to severe TBI.&#xD;
      Core EF is composed of three skills: inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility, whose impairment is associated with impaired daily EF skills, increased&#xD;
      attention problems, and lower quality-of-life (QoL). The CDC reported to Congress in 2015&#xD;
      that post-TBI cognitive rehabilitation was the No. 1 unmet health care need for children with&#xD;
      TBI. However, evidence-based EF rehabilitation programs are lacking. Although research has&#xD;
      shown that a combination of diverse cognitive interventions may improve children's EF,&#xD;
      clinically adapting and implementing such interventions in the rehabilitation setting is&#xD;
      hampered by limited affordability, accessibility, adherence, and generalizability. Virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) offers an exciting alternative strategy for EF rehabilitation of childhood TBI&#xD;
      for three reasons. First, VR has the flexibility to offer various EF training activities in a&#xD;
      virtual environment within a restricted physical space. Second, VR can be delivered via&#xD;
      Internet/mobile platforms, allowing children to participate in post-discharge training at&#xD;
      home as needed. Third, unlike traditional computerized training programs, VR can provide&#xD;
      immersive experiences in three dimensions. This may increase adherence to training and foster&#xD;
      greater transfer of learned EF skills to untrained tasks in everyday life. Thus far, rigorous&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have not been conducted to establish the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of VR-based EF rehabilitation for childhood TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this pilot project is to assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel VR-based interactive cognitive training (VICT) program for EF&#xD;
      rehabilitation in children ages 7-17 years with complicated mild to severe TBI. The VICT&#xD;
      program is an integrative hardware and software VR system that trains the three core EFs&#xD;
      within a challenging animated mission. Using a small parallel-group RCT, the study focuses on&#xD;
      refining clinically-appropriate VR research paradigms in pediatric rehabilitation settings&#xD;
      and obtaining feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy data on children's EF&#xD;
      improvement. After the conclusion of the present pilot study, the investigators will utilize&#xD;
      the knowledge and skills gained from this phase to conduct a full-scale longitudinal&#xD;
      parallel-group RCT to formally evaluate the VICT program's efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, a small parallel-group RCT will be carried out in this study. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to recruit 20-30 children with complicated mild to severe TBI and randomly assign each&#xD;
      participant to either an intervention group (VICT) or a control group (comparable VR game&#xD;
      without EF training). Preliminary efficacy outcomes will be assessed at pre-,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and a follow-up visit up to six months after the post-intervention&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Refine clinically-appropriate paradigms for VR childhood TBI rehabilitation research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Explore feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of the VICT program. The&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of the VICT program will be examined through both quantitative&#xD;
      measures (adverse events, simulator sickness, and fatigability) and a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview with children, families, and clinicians regarding perceived benefits and&#xD;
      challenges. Preliminary efficacy data will be obtained on core EF, daily EF, attention&#xD;
      problems, and health-related QoL for both groups. These data will then be used in a&#xD;
      conservative way to estimate the effect size of this novel intervention and calculate the&#xD;
      required sample size for future RCTs.&#xD;
