      To develop awareness, enhance knowledge, attitude and make behavioral changes by using health&#xD;
      education and mHealth technology among hypertensive patients in a rural community of&#xD;
      Bangladesh, A Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted in a rural community around&#xD;
      Kumudini Women's Medical College and Hospital, Mirzapur, Bangladesh, intervention period will&#xD;
      be consecutive 5 months and 210 in each group (total 420). Face to face interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted to develop awareness among hypertensive individuals as part of the provision of&#xD;
      improved health care services. The face to face interview will take place at Kumudini&#xD;
      Hospital or in the community. Face to face interviews will help to understand the&#xD;
      individuals' perceptions, attitudes, and practices associated with compliance to treatment&#xD;
      and behavior change. Additionally, the study will identify major barriers related to&#xD;
      hypertension associated with healthcare-seeking behaviors. Subjects will be diagnosed cases&#xD;
      of hypertension. The selection criteria would be: individuals aged 35 years and more, have at&#xD;
      least 1-5 years of schooling, who are open and can exchange their views freely as well as who&#xD;
      can be asked in-depth and probing questions. Moreover, specimens will be collected to examine&#xD;
      for serum total cholesterol, random blood sugar, urinary salinity, and urinary protein.&#xD;
      Physical measurements like height in meter, weight in kg, MUAC in millimeter, hip and waist&#xD;
      ratio will be performed from the day of enrollment till the end of follow up. If the&#xD;
      participant agrees to participate, they will be asked questions about their lifestyle,&#xD;
      present health status, and socio-demographic characteristics. The interview will around 30&#xD;
      minutes of their time, measurement of nutritional status (height, weight, MUAC, hip&#xD;
      circumference, and waist circumference), and specimen collection for laboratory tests (blood&#xD;
      and urine) will take another 30 minutes. Initially, the follow-up visits will be twice a&#xD;
      month then once a month up to 4 consecutive months. Interviews will be conducted in the&#xD;
      Kumudini Women's Medical College and Hospital. The data will be securely stored in a locked&#xD;
      room. Data will be processed and analyzed by using the statistical software packages SPSS for&#xD;
      Windows version 21.0 and Epi Info version 6.0. Statistical significance will be defined as&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension is one of the foremost non-communicable diseases (NCDs)c in the world, which&#xD;
      significantly contributes to the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke, kidney&#xD;
      failure, disability, and premature death. It is also recognized as a global public health&#xD;
      problem and ranked third as a cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). According to&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO), about 17 million deaths occur worldwide due to CVDs, of&#xD;
      which hypertension alone accounts for 9.4 million deaths and 80% of the CVD-related deaths&#xD;
      occurred in the developing countries. The global prevalence of hypertension is projected to&#xD;
      increase from 26% in 2000 to 29% by 2025, which will be approximately 29% of the world's&#xD;
      population. Its prevalence is increasing in the low and middle-income countries (LMIC),&#xD;
      especially Southeast Asia where individuals are having an increasing burden of hypertension&#xD;
      including CVDs. According to WHO, hypertension has become a significant health concern in the&#xD;
      Asian region, affecting more than 35% of the adult population. Bangladesh, a developing&#xD;
      country in South Asia, has been experiencing an epidemiologic transition from communicable&#xD;
      diseases to NCDs. In recent years, rapid urbanization, prolonged life expectancy, unhealthy&#xD;
      diet, and lifestyle changes have led to an increase in the rate of CVD including hypertension&#xD;
      in Bangladesh. In recent years, in Bangladesh, approximately 20% of adults and 40-65% of&#xD;
      elderly people suffer from HTN. Most of the common reasons are sedentary lifestyle, changing&#xD;
      food habit, smoking, and adulteration of food products, fruits, and vegetables. However,&#xD;
      keeping in mind the changes in lifestyle and food habits among the young adults in&#xD;
      Bangladesh, the possibilities of hypertension in young adults can't be ruled out among this&#xD;
      age group. In this study, we aim to develop awareness, enrich knowledge and make behavioral&#xD;
      modifications by health education and mHealth technology among hypertensive patients in a&#xD;
      rural community of Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop awareness and enhance knowledge, which will be measured by actual behavioral&#xD;
           changes by using health education and mHealth technology among hypertensive patients in&#xD;
           a rural community of Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the level of blood pressure changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure health status by Euro-5D-5L QOL questionnaire (Mobility, self-care, usual&#xD;
           activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To decrease dietary salt intake (Measured by food and urinary salinity test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To measure blood glucose level (Random Blood Sugar), urinary protein and glucose test to&#xD;
           measure complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the feasibility of this intervention strategies and mHealth technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we hypothesize that hypertensive patients because of health education and mHealth&#xD;
      technology applications (cell phone monitoring of BP and periodic behavioral change education&#xD;
      - drug adherence) and follow-up will have decreased blood pressure (BP) relative to controls&#xD;
      under medication but without any mHealth technology applications. Compared to controls,&#xD;
      intervention patients at follow-up will report quality of life, behavioral change, dietary&#xD;
      habit as well as their greater satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation In this study we have considered two groups, intervention group (PI;&#xD;
      health education with text messaging) and control group (PC; health education without text&#xD;
      messaging). In each group a proportion of the participants will respond to the intervention;&#xD;
      PI and PC. When the intention of the study is to show that the intervention group is superior&#xD;
      than the usual formulation of null hypothesis (PI&gt;PC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to compare between two interventions (health education&#xD;
      with or without text messaging). Investigators regard the compliance as PI&gt;PC. We assume&#xD;
      that, if the proportion of patients with compliance is at most 10% to 12% better in the&#xD;
      health education with text messaging group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated with 2-tailed 5% significance level, power 80% with a confidence&#xD;
      level of 95% (1-Î±) and to detect varying differences in the effectiveness of the two&#xD;
      intervention groups. Assuming adherence rates differing between 10-12% with 90% in the study&#xD;
      group and 78%, 79% and 80% respectively in the control group and with a presumption that 6%&#xD;
      of the participants would be lost during follow-up. The sample size was calculated to range&#xD;
      between 153-210 in each group. Thus, considering the largest size of the calculated sample&#xD;
      sizes, the study finally had a sample size of 210 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization schedule is being prepared following a permuted block randomization technique&#xD;
      using a block size of four based on a computer-generated series of numbers. An experienced&#xD;
      researcher (third party), who is not involved with the study generated the random allocation&#xD;
      by sequence and distributed that in serially numbered sealed opaque envelopes which are being&#xD;
      kept in locked file cabinets in a site away from trial's location. Thus, all CHWs and the&#xD;
      principal investigator (PI) are kept blinded about the random allocation. A total of eight&#xD;
      CHWs are being involved in participants' enrollment under the guidance of the PI. Sequential&#xD;
      ID numbers of the potential participants are arranged by the PI immediately before enrolling&#xD;
      in the field on a daily basis. Enrollment takes place during morning hours for consecutive 6&#xD;
      days (except Friday) in a week. CHWs open the envelope in front of the participants at their&#xD;
      household when they agree to be enrolled in the study by giving written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be implemented at Kumudini Women's Medical College and Hospital immediately&#xD;
      after getting IRB approval from Bangladesh Medical and Research Council (BMRC). Hypertensive&#xD;
      patients living in rural Mirzapur will be mostly identified from Mirzapur Kumudini Hospital.&#xD;
      Additionally, study participants will be selected from the community by the door to door&#xD;
      visits. The diagnosis of hypertension will be based on the prescription and Kumudini hospital&#xD;
      database records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Activities and Data Collection Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present qualitative assessment will follow an exploratory study design. The study will&#xD;
      particularly aim to comprehend the knowledge level in relation to hypertension in a rural&#xD;
      community of Bangladesh. To achieve the study objectives, this study will adopt focus group&#xD;
      discussion (FGD), in-depth-interviews (IDI), and key informant interviews (KII). These tools&#xD;
      are omnipresent in qualitative study and provide subjective perceptions from community and&#xD;
      individual perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population The inclusion criteria of these specific predefined participants for KII&#xD;
      and IDI will be as follows: (i) male and female individuals aged â¥35 years, (ii) diagnosed&#xD;
      recently or before as a hypertensive or non-hypertensive individual through review of&#xD;
      hospital logs, and prescriptions (iii) physically and intellectually able to travel, attend&#xD;
      and talk in interviews and actively participate in discussions, and (iv) who can be asked&#xD;
      probing questions, can share their knowledge, perception, attitude towards hypertension and&#xD;
      mHealth technology freely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following number of participants will be interviewed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools Number of participants Key informant interview 6-8 (3-4 M &amp; 3-4 F)&#xD;
      In-depth interview 6-8 (3-4 M &amp; 3-4 F) FGD with hypertensive male and female participants&#xD;
      60-80 (30/40 M &amp; 30/40 F)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected through individual interviews (key informant interviews) and group&#xD;
      interviews (focus group discussions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Focus group discussion (FGD)&#xD;
&#xD;
           FGD will be conducted in individuals with and without hypertension including both male&#xD;
           and females at the community level to understand their perceptions, symptoms, knowledge,&#xD;
           motivations, beliefs and attitude towards hypertension and mHealth technology and their&#xD;
           practices related to healthcare at household and community level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In-depth interview (IDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The in-depth interviews will be conducted with 3-/4 people with hypertension and 3-/4&#xD;
           people without hypertension both male and female who are individuals of either sex from&#xD;
           local community to understand their perceptions, knowledge about symptoms of&#xD;
           hypertension, motivations, beliefs and attitude towards hypertension and mHealth&#xD;
           technology and their health care seeking practices and compliances towards drugs and&#xD;
           instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Key informant interview (KII)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to the study objectives, the study will conduct key informant interviews to&#xD;
      develop an insight of individuals regarding the symptoms, causes and consequences of&#xD;
      hypertension, the importance of lifestyle modification and regular check-ups in controlling&#xD;
      hypertension or barriers and challenges that keep them away from regular checkups and&#xD;
      medication adherence. Moreover, the systems that affect mobile health related health care&#xD;
      services at the local level, potential barriers and challenges, and issues that may need&#xD;
      further attention will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from field will follow a step-by-step data management procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data labelling (naming the recorded and transcribed files)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transcription (both in Bangla and English)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data cleaning (recover missing data)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data compilation with field notes (check the accuracy and brevity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data storage (both soft and hard copy in a safe and secure place with restricted access)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis After having a good sense of field data, the research team will initiate a&#xD;
      thematic/content analysis based on available data. Both inductive (bottom-up: emerging from&#xD;
      field data) and deductive (top-down: theory driven) approach of coding and themes&#xD;
      (/sub-themes) selection will be taken into consideration. However, it is important to note&#xD;
      that data analysis in a qualitative study is consistent process rather than step-by-step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data coding At first, transcripts will be reviewed carefully and re-read for producing a code&#xD;
      book. Reading and coding will initiate while data are being collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data presentation The data display and reduction process will be conducted once all data have&#xD;
      been collected. Even during data display and reduction, the investigators will loop back&#xD;
      through earlier steps to refine codes, re-read texts and revise some aspects of analysis.&#xD;
      After reading, re-coding and coding the text, the main themes will be formalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of participants for RCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before the implementation of the research, a structured questionnaire will be&#xD;
      developed based on past experience in rural Bangladesh and elsewhere, which will be discussed&#xD;
      thoroughly with field staff members and extensive field-testing will be done for necessary&#xD;
      modifications of the questionnaire. Using a standardized pre-tested questionnaire, the&#xD;
      socio-economic status and demography ( age, sex, religion, financial dependency, educational&#xD;
      qualification, occupation, monthly family income and expense, type of house, type of family,&#xD;
      marital status, living arrangements and so on) health status, health care seeking behavior,&#xD;
      food consumption practices, life styles such as tobacco consumption, level of physical&#xD;
      activity and other relevant information will be obtained. Moreover, blood and urine specimens&#xD;
      will be collected and laboratory tests like serum total cholesterol, random blood sugar,&#xD;
      urinary salinity, and urinary protein, glucose will be performed. Measurements of nutritional&#xD;
      indices such as height, weight, MUAC, hip circumference, and waist circumference will be&#xD;
      carried out from the enrollment day till end of follow up. Follow up and physical examination&#xD;
      will take place at Kumudini Hospital or in the nearest Health and Family Welfare Center. In&#xD;
      this study, we will use a portable health clinic device which is recommended by Grameen&#xD;
      health program and by using this device we can save our time, as this device has all the test&#xD;
      and measurement facilities which we will do in our study. Six follow up visits will be&#xD;
      undertaken during the study period. Initially follow up visits will be twice a month then&#xD;
      once a month up to 4 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, staff members will be trained on use of all hardware. Usability evaluation of the&#xD;
      staff members will be performed to document (a) user performance and understand common errors&#xD;
      that are made by them while using the devices, (b) understand user perceptions and their&#xD;
      suggestions in better usage of the devices. Similar usability evaluation of the 10-15&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals will be conducted. The evaluation will be conducted in a quiet&#xD;
      environment with no distractions. Five qualitative questions will be asked to understand the&#xD;
      practical benefits and drawbacks of the devices. SMS messages will be developed in native&#xD;
      language by the members of the research team representing different professional background;&#xD;
      these messages will be sent to 10-15 people (randomly) for their comprehension and&#xD;
      acceptability as part of field-testing. The wired intervention individuals will receive short&#xD;
      messaging service (SMS) and they will have liberty to participate additionally in two-way&#xD;
      communication system (between wired individuals and research team members). After receiving&#xD;
      feedback, messages will be finalized. The SMS will provide simple health education and BP&#xD;
      measurement reminders to encourage adherence to medical advice. Research team members will&#xD;
      send a text message to a wired person having registered cell phone number throughout the&#xD;
      study period. SMS (First month: 3 SMS per week, and then third month to five months: 1 SMS&#xD;
      per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the enrolled patients will receive health education booklets created by the researchers&#xD;
      based on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as well as a self-management&#xD;
      notebook we will provide to participants in which the they will record blood pressure, body&#xD;
      weight and lifestyle improvement goals. The education booklets will be selected for that it&#xD;
      will suitable for the individual participant. Any abnormalities in the monitored values or&#xD;
      data or exacerbation of participant symptoms will be reported immediately to the primary care&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMS content:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet Reduce sodium (salt) intake WHO recommended sodium intake is 5g/day Eat more fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables and more fiber&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is high in fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, and fiber. Patients who strictly follow&#xD;
      the DASH eating plan can also have fairly significant reductions in weight, particularly when&#xD;
      combined with a low-sodium diet. Lifestyle, Stop smoking, Stop taking alcohol, Caffeine,&#xD;
      Exercise: Regular exercise (walking, running) for 20 to 30 minutes most days of the week can&#xD;
      lower your blood pressure, Reduce weight, Reduce stress, Monitor your blood pressure at home,&#xD;
      Control blood pressure during pregnancy, Medication: Take medication regularly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have recommended with emphasis on economic evaluation of health promotion&#xD;
      interventions such as health education and mobile health technology (SMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this evaluation, the estimated cost of the program as well as costs for activities will&#xD;
      be measured using ingredients approach, which includes listing of all types of inputs by&#xD;
      identification of activities, quantities used, and prices for each input. Activity-based&#xD;
      costing (ABC) techniques will be attempted to assign costs to each of the activities in the&#xD;
      production process and/or resources. For this purpose, all costs will be classified according&#xD;
      to major activities and/or resources. All activities and their associated inputs will be&#xD;
      identified, and their respective costs will be obtained. Costs will be derived from two&#xD;
      phases of the intervention named start-up cost and implementation cost which are directly&#xD;
      related to the study. Total costs will be considered as the summation of capital and&#xD;
      recurrent cost items for each phase. A comprehensive list of cost-related items will be made,&#xD;
      and finally, cost per session per beneficiary will be estimated by dividing the total&#xD;
      provider cost per session with the number of beneficiaries who received the SMS. The&#xD;
      estimation of the cost will be covered the additional costs only that will include all field&#xD;
      and administrative activities. Costs incurred other than intervention activities of the&#xD;
      project such as salary, transportation, and data collection will be excluded from the&#xD;
      estimation. Moreover, a household out of pocket expense/cost will be measured to assess any&#xD;
      costs incurred for receiving the treatment or related to treatment. All necessary data will&#xD;
      be extracted from the project's documents, and project staff members will be interviewed&#xD;
      whenever necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To capture the care seeking pattern due to chronic disease and other illness also.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the treatment cost from household perspectives due to chronic disease and&#xD;
           other illness also.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the program cost from supply side perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To conduct a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program costs/provider perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start-up cost&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation cost&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household costs/household perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-Effectiveness analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention package will finally be calculated using the&#xD;
      cost of the whole program. Net cost of intervention and its effectiveness will be measured by&#xD;
      comparing cost and effectiveness in intervention and control groups. Cost-outcome ratio as&#xD;
      well as incremental cost-outcome ratio will be calculated i.e. if the study switches from one&#xD;
      alternative (A) to another alternative (B), the changes in costs and outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared (like, C1 - C0 / E1 - E0). Changes in various effects between intervention and&#xD;
      comparison group will be considered as the changes in outcome/success of the intervention.&#xD;
      The program with the low cost-effectiveness ratio will be considered as cost-effective&#xD;
      intervention as it would offer most value for money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered twice and stored in a relational database. Pre-coded questionnaire will&#xD;
      be used to minimize data coding errors. All data forms and questionnaires will be checked for&#xD;
      errors and necessary corrections will be made before data entry. A data entry program with&#xD;
      built-in range and consistency checks will be used. Frequency distributions will be run to&#xD;
      identify outliers. In all analyses, potential confounding variables and effect modifiers will&#xD;
      be considered. Data will be entered, processed and analyzed using the statistical software&#xD;
      packages SPSS for Windows version 21.0 and Epi Info version 7.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will include descriptive as well as analytical methods. Basic&#xD;
      presentations of data will include number and percentages of individuals with hypertension by&#xD;
      age, sex and in relation to different known risk factors of interest. The descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be expressed as percentages, means, medians, standard deviations with ranges&#xD;
      or with 95% confidence intervals where appropriate. Chi-square (Ï2) tests will be computed to&#xD;
      assess the association between outcome and independent variables. Odds ratios will be&#xD;
      calculated for hypertension after adjusting for major confounding variables (e.g. age, sex,&#xD;
      food habits, socioeconomic status, nutritional status, family history of hypertension etc.).&#xD;
      Effects of interaction terms will also be examined fitting logistic regression models. When&#xD;
      the main outcome measures are continuous variables, the statistical significance of group&#xD;
      mean comparisons will be determined by Student's t-test. The primary analysis will be&#xD;
      intention to treat which will provide relative unbiased comparisons among the intervention&#xD;
      and control groups. In case of non-normal distribution of measurements, equivalent&#xD;
      non-parametric tests will be used. Statistical significance will be defined as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be compared with the Ï2 test for categorical outcome. Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test when needed will be performed to estimate p values. For all models, the results will be&#xD;
      expressed as an estimate of effect size, with 95% CIs and p values.&#xD;

      1. Behavioral changes by health education (evaluated by the researcher who developed&#xD;
      questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational Definition: Increased awareness, knowledge, and attitude changes will be measured&#xD;
      by actual behavior change of participants. Once participants will aware the importance of&#xD;
      lifestyle change, obtain knowledge about the way of change, and intend to change, the&#xD;
      participants will change their lifestyles. Thus, we can measure these changes by actual&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To decrease level of blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure health status by Euro-5D-5L QOL questionnaire (Mobility, self-care, usual&#xD;
           activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To decrease dietary salt intake (Measured by food and urinary salinity test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure blood glucose level (Random Blood Sugar), Urinary Protein and glucose test&#xD;
           (In order to measure the complications)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Check the feasibility of mobile phone in hypertensive individuals by field testing&#xD;
           questionnaires which will be developed by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will only be initiated after it has been approved by the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB) of Bangladesh Medical and Research Council (BMRC) as well as collaborating institutes&#xD;
      in Bangladesh. Before enrolment, signed informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      participants. The consent form will be written in Bangla in a language and format that will&#xD;
      be easily understood by the study participants of even little education. The consent form&#xD;
      will be read out to the study participants. Signed consent or the left thumb impression will&#xD;
      be obtained from the participants for participation in the study. A copy of the signed&#xD;
      consent form will be given to the participant for their future questions and concerns. There&#xD;
      will be some personal questions (age, income, contact address) for household respondents in&#xD;
      the questionnaires. We will also collect blood and urine samples. So, there are some&#xD;
      precautions will be taken to address the risk. Firstly, field researchers will be careful to&#xD;
      emphasize the voluntary nature of engagement with the study and should ensure that&#xD;
      participants will confirm written consent during the interview. Secondly, the personal&#xD;
      questions will be asked in a calm and sensitive manner. Thirdly, during sample collection as&#xD;
      much as possible we will take higher protection. Finally, total anonymity across all stages&#xD;
      of the study will be maintained and access to raw data will be restricted to researchers only&#xD;
      and stored securely.&#xD;
