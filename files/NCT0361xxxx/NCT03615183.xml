  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the anti-retroviral activity of MK-8527 in HIV-1 infected, ART-naïve&#xD;
      participants. The primary hypothesis is that MK-8527 has superior anti-retroviral activity&#xD;
      compared to placebo, as measured by change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA) at 168 hours postdose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to five panels (Panels A-E) of 6 participants each will be enrolled in a sequential&#xD;
      manner. In each panel, participants will receive a single dose of MK-8527 up to 50 mg.&#xD;
      Historical data from previous single does studies will be used for placebo (control)&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples were taken to determine HIV-1 RNA levels at Predose (baseline) and 168 hours postdose. Data were fitted with a longitudinal data analysis (LDA) model containing fixed effects for treatment, time and treatment by time interaction, and a random effect for participant.The change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA in participants administered MK-8527 was calculated and results were compared with historical placebo data.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, regardless of whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal product. The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 AE will be summarized.</description>

        <title>Apparent Terminal Half Life (t1/2) of MK-8527 in Plasma</title>
        <description>Blood samples were taken at Predose, up to 168 hours postdose to determine the t1/2 of MK-8527 in plasma. Values were natural log transformed and analyzed based on a linear model containing a fixed effect for dose level. The 95% CI for the means were constructed on the natural log scale and referenced the t-distribution.</description>
        <time_frame>Predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose</time_frame>
        <population>Participants who comply with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that generated data will be likely to exhibit the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model. The 1 mg MK-8527 arm had insufficient data for four participants. Participants from Panels D and E were not analyzed because they were not enrolled in the study.</population>
