      Introduction A common problem in women after childbirth is bleeding (5-8 percent). This is&#xD;
      one of the leading causes of maternal death in Thailand. The incidence of postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage is approximately 1-2 percent of the births. A second problem is infection after&#xD;
      birth which is a leading cause of illness and death of the mother. Incidence of infection&#xD;
      after childbirth is 1-2 percent of women in developed countries and 5-10 percent of&#xD;
      postpartum women overall. Staphylococcus aureus bacterium is found in the reproductive system&#xD;
      of 5-9 percent of women. Perineal wound infections cause perineal pain. Thirdly is the&#xD;
      problem of insufficient milk in foreign countries, mothers breastfeeding for less than 12&#xD;
      months total 94.7 percent. The fourth problem is difficult urination after vaginal delivery&#xD;
      or 6 hours after removing the catheter in surgical cases. It is a common and important&#xD;
      problem from 1.7 to 17.9 percent. The above problem causes infection and inflammation pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 24 hours after birth to 6 weeks physical and physiological changes of maternal&#xD;
      organs and systems occurs such as the decline in hormone levels. This includes human&#xD;
      placental lactogen (HPL), human chorionic somatomammotropin (HCS), human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotropin (HCG), estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, follicular stimulating hormones,&#xD;
      luteinizing hormones. There is also blood loss. The clinical difficulties found in the&#xD;
      postpartum period include after pain, perineal pain, breast engorgement, puerperal diuresis,&#xD;
      weight loss, fever, pain and discomfort after birth. And the pain decreases or is lost in 3&#xD;
      days after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original gate-control theory proposed that there is a physiological within the substantia&#xD;
      gelatinosa of the spinal cord's dorsal horn grey matter. It is suggested that sensory signals&#xD;
      can only pass through the cells in the substantia gelatinosa when the gate is open. When the&#xD;
      gate is closed, sensory information is blocked, and this forms the basis of a kind of&#xD;
      physiological pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to the 4 basic life elements of earth, water, wind and fire, the maternal body is&#xD;
      lacking wind. This causes the fire to also decrease and the element of pain results. It&#xD;
      becomes important to restore balance by stimulating blood circulation and herbal treatment is&#xD;
      desirable to help the fire of the blood to speed the element of wind through the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thai Traditional Medicine is used to treat the pain of mothers after childbirth. Because of&#xD;
      in balance of mind fire in the body. By this reason, the balance of fire and wind increase to&#xD;
      spread the circulatory system. Medicinal plants can increase the element of fire and the&#xD;
      wind. Also, in Thai Traditional Medicine concept, pain reduction for postpartum mothers&#xD;
      includes regular massage, herbal steam, herbal breast compress, Tub Mhor Kluer, eating&#xD;
      heat-producing food. In the Thai Traditional Medicine manuscript, Kam-pee Mahachotharat there&#xD;
      are 85 remedies for blood treatment therapy and especially, 44 contain ginger. Representing&#xD;
      51.76 percent of then.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ginger has been included in the National Essential Medicines Catalogue 2554. Medication to&#xD;
      relieve heartburn, bloating and distension, is documented and prevention and relief of nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting due to motion sickness, seasickness. Or after surgery, are all included.&#xD;
