  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell transplant that impairs quality of life, and is associated with significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Management of chronic GVHD with prednisone is associated with an overall&#xD;
      response rate of approximately 60%, and a complete response rate of approximately 30% but&#xD;
      sclerotic features do not respond as well. Based on the biology of chronic GVHD and available&#xD;
      preliminary evidence, the investigators hypothesize that ruxolitinib will be effective in the&#xD;
      management of sclerotic chronic GVHD. The study is an open label, phase II multicenter trial&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of ruxolitinib as a salvage treatment for patients with&#xD;
      sclerotic GVHD (sclerosis or fasciitis). The primary objective is to determine the proportion&#xD;
      of patients with response rate (complete and partial responses) in skin and/or joint, as&#xD;
      determined by 2014 NIH (National Institutes of Health) consensus criteria, at 6 months of&#xD;
      therapy with ruxolitinib. Eligibility criteria includes adult patients with chronic GVHD and&#xD;
      skin, joint and/or fascia sclerosis, who have received systemic corticosteroids for &gt;12&#xD;
      months and at least one additional line of therapy OR systemic corticosteroids and at least&#xD;
      two additional lines of therapy for chronic GVHD. A sample size of 47 patients (43 evaluable&#xD;
      patients and estimated 10% dropout) will allow an α of 0.044 and a power of 84% to test the&#xD;
      null hypothesis response rate of 25% compared to an alternative of 45%. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      ruxolitinib for 6 months for the treatment of sclerotic chronic GVHD. Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated for GVHD status as well as non-relapse mortality, relapse of underlying malignancy&#xD;
      and quality of life/functional status. Plasma cytokine levels and T/Natural Killer (NK) cell&#xD;
      subset in peripheral blood will be measured at various time points. The response rate will be&#xD;
      reported as a proportion and 95% exact confidence interval. If positive, the trial results&#xD;
      will support other ongoing studies to establish the role of ruxolitinib in chronic GVHD in&#xD;
      general and specifically in sclerotic chronic GVHD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Sclerotic chronic GVHD (classic chronic or overlap syndrome) that meets 2014 NIH&#xD;
             Consensus Criteria. Eligible patients will have superficial or deep skin sclerosis,&#xD;
             fasciitis or joint contractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject must have received the following therapy for chronic GVHD (not necessarily&#xD;
             for sclerotic manifestations): A - Systemic corticosteroids for &gt;12 months and at&#xD;
             least one additional line of systemic therapy OR B - Systemic corticosteroids and at&#xD;
             least two additional lines of systemic therapy. For the purpose of this study,&#xD;
             fluticasone, azithromycin and montelukast (&quot;FAM&quot;) therapy for lung GVHD will be&#xD;
             considered a topical therapy. Investigators are encouraged but not mandated to use&#xD;
             ibrutinib for appropriate patients prior to enrollment in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adults, Age ≥18 years (state of Nebraska, Age ≥19 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Karnofsky performance status ≥60% at the time of enrollment&#xD;

          7. Able to take orally-administered medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patient of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test ≤7 days prior to starting the study drug. Women are considered NOT to have&#xD;
             reproductive potential if they have had 12 months of amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
             clinical profile (i.e. ≥51 years, history of vasomotor symptoms, OR supportive hormone&#xD;
             levels such as low estrogen and high follicle-stimulating hormone levels), OR surgical&#xD;
             sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male and female patients of reproductive potential must be willing to avoid pregnancy&#xD;
             or fathering children from enrollment to one month after the end of study treatment.&#xD;
             This will require either a total abstinence, OR exclusively non-heterosexual activity&#xD;
             (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject), OR two&#xD;
             methods of contraception (male or female condom with or without a spermicidal agent,&#xD;
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, or hormonal based contraception including&#xD;
             intrauterine device).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Life expectancy greater than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Fibrosis of internal organs such as gut, liver or lung as the sole manifestation of&#xD;
             sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Fluconazole at a dose more than 200 mg daily. Patients should stop fluconazole or&#xD;
             lower dose to less than or equal to 200 mg daily before starting ruxolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current evidence of malignancy after allogeneic transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy (PML)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or viral infection. Infections are&#xD;
             considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of&#xD;
             screening, no signs of infection progression are present. Progression of infection is&#xD;
             defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening&#xD;
             physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever&#xD;
             without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of known HIV infection, active hepatitis B or C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active tuberculosis infection that developed after allogeneic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
             transplant (HCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Total bilirubin 1.5 ´ the upper limit of the normal range&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min&#xD;

             arrhythmias, unstable angina or myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension (e.g.&#xD;
             blood pressure higher than 150/90 for patients 60 years or older, or higher than&#xD;
             140/90 for patients younger than 60 years, or those with diabetes and chronic kidney&#xD;
             disease), New York Heart Association class III/IV congestive heart failure, or&#xD;
             requirement of supplemental oxygen at rest or having a resting O2 saturation &lt;90% by&#xD;
             pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any other condition that is judged by the physician to potentially interfere with&#xD;
             compliance to the study protocol or pose a significant risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnancy, breastfeeding or planning to be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Exposure to Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK) inhibitor therapy for any indication after&#xD;
             allogeneic transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Initiation of a new systemic immunosuppressant for management of chronic GVHD within 8&#xD;
             weeks prior to enrollment. However, patients who develop disease progression can&#xD;
             enroll as early as 4 weeks after initiation of a new systemic immunosuppressant. Also,&#xD;
             patients who are unable to tolerate current therapy can enroll any time after&#xD;
             initiation of a new systemic immunosuppressant, as long as the &quot;new&quot; immunosuppressant&#xD;
             is stopped in these cases prior to initiation of ruxolitinib. Initiation of any new&#xD;
             topical therapy (including FAM or intra-oral narrow-band UVB phototherapy) and changes&#xD;
             in dose of existing immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, sirolimus,&#xD;
             calcineurin inhibitors or other agents are acceptable at any time prior to enrollment.&#xD;
             The use of immunosuppressants for short term period, for example 7 days, for&#xD;
             indications other than GVHD will be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Treatment with any other investigational agent, device, or procedure, within 21 days&#xD;
             (or 5 half-lives, whichever is greater)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study medications,&#xD;
             excipients, or similar compounds.&#xD;
