  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), early recognition of those with the&#xD;
      highest risk of death is of paramount importance. Since clinical judgment is sometimes&#xD;
      uncertain biomarkers could provide additional information likely to guide critical illness&#xD;
      management. We want to evaluate the prognostic value of leucocyte surface expression of CD64.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for CD64 biomarker measurement will be obtained daily during the patient's&#xD;
      hospitalization. The primary outcome was all-cause death at D28 after admission&#xD;

      Some local or systemic biological markers, using highly specialized techniques, have an&#xD;
      interest that remains quite marginal in routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of inflammation generally have elevated concentrations in circulating blood, but&#xD;
      these increases are not specific for prognosis. This is the case of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6...)[1, 2] and especially, so-called'acute phase' proteins such as&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin. It is now well established that the rise in the&#xD;
      CRP is totally non-specific. With regard to procalcitonin, the published data are far from&#xD;
      univocal[3-4], in particular because of the heterogeneity of the populations studied&#xD;
      (emergency services, medical services, intensive care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These conventional biological assays are therefore not very informative and less efficient&#xD;
      than the clinical-biological scores used in routine (SAPSII and SOFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative diagnostic approach relies on molecular changes in the cellular compartment of&#xD;
      innate immunity. Activation of neutrophil polymorphils (PNN) is the result of the&#xD;
      pro/anti-inflammatory cytokinic balance and hormonal cascades In other words, the degree of&#xD;
      activation of NNPs can be considered as the barometer of the intensity of any acute&#xD;
      inflammatory phenomenon. One of the most specific indicators of a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response is the increased expression of CD64, a high affinity receptor to the immunoglobulin&#xD;
      fragment Fcγ, on the surface of PNNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD64 expression elevation is induced in 4-6 hours by numerous cytokines (G-CSF, IFN- γ[5-7].&#xD;
      Given the very low basal expression level of CD64 (less than 2000 sites per cell) and its&#xD;
      rate of elevation in case of inflammation, its determination could prove interesting in&#xD;
      demonstrating the inflammatory response and its intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the measurement of CD64 expression has obvious advantages over other PNN&#xD;
      activation markers (such as CD11b, CD18, CD16, CD45RA or CD62L): negligible expression in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers; no influence of blood sample manipulation; stable expression for 36 hours&#xD;
      on anticoagulated blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other decisive advantage is the standardisation and automation of the measurement&#xD;
      (performed in flow cytometry) thanks to a device developed by the LeukoDx company, the&#xD;
      ACCELLIX-CD64. This measurement is performed in whole blood (30 to 50µL maximum), and the&#xD;
      measurement time is short (26 minutes), which makes it particularly attractive in the context&#xD;
      of emergency and resuscitation.&#xD;
