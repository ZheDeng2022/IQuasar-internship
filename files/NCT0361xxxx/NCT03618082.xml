  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of GOALDAN study is to demonstrate the superiority of a targeted&#xD;
      perioperative analgesic strategy by the ANI over the usual practice on the incidence of&#xD;
      immediate postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that a prophylactic administration of morphine in patients&#xD;
      with risk of postoperative pain determined by the ANI at the end of the intervention would&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of immediate postoperative pain and that the targeted analgesia to ANI&#xD;
      and minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane could improve the perioperative&#xD;
      hemodynamic, and the postoperative becoming.&#xD;

      Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will arrive in the department the day before the surgical intervention&#xD;
           (D-1). During this preoperative visit (D-1), the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  will preselect potentially eligible patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  will offer to participate to this study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  will give the notice form to the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  will present the research: objectives, benefits and constraints for the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  will check that patients understand the verbally administered Numeric Rating Scale&#xD;
                (NRS) for the assessment of the postoperative This verbally administered NRS is&#xD;
                routinely presented to all patients at a surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention day (D0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will collect the signed consent form after having ascertained the&#xD;
      understanding of the notice form by the patient and checking the inclusion and non-inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be done via the eCRF module (allocation group and number) and the&#xD;
      preoperative data registration in the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Surgical intervention (D0): All patients will receive a usual multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      associating level 1 analgesics (acetaminophen, ketoprofen, nefopam) or level 2 (tramadol)&#xD;
      administered 30 to 60 min before the foreseeable end of the surgical intervention. All&#xD;
      patients will receive 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of morphine within the 30 min preceding the end of the&#xD;
      surgical intervention according to the usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient transferred to the recovery room, the assessment of the primary outcome&#xD;
      (verbally administered NRS) will be done by the nurse responsible for the patient, when the&#xD;
      patient arrives, during the stay and when the patient leaves the recovery room. If the&#xD;
      verbally NRS &gt; 3, a morphine titration by IV administration of 2 to 3 mg of morphine will be&#xD;
      realised then the verbally NRS will be collected 5 min after, according to the usual&#xD;
      practice. This morphine titration will continued until the obtaining of a verbal NRS ≤ 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to this morphine titration, where possible, a peripheral nerve block may be&#xD;
      proposed to the patient and performed by the investigator to relieve the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is transferred directly in ICU without being extubated at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention and so without transiting by the recovery room, the patient will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
