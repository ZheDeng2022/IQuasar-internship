      duration of disappearance of pain after film application (hours), duration of complete&#xD;
      healing of the aphthous ulcer (weeks), onset of ulcer size reduction after film application&#xD;

      The present study have been performed on a total of 24 patients suffering from RAU, they were&#xD;
      divided into two groups each included 12 patients. The first group was treated by the&#xD;
      propolis mucoadhesive film and the second group received the film without the active&#xD;
      component (placebo group). Patients were recruited from the out-patient clinic of the Faculty&#xD;
      of Dentistry, British University in Egypt during a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were subjected to thorough clinical examination and history obtaining in order to&#xD;
      diagnose the oral ulcer by an oral medicine specialist, they were thoroughly informed about&#xD;
      the study and only those with the oral ulcer within the first day to the third day of&#xD;
      appearance were included in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria in the present study were the presence of systemic or local disease&#xD;
      such as hepatitis, cardiac conditions, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal problems,&#xD;
      mental disorders, AIDS and also the use of any immunosuppressive drugs or systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids during last three months or using steroid treatment locally in last month,&#xD;
      also any nutritional supplements, folic acid or antioxidants, pregnancy and nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were asked to avoid using antiseptics, antibiotics or analgesics, during the&#xD;
      study as they might aid in curing the oral ulcers. Patients were blinded of receiving either&#xD;
      propolis or placebo. They were warned about the potentiality of allergic responses that could&#xD;
      happen to some people and that in case of occurrence of such side effect immediate&#xD;
      termination of using the film should be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were first instructed how to apply the mucoadhesive film of 2 cm2 on the oral&#xD;
      ulcer and pasted by applying a light force with the finger tip for 20 s, and then were asked&#xD;
      to apply it two times per day and to refrain from eating for at least one hour after the film&#xD;
      application on the oral ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were handed a checklist for monitoring the actual improvement of the clinical&#xD;
      parameters which included; duration of disappearance of pain after film application (hours),&#xD;
      duration of complete healing of the aphthous ulcer (weeks), onset of ulcer size reduction&#xD;
      after film application (days), duration of propolis film adherence onto the oral mucosa&#xD;
      (hours) and finally the level of patient satisfaction scaled from 1-10. After total healing&#xD;
      of the oral RAU, checklists were recollected from patients, the results were tabulated and&#xD;
      statistical analysis were conducted.&#xD;
