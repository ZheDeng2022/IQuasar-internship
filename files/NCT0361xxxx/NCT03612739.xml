      This open-label Phase I study aims to define the recommended dose for further clinical&#xD;
      development the NKR-2 treatment administered concurrently with AZA in treatment-naïve AML/MDS&#xD;
      patients not candidates for intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I study is divided into three sequential cohorts evaluating three different&#xD;
      dose-levels of NKR-2 (1x108, 3x108 and 1x109 NKR-2 per injection) using a 3+3 design&#xD;
      evaluate. Further patients will be enrolled at the RecD to reach 9 evaluable patients in&#xD;
      total at the RecD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening phase, a treatment administration phase and a follow-up&#xD;
      phase divided into treatment follow-up (TFU) and long-term safety follow-up (LTSFU). For each&#xD;
      patient who received at least one NKR-2 administration, the overall study duration will be 15&#xD;
      years after first NKR-2 administration.&#xD;

        institutional practice, or all these.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The white blood cell-count should be &lt;15x109 cells/L prior to 1st infusion of NKR-2.&#xD;
