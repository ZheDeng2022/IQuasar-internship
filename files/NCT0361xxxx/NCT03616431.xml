  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study which aims to evaluate;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency in patients with pancreatic malignancies&#xD;
      (adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most appropriate diagnostic strategy. The impact that an adequate diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      may have on patients' outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will prospectively receive a full nutritional assessment, pancreatic enzyme&#xD;
      insufficiency (PEI) diagnosis and dietician education. This assessment will be performed as&#xD;
      an outpatient in parallel with the medical oncology team, by the research dietician. This&#xD;
      study will be performed in two steps (summarized in Figure 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step-1 | A prospective cross-sectional assessment of the prevalence of PEI-related symptoms&#xD;
      in up to n=150 patients with pancreatic malignancy (this will be termed 'the demographic&#xD;
      cohort'). A sub-set of these patients (n=50) will be tested to elucidate the most efficient&#xD;
      diagnostic panel for PEI in pancreatic malignancy (this will be termed 'the diagnosis&#xD;
      cohort').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step-2 | A prospective longitudinal validation of the diagnostic panel designed and tested in&#xD;
      Step-1 and evaluation of dietician intervention (including PERT) and its impact in weight&#xD;
      loss, symptom evolution, chemotherapy receiving rate, Quality of Life and overall survival&#xD;
      (this will be termed 'the follow-up cohort' and will include up to n=50 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in both steps will have a full nutritional assessment at baseline, and&#xD;
      PERT treatment (as per standard of care if considered appropriate). Patients in the follow-up&#xD;
      cohort will be reviewed (at least every 3 months for a maximum of 6 months since study entry)&#xD;
      by dietician for further intervention and assessment.&#xD;

    <description>A sub-set (up to n=50) of the Demographic cohort patients will be tested to elucidate the most efficient diagnostic panel for PEI in pancreatic malignancy.&#xD;
An extra assessment for PEI diagnosis consisting of a breath test (Pancreo-KIT breath test) will be carried out during the following 1-2 weeks after the first appointment (which takes around six hours to complete and involves the administration of bread spread with 13C butter followed by collection of the patient's breath in small plastic vials at timed intervals. The vials will subsequently be analyzed for 13C quantity; details in Appendix 6). Following these diagnostic tests, patients will complete an &quot;acceptability questionnaire&quot; to assess their opinion regarding the burden that these diagnostic tests may add.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pancreo-KIT breath test</intervention_name>
    <description>Pancreo-Kit (Isomed Pharma, Madrid, Spain) is a breath test devised to measure Pancreatic Enzyme Insufficiency. It is a non-invasive method to obtain information about the digestion of consumed lipids; this in turn is informative about the exocrine enzyme activity of the pancreas (specifically pancreatic lipase). This kit is manufactured to EC directive 98/79/EEC and carries the CE mark.&#xD;
The test is based on measurement of 13C which is a stable naturally occurring environmental isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing 6 protons and 7 neutrons (note, it is not radioactive).</description>
