      English Synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Title of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate and retained effects of three types of dual-task interventions on dual-task walking&#xD;
      performance of stroke patients: psychometric study and randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate psychometric properties of dual-task walking&#xD;
      assessments and compare effects of three types of dual-task balance interventions on&#xD;
      dual-task walking for stroke patients. Specifically, we will investigate psychometric&#xD;
      properties (i.e. reliability, validity, and responsiveness) of dual-task walking assessments&#xD;
      with various levels of difficulty for stroke individuals (Aim 1). The second aim of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the immediate and retained effects of combined motor and cognitive&#xD;
      dual-task training (MCDTT), motor dual-task training (MDTT), and cognitive dual-task training&#xD;
      (CDTT) on dual-task gait and cognitive performance after stroke (Aim 2). The third aim of&#xD;
      this study is to elucidate the changed CMI pattern of stroke patients after dual-task&#xD;
      interventions (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study Design A metric analysis and comparative efficacy research will be conducted at&#xD;
      medical center(s). Sixty ambulatory stroke patients will receive dual-task walking&#xD;
      assessments twice at pretreatment with a 1-week interval for test-retest assessment and&#xD;
      investigation of the reliability and validity of outcome measures. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure of the six dual-task walking assessments will include two types of walking conditions&#xD;
      (walking at preferred speed and fast speed) and simultaneously perform three cognitive tasks&#xD;
      (Serial Three Subtractions, Stroop, and Auditory Stroop tasks). These three cognitive tasks&#xD;
      represent different domains of cognitive function: working memory and executive function.&#xD;
      Concurrent validity will be studied to validate the dual-task walking measures with each&#xD;
      other and with the item 14 of the mini-Balance Evaluation Systems test (Mini-BESTest) and&#xD;
      dual-task Timed-up-and-Go test (dual-TUG) obtain concurrently for assessing dual-task&#xD;
      ability. In addition, we will compare dual-task walking performance between fallers and&#xD;
      non-fallers to examine discriminant validity of dual-task assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative efficacy research is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Sixty stroke&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to MCDTT or MDTT or CDTT. All three groups will receive dual-task&#xD;
      interventions at progressively increasing task difficulty 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      MCDTT group will undertake sitting to standing, standing balance, and treadmill walking&#xD;
      training while concurrently perform motor and cognitive tasks. The MDTT and the CDTT groups&#xD;
      will train the same set of sitting to standing, standing balance, and walking activities as&#xD;
      the MCDTT group while simultaneously performing only motor or cognitive task, respectively.&#xD;
      During each session, all participants will receive the instruction of a variable priority to&#xD;
      practice shifting attention between tasks by spending half of the training attention focus on&#xD;
      the balance task, and half focus on the secondary cognitive or motor tasks. A blinded&#xD;
      assessor will administer three assessments All participants will be examined gait and&#xD;
      cognitive performance under single-task (walking only, cognitive tasks only) and dual-task&#xD;
      conditions (walking while performing 3 cognitive tasks) at two baselines, post intervention,&#xD;
      and 1-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure of gait and cognition is gait speed and&#xD;
      composite score of accuracy and reaction time of the cognitive tasks under single- and&#xD;
      dual-task conditions. The secondary outcome measures will be the Berg Balance Scale,&#xD;
      Mini-BESTest, dual-TUG, Functional Gait Assessment, Activity-specific Balance Confidence&#xD;
      Scale, Chair Stand Test, Stroke Impact Scale, and Patient Global Impression of Change.&#xD;
      Repeated measure ANOVA will be used to compare measurements at baseline, after training, and&#xD;
      follow-up among the groups.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will walk 10m at their preferred speed and at fast speed. A 12-meter walkway will be used for walking testing. In order to allow the subjects to have enough distance to accelerate and decelerate, only the time taken to walk the middle 10 meters will be recorded by a stopwatch. The primary gait parameter is gait speed (cm/s) under dual-task walking conditions using the 10 Meter Walking Test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For all the cognitive tasks, we will calculate a composite score for cognitive-task performance by dividing the accuracy (% correct responses) with the reaction time of correct answers (milliseconds), which accounts for speed-accuracy tradeoffs in the overall dual-task effect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS).</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a 14-item scale quantitatively assesses both static and dynamic balance with psychometrically sound measure of balance impairment after stroke. The items are scored from 0 to 4, with a score of 0 representing independent item completion. Scores of the BBS range from 0 to 56, with higher scores suggest better balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest).</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-BESTest consists of 14 items and.includes four subscales: anticipatory postural adjustmentsl, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait. Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (0 = severe, 1=moderate, and 2 = normal), with a maximum score of 28 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test will be used as an index of dynamic balance of the elderly and stroke patients. At the signal, participants stand up, walk 3 m, turn, walk back, and sit down again. The score is the time to complete the test measured using a stopwatch. The TUG test will be administered under the single-task (preferred speed and maximum fast) and dual-task conditions (tray carrying and counting backward by 3s). In dual-task condition, participants will be asked to perform the TUG test while carrying a tray with glasses (dual-TUG manual) or counting backward by 3s (dual-TUG cognition). The instruction for dual-TUG tests is to walk with your comfortable speed and concurrently perform a secondary task (carry the tray in front of you with both hands without dropping glasses on the tray or counting backward by 3s).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment (FGA).</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The FGA is comprised of 10-item that contains 7 of 8 items (except walking around obstacles) from the Dynamic Gait Index and 3 additional tasks, including walking with a narrow base of support, walking with the eyes closed, and walking backward. Subjects' performance of each test item was rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), with the total score ranging between 0 and 30.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC will be used to determine fear of falling and self-reported confidence when performing 15 different daily activities, such as walking around the house, walking up and down stairs, and walking on slippery floors. A confidence rating scale ranges from 0% to 100%, with 0% indicating no confidence, and 100% indicating full confidence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chair Stand Test (CS).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Chair Stand Test measures lower extremity muscular strength.87 The participants will be instructed to stand from a seated on the chair position as much as possible for 30 seconds. The total number of stands was counted in 30 seconds. Timed five-chair stand (TCS) is the time measured using a stopwatch to complete five times of standing from sitting</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength of Lower-Extremity.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Handheld dynamometers (MicroFET2, Hoggan Health Industries Inc, West Jordan, Utah; Jamar Â® Plus+ hand dynamometer, Patterson MedicalÂ® Sammons PrestonÂ®) will be used to measure the maximum isometric strength of tibialis anterior and grip strength (averaged over three attempts and left and right limbs) using a standard protocol with high test-retest reliability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated regarding the participants' perception with the change in balance and gait related to the intervention. The PGIC is a transition scale that is a single question asking the patients to rate their balance/gait now, as compared with how it was prior to before beginning treatment on a scale from 1 (very much better ) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
