      Validation of modified HEART score as a rule-out criterion for MACE at 6 weeks: a 2 centre&#xD;
      prospective observational cohort with a direct comparison to TIMI, GRACE and high sensitive&#xD;
      troponin T at limits of detection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HEART score, as defined previously by Backus et al1, is a risk score specifically&#xD;
      developed for acute chest pain/ suspected acute coronary syndrome. The conventional scoring&#xD;
      system for the troponin component of HEART is as follows: Troponin &lt;99th percentile =0 (in&#xD;
      the case of Hstn T [Roche} 14ng/l, 99th percentile up to X3 URL (99th percentile)= 1 (HSTN T&#xD;
      =14-42ng/L, &gt;x3 URN =2 (HSTN T &gt;42ng/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously defined that the optimal rule-out strategy for suspected acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes may well be a modified HEART score in a single centre study. This study is to&#xD;
      prospectively validate the use of this score in a prospective unselected cohort of patients&#xD;
      with possible acute coronary syndrome at 2 large secondary care centres&#xD;

      The HEART score, as defined previously by Backus et al1, is a risk score specifically&#xD;
      developed for acute chest pain/ suspected acute coronary syndrome. The conventional scoring&#xD;

      =14-42ng/L, &gt;x3 URN =2 (HSTN T &gt;42ng/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators previously defined that the optimal rule-out strategy for suspected acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes may well be a modified HEART score in a single centre study. This study is&#xD;
      to prospectively validate the use of this score in a prospective unselected cohort of&#xD;
      patients with possible acute coronary syndrome at 2 large secondary care centres. The second&#xD;
      centre (Royal Liverpool University Hospital) was external to where the initial cohort of 1642&#xD;
      patients were assessed that defined modified HEART as the optimal score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified HEART score is as follows: HEART score can be re-calibrated (modified HEART) to&#xD;
      undetectable hstnT and 99th percentile limits (&lt;5= 0, â‰¥5-14=1, &gt;14=2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Troponin (HSTnT) Roche (elecsys) &gt;14ng/l 2 5-14ng/l 1 &lt;5ng/l 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 2 centre study will enrol consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      (defined as physician suspicion of ischaemic chest pain resulting in sampling of High&#xD;
      sensitive troponin and undertaking an electrocardiogram at presentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all troponin positive patients (HSTnT&gt;14ng/l) the diagnosis will be adjudicated centrally&#xD;
      with at least 2 'blinded' clinicians. The outcome will be MACE at 6 weeks. MACE will be&#xD;
      defined by acute myocardial infarction, urgent or emergency coronary revascularisation and&#xD;
      all cause death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations (provided by clinical trials, university of Liverpool):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of MACE events in the population with suspected ACS is 12.5% (as in MACROS) The&#xD;
      anticipated sensitivity is 0.98 The acceptable value for the 95% confidence interval for&#xD;
      sensitivity is 0.95 The power of the study is 80%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the number of events needed would be approximately 150. Thus 150/0.125 = 1200 suspected&#xD;
      ACS admission would need to be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been assessed by research boards at both hospitals and has been registered as&#xD;
      an audit, with the primary aim of quality control of a novel accelerated chest pain pathway&#xD;
      that has been recently implemented at both hospitals. The study does not require&#xD;
      individualised patient consent and is supported by the Caldicott Guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of the study are to compare the performance of modified HEART score with&#xD;
      modified TIMI &lt; or equal to 1 or 0 and modified GRACE score &lt; or equal to 75 in terms of rule&#xD;
      out for MACE at 6 weeks The investigators compare the 'performance' of modified HEART with&#xD;
      the use of undetectable HSTnT &lt;5ng/l (combined with a nonischaemic ECG). The latter is part&#xD;
      of the recently adopted chest pain pathway at both recruiting hospitals with clear guidance&#xD;
      of discharge at presentation for patients with chest pain who have an undetectable HSTnT and&#xD;
      nonischaemic ECG. Therefore it will allow the research team to compare modified HEART virtual&#xD;
      discharge with actual (rather than virtual) discharge for an approach based on undetectable&#xD;
      HSTnT.&#xD;
