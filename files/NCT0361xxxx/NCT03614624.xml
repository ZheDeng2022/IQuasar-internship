  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the C3S study is research an equivalence with longitudinal, radial and&#xD;
      circumferential, global and segmental strain value, in left Ventricular in 2 and 3 dimension&#xD;
      between two echograph General Electric Vivid 9 (GE Vingmed, Horton, Norway) et Philips Epiq&#xD;
      7.&#xD;

      Healthy volunteer will be inform about the study by email and press. They could join the&#xD;
      clinical research team by email and phone to ask more questions about the study. Then the&#xD;
      investigator, verify the eligibiliy of the volunteers and schedule an appointment for the&#xD;
      visit of inclusion. During this visit, the patient's consent will be collected. One&#xD;
      echocardiography will be complete on echograph General Electric Vivid 9 to collect the&#xD;
      clinical data necessary for the study and to eliminate the presence of criteria of&#xD;
      exclusions, the acquisition of the loops of ultrasound will be realized on both echographs by&#xD;
      a first investigator. A second investigator will make the post-treatment of the ultrasound&#xD;
      images on consoles ECHOPAC PC version 201, General Electric Medical System and Q Station&#xD;
      version 3.5, Philips Healthcare in two different times, to obtain the values of the various&#xD;
      strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, an clinical exam, an ECG, a questionnary will be realized.&#xD;
