  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an NCI-funded, randomized control pilot trial to evaluate: (1) the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of a web-based, personalized navigation tool (ConnectedCancerCare) and (2)&#xD;
      explore whether the tool improves delivery of team-based survivorship care for women who have&#xD;
      recently finished primary breast cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control pilot trial involving 60 women newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      early-stage breast cancer who are finishing primary treatment. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized either to the intervention arm (CCC website that provides information on&#xD;
      team-based follow-up care for both cancer surveillance and preventive care) or the control&#xD;
      arm (static online survivorship care plan template, adapted from the ASCO breast cancer&#xD;
      survivorship template). The feasibility and acceptability of the tool and correlations with&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes will be assessed 3 months following the completion of a baseline&#xD;
      survey via an online follow-up survey.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized control pilot trial of a web-based, personalized navigation tool to support the continuing and team-based care of early-stage breast cancer patients who have completed their primary cancer treatment. Patients will be randomized to either the intervention (n=30), a personalized website that guides team-based, survivorship care or to the control (n=30), an static online survivorship care plan.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomized to the intervention (website) or control (informational template) after completing an online questionnaire; they will not be informed of which arm of the study they are participating.

    <measure>Number of Breast Cancer Patients Successfully Recruited to Participate in the Study</measure>

    <description>We anticipate a response rate of 80% enrollment (n=60). We will assess the number of patients successfully recruited who enroll and complete the baseline survey.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rating the Experience With the CCC Web-based, Survivorship Care Plan</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-Up Survey: 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability and usability assessed by the following 6 key factors: 1. Ease of use; 2. Helpful during the transition to survivorship; 3. Helpful in terms of planning when to see my PCP and when to see my Oncologist; 4.&quot;Would recommend CCC to other patients&quot;; 5. Length of time it took to go through the website; 6. Amount of information on the website. Each of the 6 factors will be assessed using a 5-point (1-5) Likert scale with higher scores (3, 4, 5) representing better acceptance and usability of the CCC website. Based on prior work, a cut off of 50% or more reporting a score of 3 or higher will be used to measure acceptance within each domain. The average of each participant's responses to the 6 items will result in one score per participant, on a scale of 1 - 5. A single summary score of acceptability across all participants will be determined by averaging the individual scores. On a scale of 1-5, a score of 3 or higher indicates acceptability to the majority of participants.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Reporting a Preference for an Oncologist vs. PCP for Their Continuing Cancer Care Services</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>An 8 item list of continuing care services adapted from the CanSORT Provider Roles Scale (iCanCare Study) is used to assess participants' preferences for seeing their Oncologist or PCP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Scheduling a Primary Care Physician (PCP) Appointment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients who have scheduled a follow-up visit with their PCP after viewing the CCC web tool (intervention arm) or after receiving the static survivorship care plan (control arm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Satisfaction With Oncologist/PCP Coordination of Care</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-point scale will be used to ask patients to rate their satisfaction with the coordination of care provided by their Oncologist and PCP. The rating scale will range from a value of 1 ('not at all') to a value of 5 ('extremely satisfied'), with a higher numeric value representing greater satisfaction with coordination of care. The mean satisfaction scores will be compared between the intervention and control arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients That Communicated With PCP About Provider Roles</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Communication with PCP about provider roles was measured using an item adapted to the patient perspective from a prior study of providers' views about shared cancer care roles. Patients were asked if they communicated in the past 3 months with their PCP about who will manage specific aspects of their survivorship care (yes/no).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge About Team-based Survivorship Care</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge about team-based survivorship care was measured utilizing an 8-item scale adapted from the Perceived Primary Care Delivery of Survivorship Care Scale. It includes items specific to patients' knowledge of PCPs roles in team-based care delivery, (e.g. second cancer screening, symptom management). The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The responses to the 8 items were then averaged to create a mean knowledge summary score for each participant, ranging from 1 to 5, with higher values representing greater knowledge about team-based survivorship care.</description>

    <description>The intervention, ConnectedCancerCare (CCC) Website is a personalized, navigation tool that is tailored to patients' preferences for provider roles in follow-up care, their satisfaction with their current primary care provider, and their worry about cancer recurrence. It involves a personalized, patient-facing website which includes a baseline survey, tailored educational modules, and a guide for their survivorship care, as well as a text or email based reminder system. The intervention also includes a provider-facing summary document, which will be faxed to both the oncology and primary care teams.</description>

        <title>Rating the Experience With the CCC Web-based, Survivorship Care Plan</title>
        <description>Acceptability and usability assessed by the following 6 key factors: 1. Ease of use; 2. Helpful during the transition to survivorship; 3. Helpful in terms of planning when to see my PCP and when to see my Oncologist; 4.&quot;Would recommend CCC to other patients&quot;; 5. Length of time it took to go through the website; 6. Amount of information on the website. Each of the 6 factors will be assessed using a 5-point (1-5) Likert scale with higher scores (3, 4, 5) representing better acceptance and usability of the CCC website. Based on prior work, a cut off of 50% or more reporting a score of 3 or higher will be used to measure acceptance within each domain. The average of each participant's responses to the 6 items will result in one score per participant, on a scale of 1 - 5. A single summary score of acceptability across all participants will be determined by averaging the individual scores. On a scale of 1-5, a score of 3 or higher indicates acceptability to the majority of participants.</description>

        <description>Knowledge about team-based survivorship care was measured utilizing an 8-item scale adapted from the Perceived Primary Care Delivery of Survivorship Care Scale. It includes items specific to patients' knowledge of PCPs roles in team-based care delivery, (e.g. second cancer screening, symptom management). The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The responses to the 8 items were then averaged to create a mean knowledge summary score for each participant, ranging from 1 to 5, with higher values representing greater knowledge about team-based survivorship care.</description>
