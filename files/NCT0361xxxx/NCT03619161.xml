      Purpose: Evaluate the impact of cleaning the bathroom environment on the severity of eczema.&#xD;
      Determine if part of the efficacy of bleach baths may be in cleaning the bathroom. Record&#xD;
      data on the process in order to improve future interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients and families with eczema&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain baseline eczema severity scores and bacterial cultures from bathtubs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomize subjects to receive (1) a bathtub culture alone; (2) a culture and bathroom&#xD;
           cleaning; and (3) a culture, cleaning, and bleach baths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure changes in eczema severity scores over 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitatively evaluate the process by participants and investigators&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of two interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the start of the study, two-thirds of the patients (40 patients) will be randomized&#xD;
           to have a culture taken from their bathtub with subsequent cleaning of all of their&#xD;
           bathrooms (intervention arm) versus one-third (20 patients) only obtaining a culture&#xD;
           taken from their bathtub with no cleaning (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After cleansing the bathrooms in the intervention arm, this group will be randomized&#xD;
           again so that half of this group (20 patients) receives instructions on performing twice&#xD;
           weekly bleach baths and the other half (20 patients) does not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When the intervention period ends at 4 weeks, the placebo arm will be offered a bathroom&#xD;
           cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four quantitative assessment phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Upon entry into the study the investigators will obtain basic demographic information&#xD;
           (insurer, age, race/ethnicity), a history of skin infections and allergic diseases, an&#xD;
           eczema severity score (POEM score), an eczema area and severity index score (EASI&#xD;
           score), and record the participant's level of eczema therapy (weak-moderate topical&#xD;
           steroids, strong topical steroids, or systemic immunomodulators).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will obtain a culture from the bathtub used by every study subject.&#xD;
           This will be prior to cleaning the bathroom if the participant is in the cleaning&#xD;
           intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will obtain a POEM score over the phone 1 week after obtaining the&#xD;
           cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After 4 weeks, the investigators will obtain a POEM score over the phone as well as&#xD;
           document whether the participant received any antibiotics or had any visits to medical&#xD;
           providers for atopy flares over the last 4 weeks. The investigators will also re-record&#xD;
           the participant's level of eczema therapy (weak-moderate topical steroids, strong&#xD;
           topical steroids, or systemic immunomodulators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one qualitative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study team will keep field notes documenting perceptions and experiences&#xD;
      during the cleaning process. These qualitative documents will be used for process evaluation&#xD;
      to improve home hygiene interventions and studies. Domains that the investigators will assess&#xD;
      in field notes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Environment: The general appearance of the exterior of the home and neighborhood,&#xD;
           cleanliness and order within the home and bathrooms, the hospitality and dynamics of&#xD;
           interacting with the family. The investigators will also take pictures of the bathroom&#xD;
           before and after each cleansing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Work difficulty: Description of activities performed and any physical, mental, and&#xD;
           emotional toil related to the labor with suggestions for improving the work experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of usefulness to the family: Did the family find the intervention useful? Did&#xD;
           the family mention ways to make the cleaning intervention better? If given bleach bath&#xD;
           instructions, did the family appear receptive and willing to do bleach baths? Did it&#xD;
           appear that the family would clean their bathroom regularly after the intervention?&#xD;
