      The purpose of the study is to Evaluate the Effect of Ticagrelor versus Placebo in Reducing&#xD;
      the Rate of Vaso-Occlusive Crises in Paediatric Patients with Sickle Cell Disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hestia3 will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ticagrelor versus placebo in&#xD;
      children with SCD during treatment for at least 12 months and up to approximately 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The target population are children aged ≥2 to &lt;18 years of age and body weight of ≥12 kg&#xD;
           diagnosed with HbSS or HbS/β0 confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography or&#xD;
           hemoglobin electrophoresis. At least 50 evaluable patients should be recruited in each&#xD;
           of the age groups, ≥2 years to &lt;12 years and ≥12 years to &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To be eligible for the study, patients must have experienced at least 2 VOCs (defined as&#xD;
           painful crisis and/or ACS) events in the past 12 months prior to Visit 1, indicating&#xD;
           that the severity of the patient's disease justifies preventive chronic long-term&#xD;
           treatment. The intent is to enroll only children aged 2 years or above, since VOCs&#xD;
           become more frequent with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants should receive standard of care for SCD, adjusted to the individual&#xD;
           patient at the discretion of the investigator, including routine health care screening&#xD;
           examinations and immunizations according to local guidelines and health care&#xD;
           programmers. Study drug will be given on the background of standard treatments for SCD.&#xD;
           Study participants are not withheld from any other treatments that may be used in SCD&#xD;
           (eg., hydroxyurea) during the trial, which is important considering the use of a placebo&#xD;
           control group. However, restrictions apply to some medications and interventions that&#xD;
           may be necessary for the patient's health and well-being during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are to be followed up to 24 months or until a common study end date is reached&#xD;
           defined as 12 months after the last patient is randomised. The expected average&#xD;
           follow-up is 18 months. Considering inclusion of patients with at least 2 VOC events in&#xD;
           the past year, this treatment duration is considered long enough to evaluate effects on&#xD;
           VOC events as well as to capture safety and tolerability data supporting a potential&#xD;
           future long term use of ticagrelor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Due to ticagrelor mechanism of action and the potential to reduce symptoms caused by&#xD;
           ischemia during a vaso-occlusion, a composite endpoint with painful crises and/or ACS&#xD;
           has been selected for the primary endpoint. Painful crisis is the most common reason for&#xD;
           emergency department visits for patients with SCD with a significant impact on young&#xD;
           patients' lives, affecting them physically and emotionally. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
           included to broaden the understanding of effects in patients with SCD and to also assess&#xD;
           potential benefits on symptomatic disease burden and health-related quality of life&#xD;
           (HRQL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with 15, 30 and 45 mg bd or matching placebo, depending on body&#xD;
           weight.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any study specific procedures&#xD;
             not part of standard medical care (local regulations and international guidelines are&#xD;
             to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female paediatric patients aged ≥2 to &lt;18 years and body weight of ≥12 kg (at&#xD;
             Visit 1), diagnosed with HbSS or HbS/β0 as confirmed by high-performance liquid&#xD;
             chromatography or haemoglobin electrophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Diagnosis of SCD (if not confirmed prior to screening and records available on&#xD;
             the medical file) should be confirmed for HbSS or HbS/β0 by high-performance liquid&#xD;
             chromatography or haemoglobin electrophoresis, performed at the site's local lab, in&#xD;
             order to confirm the type of mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have experienced at least 2 VOCs (painful crisis and/or ACS) as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator in the past 12 months prior to Visit 1. These VOCs need to be documented&#xD;
             in the patient's medical records or in other documents that can be reconciled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If ≤16 years old, must have had transcranial Doppler (TCD) within the past year prior&#xD;
             to Visit 1. If this is not the case, a TCD examination must be done before proceeding&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If ≥10 years old, must have had an ophthalmological examination within the past year&#xD;
             prior to Visit 1. If this is not the case, the patient must be examined by an&#xD;
             ophthalmologist before proceeding in the study. If local guidelines dictate&#xD;
             ophthalmological examination at younger ages, those local guidelines should be&#xD;
             followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If treated with hydroxyurea, the weight-adjusted dose must be stable for 3 months&#xD;
             before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Suitable venous access for the study-related blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior to dosing on day of randomisation (Visit 2), a negative urine (dipstick)&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Females of childbearing potential (after menarche) must not become pregnant during&#xD;
             study. Sexually active females must use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             which results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year). If use of effective&#xD;
             contraception cannot be secured in sexually active females, the patient cannot be&#xD;
             included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (ischaemic or&#xD;
             haemorrhagic), severe head trauma, intracranial haemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm,&#xD;
             arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or proliferative retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Findings on TCD: Current or previous values for time averaged mean of the maximum&#xD;
             velocity (TAMMV) that are Conditional or Abnormal. Patients with Conditional TAMMV&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>This Phase III study was conducted in pediatric participants with sickle cell disease (SCD) at 53 sites in 16 countries (Kenya, India, Uganda, Egypt, Lebanon, Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania, United Kingdom, Turkey, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Brazil and United States) between 26 September 2018 and 13 August 2020.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Pediatric participants who experienced at least two vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) events in the past 12 months prior to screening and who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were enrolled. Participants randomized to ticagrelor received doses based on weight band (at randomization): ≥12 to ≤24 kilogram (kg)=15 milligram (mg), &gt;24 to ≤48 kg=30 mg, &gt;48 kg=45 mg. A total of 193 participants were randomized in this study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Health-Related Quality of Life Total Score Using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Sickle Cell Disease Module</title>
        <description>The PedsQL SCD module instrument developed using a 5-point Likert scale (where 0= never and 4= almost always) for the participant self-report forms for ages ≥5 to &lt;8 years, ≥8 to &lt;13 years, and ≥13 to ≤18 years and the caregiver proxy-report form specific for ≥2 to &lt;5 years was used. The PedsQL SCD module measures problems in the following categories:&#xD;
Pain: 3 sub-scales&#xD;
Worry: 2 sub-scales&#xD;
Emotions: 1 sub-scale&#xD;
Treatment: 1 sub-scale&#xD;
Communication: 2 sub-scales&#xD;
Total score PedsQL SCD module items were reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale (0= 100, 1= 75, 2= 50, 3= 25, 4= 0) so that higher scores indicate better quality of life. To create the PedsQL SCD module total score (43/42/40 items - depending on version completed) the arithmetic mean of the transformed scores was computed as the sum of the items transformed scores divided by the number of items answered. Baseline values are the closest observation prior to and including the randomization visit.</description>

        <title>Fatigue Total Score Using Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Multidimensional Fatigue Scale</title>
        <description>The PedsQL multidimensional fatigue scale instrument developed using a 5-point Likert scale (where 0= never and 4= almost always) for the participant self-report forms for ages ≥5 to &lt;8 years, ≥8 to &lt;13 years, and ≥13 to ≤18 years and the caregiver proxy-report form specific for ≥2 to &lt;5 years was used. The PedsQL multidimensional fatigue scale measures problems in the following categories:&#xD;
General (6 items)&#xD;
Sleep/rest (6 items)&#xD;
Cognitive fatigue (6 items)&#xD;
Total score (18 items) PedsQL multidimensional fatigue scale items were reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale (0= 100, 1= 75, 2= 50, 3= 25, 4= 0) so that higher scores indicate better quality of life. To create the PedsQL multidimensional fatigue scale total score (18 items), the arithmetic mean of the transformed scores was computed as the sum of the items transformed scores divided by the number of items answered. Baseline values are closest observation prior to and including randomization visit.</description>

        <description>The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale is caregiver-reported and used to assess pain daily during the VOC event for those participants &lt;5 years of age as determined at randomization. Each of the 5 behaviours observed are assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2. The total FLACC score ranges between 0 and 10, with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 representing &quot;very much pain&quot;. Lower score indicate better outcome. Worst pain ratings were collected once daily throughout the duration of the VOC event using an eDevice.</description>

        <description>The FHS method was used for all participants taking the study treatment who are ≥5 years of age. The FHS consists of 5 faces with descriptions ranging from &quot;Dislike very much&quot; to &quot;Like very much&quot;. The face with description &quot;Like very much&quot; was considered as positive outcome. The way in which the study treatment was taken, that is, whether the tablet is whole or dispersed, was captured.</description>

        <population>The Safety Analysis Set included all participants who received at least 1 single dose of randomized study treatment, ticagrelor or placebo, and for whom any post-dose data were available. Only participants ≥5 years of age who completed the assessment for study treatment palatability are reported.</population>
