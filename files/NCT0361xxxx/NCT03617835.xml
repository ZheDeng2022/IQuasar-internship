    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI&#xD;
      655130 administered as two subcutaneous injections in the left and right periumbilical region&#xD;
      compared to a single subcutaneous periumbilical injection of BI 655130.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to investigate the relative bioavailability of a single&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of BI 655130 into the thigh compared to a single subcutaneous&#xD;
      periumbilical injection of BI 655130.&#xD;
