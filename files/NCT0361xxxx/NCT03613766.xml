    <textblock>
      Background: Weight reduction, especially of visceral fat in patients awaiting bariatric&#xD;
      surgery (BS), may facilitate the surgical process, and reduce postoperative complications.&#xD;
      Normally, to achieve weight reductions a nutritional treatment is prescribed, but the effects&#xD;
      of exercise on these patients have been little studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To know the effects of an exercise program on body composition and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors in patients awaiting BS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty-three patients awaiting BS were divided into two groups: a) an experimental&#xD;
      group (EG, n = 12); b) a control group (CG, n = 11). Both groups received the usual care&#xD;
      prior to surgery, but the EG also performed a 12-week exercise program in which endurance and&#xD;
      resistance training were combined. Body composition, anthropometric measures, cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors, physical fitness, basal metabolic rate and quality of life were assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the presurgical protocol for BS at two University Hospitals were&#xD;
      recruited while awaiting surgery. Each patient participated in an initial interview, during&#xD;
      which all the aspects of the program were carefully explained, and a written informed consent&#xD;
      was obtained. After that, the individual's medical history was checked looking for the&#xD;
      presence of the following exclusion criteria: a) cardiovascular diseases; b) severe&#xD;
      functional limitations; c) chronic respiratory diseases; or d) being undergoing another&#xD;
      exercise program at the time of the study. Finally, twenty-three participants were&#xD;
      diachronically enrolled in the intervention at 3 to 6 months before the expected date of&#xD;
      surgery. The patients were assigned to the experimental group (EG) or to the control group&#xD;
      (CG) in chronological order of recruitment: the first 12 patients were included in the EG,&#xD;
      and the other 11 patients in the CG. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics&#xD;
      committee and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups followed the usual presurgical care of their respective hospitals (psychological&#xD;
      and nutritional counseling). In addition, the EG performed a 12-week monitored and supervised&#xD;
      CEP, while the CG only received advice to follow an active lifestyle. Both groups were&#xD;
      assessed at the start (T1) and the end of the study, after 12 weeks (T2). At each assessment&#xD;
      session, body composition, anthropometric measures, physical fitness, cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      (CVR) and CVR factors, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and health-related quality of life were&#xD;
      measured in a laboratory under controlled conditions (temperature 22-24º; relative air&#xD;
      humidity 45-60%). Blood samples from each patient were taken and analyzed in their respective&#xD;
      hospitals at the same timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent exercise program (CEP) The CEP was divided into three 4-week blocks, for a total&#xD;
      duration of 12 weeks. In the first-block endurance training (ET) (performed on a&#xD;
      cycle-ergometer, arm-ergometer, elliptical and treadmill) and resistance training (RT)&#xD;
      (performed in resistance machines for 5 muscle groups: hamstrings, pectorals, quadriceps,&#xD;
      latissimus dorsi, and gastrocnemius) were combined in the same session. During the&#xD;
      second-block, patients performed 3 sessions per week. One day, only ET was performed. In the&#xD;
      other 2 sessions, patients performed a High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer or an arm-ergometer followed by 7 resistance exercises (biceps and triceps brachii&#xD;
      were added to the previous 5 major muscle groups trained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third-block, patients trained 4 days a week. Two days a week, HIIT and RT were&#xD;
      combined in the same session. RT was performed after HIIT. It consisted in training 4&#xD;
      different major muscle groups in each session (pectorals, quadriceps, biceps, and hamstrings&#xD;
      in the first session, and latissimus dorsi, triceps, gastrocnemius and deltoids in the second&#xD;
      session). In the other two sessions, only ET was carried out. In all the blocks, 2 days a&#xD;
      week of flexibility training were carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of the ET was monitored using a heart rate (HR) monitor (FT40, Polar, Finland),&#xD;
      while the intensity of the RT was determined by percentages of 1 maximum repetition, which&#xD;
      was estimated using the Brzycki formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIIT performed consisted of a 5-minute warm-up, followed by the main part of 20 minutes&#xD;
      with bouts of 30 seconds at high intensity (60-80% VO2peak) and 30 seconds of active recovery&#xD;
      (40% VO2peak), for a total of 10 minutes of training at high intensity. Once the main part&#xD;
      was finished, 3 minutes of cool-down at 40% VO2peak were performed. The rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE) was taken of each session using the CR-10 Borg's scale in order to control the&#xD;
      progression of training loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry and body composition. These measures were performed between 7:30 and 8:30 A.M.,&#xD;
      after 10-12 hours overnight fast, with an empty bladder. Exercise was forbidden in the 72&#xD;
      hours before the test, as well as the consumption of caffeine or alcohol in the 24 hours&#xD;
      before the test. Waist and hip circumference and height were measured using the ISAK&#xD;
      (International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry) protocol. Total weight and&#xD;
      body composition were measured by bioimpedance analysis (Tanita BC-420MA, Tanita, Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan). Body mass index was calculated, and expressed as kg·m-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory fitness. A protocol in cycle ergometer (Technogym Bike Med, Technogym,&#xD;
      Gambettola, Italy) adapted Achten was used to determine the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak)&#xD;
      using an Oxycon Pro gas analysis system (Jaeger, Friedberg, Germany). This protocol consisted&#xD;
      of two phases. In the first phase, patients performed a 4 -minutes warm-up at 40 watts (W),&#xD;
      followed by increases of 20 W every 3 minutes, maintaining a cadence of 60 rotations per&#xD;
      minute (RPM), until the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) reached 1.0. At this point the&#xD;
      second phase started, which consisted of increments of 20 w each minute, maintaining a&#xD;
      cadence between 70-80 RPM, until volitional fatigue. The average of the highest 30 seconds of&#xD;
      VO2 was used to calculate VO2peak. The VO2peak was expressed in absolute values (VO2peak abs)&#xD;
      and normalized to total body weight (VO2peak/BW) and fat- free mass (VO2peak/FFM). Subjects&#xD;
      with musculoskeletal disorders on the leg performed the same test in an arm-ergometer but&#xD;
      initiated at 20W with increases of 10 W (Technogym, Excite®+Top MD Inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength Dynamic and isometric strength of the quadriceps, hamstrings, biceps and&#xD;
      triceps brachii were assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 4; Biodex&#xD;
      Medical Systems, New York, USA). First, patients performed a 5-minute warm-up on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer at an intensity of 60% of individual HRmax. Next, participants were stabilized on&#xD;
      the dynamometer chair (seat back angle ~ 85º) with two shoulder straps and a thigh strap. The&#xD;
      anatomical axis of rotation was aligned to the dynamometer axis to allow movement in the&#xD;
      sagittal plane for the knee and in the transversal plane for the elbow. For each limb, 3&#xD;
      unipodal tests were performed, 1 isokinetic test and 2 isometric tests. A two-minutes rest&#xD;
      was conducted between tests and 3 minutes between limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic strength measurement (MDS): Participants performed 4 sets of 4 concentric&#xD;
      contractions (flexion-extension) of the upper (elbow) and lower body (knee), at an angular&#xD;
      speed of 60º/s, with 90 s rest between repetitions. The knee and elbow motion ranges were&#xD;
      within 105° to 10° and within 160° to 60°, respectively. The first series was a submaximal&#xD;
      familiarization trial. In the following three sets, participants were verbally encouraged to&#xD;
      perform and maintain maximal effort in every contraction. The peak torque (N·m) of each set&#xD;
      was analyzed and the average of the last three sets was calculated. Additionally, the peak&#xD;
      torque was normalized to the individual's body weight (MDSBW) and relative to FFM (MDSFFM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isometric strength measurement (MIS): Participants completed a submaximal repetition followed&#xD;
      by 3 maximum voluntary contraction (15 s rest between repetitions), during which they were&#xD;
      verbally encouraged to perform a maximal effort for 5 s, following the recommendations of&#xD;
      previous research .(40). The angles used for assessing quadriceps and hamstrings were of 105º&#xD;
      and 75º, respectively, and triceps and biceps brachii were of 75º and 120º, respectively. As&#xD;
      there was one set per exercise, the peak torque (N·m) was analyzed and normalized to the body&#xD;
      weight (MISBW) and individual's FFM (MISFFM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal metabolic rate BMR was calculated by indirect calorimetry, using an Oxycon Pro gas&#xD;
      analysis system (Jaeger, Friedberg, Germany). The patients were 30 minutes in supine position&#xD;
      in a comfortable bed. To perform the analysis, only the data from the last 10 minutes of the&#xD;
      assessment were used. BMR was determined according to the Weir formula and, was normalized to&#xD;
      BW (BMRBW) and to FFM (BMRFFM). BMR was measured at the same times and under the same ambient&#xD;
      conditions that anthropometry and body composition measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk factors. Blood samples were taken at the University Hospitals, after 12&#xD;
      hours overnight fast. Patients were instructed not to perform exercise 48 hours before the&#xD;
      test. Standard methods were used to measure total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C),&#xD;
      glucose, HbA1C, and triglycerides (TG). Friedwald equation was used for calculating LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-C) (42). Blood pressure was measured according to established&#xD;
      recommendations, using a digital sphygmomanometer (Microlife WatchBP Home, Heerbrugg,&#xD;
      Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Framingham cardiac risk score adapted to the Spanish context was used to calculate CVR. This&#xD;
      formula, uses the TC, HDL-C, blood pressure values, sex, age, diabetic and/or smoking status,&#xD;
      to calculate the 10-year coronary risk. In some subjects of the CG, this formula could not be&#xD;
      applied, since they were less than 35 years old, thus, CVR was also determined by the&#xD;
      waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR) and by the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life. The Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) in its version&#xD;
      adapted to the Spanish context was used to determine health related to the life quality of&#xD;
      the patients. Physical and mental health are measured by 8 scales, the scores of which are&#xD;
      transformed to values between 0-100 points, indicating the highest scores a better function.&#xD;
      These 8 scales are grouped into two summary components (physical and mental) (49), which were&#xD;
      calculated according to the reference values of the Spanish population (50), with a mean of&#xD;
      50 and standard deviation of 10.&#xD;
