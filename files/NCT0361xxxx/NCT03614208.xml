  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an uncommon chronic rheumatic disease with an unknown cause and&#xD;
      unpredictable course. The inability, in addition to easy fatigability, starts a vicious&#xD;
      circle that leads to a fast deterioration of physical conditions that cause a reduction of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise capacity and, consequently, of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;
      Aerobic exercise has already been shown to be safe and effective in improving exercise&#xD;
      capacity and HRQoL of patients with chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. However,&#xD;
      few studies have evaluated the role of specific exercise programs on the muscular impairment&#xD;
      in SSc. Nevertheless, the results obtained in preliminary reports are promising, and, for&#xD;
      these reasons, the management of muscular impairment in SSc could include an appropriate&#xD;
      rehabilitation program besides pharmaceutical and surgical treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate the effect of an individualized exercise&#xD;
      program performed at home on aerobic capacity evaluated by 6 minutes walking test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims will be to evaluate: 1- VO2max, measured by cardiopulmonary test; 2- the&#xD;
      effect of the same program on the muscular strength of upper and lower limbs; 3- the efficacy&#xD;
      of a self-administered stretching program for finger joint motion. Secondary aims will be&#xD;
      also 1-to ascertain whether a comprehensive exercise program may affect, besides physical&#xD;
      function, HRQoL; 2- and to evaluate the adherence during two periods of three months, one&#xD;
      whit and one without supervision and reinforcement by a phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients with a diagnosis of SSc, according to the criteria of American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology (ACR), who attended the Rheumatologic outpatient clinic of our institution will&#xD;
      be evaluated in order to participate in the rehabilitation program. The pneumological&#xD;
      examination and two days of screening and testing will take place at the outpatient's clinic&#xD;
      of Respiratory Medicine and Sport of our institution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled, six months parallel group study. The flow chart of the&#xD;
      study is reported in table 1. Participants initially will undergo 2 days of screening and&#xD;
      testing. During the first visit patients will sign an informed consent, will undergo clinical&#xD;
      assessment, pulmonary function testing, measurement of anthropometric data and body&#xD;
      composition by bioimpedentiometry. They will perform a graded exercise test on a&#xD;
      cycloergometer and will complete questionnaires to assess HRQoL (short form-36, SF-36) and&#xD;
      functional abilities (health assessment questionnaire disability index, HAQ-DI). During the&#xD;
      second visit, the participants will carry out the hand mobility in scleroderma test (HAMIS),&#xD;
      six minutes walking test (6MWT), will undergo measurements of quadriceps and biceps strength,&#xD;
      and handgrip test. After completion of testing and screening, patients who will meet the&#xD;
      selection criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two groups 1) home-care rehabilitation&#xD;
      group (HCRG); 2) control group (CG). The first group will begin a six months program of&#xD;
      exercise training. The patients of the second group will be given generic recommendations to&#xD;
      increase physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the first group, during a session in our outpatient clinic, will be&#xD;
      instructed by a physiotherapist how to perform the physical exercise program at home. In&#xD;
      particular, they will learn how to use the stationary bike and how to perform the exercises&#xD;
      for upper limbs. Furthermore, the patient of the first group will be instructed how to fill&#xD;
      in a card in which they will record the exercises performed daily. Throughout the first three&#xD;
      months of the training period, the patients received a phone call from a physiotherapist once&#xD;
      monthly, during which the adherence to exercise program will be reinforced. Particularly, it&#xD;
      will be asked about the adherence to and the acceptance of exercise program, and the presence&#xD;
      of side effects. Also, the control group will receive a phone call with the same schedule,&#xD;
      but only in order to evaluate health status and to give a general recommendation about the&#xD;
      positive effect of the aerobic exercise. From the third to the sixth month, both groups will&#xD;
      not receive a monthly call, in order to evaluate the adherence to the program in the absence&#xD;
      of supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 and 6 months, the subjects will undergo a complete 2 days of testing, using the same&#xD;
      schedule described for a baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise program consists of aerobic exercise on a stationary bike, muscular endurance&#xD;
      training of the upper limb and stretching exercises for finger joint motion. The exercise on&#xD;
      the stationary bike and muscular endurance training will be performed on alternate days,&#xD;
      three times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stationary cycle (Energetics ct220p, Neomark Sarl, Luxembourg) will be given to each&#xD;
      patient for lower limb training. Each session will consist of three phases. In the first one,&#xD;
      the patient will pedal for 5 minutes without inserting the brake. In the second phase, the&#xD;
      patient will be instructed to set the brake at a load equal to 60% of the watts achieved at&#xD;
      the peak of the maximal ergocycle exercise test. This phase consists in two periods of&#xD;
      fifteen minutes divided by recovery interval of three minutes. It will be followed by five&#xD;
      minutes of cool-down without load. The frequency of pedalling will be about 60 rotation/min&#xD;
      during the second phase and less than 50 during the other phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For upper limbs training the patients will perform ten repetitions for three times that&#xD;
      consists in lifting and lowering repeatedly a weight from the waist to the shoulders,&#xD;
      alternating periods of exercise and three minutes of rest. The load will be calculated as the&#xD;
      60% of predicted 1-RM. Warm up and stretching of upper limbs, shoulders and neck will be&#xD;
      performed before and after each exercise session respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first two weeks, for both types of exercises of the program, the load will be reduced&#xD;
      by 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For finger stretching to the patients will be given written and illustrated instructions on&#xD;
      self-administered exercises, and will be directed to perform it every day, both in the&#xD;
      morning and in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the rehabilitation period, the patients will report each day on a diary for each type&#xD;
      of exercise whether the tasks were complete, partially or not executed which corresponds a&#xD;
      score of 1, 0.5, 0 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attendance rate at the training session will be calculated by the ratio between the&#xD;
      amount of the score obtained from the diary and the scheduled sessions multiplied for 100.&#xD;
