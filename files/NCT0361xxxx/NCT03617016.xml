  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of domperidone in treatment of&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia (FD) in Chinese participants and identify sub-populations (subtype of&#xD;
      the disease) who are sensitive to domperidone treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Response Rate Based on Overall Treatment Effect (OTE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with overall symptoms extremely improved or improved will be considered as responders. Response rate of OTE is defined as the percentage (%) of responders in total participants.</description>

    <measure>Response Rate Based on OTE</measure>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Each Average Symptom Score Decreased at least 2 Points Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 to Day 7 and Day 8 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants on every need will rate the severity of functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms (postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, epigastric burning, belching, epigastric bloating, nausea and vomiting) on a Likert scale of 7-point using e-diaries, the score range is 1 to 7. The higher the score, the more serious the outcome is.. For each FD symptom, the percentage of participants with each average symptom score (average of Day 1 through Day 7 and Day 8 through Day 14) decreased at least 2 points compared to baseline will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Frequency of Each FD Symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 7 and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Participants on every need will rate the severity of functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms (postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, epigastric burning, belching, epigastric bloating, nausea and vomiting) on a Likert scale of 7-point using e-diaries, the score range is 1 to 7. The higher the score, the more serious the outcome is.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Disease-SpeciÔ¨Åc Quality of Life (QoL) in FD as Assessed by Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>QoL will be assessed by using the NDI questionnaire. The NDI is a reliable and valid measure of quality of life in FD. The NDI originally contains 42 items designed to measure impairment of a subjective ability engaged in relevant aspects of their life because of dyspepsia. The score range is 0 to 100. The higher the score, the more serious the outcome is.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must meet the diagnostic criteria for functional dyspepsia (Postprandial Distress&#xD;
             Syndrome [PDS] and/or Epigastric Pain Syndrome [EPS]) according to Rome IV diagnostic&#xD;
             criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders before and through screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have had an upper endoscopy that shows no evidence of structural change that is&#xD;
             likely to explain the dyspepsia symptoms. If the participant has had the upper&#xD;
             endoscopy performed within 3 months before screening, no re-test is needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have an abdominal ultrasonography that shows no evidence of organic disease that&#xD;
             is likely to explain the dyspepsia symptoms. If the participant has the abdominal&#xD;
             ultrasonography performed within 3 months before screening, no re-test is needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) pregnancy test at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted&#xD;
             reproduction during the study and for 30 days after receiving the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,&#xD;
             and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are&#xD;
             abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study&#xD;
             population. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents&#xD;
             and signed by the investigator. Specifically, for vital signs, the participant must&#xD;
             have blood pressure (after participant has been supine for 10 minutes) between 90 and&#xD;
             140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic (inclusive) and between 60 and 90 mmHg&#xD;
             diastolic (inclusive)&#xD;

             syndrome, long QT syndrome, sudden unexplained death at a young age (less than or&#xD;
             equal to [&lt;=] 40 years); or a history of second- or third-degree heart block&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has clinically significant electrolyte disorders or conditions that result in&#xD;
             electrolyte disorders, such as severe dehydration, vomiting, malnutrition, eating&#xD;
             disorders, renal diseases, or the use of potassium-wasting diuretics or insulin in&#xD;
             acute settings&#xD;
&#xD;

             antibiotics), and other drugs that affect gastrointestinal function, QT-prolonging&#xD;
             drugs, cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),&#xD;
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, aspirin (including low-dose aspirin),&#xD;
