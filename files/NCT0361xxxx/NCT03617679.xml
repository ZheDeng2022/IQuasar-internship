  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of Rucaparib as maintenance therapy for&#xD;
      metastatic and recurrent endometrial cancer, after 1-2 prior lines of therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial, that administers a maintenance treatment after first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy is complete. It is designed to have a 1:1 randomization technique. Half the&#xD;
      participants who enter the study will receive the active ingredient, Rucaparib, while the&#xD;
      other half will receive a placebo. Treatment will be until progression with follow up until&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
