  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, which include&#xD;
      abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure. MS is considered a&#xD;
      serious problem to health systems due to a current inability on implementing an effective&#xD;
      prevention and treatment program. In Mexico 73% of adult population suffers obesity or&#xD;
      overweight, this condition triggers the best studied pathophysiological mechanism; insulin&#xD;
      resistance, which in turn precedes the diagnosis of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, that&#xD;
      are the main cause of general mortality in Mexico, thus the prevention and timely treatment&#xD;
      of this condition are now a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual pharmacological therapy is designed to control its components individually, however,&#xD;
      there are great interest in developing new therapeutic lines that improve more than one&#xD;
      component simultaneously and thereby increase the cost-benefit and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      therapy. Fucoxanthin is a functional element present in seaweed species. Several studies have&#xD;
      offered certain perspectives on its action mechanism and safety. The information available is&#xD;
      favorable for weight control in overweight subjects, but its activity in glucose levels,&#xD;
      lipid metabolism and blood pressure is inconsistent. It represents a natural option with&#xD;
      great interest in this research, since it could be a new, safe and effective therapy in the&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of fucoxanthin on the components of the MS,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. The investigators hypothesis is that Fucoxanthin&#xD;
      modifies the components of the MS, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial will be conducted in 28&#xD;
      patients with MS according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, men and&#xD;
      women, ages 30 to 60. Participants will be assigned randomly into two groups of 14&#xD;
      individuals each. Patients will receive a capsule with Fucoxanthin 12 mg or homologated&#xD;
      placebo once a day during 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, serum triglycerides, serum HDL cholesterol and&#xD;
      blood pressure will be evaluated before and after intervention in both groups. First phase of&#xD;
      insulin secretion (Stumvoll index), total insulin secretion (Insulinogenic index) and Insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (Matsuda index) will be calculated from the concentration of glucose and insulin&#xD;
      obtained from an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion( mean and standard deviation) for quantitative variables and frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages for qualitative variables. The qualitative variables will be analyzed through the&#xD;
      X2 or Fisher's exact test. The intra-group analysis of the quantitative variables will be&#xD;
      carried out by means of the Wilcoxon rank test, while the inter-group analysis with the U&#xD;
      test of Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis. Statistical significance will be considered with a&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol was approved by a local ethics committee and written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all volunteers&#xD;
