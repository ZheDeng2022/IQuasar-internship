  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption&#xD;
      in adult patients with a first presentation of a glioblastoma (GBM) following a maximal safe&#xD;
      surgical resection and standard chemo-radiation with temozolomide (TMZ) protocol and ready&#xD;
      for the maintenance phase of the Stupp protocol with TMZ.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, single-arm study to establish the safety, feasibility,&#xD;
      and effectiveness of BBB disruption along the periphery of the tumor resection cavity using&#xD;
      the ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2 (220 kHz) system and DEFINITY ultrasound contrast in&#xD;
      patients with GBM. Adult patients with a first time diagnosis of GBM, whom have undergone&#xD;
      maximal safe surgical resection and have safely completed the initial phase of concurrent&#xD;
      chemo-radiation therapy, will be recruited for this study. Twenty patients will undergo up to&#xD;
      6 treatments with FUS coincident with their standard TMZ cycles.&#xD;
