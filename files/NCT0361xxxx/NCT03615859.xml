  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to compare healthy volunteers with three groups of patients with&#xD;
      adrenal insufficiency and a final group of patients receiving high dose steroids for&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory purposes. The study will collect data on all 5 groups with the intention of&#xD;
      identifying any novel markers or immunological indicators which may be used clinically to&#xD;
      gauge the adequacy of steroid replacement treatment in patients with adrenal insufficiency.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoid replacement in adrenal insufficiency poses a significant challenge. If given&#xD;
      too much, patients risk long term complications including diabetes, osteoporosis and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. If, however they are given too little, patients can feel tired,&#xD;
      unwell and may collapse as there is insufficient steroid hormone to cope with stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no single objective marker or outcome that can be measured to ascertain&#xD;
      whether a patient is receiving optimum glucocorticoid replacement therapy. This study will&#xD;
      investigate a selection of markers to examine whether they can be used to as indicators to&#xD;
      gauge the adequacy of therapy. Finding an appropriate marker could unlock better care and&#xD;
      outcomes for our patients with adrenal insufficiency .&#xD;
