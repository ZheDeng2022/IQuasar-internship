  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in order to determine the safety, dose-limiting toxicities, and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of cabozantinib in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including tumors of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be treated in an open-label, non-randomized phase I trial to determine the&#xD;
      safety, dose-limiting toxicities, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
      combined with 13-cis-retinoic acid in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible Participants must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor at time of initial&#xD;
      diagnosis, and have either progressive, recurrent, or refractory disease. Cabozantinib will&#xD;
      be given orally once every day with cycles repeated every 4 weeks (28 days, +/- 3 days), with&#xD;
      no rest periods between cycles, combined with 13-cis-retinoic acid at 80mg/m2/dose twice&#xD;
      daily for two consecutive weeks (14 days) out of every four weeks (28 days, +/- 3 days).&#xD;
      Participants with disease response or stable disease at the end of each cycle will be allowed&#xD;
      to continue treatment, and patients may continue to receive therapy until there is evidence&#xD;
      of clinical or radiographic disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will perform a phase I trial to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      cabozantinib in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid using the standard 3+3 study design.&#xD;
      Cohorts of patients will be enrolled at doses determined as detailed below. The first cycle&#xD;
      will be used to determine the dose-limiting toxicities. Toxicity will be summarized by dose&#xD;
      levels. Response rates will be estimated. Kaplan-Meier curves will be plotted to graphically&#xD;
      present time to progression (PFS) and other time-to-event endpoints. Median PFS and the&#xD;
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib dosing will be started and modified, if necessary, during the course of the&#xD;
      trial as detailed below. The tablet formulation of the drug will be used with doses in 20mg&#xD;
      increments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation to determine eligibility will include medical history (including a review&#xD;
      of current medications), physical examination, blood count with differential, chemistry panel&#xD;
      blood or urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (not post-menopausal for&#xD;
      at least 12 months and not surgically sterile), echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
      disease evaluation (appropriate for disease). Samples for correlative studies will be&#xD;
      collected accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated weekly (+/- three days) during the first cycle. The interim&#xD;
      evaluations will consist of interval history (with a review of current medications), physical&#xD;
      examination, blood count with differential, and chemistry panel. Pregnancy tests will be&#xD;
      performed prior to each cycle in women of childbearing potential. After the first cycle,&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated monthly (+/- seven days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have had therapy discontinued will undergo end-of-therapy evaluations and&#xD;
      will continue to be monitored with interval histories, physical examinations, and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations every three months (+/- seven days), with disease evaluations every three months&#xD;
      (+/- 28 days) until they fulfill criteria for removal from study or the study is completed&#xD;
