  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of a new probiotic strain Lactobacillus salivarius PS7 on Acute Otitis&#xD;
      Media (AOM) in children with recurrent AOM history. The study duration will be 7 months,&#xD;
      which includes a 6-month product administration and a 1-month follow-up period. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized assigned to one of the three study groups: the control group; a 3 months&#xD;
      probiotic +3 months placebo consumption group and a 6 months probiotic consumption group. The&#xD;
      efficacy of the probiotic strain to reduce the incidence of AOM episodes will be assessed by&#xD;
      counting AOM episodes occurring in study participants, during the entire intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up periods, by bilateral comparison of each of the treatment groups with the control&#xD;
      group according to the following hypothesis: &quot;The number of AOM episodes occurring in&#xD;
      participants who take the probiotic is the same as that for the participants in the control&#xD;
      group. λc = λe&quot;. Where λc is the mean incidence of AOM in the control group and λe is the&#xD;
      mean incidence of AOM in the groups taking the probiotic strain Lactobacillus salivarius PS7&#xD;
      obtained with 95% confidence interval.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The parent or legal guardian of the minors will be contacted during a visit to the&#xD;
      pediatrician for suspected AOM to request their participation in the study, which will be&#xD;
      voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visits will take place at the primary care center or hospital. During Visit 1, the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified, and the informed consent will be signed.&#xD;
      Information will be collected on the demographic profile, characteristics of the AOM episode&#xD;
      and the prescribed treatment; and the participants will be randomized. The investigator will&#xD;
      give the parent or guardian the product corresponding to the first treatment period (3&#xD;
      months) and will explain how to administer it to the child, as well as when the next visits&#xD;
      will take place and what they will entail. Instructions will be given to start the&#xD;
      administration of the product as soon as possible after the collection of the first stool&#xD;
      sample. A sample will be collected from the outer ear most affected by the AOM using a&#xD;
      sterile swab (Day 0). The investigator will go over, with the parent or legal guardian, the&#xD;
      details of the diary to be completed (Annex II), how to record the data on product&#xD;
      administration, fever episodes, days of school or daycare missed, unscheduled visits to the&#xD;
      pediatrician, as well as data related to the frequency and characteristics of the stools in&#xD;
      the event of AOM episodes and/or antibiotic treatment. The investigator will inform the&#xD;
      parent or legal guardian that, during the child's participation in the study, the child&#xD;
      cannot take any probiotic supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Visit 2, a sample will be taken from the same ear as in the previous visit using a&#xD;
      sterile swab. Any questions regarding completing the diary will be discussed. The leftover&#xD;
      product from the first treatment period will be collected and the study product corresponding&#xD;
      to the second supplement administration period will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the third visit (Visit 3, after 6 months of product administration), a sample will be&#xD;
      collected from the same ear as in previous visits using a sterile swab. Any leftover product&#xD;
      from the second treatment period will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the fourth visit (Visit 4, after 1 month of observation), a sample will be collected&#xD;
      from the same ear as in previous visits using a sterile swab. The completed diary will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the duration of the child's participation in the study (7 months), additional&#xD;
      visits to the pediatrician (study investigator) may take place. If an episode of AOM, otitis&#xD;
      externa or respiratory tract infection occurs during the intervention period, the&#xD;
      investigator will make a diagnosis and will start the necessary treatment. In the course of&#xD;
      new AOM episodes, during the intervention period, the administration of the product will not&#xD;
      be interrupted. If the AOM episode occurs during the observation period, the investigator&#xD;
      will proceed according to his/her routine practice. At the additional visits taking place,&#xD;
      relevant data will be collected on the possible Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Events (SAEs), as well as on the concomitant medication.&#xD;
