  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to show that a computer can analyze brain waves and&#xD;
      that those brain waves can be used to control an external device. This study will also show&#xD;
      whether passive movement of the affected hand as a result of brain-based control can cause&#xD;
      rehabilitation from the effects of a stroke. Additionally, this study will show how&#xD;
      rehabilitation with a brain-controlled device may affect the function and organization of the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is the most common neurological disorder in the US with 795,000 strokes per year&#xD;
      (Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). Of survivors, 15-30% are permanently disabled and 20% require&#xD;
      institutional care (Mackay et al. 2004; Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). In survivors over age 65,&#xD;
      50% had hemiparesis, 30% were unable to walk without assistance, and 26% received&#xD;
      institutional care six months post stroke (Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). These deficits are&#xD;
      significant, as recovery is completed after three months (Duncan et al. 1992; Jorgensen et&#xD;
      al. 1995). This large patient population with decreased quality of life fuels the need to&#xD;
      develop novel methods for improving functional rehabilitation. We propose that signals from&#xD;
      the unaffected hemisphere can be used to develop a novel Brain-Computer interface (BCI)&#xD;
      system that can facilitate functional improvement or recovery. This can be accomplished by&#xD;
      using signals recorded from the brain as a control signal for a robotic hand orthotic to&#xD;
      improve motor function, or by strengthening functional pathways through neural plasticity.&#xD;
      Neural activity from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemiparetic limb would provide&#xD;
      a BCI control in stroke survivors lesions that prevent perilesional mechanisms of motor&#xD;
      recovery. The development of BCI systems for functional recovery in the affected limb in&#xD;
      stroke survivors will be significant because they will provide a path for improving quality&#xD;
      of life for chronic stroke survivors who would otherwise have permanent loss of function.&#xD;
      Initially, the study will serve to determine the feasibility of using EEG signals from the&#xD;
      non-lesioned hemisphere to control a robotic hand orthotic. The study will then determine if&#xD;
      a brain-computer interface system can be used to impact rehabilitation, and how it may impact&#xD;
      brain function. The system consists of a research approved EEG headset, the robotic hand&#xD;
      orthotic, and a commercial tablet. The orthotic will be made, configured, and maintained by&#xD;
      Neurolutions. Each participant will complete as many training sessions as the participant&#xD;
      requires, during which a visual cue will be shown to the participant to vividly imagine&#xD;
      moving their impaired upper extremity to control the opening and closing of the orthotic.&#xD;
      Participants may also be asked to complete brain scans using magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI).&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to show that a computer can analyze brain waves and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Stroke is the most common neurological disorder in the U.S. with 795,000 strokes per year&#xD;
      (Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). Of survivors, 77% experience weakness of loss of motor function in&#xD;
      the upper limb (Lawrence et al, 2001). Motor recovery in post-acute stroke patients is&#xD;
      complicated by an apparent plateau in the ability to achieve recovery beyond 3 months after&#xD;
      stroke (Duncan et al. 1992; Jorgensen et al. 1995; Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). The large&#xD;
      patient population with decreased quality of life and requiring significant medical resource&#xD;
      fuels the urgent need to develop novel methods for improving functional rehabilitation in&#xD;
      chronic stroke survivors. We propose that cortical signals from the unaffected hemisphere of&#xD;
      chronic stroke survivors can be used to control Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system to&#xD;
      facilitate functional recovery. The development of such rehabilitative BCI systems is&#xD;
      significant because it provides a path to functional recovery currently unavailable to many&#xD;
      chronic stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from patient populations of collaborators and colleagues of&#xD;
      the principal investigator, as well as from previous research studies of the principal&#xD;
      investigator and colleagues. Participants from previous research studies will also be&#xD;
      recruited. Colleagues will provide study information to interested candidates, and candidates&#xD;
      will contact the research team if they will to be screened by study staff. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked a series of screening questions to determine their eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will screen participants for eligibility after completing the informed consent&#xD;
      process and documentation. After screening for study eligibility, the participant will be&#xD;
      assigned to group 1 or group 2. Group 1 participants will complete the study with the&#xD;
      addition of functional MRI imaging (fMRI) and a range of motion (ROM) home exercise program&#xD;
      appropriate for the patient as determined by a clinical specialist. Group 1 participants will&#xD;
      undergo 12 weeks each of device use and the home exercise program. Half of the participants&#xD;
      will use the device before the ROM program, and half afterwards (i.e. a crossover design).&#xD;
      Neuroimaging scans will take place immediately prior to device use, immediately prior to&#xD;
      beginning ROM therapy, and at study completion. Group 2 participants participate in the study&#xD;
      with no imaging. Following eligibility screening, participants will be placed into Group 1 or&#xD;
      2 based on ability and willingness to participate in MRI scans. The study will be run in two&#xD;
      phases. In Phase 1, each participant will complete up to 3 sessions for recording EEG&#xD;
      signals. For recording, patients will wear a research grade EEG headset with EEG electrodes&#xD;
      in place. The signals will be recorded with brain computer interface software. If the&#xD;
      participant's EEG signals are adequate for controlling a BCI mediated hand orthosis, they&#xD;
      will continue onto phase 2 of this study. Phase 2 of this study, participants will be issued&#xD;
      a BCI mediated hand orthotic and be advised to use the device daily at home (5 out of 7&#xD;
      consecutive days) for a minimum of 12 weeks. The participant will have motor assessments at 4&#xD;
      weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks of device use. Group 1 patients follow the same schedule for ROM&#xD;
      therapy and continued motor function assessments. Should the participant be achieving&#xD;
      progress as evidenced by motor assessments at 12 weeks of device use, the participant may be&#xD;
      asked to continue to utilize this therapy daily at home until progress plateau's. Should this&#xD;
      occur, participants would have motor assessments completed every 4 weeks of additional device&#xD;
      use (beyond the minimum 12 weeks). Participants may be contacted to complete a motor&#xD;
      screening 6 months post device use to assess durability of motor recovery of the affected&#xD;
      upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - EEG Signal Assessment Participants will complete two EEG screening visits to find a&#xD;
      consistent EEG signal to control the robotic hand orthosis. Participants may be asked to&#xD;
      complete a third EEG screening if a consistent signal could not be identified in the first&#xD;
      two EEG screenings. During EEG screenings, participants will wear an EEG headset with a&#xD;
      subset of the standard 10-20 system of electrode coordinates. Proper connection will be&#xD;
      verified using signal inspection. A 7.5 minute set of resting data will be recorded.&#xD;
      Secondly, a motor imagery task will be completed in which participants will receive visual&#xD;
      cues/prompts on a computer screen to imagine finger tapping movements of the left hand, right&#xD;
      hand, or both hands for a period of 5-10 seconds per cue. Screening data will be analyzed to&#xD;
      ensure that sufficient cortical signals are present for device control. Spectral power&#xD;
      changes in the unaffected hemisphere will be analyzed using an r-squared analysis.&#xD;
      Participants must exhibit significant power changes at electrode locations of the motor and&#xD;
      pre-motor cortical areas to achieve device control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will obtain structural, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI)&#xD;
      from the patients in this study. Structural images are acquired using T1- and T2-weighted&#xD;
      scans. DTI scans will be acquired with b-values of 300, 1000 and 2000 s/mm² and 8, 32, and 60&#xD;
      diffusion directions. Tract-specific measurements, such as volume, radial diffusivity, and&#xD;
      fractional anisotropy (FA) will be obtained from the DTI data. We will collect approximately&#xD;
      22.5 minutes of rs-fMRI (3 scans at 7.5 minutes each). The data will undergo a standard&#xD;
      preprocessing stream including spatial smoothing, temporal band pass filtering and removal by&#xD;
      regression of sources of spurious variance. Data will be volume-censored to avoid&#xD;
      motion-induced artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - BCI Therapy &amp; Motor Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing EEG screenings, participants in Group 1 and Group 2 will complete two sets&#xD;
      of motor assessments in-office on two separate days to establish a baseline. These&#xD;
      assessments to be completed are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UEFM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motricity Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Ashworth Scale (Elbow Flexion, Wrist Flexion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gross Grasp Hand Dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a device and trained in its use and care by a clinical specialist&#xD;
      following the initial motor assessments. At each follow-up motor assessment visit, the&#xD;
      clinical specialist will have the participant bring their device in each follow up. The&#xD;
      clinical specialist will download all data stored on the device, address any questions or&#xD;
      concerns, modify the fit of the, and modify the home exercise program as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the final motor assessment visit, participants will be asked to complete a final EEG&#xD;
      screen identical to the baseline EEG screen in order to study robust changes in cortical&#xD;
      activity that may have occurred during BCI rehabilitation. The participant will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete a patient experience survey as it relates to user experience of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reimbursed for their participation in the study. EEG screenings and motor&#xD;
      evaluations will be reimbursed at a rate of $25.00 each. MRI scans will be reimbursed at a&#xD;
      rate of $50.00 each. Patients who complete the study on protocol will receive a bonus $50.00&#xD;
      incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk / Safety Information (Device Use):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likely: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less Likely: Fatigue from repetitive computer tasks and/or frustration. Eyestrain and fatigue&#xD;
      could result from prolonged attempts, watching the computer screen throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare: Minor discomfort associated with muscle stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research staff member will be available while the subject is participating in any portion&#xD;
      of the research study. During experimentation, patient will be reminded that they may stop&#xD;
      the study at any time and they can delay or terminate any sessions if they are experiencing&#xD;
      discomfort. The battery power of the EEG headset is very low and thus presents no risk. The&#xD;
      robotic hand orthosis will be operated to move the participants hand within their physiologic&#xD;
      range of motion and will not exert forces great enough to physically harm the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, participation is voluntary, and the individual may choose to terminate at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk / Safety Information (MRI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likely: Mild - Fatigue, Discomfort from lying in the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less Likely: Mild - Feeling of claustrophobia. Discomfort from loud noise of the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare: Life Threatening - Injury from metal object in the body. There is substantial risk to&#xD;
      persons who have metallic objects inside their bodies, since the MRI scanner uses a high&#xD;
      strength magnet. Examples of these include surgical staples left in the body following&#xD;
      surgery, middle ear prostheses or cochlear implants, permanent eye liner, metal foreign&#xD;
      objects lodged inside the eye, heart pacemakers, and pins inside the knees or other joints.&#xD;
      If patients have any kind of metallic object in their body not been tested for MRI safety,&#xD;
      they may not participate in the MRI portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Oversight:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to participate in this study is voluntary. The participant may choose to not&#xD;
      participate or may withdraw from the study for any reason without penalty or loss of benefits&#xD;
      to which are otherwise entitles and without any effect on future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator or the sponsor can stop one's participation at any time without&#xD;
      the participant's consent for any reason. Some reasons may include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it appears to be medically harmful to the participant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant fails to follow directions for participating in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it is discovered that the participant does not meet the study requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study is canceled; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For administrative reasons, including competitive enrollment - the target number of&#xD;
           subjects has entered the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor / principal investigator of the study will provide oversight throughout the&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis / Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed with multiple techniques, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple mathematical algorithms will be used to translate raw analog electrocortical&#xD;
           activity into a statistically significant signal profile. These would include such&#xD;
           approaches as the autoregressive analysis, fast fourier transforms, analysis of&#xD;
           variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) technique, Cross Correlation Signal Technique,&#xD;
           Etc. These methods would primarily be used for offline analysis of signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In phase 2, tests of motor function (UEFM, Motricity Index, Modified Ashworth, grasp&#xD;
           strength, during use of the device, and post using the device will be used to test the&#xD;
           impact of the device on the rehabilitative effects of upper extremity function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In phase 2, changes in functional connectivity patterns before and after treatment will&#xD;
           be assessed using statistical analysis as follows: construction of regions of interest&#xD;
           (ROI); ROI will be used as &quot;seeds&quot; to create ROI to whole brain voxel-wise correlation&#xD;
           maps; correlation map statistical methodologies (analyses that treat participants as a&#xD;
           random effect to test for group effects in the Fischer-z transformed correlation maps,&#xD;
           and resulting group maps corrected for multiple comparisons using previously computed&#xD;
           Monte-Carlo simulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UEFM will serve as the primary measure of statistical success. Because we will use&#xD;
      baseline tests before treatment begins, we will use a repeated measures test, such as paired&#xD;
      t-test assuming a normal distribution of scores. The Upper Extremity portion of the UEFM&#xD;
      assess grasp motor function in the affected upper extremity. The key statistical outcome will&#xD;
      be based on the subtest grasp as the device has the greatest potential impact on this domain.&#xD;
      Power estimates suggest that 10 subjects will be sufficient for significant results in a&#xD;
      paired T-test; up to 20 patients will be enrolled to allow for attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical and experimental data will be de-identified by being assigned a randomly&#xD;
      generated code. Additionally, all traceable data from copied medical records will also be&#xD;
      removed. Paper records will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked office suite. Electronic&#xD;
      records will be stored on a lab computer in a password-protected file. Only study team&#xD;
      members will have access to records. After the research project is completed, the principal&#xD;
      investigator will delete all electronic files and shred any paper forms containing&#xD;
      identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team may discuss the study with the participant in person or by&#xD;
      phone to describe the study to the patient and determine if they are willing to participate.&#xD;
      However, the patient will be consented in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a functioning and clinically feasible method&#xD;
      for restoring function to motor impaired stroke survivors. In developing a new rehabilitation&#xD;
      method, we hope to create a system that allows for closed loop feedback through a robotic&#xD;
      hand orthosis on the motor impaired side of stroke patients in response to intended movements&#xD;
      of the muscles. The method, if successful would represent a non-invasive method of promoting&#xD;
      motor learning and recovery in stroke survivors.&#xD;
