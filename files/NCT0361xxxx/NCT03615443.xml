  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor derived cell free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly used in the clinic to obtain genotype&#xD;
      information about lung cancer, but its concordance with concurrent tumor-derived sequenced&#xD;
      data is not known. The purpose of the trial is to determine the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      cfDNA-based vs. tumor tissue-based genotyping as it pertains to the detection of National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended biomarkers in first line, treatment naive,&#xD;
      non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of subjects for whom a genetic alteration is found in at least one of seven genes (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, ERBB2, RET) by testing tumor tissue will be compared to the proportion of subjects for whom a genetic alteration is found in at least one of the same genes by testing cfDNA.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity, Specificity, and Diagnostic Accuracy of Non-NCCN Biomarkers on the Guardant360 Panel</measure>
    <time_frame>34 months</time_frame>
    <description>This objective applies to genes included in the Guardant360 panel other than EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, ERBB2, RET and to subjects for whom both cfDNA and tumor tissue testing results are available. Diagnostic accuracy will include calculations for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value comparing tissue to cfDNA results and vice versa.</description>

    <time_frame>34 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among subjects with tumor genetic alterations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, ERBB2, or RET, the proportion with new (compared to baseline) genetic alterations in cfDNA at the time of disease progression following treatment with a therapy targeting the specific genetic alteration.</description>

             collected within 12 months prior to enrollment), (2) Metastatic (Stage IV, Stage IIIB&#xD;
             when curative intent is not an option, or relapsed/recurrent disease after original&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment (targeted therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, etc.), (2)&#xD;
             Resection of a metastatic lesion if the resected metastasis had been the only site of&#xD;
