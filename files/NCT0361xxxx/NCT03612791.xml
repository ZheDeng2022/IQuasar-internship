  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized phase II trial is to evaluate the clinical benefits&#xD;
      of the addition of atezolizumab to standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (first given concurrently&#xD;
      with CRT, then continued as adjuvant treatment), compared with CRT alone, on&#xD;
      investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), as per Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
