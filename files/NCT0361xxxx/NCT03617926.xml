      The present study is set-up to compare in vivo clinical performance and safety of the test&#xD;
      product versus an in the US commercially available, pyrethrum-based product (RID® shampoo).&#xD;
      The study will be performed in subjects ≥2 year of both genders with confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      head lice infestation. To support safety, local and global tolerability, skin and ocular&#xD;
      irritation will be assessed and adverse events (AEs) will be registered.&#xD;
