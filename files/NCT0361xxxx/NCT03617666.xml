      This is a phase II, non-randomised, multicentre study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the PD-L1 inhibitor, avelumab, in a previously untreated fit population of high risk stage&#xD;
      II, stage III and stage IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase II study investigates the safety and efficacy of the PD-L1 inhibitor, avelumab, in&#xD;
      a previously untreated fit population of high risk stage II, stage III and stage IV classical&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed high risk stage II, stage III or stage IV cHL staged by&#xD;
      18FDG-PET/CT will receive 4 doses of single agent avelumab every 2 weeks. After the 4th dose&#xD;
      of avelumab patients will have a PET-CT scan. All patients will then receive 2 cycles of ABVD&#xD;
      followed by a PET-CT scan and further treatment will be guided in a risk-adapted manner based&#xD;
      on the results of the RATHL. That is, patients who achieve PET CMR (defined as Deauville&#xD;
      score 1-3) will receive 4 cycles of AVD and will undergo a CT scan. Patients with Deauville&#xD;
      score 4-5 will receive 4 cycles of BEACOPP-14 or 3 cycles of escalated BEACOPP (at&#xD;
      Investigators discretion and as per standard local policy) and will then undergo a further&#xD;
      PET scan. Patients who are Deauville score 1-3 at this point will receive 2 further cycles of&#xD;
      BEACOPP-14 or 1 cycle of escalated BEACOPP (at Investigators discretion and as per standard&#xD;
      local policy). Patients who are Deauville score 4-5 at this point will receive further&#xD;
      treatment at Investigators discretion and as per standard local policy. Radiotherapy to sites&#xD;
      of residual avidity, initial bulk or as part of salvage treatment, is recommended (but not&#xD;
      mandated).&#xD;
