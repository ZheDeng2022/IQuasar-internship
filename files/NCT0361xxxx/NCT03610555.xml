  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choosing a transplant center that will accept a particular candidate can be difficult and&#xD;
      challenging for patients with end-stage organ failure. As transplant centers have varying&#xD;
      levels of expertise, interests, and outcomes of solid organ transplant, patient&#xD;
      health-related characteristics influence the variation in candidates centers will accept.&#xD;
      Most transplant candidates undergo waitlist work-ups as outpatients and many undergo&#xD;
      transplant at centers not closest to their homes. Some are listed at more than one center.&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that patients have a choice of centers. The PI, as Deputy Director of&#xD;
      the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), provides comparative information to&#xD;
      the public about each solid organ transplant center in the United States. The risk adjusted&#xD;
      outcomes, in the report cards, account for the transplant recipient's health-related&#xD;
      characteristics, donor characteristics and transplant related factors. Unfortunately, in&#xD;
      their current format, the report cards are not designed for transplant candidates, many of&#xD;
      whom may have low health literacy and numeracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work aims to develop and evaluate a patient-centered website and printouts of&#xD;
      the SRTR report cards that will effectively communicate comparative information to transplant&#xD;
      candidates about their alternatives when choosing transplant centers. We will develop a novel&#xD;
      tool to allow candidates to tailor the report cards to their clinical profiles based on their&#xD;
      health-related characteristics and to communicate information on alternative transplant&#xD;
      centers that perform transplants in patients like them. Aim 1 will use focus groups to&#xD;
      determine which transplant center characteristics to present to transplant candidates and how&#xD;
      to present these characteristics clearly in a patient centered report card. Using this&#xD;
      information, Aim 2 will develop a patient-centered website and printouts of the SRTR report&#xD;
      card that effectively communicate comparative information about transplant centers to&#xD;
      transplant candidates. Lastly, Aim 3 will conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the patient centered SRTR report card. We will determine transplant&#xD;
      candidates' comprehension and the value of the comparative quality reports, and the effect on&#xD;
      clinical decision making and status on the waiting list. After the RCT, a convenience sample&#xD;
      of online visitors to the new website will be assessed for similar outcomes.&#xD;

      Before the intervention, the study design with use of hypothetical scenarios will be&#xD;
      explained to the participant. The concept of randomization will be also be explained. The&#xD;
      participants will be asked a few questions to assess their understanding of the study design,&#xD;
      specifically the hypothetical nature of the scenarios. We will also assess whether they&#xD;
      understand the concept of being randomized to see one website first and then the other. Only&#xD;
      those participants that understand the study design will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      intervention and will be randomized. For subjects that are randomized, a survey will be&#xD;
      administered verbally to collect demographic information and information about their kidney&#xD;
      disease and comorbidities. The functional health literacy and numeracy assessment and health&#xD;
      status questionnaire will be completed. Subjects will be stratified by the transplant center&#xD;
      site and then block randomized. One group will be shown the existing SRTR website with its&#xD;
      existing SRTR report cards and then the website with the new patient-centered AHRQ report&#xD;
      cards for kidney transplants. The other group will be shown the two websites in opposite&#xD;
      order. Each participant will have at most 30 minutes to view each of the websites. After&#xD;
      viewing each website, responses to the intervention will be collected. Sessions where&#xD;
      participants are reviewing the websites will be recorded using Zoom. Figure 2 shows the study&#xD;
      design whereby subjects will be block randomized once to one of the four groups consisting of&#xD;
      18 subjects each. At the end of the study, the patients will have access to both the&#xD;
      websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study interventions can be administered in person on a laptop. During the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, the intervention can be administered remotely via email and zoom. The link to the&#xD;
      websites will be sent via encrypted email and the intervention will be recorded via zoom. The&#xD;
      recordings for subjects at Hennepin Healthcare will be stored on computers at that site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant does not have your own electronic device or internet, the study will send the&#xD;
      participant a study iPad with internet that participant can use for the intervention and then&#xD;
      to send back to the study team. We will provide detailed instructions on how to use the iPad&#xD;
      and Zoom application. The study will also pay for a FedEx pick up from the participants' home&#xD;
      to return the iPad to the study team after the completion of the intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Comprehension of the report card</measure>
    <time_frame>one hour</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the comprehension of the report card. To assess comprehension, the correct response to the following question will be assessed, &quot;Which transplant center do you think is most likely to have the best posttransplant outcome?&quot; There will be one correct answer; respondents will choose one of the four transplant center report cards shown or respond &quot;Don't know.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived value of information</measure>
    <time_frame>one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived value of information will be determined via patient responses to the following question, &quot;How useful is the information in the report card in helping you choose a transplant center for you or your family?&quot; Response choices to the questions will be based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at all useful to 5 = very useful; score 1 indicates the worst outcome and score 5 indicates better outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of satisfaction with decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>two hours</time_frame>
    <description>We will also measure satisfaction with decision-making and decisional conflict using the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The DCS consists of 16 questions with an overall score and subscales that address uncertainty, modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, clarity of values, inadequate social support, and perceived effective decision making. (1 = low decisional conflict, 5 = high decisional conflict). The overall score is calculated by summing up the subscales and the total score is considered for the measure of outcome. Overall score indicates the level of decisional conflict and lower overall score indicates better outcome.</description>
