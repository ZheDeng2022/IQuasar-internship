  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZSP1603&#xD;
      and the Secondary objective is to estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after orally&#xD;
      administered once daily of ZSP1603.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single center study aimed at&#xD;
      investigating the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of ZSP1603 on fasted&#xD;
      condition.Up to 4 cohorts of 32 eligible participants totally are planned to be enrolled.&#xD;
      This is a two-arm clinical trial that ZSP1603 and matching placebo will be orally&#xD;
      administered once daily. Two subjects in the first cohort will be assigned in a opened&#xD;
      fashion to receive 7.5mg of ZSP1603 while another three cohorts of volunteers will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive either a single dose of ZSP1603 or matching&#xD;
      placebo in an ascending dose fashion. To monitor AEs,record abnormalities (Holter, 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG, Vital signs, Physical examination, Clinical Laboratory), and detect the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of ZSP1603.&#xD;
