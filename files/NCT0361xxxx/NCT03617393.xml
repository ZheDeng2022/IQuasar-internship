  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focusing on patients with diabetes complicated with pulmonary infection, the purpose of this&#xD;
      study is: 1) to identify the epidemiology, etiologic spectrum and status of diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment; 2) to develop a symptom score scale , clarify the risk factors and create a&#xD;
      precise warning model; 3) to develop a rapid detection of pathogen of lower respiratory&#xD;
      infection, to establish clinical pathways of early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes&#xD;
      complicated with pulmonary infections (including bacterial, tuberculosis and fungal&#xD;
      infections) and then make an application in clinic.&#xD;

      Investigators perform a observational study on 6000 patients with diabetes, among which 200&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary infection are included in a retrospective study and 100 patients go&#xD;
      through metabolomics research. All patients receive clinical questionnaires, laboratory&#xD;
      examinations and pulmonary function tests. Investigators study on pathogen distribution and&#xD;
      infection ratio of patients above depending on follow-up survey. 1:1 nested case-control&#xD;
      study is carried out involving 100 cases from pulmonary-infected group paired with 100&#xD;
      control cases matched for gender, age and fasting blood-glucose. The final purpose is to&#xD;
      create a precise warning model in order to develop a rapid detection of pathogen of lower&#xD;
      respiratory infection in diabetes patients. Now investigators wish to register this study to&#xD;
      do a further research, in order to improve the early diagnosis of diabetes complicated with&#xD;
      pulmonary infection and to reduce the mortality.&#xD;
