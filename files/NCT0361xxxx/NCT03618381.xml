  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study that will enroll pediatric and young&#xD;
      adult research participants with relapsed or refractory non-CNS solid tumors to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, feasibility, and efficacy of administering T cell products derived from the research&#xD;
      participant's blood that have been genetically modified to express a EGFR-specific receptor&#xD;
      (chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR) that will target and kill solid tumors that express EGFR&#xD;
      and the selection-suicide marker EGFRt. EGFRt is a protein incorporated into the cell with&#xD;
      our EGFR receptor which is used to identify the modified T cells and can be used as a tag&#xD;
      that allows for elimination of the modified T cells if needed. On Arm A of the study,&#xD;
      research participants will receive EGFR-specific CAR T cells only. On Arm B of the study,&#xD;
      research participants will receive CAR T cells directed at EGFR and CD19, a marker on the&#xD;
      surface of B lymphocytes, following the hypothesis that CD19+ B cells serving in their normal&#xD;
      role as antigen presenting cells to T cells will promote the expansion and persistence of the&#xD;
      CAR T cells. The CD19 receptor harbors a different selection-suicide marker, HERtG. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of the study will be to determine the feasibility of manufacturing the&#xD;
      cell products, the safety of the T cell product infusion, to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of the CAR T cells products, to describe the full toxicity profile of each product, and&#xD;
      determine the persistence of the modified cell in the subject's body on each arm. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of T cells comprised of two different subtypes of T cells (CD4 and&#xD;
      CD8 T cells) felt to benefit one another once administered to the research participants for&#xD;
      improved potential therapeutic effect. The secondary objectives of this protocol are to study&#xD;
      the number of modified cells in the patients and the duration they continue to be at&#xD;
      detectable levels. The investigators will also quantitate anti-tumor efficacy on each arm.&#xD;
      Subjects who experience significant and potentially life-threatening toxicities (other than&#xD;
      clinically manageable toxicities related to T cells working, called cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome) will receive infusions of cetuximab (an antibody commercially available that&#xD;
      targets EGFRt) or trastuzumab (an antibody commercially available that targets HER2tG) to&#xD;
      assess the ability of the EGFRt on the T cells to be an effective suicide mechanism for the&#xD;
      elimination of the transferred T cell products.&#xD;
