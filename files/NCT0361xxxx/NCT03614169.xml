    <textblock>
      The present study will randomize 50 symptomatic heart failure patients with severely reduced&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a true left bundle branch block to either&#xD;
      direct HIS-pacing or biventricular pacing and follow them for at least six months. The&#xD;
      outcome is how often it is possible to achieve HIS-pacing at implant and during follow-up and&#xD;
      if HIS-pacing leads to differences in symptoms or measurable clinical parameters as compared&#xD;
      to biventricular pacing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biventricular (BiV) pacing is an established treatment of symptomatic heart failure patients&#xD;
      with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and wide QRS due to bundle&#xD;
      branch block (BBB) on a 12-lead ECG. BiV pacing is normally achieved with an endocardial&#xD;
      pacing lead in the right ventricle and an epicardial lead over the left ventricle situated in&#xD;
      a coronary vein. BiV pacing does not correct the BBB but corrects the mechanical dyssynchrony&#xD;
      that is a consequence of the BBB. It has been shown to work best on patients with &quot;true&quot; left&#xD;
      bundle branch block (LBBB) where the block is due to disease within the conduction system&#xD;
      (and not for example left ventricular hypertrophy or scars). Even if the patient is an ideal&#xD;
      candidate for BiV pacing it can sometimes be difficult to achieve the best mechanical&#xD;
      resynchronization because of anatomic difficulties, high pacing thresholds or phrenic nerve&#xD;
      capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years it has been demonstrated that the level of block in true LBBB is often within&#xD;
      the bundle of HIS and it is possible in many cases to place a pacing lead distally to the&#xD;
      site of block and get capture of both right and left bundles thereby &quot;correcting&quot; the BBB and&#xD;
      achieve a normal or near-normal QRS complex. If the conduction system is intact distal to the&#xD;
      block this mode of pacing leads to complete resynchronization of the ventricles. HIS-pacing&#xD;
      can be achieved as either selective HIS-capture where it is only the conduction system that&#xD;
      is paced leading to a narrow QRS complex. However, mostly it is achieved with non-selective&#xD;
      HIS-capture where both the septal myocardium close to the pacing site and the His-bundle is&#xD;
      captured. This leads to a QRS resembling the QRS achieved by selective HIS-capture but&#xD;
      preceded by a delta-wave-like deflection which broadens the QRS complex. Since it is only a&#xD;
      small part of the septum that is captured early this does not influence the resynchronization&#xD;
      of the heart. In some patients HIS-pacing cannot be achieved due to anatomical difficulties&#xD;
      that hinders reaching the HIS bundle with the present tools available. In others it is not&#xD;
      possible to come distal to the block and recruiting both the left and the right bundle&#xD;
      branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is to date no randomized studies between HIS-bundle pacing and BiV pacing in HFrEF&#xD;
      patients with LBBB but there are several case reports and retrospective data on successful&#xD;
      HIS-bundle pacing in these patients. The present study will randomize 50 patients in a single&#xD;
      centre to HIS-pacing or BiV pacing to determine to which extent it is possible to achieve&#xD;
      normalization or near-normalization of the QRS with HIS-bundle pacing and what this&#xD;
      translates to with regard to symptom relieve, walking distance, echocardiographic measures&#xD;
      and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels as compared to BiV pacing.&#xD;
