  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if a new series of evaluations called the SAE&#xD;
      (Sensory-Attention-Executive) Battery can help researchers learn more about how cancer&#xD;
      treatment does or does not change the way the brain processes/filters information, emotions,&#xD;
      attention span, and behavior by comparing the results of the SAE Battery with traditional&#xD;
      evaluations like questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>Assessments of their neurocognitive performance will be assessed longitudinally, at 4 time points: prior to adjuvant treatment (post-surgery); 1 month (with a +4 week window) post-chemotherapy; and again at the 12 and 24 months (with a +4 week window) post-treatment time points. These assessment time points are denoted as T1 though T4, respectively. The assessment schedule for the HC and CT- groups will be yoked against that of the CT+ cohort.</description>
