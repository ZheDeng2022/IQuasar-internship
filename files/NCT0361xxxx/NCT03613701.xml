  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moyamoya disease is a chronic cerebrovascular diseaseï¼ŒThe typical pathological manifestations&#xD;
      are the stenosis or occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery, and the proximal anterior cerebral artery. Meanwhile, the abnormal vascular net,&#xD;
      which is the smokey vessel, occurs at the bottom of the brain. Currently the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      this disease is unknown. Limited studies have reported the expression of endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (EPCs) in moyamoya disease, but the results were inconsistent. Some&#xD;
      investigators believe that the number of EPCs in peripheral blood of patients with moyamoya&#xD;
      disease is increased, while others believe that the number of EPCs in peripheral blood of&#xD;
      moyamoya patients is reduced. Therefore, the investigators need to find a more accurate&#xD;
      detection method to confirm the growth of EPC in patients with moyamoya disease. At the same&#xD;
      time, whether there is endothelial injury in patients with smoke disease, and the expression&#xD;
      of endothelial cells (CEC) in patients with smoke disease, there is no research on this&#xD;
      aspect at home and abroad.&#xD;

      Objective: Detect the expression of endothelial progenitor cells and endothelial cells from&#xD;
      peripheral blood of patients with moyamoya disease, and to assess the relationship between&#xD;
      clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A single center study, and planned to enroll 120 patients. The present study was to&#xD;
      detect the quantities of EPC from peripheral blood in Moyamoya disease by flow cytometry, and&#xD;
      to identify the relationship of endothelial progeIlitor cells and effect of the&#xD;
      revascularization on Moyamoya disease. The present study also use cerebral ischemia animal&#xD;
      model foe intervention experiment, to explore whether EPC can promote vascular remodeling&#xD;
      effect of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and to provide new thought for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic cerebrovascular disorder.&#xD;
