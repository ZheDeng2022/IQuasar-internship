  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the current protocol is to collect data from extended follow up in subjects&#xD;
      that have received a kidney transplant following imlifidase dosing to provide a better&#xD;
      understanding regarding the long-term outcome for these subjects. Data of parameters such as&#xD;
      patient and graft survival, comorbidity, treatment of graft rejection episodes and quality of&#xD;
      life as well as anti-drug antibody levels will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational follow up study of subjects who have received imlifidase&#xD;
      prior to kidney transplantation will provide important data to future prescribers and&#xD;
      patients of the potential long-term benefits of imlifidase mediated transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>This is a five year, long-term follow up, observational study. The study will primarily determine the time of graft survival in subjects who have received imlifidase prior to kidney transplantation. Subjects who have participated, or are currently participating, in the imlifidase kidney transplantation studies (called feeder studies) 13-HMedIdeS-02, 13-HMedIdeS-03, 14-HMedIdeS- 04 and 15-HMedIdeS-06 will be included. The subjects will attend 4 follow up visits, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years after imlifidase administration.</description>
