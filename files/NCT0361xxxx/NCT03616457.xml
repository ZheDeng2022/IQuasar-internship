  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the Inveniaâ„¢ Automated Breast Ultrasound&#xD;
      (ABUS) device, as an adjunct to Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), improves breast cancer&#xD;
      detection in women with dense breasts. The study aims to collect information about cancer&#xD;
      detection, treatment, and outcomes based on individual and combined technologies in patients&#xD;
      who receive ABUS exams in addition to DBT. The results of this study are intended to be used&#xD;
      to extend understanding of ABUS as an adjunct in DBT screening in patients with dense&#xD;
      breasts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following consenting procedures, subjects will undergo standard of care DBT of both breasts&#xD;
      or of one breast if they have had prior uni-lateral mastectomy. Subjects will also undergo&#xD;
      ABUS of both breasts or of one breast if they have had prior uni-lateral mastectomy. These&#xD;
      imaging exams will be done per the sites routine practice, and can be done in any order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images will be read and assessed by one (1) Mammography Quality Standards Act&#xD;
      (MQSA)-qualified reader. The evaluating radiologist will use the image reconstruction views&#xD;
      appropriate for the evaluation, per his or her medical judgment, and handle diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluations in accordance with the standard of care at the investigational site. The DBT&#xD;
      images will be read and assessed first and independent of ABUS images. DBT plus ABUS will&#xD;
      then be read per routine practice and assessed. Images will not be read until both imaging&#xD;
      exams have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If screening shows a suspicious finding, subjects will receive standard of care follow-up and&#xD;
      appropriate workup, which may include biopsy (as needed), to determine cancer status.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed at approximately one year (11- to 16-months) unless negative&#xD;
      histopathology with image concordance or positive cancer status is histologically determined&#xD;
      prior to one-year follow-up. Follow up procedures will be conducted as per the sites standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
