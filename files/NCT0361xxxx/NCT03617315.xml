  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 50 eyes were analyzed (25 patients). The subjects selected were over 18 years of&#xD;
      age. No gender distinction was made in the choice of subjects. All subjects were carriers of&#xD;
      silicone hydrogel contact lenses. The antecedents of the eye diseases not identified, neither&#xD;
      the previous eye surgeries nor the systemic or ocular medication. All patients read,&#xD;
      understood and signed an informed consent form of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study was performed using the contralateral eye, the study groups were randomized. The&#xD;
      choice of eye for each tear was random and established as an artificial tear A and artificial&#xD;
      tear B. The patients were not previously warned about the type of artificial tear they were&#xD;
      going to use or the difference that existed between them, therefore, they were unaware of the&#xD;
      benefits that such tears could offer them. The examiner did know what tear was applied to&#xD;
      each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the lubricants used; Tear A (Aquoral Forte®, ESTEVE®, Farmigea, Pisa, Italy) was a&#xD;
      combination of 0.4% unridged hyaluronic acid and 0.2% Galacto-xyloglucan. The&#xD;
      galacto-xyloglucan is extracted from the tamarind seed. It consists of 30 single doses, each&#xD;
      with 0.5 ml and have a daily use closure, that is, it can not be used once 12 hours have&#xD;
      passed since the dose was opened. This lubricant lacks preservatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, tear B (Aquoral Lipo® [Spain] / Lumixa® [Italy], ESTEVE®, Farmigea, Pisa,&#xD;
      Italy) is a combination of three components; cross-linked hyaluronic acid (CXL) at 0.15%,&#xD;
      crocin and liposomes. It is an ophthalmic lubricant and antioxidant solution. Its package is&#xD;
      10 ml multidose, so it can be used for a long time. It is composed of liposomes, sodium salt&#xD;
      of crosslinked hyaluronic acid 0.15%, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt&#xD;
      and crocin. Although this tear comes in a multi-dose container, it does not contain a&#xD;
      preservative due to the dispenser that does not let microorganisms from outside. Contact&#xD;
      lenses can be used while both lubricants are applied. In this regard, the study patients used&#xD;
      their silicone hydrogel contact lenses monthly during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the study had a period of one month without using any type of artificial tear&#xD;
      or eye drops. Once this time or study was over, the patients were explained how artificial&#xD;
      tears should be instilled. The visits were carried out blindly by research optometrists. Who&#xD;
      did not know how the distribution of artificial tears in patients had been. The artificial&#xD;
      tears were administered 3 times a day for 6 weeks and the subjects belonging to the study&#xD;
      underwent a clinical examination in the period prior to treatment and 45 days after the&#xD;
      treatment, once the treatment with artificial tears. He was repeated the tests of the&#xD;
      beginning, nevertheless, the meibografía was not realized, since the use of artificial tears&#xD;
      was not going to cause the growth of the glands of Meibomio&#xD;
