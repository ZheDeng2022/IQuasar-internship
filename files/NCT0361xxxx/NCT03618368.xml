      THERANOVA-500 dialyzer versus conventional hemodialysis (HD) using REVACLEAR-400 dialyzer in&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis patients over a 6-week intervention period. Primary endpoint is&#xD;
      post-hemodialysis recovery time. Secondary endpoints are six pre-dialysis biomarker levels&#xD;
      (b2-microglobuline, procalcitonine, free light chains (gamma-lambda), IL-6, CRP) and three&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled trial involving 70 subjects divided in 4 groups: 25 single&#xD;
