  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see whether the antibiotic combination of 100mg doxycycline,&#xD;
      500mg azithromycin and 300mg rifabutin is a safe and effective treatment for coronary artery&#xD;
      disease which has not responded to 'standard treatment'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease is the process of plaque build up within the walls of the arteries&#xD;
      responsible for supplying the heart with oxygen and nutrients. plaque is usually made up of&#xD;
      fatty deposits, minerals and various amounts of tissue and white cells which eventually&#xD;
      narrows the artery, reducing blood flow to the heart. The resulting damage and build up of&#xD;
      fat leads to inflammation of the arterial wall and eventually the arteries narrow. The&#xD;
      researchers involved in this study consider that a pathogen called Chlamydophila pneumoniae,&#xD;
      which can live inside cells may cause this inflammation of the arterial wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if treatment with this antibiotic combination in patients&#xD;
      with CHD is safe and effective in reducing disease severity measured at coronary angiography&#xD;
      and improving quality of life. Approximately 60 patients will be involved in this trial. the&#xD;
      treatment period is 90 days with a further 90 day follow up period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chlamydophila pneumoniae has been evaluated as one potential underlying cause of CHD. The&#xD;
      strongest evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from multiple investigators who enrolled&#xD;
      over 19,217 subjects in 'Anti-Chlamydia trials'. However, these studies can be questioned on&#xD;
      the basis of the type and duration of therapy. The recent change of the genus no longer&#xD;
      permits treatment of C. pneumoniae as if it were Chlamydia trachomatis - which can generally&#xD;
      be cured with a short course of macrolides [azithromycin, roxithromycin or clarithromycin]&#xD;
      used in the majority of subjects analysed in this meta-analysis. C. pneumoniae is largely&#xD;
      intra-cellular and its preferred locations (arterial muscle cells and macrophages) may&#xD;
      contribute to its persistence in the body. C. pneumoniae can be refractory to antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment in spite of in vitro susceptibility to various macrolides and ansamycins likely due&#xD;
      to the use of sub-optimal dosages, which has been shown to encourage or induce persistence of&#xD;
      C. pneumoniae in vitro. Rupp et al (2009) reported C. pneumoniae to infiltrated poptotic&#xD;
      neutrophils that are subsequently taken up by monocyte-derived macrophages, thereby&#xD;
      preventing clearance by the body's immune system and preventing susceptibility in the&#xD;
      presence of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previously reported trials have used short-term or recurrent treatment. The rationale for&#xD;
      combined antibiotic long-term therapy stems from experience with other intracellular bacteria&#xD;
      e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, characterized by its dormant forms and affinity for&#xD;
      developing resistance. The presence of infection in arterial cells with associated fibrosis&#xD;
      and calcification for a considerable time may warrant prolonged treatment to enable&#xD;
      antibiotic penetration into infected spaces. The occurrence of dormant forms also requires&#xD;
      long-term treatment to anticipate the 'awakening' of dormant bacterial cells so that&#xD;
      antibiotics can be effective during their division phase. The use of a combination therapy&#xD;
      rather than a single agent to address dormant forms is concurrent with experience with other&#xD;
      chronic and multiple resistant strain infections such as H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, and&#xD;
      Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis which are treated with combination antibiotics to&#xD;
      minimise the development of resistant strains. Indeed, in the C. pneumoniae/CHD trials, the&#xD;
      only trial that showed marked improvement in primary end points was the trial that used&#xD;
      multiple antibiotics albeit for 7 days22. Hence, it would be reasonable to trial an&#xD;
      appropriate multiple-antibiotic regimen in CHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, antibiotics against C. pneumoniae known to be active within cells will be&#xD;
      used. The three drugs will be administered simultaneously to minimise resistance development,&#xD;
      and these will be used for a minimum of 3 months. At this stage ideal duration of treatment&#xD;
      is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary clinical experience of 5 subjects, with 3-6 month treatment using&#xD;
      clarithromycin, rifabutin and doxycycline, subjects noted reduced shortness of breath, angina&#xD;
      episodes, and marked improvement in claudication. The dosage schedule for this trial will be&#xD;
      initiated as half doses in the first week followed by full dosages from week two onwards.&#xD;
      This is designed as to minimize the onset of potential adverse effects in subjects. The&#xD;
      dose-escalating schedule allows introduction of the medications into the body and maximizing&#xD;
      bioavailability yet minimizing the potential adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience with long term use of a combination of three antibiotics in Mycobacterium&#xD;
      avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease has been largely in younger subjects who did not&#xD;
      receive anti-platelet agents as concomitant therapies, and thus, macrolide anti-platelet&#xD;
      agent interactions have not been observed. In the proposed group of subjects with CHD&#xD;
      disease, clarithromycin has a known interaction with anti-platelet agents and therefore in&#xD;
      this group, clarithromycin will be substituted by azithromycin, a similar macrolide that&#xD;
      demonstrates the same intracellular activity against C. pneumoniae but does not exhibit such&#xD;
      interaction with anti-platelet agents. The azithromycin dose will be reduced due to its&#xD;
      longer half-life, resulting in longer bioavailability duration in the body. Due to reported&#xD;
      occasional QT-prolongation at high doses of azithromycin, ECG monitoring of the QT-interval&#xD;
      will be carried out.&#xD;
