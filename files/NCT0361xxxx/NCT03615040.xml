  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide. In contrast to other chronic diseases, COPD is increasing in prevalence&#xD;
      and is projected to be the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide by 2030. The&#xD;
      costs to society for treating COPD are high, accounting for approximately 3.4% of the total&#xD;
      health care budget of the European Union. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are&#xD;
      responsible for a large portion of the economic burden of COPD. More than 500,000&#xD;
      hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths are attributed to AECOPD in the US each year. In addition&#xD;
      to a substantial economic burden, AECOPD is also responsible for much of the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality from COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an alarmin released from the epithelium following damage. IL-33 is&#xD;
      an IL-1 family alarmin cytokine constitutively expressed at epithelial barrier surfaces where&#xD;
      it is rapidly released from cells during tissue injury. IL-33 signals through a receptor&#xD;
      complex of IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) (known as ST2) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein&#xD;
      (IL1RAcP) to initiate MyD88-dependent inflammatory pathways. The role of the IL33/ST2 axis in&#xD;
      COPD is uncertain. IL33 has been implicated in eosinophil recruitment to the airway and&#xD;
      maturation in the bone marrow largely via its effects upon innate lymphoid cells. IL33&#xD;
      increased following experimental cold in asthma and thus might play a role in the consequent&#xD;
      inflammatory response and possible susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection in&#xD;
      obstructive lung disease. Both eosinophilic inflammation and viral infection drive COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations and therefore targeting the IL33/ST2 axis might reduce COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this trial is to evaluate whether anti-ST2 will impact on airway inflammation&#xD;
      in COPD and therefore reduce the frequency of exacerbations. For the purposes of this trial,&#xD;
      exacerbations are defined as flare-ups of symptoms involving the use of healthcare resulting&#xD;
      in treatment with steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalisation or death due to COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group, randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of anti-ST2 compared to placebo, in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to very severe COPD (GOLD II-IV). Anti-ST2 will be administered via&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks (Week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and&#xD;
      44) during the 48-week treatment period. Participants will be followed up for 60 weeks (i.e.&#xD;
      48 week treatment period and 12 week follow-up), with secondary outcome measures at baseline,&#xD;
      4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 weeks and at exacerbation events presenting prior to treatment&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent at the initial visit, patients will enter a screening&#xD;
      period which should last for up to 2 weeks unless extension of the screening period is&#xD;
      necessary under certain circumstances. Patients who qualify to participate in the study will&#xD;
      be randomised into a 48-week treatment period in which they will receive either 490 mg&#xD;
      anti-ST2 or a matching placebo. Patients will be evaluated for an additional 12 weeks&#xD;
      following completion of the randomised treatment period. Treatment groups will remain blinded&#xD;
      until the 60-week follow-up period is completed, and trial database is locked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is sponsored by the University of Leicester, coordinated by the National Institute&#xD;
      for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) - Respiratory and Leicester&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Unit (LCTU) and funded by Genentech, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of anti-ST2 versus placebo on&#xD;
      frequency of moderate-to-severe exacerbations (health care utilisation resulting in treatment&#xD;
      with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or hospitalisation, respectively) as add-on&#xD;
      to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: another key objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) doses of anti-ST2 compared to placebo in adult patients with moderate to&#xD;
      very severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, to assess the effects of anti-ST2 versus placebo both during stable visits and&#xD;
      at the exacerbation events on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health status&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inflammatory cell differentials i. Sputum cell count ii. Blood cell count&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Airway morphometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pharmacogenomics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systemic inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Upper airway inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Airway infection and ecology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Breath volatile organic compound profiling&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quantitative airway geometry and densitometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pharmacogenomics&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pharmacokinetics and ADA level&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Pharmacogenomics response analysis in subgroups determined by SNPs for alleles&#xD;
           associated with the IL33/ST2 axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup objectives: to evaluate the efficacy of anti-ST2 versus placebo on the outcome rate&#xD;
      of protocol-defined COPD exacerbations through 48 weeks treatment period, patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) [SGRQ-c], and lung function [FEV1] in subgroups defined by baseline blood&#xD;
      eosinophil count.&#xD;

    <description>Patient reported outcome (PRO). To evaluate health status; designed to measure health impairment in patients with asthma and COPD. It is in two parts. Part I produces the Symptoms score, and Part 2 the Activity and Impact scores. A Total score is also produced. The Total score is calculated by summing the weights to all the positive responses in each component. The score for each component is calculated separately by dividing the summed weights by the maximum possible weight for that component and expressing the result as a percentage. Maximum possible weights for components: Symptoms (566.2), Activity (982.9), Impacts (1652.8). Total (3201.9, which would represent the worst possible state of the patient.</description>

    <description>Patient reported outcome (PRO). To evaluate health status: evaluation and rehabilitation education guidance on the respiratory and motor functions of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40, with Since COPD is a progressive disease, a fi xed target score for all patients cannot be set. In Practice, a target for improvement in individual patient CAT scores may be set, based on an holistic assessment of the patient. A change of 2 units suggests a meaningful difference. This test should be used in conjunction with the mMRC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to determine COPD health assessment of participants.</description>

    <description>Patient reported outcome (PRO). To evaluate respiratory breathlessness symptoms (Grade 0-4, with Grade 0 being breathlessness with strenuous exercise to Grade 4 being breathlessness for daily activities like dressing). The mMRC Dyspnea Scale score must be contextualized with an individual patient's history, physical, and available diagnostic test results. For patients with a higher mMRC grade (e.g. ≥2) and clinical circumstances consistent with respiratory disease, measuring spirometry (e.g., FEV₁ and FVC), determining the patient's Body-mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise (BODE) Index and/or GOLD stage, and pursuing further targeted diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions is appropriate. A patient's mMRC Dyspnea Scale score, or another dyspnea measurement, such as the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), is combined with the patient's FEV₁ percent predicted and the frequency of COPD exacerbations to guide treatment interventions</description>

    <time_frame>Anytime between screening and week 12, unless patient has had the test within 12 months prior to screening visit.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess lung function, i.e. the functional residual capacity of the lungs. The participant sits inside an airtight box, inhales or exhales to a particular volume (usually FRC), and then a shutter drops across their breathing tube. The participant makes respiratory efforts against the closed shutter, causing their chest volume to expand and decompressing the air in their lungs. The increase in their chest volume slightly reduces the box volume (the non-person volume of the box) and thus slightly increases the pressure in the box. TLC, RV and RV/TLC% will be measured.</description>

    <description>MSTT1041A (RO7187807; formerly made by Amgen [AMG] and referred to as AMG 282) is a novel biopharmaceutical that blocks signaling of interleukin (IL)-33, an inflammatory cytokine of the IL-1 family and member of the newly discovered &quot;alarmin&quot; class of molecules. IL-33 is released from airway epithelial cells in response to allergens, irritants, and infection. IL-33 release can trigger acute exacerbations in both asthma and COPD. MSTT1041A has the ability to block inflammation,prevent exacerbations, and improve lung function and quality of life.&#xD;
Anti-ST2 is presented as sterile, clear, and colourless to slightly yellow liquid. Each sterile vial is filled with a 1 mL deliverable volume of 70 mg/mL. It is formulated with 15 mM sodium acetate, 9.0% (w/v) sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 20, pH 5.2.</description>
