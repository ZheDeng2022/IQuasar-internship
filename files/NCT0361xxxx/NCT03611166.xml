  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following severe traumatic brain injury, patients may remain unconscious for many years. It&#xD;
      is the first proteomic analysis comparing differentially expressed proteins between patients&#xD;
      with chronic disorder of consciousness and controls so far. The investigators generated&#xD;
      accurate lists of proteomes and identified differences at different disease time courses. The&#xD;
      obtained results provide new insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the chronic disorder of consciousness.&#xD;

      Background: Patients who awake from severely traumatic brain injury (sTBI) may remain&#xD;
      unconscious for many years. Although behavioral assessment and functional imaging are&#xD;
      currently used as diagnostic tools, the molecular basis underlying chronic condition has yet&#xD;
      to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:To explore the molecular basis and identify novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with chronic disorder of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Plasma samples were obtained from patients with chronic disorder of consciousness,&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers. A coupled isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation&#xD;
      (iTRAQ)-based proteomics approach was used to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)&#xD;
      between patients and controls. Potential molecular mechanisms were further discussed through&#xD;
      bioinformatics analyses. Candidate proteins were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay (ELISA).&#xD;

      Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected in a Vacutainer® tube, containing anticoagulant, using&#xD;
      standardized phlebotomy procedures. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation (2,000 g, 5 min,&#xD;
      4°C) and stored at -80°C until further analysis.&#xD;
