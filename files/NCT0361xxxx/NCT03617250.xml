      Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and&#xD;
      joint destruction that follows a relapsing - remitting course and induce severe disability .&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease that causes devastating joint destruction if&#xD;
      patients are not appropriately treated. It is characterized by symmetric joint involvement,&#xD;
      erosion and deformity in the joints as a result of synovial inflammation .Inflammation is the&#xD;
      key determinant and primary underlying mechanism leading to disability and increased&#xD;
      mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Disease activity assessment is important for&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis management, since it could greatly affect the clinical decision. Current&#xD;
      disease activity assessment mainly depend on clinical symptoms, signs and laboratory tests.&#xD;
      laboratory Investigations are much preferred due to the advantage of less observer&#xD;
      variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore assessment of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis with reliable markers is crucial&#xD;
      to predict long term outcome of a particular patient. The most commonly used markers for this&#xD;
      purpose are ESR and CRP in daily practice. However both of these markers have some&#xD;
      limitations such as reflection of short-term inflammatory activity and low discrimination&#xD;
      ability with other superimposed conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic inflammation is associated with changes in circulating blood cells quantity and&#xD;
      composition. Normochromic anemia, thrombocytosis, neutrophilia and lymphopenia usually occur&#xD;
      with many inflammatory conditions so the features of circulating blood cell components can be&#xD;
      used for the assessment of inflammatory activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters of hemogram, particularly those including immune system elements are important in&#xD;
      the assessment of different diseases and or sign. Immune system elements involve the&#xD;
      neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets that have a role in the control of inflammation, while&#xD;
      also undergoing changes secondary to inflammation. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be&#xD;
      found with increasing platelet counts during active stages of the disease. The counts&#xD;
      decrease up on remission of inflammation but detailed role played by platelets remains&#xD;
      unobvious .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) are three&#xD;
      useful indices of platelet function reflecting the platelet production rate. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gokmen et al 2016 concluded that MPV and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) together with&#xD;
      acute phase reactant C.reactive Protein(CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be a&#xD;
      useful indices for showing inflammation in RA patients and demonstrated that MPV negatively&#xD;
      correlated with CRP and NLR positively correlated with ESR, CRP and anti cyclic citrullinated&#xD;
      peptide antibody (antiCCP). The author concluded that high NLR levels in patients with RA is&#xD;
      important in predicting prognosis of disease and development of more joint damage and&#xD;
      hypothesized that NLR may be Considered to be an indicator of inflammation, disease activity&#xD;
      and disease prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet&#xD;
      to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are associated with poor prognosis of various inflammatory related&#xD;
      diseases such as cancer, chronic kidney disease , acute pancreatitis ) and myocardial&#xD;
      infarction . This may be due to the fact that both PLR and NLR are associated with the&#xD;
      inflammatory status .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these Studies recently Fu el at., in 2015 hypothesized that both NLR and PLR&#xD;
      correlated with the disease activity of RA and suggested that NLR and PLR may be indices for&#xD;
      assessment of RA disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uslu et al 2015 demonstrated that NLR and PLR were elevated in rheumatoid arthritis patients&#xD;
      with active disease compared with patients in remission. So they concluded that NLR and PLR&#xD;
      were two new inflammatory markers which could be used to assess disease activity in patients&#xD;
      with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
