      Antibiotic resistance is a serious and increasing worldwide threat to global public health.&#xD;
      One of antibiotic stewardship programmes' objectives is to reduce inappropriate&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics' prescription. Selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility&#xD;
      test (AST) results, which consists of reporting to prescribers only few (n=5-6) antibiotics,&#xD;
      preferring first-line and narrow-spectrum agents, is one possible strategy advised in&#xD;
      recommendations. However, selective reporting of AST has never been evaluated using an&#xD;
      experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pragmatic, prospective, multicentre, controlled (selective reporting vs usual&#xD;
      complete reporting of AST), before-after (year 2019 vs 2017) study. Selective reporting of&#xD;
      AST is scheduled to be implemented from September 2018 in the ATOUTBIO group of 21&#xD;
      laboratories for all E. coli identified in urine cultures in adult outpatients, and to be&#xD;
      compared to the usual complete AST performed in the EVOLAB group of 20 laboratories. The main&#xD;
      objective is to assess the impact of selective reporting of AST for E. coli positive urine&#xD;
      cultures in the outpatient setting on the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics&#xD;
      frequently used for urinary tract infections (amoxicillin-clavulanate, third generation&#xD;
      cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones). The primary endpoint is the after (2019) - before&#xD;
      (2017) difference in prescription rates for the previously mentioned antibiotics/classes that&#xD;
      will be compared between the two laboratory groups, using linear regression models. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the feasibility of selective reporting of AST implementation by&#xD;
      French laboratories and their acceptability by organising focus groups and individual&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with general practitioners and laboratory professionals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is a serious and increasing worldwide threat to global public&#xD;
      health. It has been estimated that multidrug-resistant bacteria affect 158.000 French persons&#xD;
      annually, of whom 12.500 die from these infections. In France, the increase of multidrug&#xD;
      resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is the most alarming: the prevalence of Escherichia coli&#xD;
      resistant to third generation cephalosporins and to fluoroquinolones has dramatically&#xD;
      increased in the last decade and has reached now 11% and 17%, respectively. More than 90% of&#xD;
      antibiotics used in humans in France are prescribed to outpatients (70% by general&#xD;
      practitioners) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for a considerable proportion of&#xD;
      these prescriptions (15% of all outpatient prescriptions, about 10 million of prescriptions&#xD;
      each year) with E. coli being the pathogen most frequently (70-95%) isolated in&#xD;
      community-acquired UTIs. Antibiotic stewardship programmes aim both at limiting antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy to proven or strongly suspected non-self-limiting bacterial infections, and at&#xD;
      reducing broad-spectrum antibiotics' use, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins and&#xD;
      fluoroquinolones. So, two goals are pursued: to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, and to&#xD;
      limit inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Several studies have shown that half of&#xD;
      antibiotic prescriptions for UTIs in primary care are either unnecessary or inappropriate,&#xD;
      and that general practitioners (GPs) prescribe more antibiotics than necessary.&#xD;
      Broad-spectrum antibiotics (in particular amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins and&#xD;
      fluoroquinolones) are frequently inappropriately prescribed in UTIs, whereas first-line and&#xD;
      narrow-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, etc.) would have&#xD;
      been sufficient to treat the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One strategy recommended by French national authorities and by international recommendations&#xD;
      to limit the inappropriate over-prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics is the use of&#xD;
      selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. Selective reporting&#xD;
      means that AST are reported back to the practitioner only for few (n=5-6) antibiotics, those&#xD;
      that should be used first-line according to guidelines. However, the laboratory is still&#xD;
      testing all the 20-25 antibiotics reported in the usual complete AST, and susceptibility&#xD;
      results not mentioned in the selective reporting of AST are available at the practitioners'&#xD;
      request to the microbiologist. Data usually used to determine which antibiotics to report for&#xD;
      urine samples are the isolated microorganism, the patient's age and gender, and the list of&#xD;
      antibiotics recommended in national guidelines. For example, in a wild-type E. coli isolated&#xD;
      in urine in an adult woman, the only antibiotics to report could be amoxicillin,&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and pivmecillinam. To date however,&#xD;
      even if recommended by the French authorities, selective reporting of AST is still limited to&#xD;
      rare local initiatives. Two randomised controlled case-vignette surveys conducted among&#xD;
      junior medical doctors and GPs in France revealed that selective reporting of AST could&#xD;
      improve the appropriateness of antibiotic treatment for UTIs and decrease the prescription of&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics, while being well accepted by most physicians. However, these two&#xD;
      surveys used fictitious clinical vignettes and no study has yet been conducted in the 'real&#xD;
      life' French health context to evaluate the impact of selective reporting of AST on&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of selective reporting of AST for E.&#xD;
      coli positive urine cultures in adult outpatients on the prescription of broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics frequently used in UTIs (amoxicillin-clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins&#xD;
      and fluoroquinolones). These antibiotics/classes have been indeed flagged since 2013 as&#xD;
      'critical' antibiotics (i.e. antibiotics with a higher risk of selection of bacterial&#xD;
      resistance) by the French Medicines Agency, in line with the recent AWaRe categorisation&#xD;
      introduced by the WHO in its Essential Medicines List. Secondary objectives are to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of the selective reporting of AST implementation by French laboratories and&#xD;
      their acceptability by GPs and laboratory professionals (microbiologists, technicians and&#xD;
      secretaries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pragmatic, prospective, multicentre, controlled (selective reporting vs usual&#xD;
      complete reporting of AST), before-after study. Selective reporting of AST is scheduled to be&#xD;
      implemented, from the 1st of September 2018, in the ATOUTBIO group of 21 laboratories for all&#xD;
      E. coli identified in urine cultures of adults, and to be compared to the complete reporting&#xD;
      of AST performed in the EVOLAB group of 20 laboratories. ATOUTBIO and EVOLAB are the two main&#xD;
      laboratory networks located in Lorraine (north-eastern France region with a population of&#xD;
      2,346,000 according to the 2014 census), and each of them is set up on approximatively one&#xD;
      third of the regional territory. The target study population is adults, with an E. coli&#xD;
      positive urine culture on which an AST is realised, (according to national recommendations),&#xD;
      who are prescribed an antibiotic by primary care physicians (GPs and other specialties)&#xD;
      located in the geographic areas served by all the 41 laboratories studied (in the&#xD;
      intervention ATOUTBIO group or the control EVOLAB group). The 'before' period is the year&#xD;
      preceding the implementation of selective reporting of AST in the ATOUTBIO group (i.e. the&#xD;
      2017 year) and the 'after' period is the year following this implementation (i.e. the 2019&#xD;
      year). The feasibility of the intervention for laboratories is evaluated by collecting&#xD;
      prospectively in a database all material/informatics, financial and human laboratory&#xD;
      resources used in 2018 and 2019 for the implementation of selective reporting of AST. The&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention is assessed by organising focus groups and individual&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with a randomised sample of GPs and laboratory professionals to&#xD;
      collect their perceptions on selective reporting of AST one year after its implementation&#xD;
      (September 2019). The monthly number of complete reporting of AST requested by physicians is&#xD;
      also calculated as an indicator of prescribers' acceptability. This study complies with&#xD;
      existing methodology guidance for stewardship studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study organisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is promoted and coordinated by Nancy University Teaching Hospital. A scientific&#xD;
      committee is in charge of supervising all scientific aspects and organisational issues&#xD;
      occurring during the study period. This committee is multidisciplinary, comprising four&#xD;
      microbiologists, two infectious diseases physicians, one GP, one epidemiologist and public&#xD;
      health specialist, one sociologist and one pharmacist. The committee will meet regularly: at&#xD;
      least one meeting before the study starts to define the protocol, at least two meetings per&#xD;
      year during the study period to solve organizational issues, and at least one meeting after&#xD;
      the end of the study period to present and discuss the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention: selective reporting of AST&#xD;
&#xD;
      As French guidelines for UTIs' treatment differ by gender, two algorithms have been developed&#xD;
      and pilot-tested by three GPs, one microbiologist and two infectious diseases physicians.&#xD;
      During the algorithms' development, two possible risks associated with selective reporting of&#xD;
      AST have been taken into account. First, physicians may have problems prescribing an&#xD;
      antibiotic for patients with multiple allergies or contra-indications; indeed, for each&#xD;
      possible clinical situation, at least two different classes of antibiotics are reported on&#xD;
      the selective report and the sentence 'the complete AST is available at the prescriber'&#xD;
      request is specifically mentioned on the report. Second, as the clinical diagnosis is unknown&#xD;
      to the microbiologist and then, in order to avoid the increased use of antibiotics reported&#xD;
      on the selective report but not appropriate to the clinical context (e.g. nitrofurantoin in&#xD;
      pyelonephritis as previously reported in other studies), antibiotics that should not be used&#xD;
      in pyelonephritis or prostatitis are specifically flagged on the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for each AST performed on E. coli positive urine cultures in 2017 (before&#xD;
      period) and 2019 (after period) in all laboratories of the two groups are: patient's gender&#xD;
      and age, living residence (community/nursing home), study group (intervention&#xD;
      (ATOUTBIO)/control (EVOLAB)), antibiotic(s) dispensed by a community pharmacy during the 15&#xD;
      days following the AST (yes/no, molecule(s), dosage, type of package and quantity), and the&#xD;
      prescriber's speciality. During the 'after period', the number of medical consultations and&#xD;
      hospitalisations during the 30 days following the AST are collected, in order to look for any&#xD;
      unintended consequences. All these data stem from the French health insurance database SNDS&#xD;
      (Système National des Données de Santé) that contains individualised, anonymous and linkable&#xD;
      data. Prospectively recorded for all beneficiaries of healthcare in France, SNDS covers&#xD;
      almost the entire French population (67 million inhabitants). Data recorded include&#xD;
      especially all medical expenditure reimbursements (all antibiotics are reimbursed in France)&#xD;
      and information from hospital stays. The SNDS database is one of the largest databases in the&#xD;
      world that has been extensively used to guide public health policies in France. A&#xD;
      probabilistic data linkage method is applied within the anonymous SNDS database to identify&#xD;
      patients for which urine cultures positive for E. coli and with an AST were processed in 2017&#xD;
      and 2019 in the two groups of laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on national published data, the prescription rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics&#xD;
      frequently used in UTIs is estimated to be at around 70% in French outpatients. A sample of&#xD;
      300 urine cultures positive for E. coli and with an AST per group would be sufficient to&#xD;
      detect a 10% decrease difference in the prescription rate between groups after intervention,&#xD;
      with a 90% power, a 5% α risk and an inflation factor at 3 (due to the cluster design). The&#xD;
      two laboratory networks included in this study will definitely be sufficient to detect such a&#xD;
      difference as more than 16,000 AST on E. coli urine cultures are performed each year by both&#xD;
      EVOLAB and ATOUTBIO groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis plan includes the following procedures: (i) A comparison of&#xD;
      laboratory activities between the two groups (ATOUTBIO and EVOLAB) in 2017 and 2019: number&#xD;
      of AST in urine cultures, E. coli prevalence in urine cultures, antibiotic resistance&#xD;
      profiles of E. coli isolated from urine cultures, (ii) A comparison of age and sex-ratio of&#xD;
      patients with E. coli positive urine cultures (with AST) between the two groups in 2017 and&#xD;
      2019, (iii) The calculation, for each laboratory group, of the prescription rates in&#xD;
      suspected UTIs of amoxicillin-clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones&#xD;
      and all these three antibiotics/classes combined in 2017 and 2019, as follows: number of&#xD;
      prescriptions of antibiotic/class y for E. coli positive urine cultures with AST during the&#xD;
      year n / number of prescriptions of all antibiotics for E. coli positive urine cultures with&#xD;
      AST during the year n, (iv) A comparison of the after (2019) - before (2017) difference of&#xD;
      the prescription rates for the above-mentioned antibiotics/classes between the two groups,&#xD;
      using linear regression models adjusted for variables that might differ between groups&#xD;
      (laboratory activities, sex-ratio, age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p-value of &lt; 0.05 for two-sided tests is considered significant. All analyses are performed&#xD;
      with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.).&#xD;
