    <textblock>
      Patients with severe hematochezia (bright red blood per rectum) may have a bleeding source&#xD;
      proximal to the colon. Visualization of the entire gastrointestinal tract using a&#xD;
      second-generation colon capsule endoscopy system could improve diagnostic yields and form the&#xD;
      basis for a new approach to early diagnosis that could change guidelines and practice&#xD;
      management in these patients. The hypothesis of this study is that urgent colon capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy will have higher rates of lesion localization and diagnosis and reduced time to&#xD;
      diagnosis than the standard tagged red blood cell scanning and/or angiography. In this study,&#xD;
      the eligible patients with severe hematochezia are enrolled to undergo an evaluation with the&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy in addition to the standard tests including a tagged RBC scan and/or an&#xD;
      angiogram. The outcomes in terms of diagnostic yields of the capsule endoscopy will be&#xD;
      compared to the standard tests.&#xD;

      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no consensus guidelines for the best approach to patient with severe&#xD;
      hematochezia. One strategy is to perform an urgent colonoscopy (following a colon purge)&#xD;
      within 12-15 hours. Although this strategy has been associated with a decreased length of&#xD;
      hospitalization and an improved diagnostic and therapeutic yields, it has drawbacks. A major&#xD;
      disadvantage of performing an urgent colonoscopy is that the endoscopist can evaluate only&#xD;
      the colon and the distal ileum, while more proximal sources of bleeding are not evaluated.&#xD;
      Another limitation is that thorough cleansing of the colon is required to facilitate complete&#xD;
      evaluation, identification of stigmata of recent hemorrhage and lesion diagnosis. Urgent&#xD;
      colonoscopy is labor intense and relies on a dedicated bleeding team with expertise in both&#xD;
      diagnosis and hemostasis. Another option for patients with persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      hematochezia is to perform either a tagged RBC scan or an angiogram to identify the bleeding&#xD;
      location. However, these techniques also have major disadvantages, including low diagnostic&#xD;
      yields for severe hematochezia, requiring additional tests for diagnosis, and cannot visually&#xD;
      detect non-bleeding stigmata of hemorrhage on lesions that can be seen during colonoscopy or&#xD;
      by capsule endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study of patients who being admitted to the hospital for severe hematochezia or&#xD;
      inpatients who developed hematochezia after hospitalization for an unrelated non-GI bleeding&#xD;
      reason. Those who meet entry criteria and lack exclusions on screening before will being&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, patients will be a colon preparation prior to ingestion of the colon&#xD;
      capsule. The capsule recording system will be activated once patients swallow the capsule.&#xD;
      Once the capsule has been excreted or if the capsule stops recording images (usually 10 hours&#xD;
      after activation), the video recorder will then be taken to a workstation and the video will&#xD;
      be downloaded for reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to having the capsule endoscopy, all consented patients will undergo standard&#xD;
      tests for the initial diagnosis and management of severe hematochezia: tagged RBC scan and/or&#xD;
      computerized tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiogram, or&#xD;
      conventional angiography. Because of contra indication, MRI angiography will not be performed&#xD;
      until the capsule has been excreted, nor will CT angiography because the capsule may&#xD;
      interfere with interpretation. All patients will also have urgent colonoscopy after clearing&#xD;
      the colon of blood and stool with the purge. All of these diagnostic procedures will be&#xD;
      performed within 48 hours of GI consultation, but ideally as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a bleeding site is not identified by colonoscopy, further diagnostic workup are usually&#xD;
      performed as part of the standard of care, including anoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy,&#xD;
      push enteroscopy, or deep enteroscopy. If bleeding continues or worsens, surgery may be&#xD;
      necessary to control the bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GI endoscopist, nuclear medicine physician, and radiologist will be blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the capsule endoscopy until 24 hours after the other diagnostic tests (i.e. tagged&#xD;
      RBC scan, angiography, and endoscopy/colonoscopy) have been performed. Then the results of&#xD;
      all tests will be unblinded. This will be done for the purpose of not delaying clinical&#xD;
      management, but also to avoid biasing the interpretations of these diagnostic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Monitoring Demographic data and medical history including details of&#xD;
      co-morbid illnesses, risk factors, and characteristics of the GI bleeding will be recorded.&#xD;
      Reasons for exclusion will be documented. Baseline physical examinations, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology (ASA) classification, laboratory results, Blatchford-Glasgow score, units of&#xD;
      blood products transfused, and results of the real-time viewer will also be recorded. Results&#xD;
      of RBC scanning, angiography, capsule endoscopy, endoscopy, pathology, and surgery will be&#xD;
      recorded. The outcomes including rates of re-bleeding or persistent bleeding, treatment of&#xD;
      bleeding at endoscopy or radiology, need for surgery, major complications, transfusions after&#xD;
      initial resuscitation, hospital and intensive care unit days, and death will be prospectively&#xD;
      recorded up to the time of hospital discharge and 30 days following discharge. Subgroup&#xD;
      analysis regarding results of urgent colonoscopy/enteroscopy will be performed to assess for&#xD;
      differences in diagnostic yield and therapeutic interventions between different endoscopists.&#xD;
      The number of patients who experience any difficulties in capsule swallowing will be&#xD;
      recorded, including inability to swallow the capsule, incomplete examination of small bowel&#xD;
      or colon, and capsule retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Based on prior retrospective data in the CURE hemostasis database,&#xD;
      the investigators estimate that a sample of 46 patients would be required. Four additional&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in case of failure of the capsule to pass through the colon or&#xD;
      other problems with the capsule recording arise. The investigators will therefore perform the&#xD;
      study with a sample of 50 patients in two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of the study will be the diagnostic yield (defined as the frequency of&#xD;
      detection and percentage of positive results) for capsule endoscopy, tagged red blood cell&#xD;
      scan/angiography, and endoscopy for the localization of the bleeding site and/or etiologic&#xD;
      diagnosis (e.g. definitive if stigmata of recent hemorrhage are found or presumptive if a&#xD;
      clean lesion is diagnosed and no other lesions are found by complete evaluation). The&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of each technique will be calculated and compared by the McNemar test for&#xD;
      paired data using exact methods. The final diagnosis by endoscopy, angiography, pathology,&#xD;
      and surgery will be considered the gold standard. Concordance between each diagnostic&#xD;
      strategy will be calculated and reported with the kappa index. A P-value of less than 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary outcomes, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy which will be also&#xD;
      determined for each technique for lesion localization; absence of lesions in the foregut,&#xD;
      small bowel, or colon; and etiologic diagnosis (definitive or presumptive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be physically and electronically secured. All personal information will be&#xD;
      replaced with a code de-identifying subject's information. The researchers will do their best&#xD;
      to make sure that all subject's private information is kept confidential as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Records will be labelled with a code number and then only de-identified&#xD;
      information will be entered into our encrypted Statistical Analysis System (SAS) electronic&#xD;
      database located at the VA West Los Angeles. No identifiable information about them will be&#xD;
      kept in the electronic research data files. All personal information will be replaced with a&#xD;
      code. A list linking the code and their identifiable information will be kept separate from&#xD;
      the research data files in a locked file in the research team's office located at VA West Los&#xD;
      Angeles. (VA CURE GI Hemostasis Research Unit). This list will be protected by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (Dennis Jensen, MD) and the research team. At the end of the study, the&#xD;
      investigators will destroy this link and no one - not even the researchers - will be able to&#xD;
      connect their identity to the research data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Use of Data After the study finishes, the research team will continue to use the&#xD;
      patient's de-identified medical data from their medical history, laboratory results, labs,&#xD;
      radiological, surgical, and pathology results, and colonoscopy results and information on&#xD;
      their medical progress to continue to analyze and to report new GI research results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events The following adverse event information will be prospectively collected:&#xD;
      capsule retention rates and those requiring endoscopic removal, perforations, aspiration,&#xD;
      myocardial infarctions, strokes, and deaths within 30 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency Safety data will be collected daily while hospitalized and weekly after discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital, up to 30 days after enrollment. Data collection will start as soon as the&#xD;
      patient enrolls in the study and swallows the capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review Cumulative safety data will be reviewed every 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events (SAE's) will be reported to the IRB as mandated by the VA research&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety data will be overseen by the PI and the biostatistician. All results will be&#xD;
      reported to the IRB, who will review all SAE's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon widespread utilization and safety of capsule endoscopy for small bowel bleeding&#xD;
      since 2001 in the U.S. and many other countries worldwide, the investigators do not expect&#xD;
      any clinical condition which would trigger an immediate suspension of this research study.&#xD;
