    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether Acelarin (NUC-1031) is superior to&#xD;
      gemcitabine in terms of overall survival for treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      carcinoma. In addition disease progression, quality of life and comparative safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Secondary objectives are to compare between the two treatment groups the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological Response and disease control rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional, exploratory objectives are to discover and validate possible biomarkers to&#xD;
      predict additional benefit of Acelarin (NUC-1031) over gemcitabine alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer remains the most lethal of solid tumours with little progress being made to&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes over the past 30 years of research. The incidence in the UK is&#xD;
      approximately 9,000 new cases per year and, with a 5 year survival remaining at just 3%,&#xD;
      mortality approximates incidence. These dismal outcomes reflect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Advanced stage at presentation such that only a minority of patients are suitable for&#xD;
           surgery with curative intent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High rates of recurrence even in those undergoing radical surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Limited efficacy of systemic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Until recently, the mainstay of systemic therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer was&#xD;
           gemcitabine, based on the pivotal study in 1997 by Burris et al., reporting a survival&#xD;
           and clinical benefit when compared with 5-FU. However, this benefit is modest with&#xD;
           median and 1-year survival of approximately 6 months and 20% respectively for patients&#xD;
           with metastatic disease. Combination chemotherapy has shown more promising results but&#xD;
           at the expense of significant toxicity limiting this to younger patients with good&#xD;
           performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although these chemotherapy combinations confer a survival advantage over gemcitabine,&#xD;
           their use is restricted to a cohort of patients able, and willing, to tolerate&#xD;
           additional toxicity. Pancreatic cancer is commonly associated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) increasing age; (ii) co-morbidities (for example, diabetes mellitus which, if&#xD;
           associated with peripheral neuropathy, may limit the safe administration of neurotoxic&#xD;
           drugs such as oxaliplatin and nab-paclitaxel); (iii) symptoms that negatively impact on&#xD;
           performance status; (iv) biliary obstruction requiring stenting, with associated risks&#xD;
           of sepsis and impaired drug metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, for a large proportion of patients single agent gemcitabine remains an appropriate&#xD;
           standard chemotherapy. For this group of patients, more efficacious and better tolerated&#xD;
           treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is being performed to investigate whether Acelarin provides improvement in&#xD;
           overall survival compared with gemcitabine. This is a pivotal study in this indication&#xD;
           and will represent the landmark data for whether there is additional benefit from&#xD;
           Acelarin in pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gemcitabine monotherapy, the control arm, remains a standard of care in this disease.&#xD;
           The only treatments that have shown improved outcome over gemcitabine are Folfirinox and&#xD;
           nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine. However, the application of these&#xD;
           regimens to a large proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer is limited by the&#xD;
           potential for significant toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acelarin (NUC-1031) is a first-in-class nucleotide analogue, which uses novel&#xD;
           phosphoramidate technology to overcome the key cancer resistance mechanisms associated&#xD;
           with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acelarin is synthesised as a pre-activated molecule bearing one protected phosphate&#xD;
           group, termed the phosphoramidate motif, imparting several potential advantages to this&#xD;
           new agent over gemcitabine:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acelarin (NUC-1031) overcomes the reliance on nucleoside transporters to cross the&#xD;
                cellular membrane for effective uptake by the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acelarin (NUC-1031) presents the cell with an already partially activated&#xD;
                (monophosphate) form of the nucleoside, thereby obviating the need for the rate&#xD;
                limiting initial kinase activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acelarin (NUC-1031) is protected from enzymatic breakdown (especially by deaminases&#xD;
                and phosphorylases) resulting in greater stability and a reduction in the&#xD;
                generation of toxic metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinical relevance of these resistance mechanisms has been well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multiple active nucleoside transporters located in the cell membrane carry out the&#xD;
           transport of nucleoside analogues, such as gemcitabine, into the cells. The human&#xD;
           equilibrative nucleoside transporter, hENT1 mediates the majority of gemcitabine uptake.&#xD;
           It is therefore expected that hENT1-deficient cells are highly resistant to gemcitabine&#xD;
           (Achiwa et al., Cancer Sci. 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nucleoside transport deficiency is an important predictive factor for gemcitabine&#xD;
           response in patients with cancer. Spratlin et al.,demonstrated that the presence of&#xD;
           nucleoside transporters correlated with improved response to gemcitabine and OS in&#xD;
           patients with pancreatic cancer (Spratlin et al Clin Cancer Res. 2004). Patients&#xD;
           expressing hENT1 had a median survival of 13 months compared to only 4 months in&#xD;
           patients with little or no hENT1 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acelarin has been shown to overcome the need for hENT1 active transport to enter the&#xD;
           cancer cells. The greater lipophilicity allows Acelarin to cross the cell membrane&#xD;
           independently of nucleoside transporters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To become active, nucleoside analogues require sequential steps of phosphorylation&#xD;
           within the cancer cells. Deficiency in dCK is a frequently described form of in-vitro&#xD;
           and in-vivo inherent as well as acquired resistance to gemcitabine. Acelarin is&#xD;
           synthesised as a monophosphate agent and, as such, has by-passed the rate limiting step&#xD;
           of kinase-dependent activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acelarin bears a phosphoramidate moiety on the ribose 5' carbon, which protects the&#xD;
           compound from deamination (Slusarczyk et al J Med Chem 2014) , which may confer&#xD;
           considerable survival advantages and a more favourable safety profile (Ghazali et al JCO&#xD;
           322:5s, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is planned to perform this study in approximately 40 UK centres with additional&#xD;
           centres in Europe and the USA with a centre defined as the primary institution of the&#xD;
           clinical investigator. Recruitment will be competitive and 328 patients will be&#xD;
           randomised in a 1:1 fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation will be stratified by ECOG performance status (PS) (0/1 vs 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 28 days prior to&#xD;
           first treatment and first treatment will be delivered within 8 days of randomisation or&#xD;
           the earliest screening procedure, e.g. blood samples, CT scan whichever is sooner as&#xD;
           follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm A (experimental arm): Acelarin (NUC-1031)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acelarin: 825 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15&#xD;
           of a 28 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm B (standard therapeutic arm): Gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gemcitabine: 1000mg/m2 administered intravenously as a 30 minute infusion on days 1, 8&#xD;
           and 15 of a 28 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be seen on a weekly basis during the time they are on active treatment and&#xD;
           will be treated until disease progression. At the completion of therapy, an end-of&#xD;
           therapy visit must be completed within 7 days after the decision is made to discontinue&#xD;
           all therapy. This must be a full assessment consisting of physical exam, Performance&#xD;
           Status, ECG, haematology and chemistry profile and toxicity/AE assessments, after which&#xD;
           follow up will then occur every 12 weeks. CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will&#xD;
           take place at screening then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression as per&#xD;
           RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           No further anti-tumour treatment will be initiated until progression of disease. AE&#xD;
           information will be collected until at least 30 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
           therapy is administered or until all study therapy-related AEs have resolved, stabilised&#xD;
           or been deemed irreversible and a 30 day safety follow up should be performed at this&#xD;
           point.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A phase I/II clinical study has established the RP2D and schedule for Acelarin as 825&#xD;
           mg/m2 administered intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Two dose&#xD;
           limiting toxicities were observed (grade 3 transaminitis at 725mg/m2 and grade 4&#xD;
           thrombocytopenia at 750mg/m2). Otherwise treatment was well-tolerated with no unexpected&#xD;
           adverse events. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate with the most common&#xD;
           grade 1 and 2 AEs being anaemia, fatigue, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia. Only three&#xD;
           patients experienced grade 4 AEs: thrombocytopenia, hypomagnesaemia and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following precautionary measures will also be put in place:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of full blood count, renal function and liver function will be made&#xD;
                prior to each administration of Acelarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The occurrence of haematological toxicity including neutropenia and&#xD;
                thrombocytopenia which requires dose adjustment is specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The effect of renal impairment on exposure to Acelarin in patients with renal&#xD;
                impairment is not known. Therefore study entry is restricted to patients with&#xD;
                creatinine clearance ≥ 30mL/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acelarin should not be administered to pregnant women. A negative pregnancy test&#xD;
                should be confirmed before administration of Acelarin for all women of childbearing&#xD;
                age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There is no known antidote for Acelarin, and treatment of AEs associated with its&#xD;
                use should be for the underlying adverse symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Since Acelarin will be reconstituted in specialist oncology pharmacies and&#xD;
                administered by experienced chemotherapy-trained nurses via intravenous injection,&#xD;
                overdose is considered to be highly unlikely. There is no specific treatment for an&#xD;
                overdose of Acelarin. In case of overdose, therapy may be interrupted, and any&#xD;
                adverse reactions treated symptomatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of full blood count, renal function and liver function will be made prior to&#xD;
           each administration of gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The occurrence of haematological toxicity including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia&#xD;
           which requires dose adjustment is specified in the protocol.&#xD;
