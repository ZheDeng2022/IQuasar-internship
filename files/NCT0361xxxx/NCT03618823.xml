    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if non-opioid pain control is a safe way to manage&#xD;
      pain after adenotonsillectomy surgery in children. The investigators will be randomly&#xD;
      assigning children aged 3-17 to one of two groups: one group will receive non-opioid pain&#xD;
      medication only, and the other group will receive opioid and non-opioid medications for pain&#xD;
      control. The investigators will analyze the data and determine if there is a difference in&#xD;
      pain control between the two drug regimens, and if there are any other associated&#xD;
      complications between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is important because if we can demonstrate that there is little difference in&#xD;
      outcomes and pain control between the two groups, a strong argument can be made for reducing&#xD;
      or eliminating opioid prescription after adenotonsillectomy. This may protect future children&#xD;
      from the risks of taking opioid medications and help to reduce the scope of the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: To determine if non-opioid pain control is a safe and effective option in the&#xD;
      treatment of post-operative pain following adenotonsillectomy in various pediatric age&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The subject population will be patients between the ages of 3 and 17 who will&#xD;
      undergo adenotonsillectomy. The study will consist of two unblinded arms - patients receiving&#xD;
      standard pain control regimen which include opioids and non-opioids, and patients receiving&#xD;
      non-opioid pain medications only. In the diary they will receive, patients or caregivers will&#xD;
      record quantity and dosage of pain medication taken each day, a survey, and pain ratings&#xD;
      measured by the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. Within 4-8 weeks post-operatively the&#xD;
      patients will return for a follow up appointment along with their diary. Demographic&#xD;
      information such as age, race, gender, household income will be extracted from the diary and&#xD;
      the electronic medical record. Information such as surgical technique, concurrent operations,&#xD;
      post-operative pain prescription (types, weight based dosage, and total days prescribed) will&#xD;
      be extracted from the electronic medical record and recorded as well. Outcomes measured will&#xD;
      include pain scale rating and rates of complications between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If it can be demonstrated that non-opioid pain control after adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      does not lead to increased pain or worse outcomes in certain pediatric age groups, a strong&#xD;
      argument can be made for the cessation of opioid prescription for these ages following&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy. Given the widespread opioid epidemic, this would be a significant step in&#xD;
      curbing the massive opioid problem, as well as reducing the adverse effects of opioid usage&#xD;
      in pediatric populations.&#xD;

    <measure>Average Pain Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Average pain over 14 post-operative days before and after medications. This is quantified using the validated Wong-Baker FACES pain metric. Patients receive a take-home pain diary and for 14 days report their maximum pain both before and after taking pain medication. The mean of these pain ratings will be the primary outcome measure. The Wong-Baker FACES scale is from 0 (min) to 10 (max). A higher score indicates worse outcome/pain.</description>

          <description>Patients in this group will be receiving triple therapy for pain control with oxycodone, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. They will be asked to complete a pain diary which will be used to determine the level of pain control achieved with this regimen. The diary will be completed by post-operative day 14. A post-operative appointment between 4-8 weeks will be scheduled and the patient and caregiver will return the pain diary.&#xD;
Oxycodone: Oxycodone will be prescribed at a dose in the range of 0.025 mg/kg to 0.10 mg/kg every four hours or as needed for adequate pain management. The total supply will be limited to seven days. It will be prescribed in liquid suspension form for ease of use in pediatric populations.&#xD;
Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen will be prescribed at 10 mg/kg to be taken every 6 hours for the first three post-operative days. After the first three days, the subject should take the ibuprofen every 6 hours as needed for pain control. The daily dose of ibuprofen is not to exceed 1200mg or more than 4 individual doses.&#xD;

Oxycodone: Oxycodone will be prescribed at a dose in the range of 0.025 mg/kg to 0.10 mg/kg every four hours or as needed for adequate pain management. The total supply will be limited to seven days. It will be prescribed in liquid suspension form for ease of use in pediatric populations.&#xD;
Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen will be prescribed at 10 mg/kg to be taken every 6 hours for the first three post-operative days.

            <description>Patients in this group will be receiving triple therapy for pain control with oxycodone, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. They will be asked to complete a pain diary which will be used to determine the level of pain control achieved with this regimen. The diary will be completed by post-operative day 14. A post-operative appointment between 4-8 weeks will be scheduled and the patient and caregiver will return the pain diary.&#xD;
Oxycodone: Oxycodone will be prescribed at a dose in the range of 0.025 mg/kg to 0.10 mg/kg every four hours or as needed for adequate pain management. The total supply will be limited to seven days. It will be prescribed in liquid suspension form for ease of use in pediatric populations.&#xD;
Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen will be prescribed at 10 mg/kg to be taken every 6 hours for the first three post-operative days. After the first three days, the subject should take the ibuprofen every 6 hours as needed for pain control. The daily dose of ibuprofen is not to exceed 1200mg or more than 4 individual doses.&#xD;
Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen will be prescribed at 15mg/kg to be taken every 4 hours for the first three days, except when sleeping. After the first three days, the subject should take the acetaminophen every 4 hours as needed for pain control. The daily dose of acetaminophen is not to exceed 5 doses in 24 hours.</description>

            <description>Patients in this group will be receiving triple therapy for pain control with oxycodone, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. They will be asked to complete a pain diary which will be used to determine the level of pain control achieved with this regimen. The diary will be completed by post-operative day 14. A post-operative appointment between 4-8 weeks will be scheduled and the patient and caregiver will return the pain diary.&#xD;
Oxycodone: Oxycodone will be prescribed at a dose in the range of 0.025 mg/kg to 0.10 mg/kg every four hours or as needed for adequate pain management. The total supply will be limited to seven days. It will be prescribed in liquid suspension form for ease of use in pediatric populations.&#xD;
Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen will be prescribed at 10 mg/kg to be taken every 6 hours for the first three post-operative days. After the first three days, the subject should take the ibuprofen every 6 hours as needed for pain control. The daily dose of ibuprofen is not to exceed 1200mg or more than 4 individual doses.&#xD;
Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen will be prescribed at 15mg/kg to be taken every 4 hours for the first three days, except when sleeping. After the first three days, the subject should take the acetaminophen every 4 hours as needed for pain control. The daily dose of acetaminophen is not to exceed 5 doses in 24 hours.</description>
