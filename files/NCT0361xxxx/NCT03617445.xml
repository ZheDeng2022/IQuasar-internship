  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to examine the effect of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) compared&#xD;
      with vancomycin for cure of recurrent C. diff infection (CDI) in solid organ transplant (SOT)&#xD;
      recipients in a randomized, controlled clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile (C.difficile) is a pathogen of major public health importance,&#xD;
      especially in individuals with comorbid conditions such as solid organ transplantation (SOT).&#xD;
      The incidence and adverse outcomes of CDI are greatly amplified in the setting of SOT, due to&#xD;
      healthcare exposure, antibiotic use and immunosuppression, all of which are ubiquitous in SOT&#xD;
      recipients. There are currently no effective treatment options to achieve a sustained cure of&#xD;
      recurrent CDI and prevent further recurrence in SOT recipients. A novel approach that has&#xD;
      recently gained attention is restoration of the CDI impaired gut microbiome by instillation&#xD;
      of stool from a healthy donor into the intestine of a CDI patient. This treatment, called&#xD;
      Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has been found in non-comparative studies to reduce&#xD;
      CDI recurrence dramatically with a reported efficacy of over 95%, however its efficacy in SOT&#xD;
      recipients has not been studied and cannot be extrapolated from results in the non-SOT&#xD;
      population because SOT recipients are a unique study population due to profound&#xD;
      immunosuppression, frequent antibiotic use and frequent opportunities for exposure to CDI all&#xD;
      of which markedly, repeatedly and persistently disrupt the gut microbiome. Thus, this&#xD;
      critical gap in the field needs to be addressed by a trial of FMT in SOT recipients with CDI.&#xD;
