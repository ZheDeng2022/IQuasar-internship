      -  Patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (P.F.O.A) is a highly prevalent disease and an&#xD;
           important source of anterior knee pain and Disability during daily activities (kneeling,&#xD;
           squatting, climbing stairs, getting up from low chair.( 3,5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coexisting Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) and Tibiofemoral O.A disease is a common&#xD;
           radiographic pattern of knee OA observed in older adults with knee pain. In addition,&#xD;
           symptomatic disease and reduced function are more likely to be found if radiographic OA&#xD;
           changes are present in both the TF and PF compartment also it demonstrates features&#xD;
           distinctly different from those observed in Tibiofemoral O.A without presence of&#xD;
           Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) . More specifically, &quot;Moderate/Severe PFOA&quot; seems&#xD;
           to be associated with lower limb impairments of lower knee extension strength and&#xD;
           limitations of knee range of motion. (14)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (14,6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High tibial osteotomy (HTO) with medial opening wedge has gained in popularity over&#xD;
           recent years and is used for the treatment of medial compartmental osteoarthritis (OA)&#xD;
           but not for anterior knee pain (P.F.O.A). This procedure is appealing because of the&#xD;
           high preservation of the knee joint relative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or&#xD;
           unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High tibial osteotomy (HTO) can cause alterations in patellar height (Patella baja) and&#xD;
           alignment which can increase contact stress and eventually lead to anterior Knee pain&#xD;
           (13,17)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The findings indicate that anterior knee pain might be due to OA progression in the&#xD;
           patellofemoral joint after HTO (11,12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patellofemoral OA and Cartilage injuries in PF joints tended to progress after Open&#xD;
           Wedge HTO which proven by second lock arthroscopy. a significant proportion of patients&#xD;
           (about 20%) had grade II OA of the patellofemoral joint at final follow-Up 2yrs. (7,8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior knee pain also were quite high (28% and 32% in the opening- and closing-wedge&#xD;
           groups) after surgery. Although there are several possible causes for anterior knee pain&#xD;
           after HTO, such as surgery itself, alteration of patellar alignment, and OA change in&#xD;
           the patellofemoral joint ,patients with severe anterior knee pain were found to have&#xD;
           grade II patellofemoral OA. (7,8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In spite of its high prevalence, treatment of this painful disorder (PFOA) is&#xD;
           challenging due to the diversity of causes of the disorder and the lack of knowledge on&#xD;
           articular regeneration, little information is available in the literature about the best&#xD;
           conservative or surgical treatment options.(3,5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-operative treatment options for patellofemoral osteoarthritis include patellar&#xD;
           bracing, physical therapy intervention, corticosteroid injections, patellar taping, and&#xD;
           strengthening of the quadriceps muscle, this is considered a potential short-term fix&#xD;
           for many patients. Ultimately, surgical treatment is necessary to provide a long-term&#xD;
           solutions. which include Patellofemoral arthroplasty, total knee replacement with&#xD;
           patellar resurfacing,(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arthroscopic circumpatellar denervation, this joint-preserving, minimal invasive&#xD;
           technique provides relief of anterior knee pain. Moreover, this technique provide a&#xD;
           faster recovery period immediately after surgery and less morbidity (1,18,19)&#xD;
           Arthroscopy will be done in all cases before osteotomy to assess lat. Comp and grade of&#xD;
           patellofemoral O.A Arthroscopic patellar denervation with vaper or diathermy will be&#xD;
           done plus open wedge high tibial osteotomy in one group and other group OWHTO only will&#xD;
           be done comparing the rustles of two groups to assess the efficacy of this procedure&#xD;

      followed by an average follow up to 12 months. And follow up( 6th weeks ,3rd month ,6th month&#xD;
