      The main objective of this multi-site project is to compare the effects of 12 weeks of HIIT&#xD;
      vs. MICT on brain plasticity. The effects of HIIT vs. MICT on cardiovascular health,&#xD;
      psychosocial predictors of physical activity and motor function will also be compared. HIIT&#xD;
      and MICT will be delivered through a whole-body exercise paradigm using a recumbent stepper&#xD;
      that requires arm and leg forces. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0, 0 weeks), at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention (T1, 12 weeks) and at 8-week follow-up (T2, 20 weeks).&#xD;

      Background: Stroke is a major health issue in Canada, with 405,000 Canadians currently living&#xD;
      with stroke. Exercise is an important component of stroke rehabilitation that can result in&#xD;
      improved function and health. Traditionally, exercise rehabilitation programs for stroke&#xD;
      employ moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) protocols that are typically sustained&#xD;
      for 20-30 minutes. The continuous nature of this form of training however, even at moderate&#xD;
      intensities, is challenging for many individuals with stroke to sustain due to neuromotor&#xD;
      impairments and poor exercise capacity. High-intensity exercise, when delivered in short&#xD;
      interval bursts (i.e. high-intensity interval training, HIIT), may be a feasible alternative&#xD;
      that allows higher intensities to be achieved during exercise. This is important because&#xD;
      intensity of training is the critical factor in promoting changes in neuroplasticity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular health, the two most important aspects of recovery and secondary prevention&#xD;
      after stroke. Interventions implemented earlier following stroke are generally viewed to&#xD;
      yield greater benefits, but high intensity exercise may also promote neuroplasticity and&#xD;
      optimize cardiovascular health in later stages of recovery. Furthermore, determining if HIIT&#xD;
      is viewed to be motivating and enjoyable for individuals post-stroke can provide insight into&#xD;
      the sustainability of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the effects of 12 weeks of HIIT and MICT on neuroplasticity,&#xD;
      cardiovascular health and psychosocial predictors of physical activity in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will be recruited from two research sites and randomly allocated into&#xD;
      HIIT or MICT. Participants will be assessed before and after the training period, and at an&#xD;
      8-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: 1) The investigators will assess: Neuroplasticity: by measuring markers of&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability at rest and in response to a non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      protocol applied over the primary motor cortex (M1); 2) Cardiovascular health: by measuring&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, resting blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and waist-hip ratio;&#xD;
      3) Psychosocial predictors of physical activity: by measuring exercise motivation and&#xD;
      enjoyment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Neuroplasticity: motor evoked potentials amplitude, intracortical facilitation and&#xD;
      short-intracortical inhibition on the lesioned and unlesioned upper limb M1 area at rest and&#xD;
      in response to continuous theta-burst will be measured with transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation; Cardiovascular health: cardiorespiratory fitness will be measured with a graded&#xD;
      exercise test, resting blood pressure with an automated blood pressure monitor and arterial&#xD;
      stiffness using applanation tonometry. Exercise motivation and enjoyment will be assessed&#xD;
      with the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale and the Behavioral Regulation Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire-3, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Both HIIT and MICT will result in improvements in outcomes of&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and cardiovascular health. However, improvements with HIIT will be greater&#xD;
      and will last longer. Participants will rate HIIT as enjoyable as MICT, and motivation for&#xD;
      exercise will increase similarly after both interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: HIIT is a promising, time-efficient, and potentially more effective alternative to&#xD;
      traditional MICT protocols that could offer an opportunity for greater improvement in motor&#xD;
      recovery and cardiovascular health in people living with stroke.&#xD;

    <description>Intensity will be determined using a combination of heart rate reserve (HRR, calculated as HRR= [max HR - resting HR] x [% training] + [resting HR]) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). The protocol will involve 10 60-second intervals of high intensity interspersed with 9 60-second low-intensity intervals. The initial high intensity intervals will start at 80% of the HRR (RPE=14-17) and progress by 10% every 4 weeks. Low intensity intervals will be performed at 30% of HRR (RPE=9-11). Three-minute warm-up and 2-minute cool-down periods will be performed at 30% of HRR. Total HIIT time including warm-up and cool-down is 24 minutes.</description>
