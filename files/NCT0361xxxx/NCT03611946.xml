    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      single dose of the live attenuated Zika vaccine rZIKV/D4Δ30-713 in adults with no history of&#xD;
      previous flavivirus infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of&#xD;
      the live attenuated Zika vaccine rZIKV/D4Δ30-713 in adults with no history of previous&#xD;
      flavivirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either rZIKV/D4Δ30-713 or&#xD;
      placebo at study entry (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur on Days 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, and 180.&#xD;
      Visits may include a physical examination; blood, urine, saliva, nasopharyngeal (NP) or&#xD;
      midturbinate swab, vaginal secretions, and semen collection; and pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR (nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab) will be performed during screening and&#xD;
      on days 0, 8, and 14.&#xD;

             contraception include hormonal birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, surgical sterilization, and intrauterine device. All female subjects will&#xD;

             internal female organs will be considered of childbearing potential and should be&#xD;
             willing to use effective contraception during the trial. Exception: Females who have&#xD;
             sex with females (exclusively) and have no intention of conceiving a child during the&#xD;
             study will not be required to use contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males only: Males of reproductive potential should be willing to use barrier&#xD;
             contraception for the first 3 months following vaccination* and agree to not donate&#xD;
