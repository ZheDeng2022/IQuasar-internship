  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and how well stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab before surgery work in treating&#xD;
      participants with human papillomavirus positive oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer.&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays&#xD;
      directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to&#xD;
      normal tissue. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy and&#xD;
      durvalumab with or without tremelimumab before surgery may work better in treating&#xD;
      participants with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability associated with the following treatment regimens:&#xD;
      Cohort 1: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and durvalumab, followed by transoral&#xD;
      robotic surgery (TORS) and adjuvant durvalumab and cohort 2: SBRT and durvalumab +&#xD;
      tremelimumab, followed by TORS and adjuvant durvalumab. (Phase I safety lead-in) II. To&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of the treatment combination deemed safe from Phase I in terms of&#xD;
      progression free survival, in order to determine the non-inferiority of tumor control&#xD;
      (progression-free survival [PFS] of 85% at 2 years) compared to conventional large field&#xD;
      adjuvant radiotherapy +/- concurrent chemotherapy. (Phase II) III. To determine Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3+ acute and chronic toxicities at the&#xD;
      end of radiation, after surgery, at the end of adjuvant immunotherapy infusion, at 3 month,&#xD;
      at 6 month, at 1 year, and at 2 years. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate to durvalumab +/- tremelimumab + SBRT prior to&#xD;
      TORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the rate of subclinical lymph node involvement at time of TORS and neck&#xD;
      dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the rate of contra-lateral neck failure with medial oropharyngeal and base&#xD;
      of tongue primary lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the potential salvage rate. V. To determine the locoregional control,&#xD;
      distant control, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the incidence of all toxicity associated with treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine the short- and long-term quality of life of patients on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the impact of KRAS gene-variant mutation on immune response and treatment&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the impact of PI3K gene mutation on immune response and treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Saliva samples to evaluate biomarkers for immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) to be collected prior to treatment,&#xD;
      at time of TORS, and at each yearly follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Blood samples to evaluate biomarkers of immune response to HPV associated OPSCC to be&#xD;
      collected prior to treatment, at time of TORS, and at each yearly follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Tumor tissue taken at the time of initial biopsy and at time of resection will be profiled&#xD;
      for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; activation markers and antigen specific T-cell receptor&#xD;
      (TCR) utilization/diversity will be evaluated for additional checkpoint targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. On long-term follow-up, tumor antigen specific T lymphocyte memory populations will be&#xD;
      monitored for representation and robustness in in-vitro stimulation assays as potential&#xD;
      biomarker of continued anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Immortalization of tumor infiltrating B-cells for identification of antigen presenting&#xD;
      complex, antibody specificity, and potential serologic markers of continuing long-term immune&#xD;
      response in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 or 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Beginning day 0 of course 1, participants undergo stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy 5 days a week for 1 week and receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 0 and 27 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants&#xD;
      then undergo transoral robotic surgery and modified radical neck dissection between weeks&#xD;
      6-8. Beginning week 12, participants then receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Beginning day 0 of course 1, participants undergo stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy 5 days a week for 1 week and receive tremelimumab IV and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 0 and 27 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants&#xD;
      then undergo transoral robotic surgery and modified radical neck dissection between weeks&#xD;
      6-8. Beginning week 12, participants then receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years&#xD;
      and then periodically thereafter.&#xD;
