      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system helps the body fight infections. Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs)&#xD;
      are diseases that make it easier for people to get sick. Many PIDs are inherited. This means&#xD;
      parents can pass them on to their children. Knowing what causes a person s PID is important&#xD;
      to decide what treatment to give them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test samples from people with a PID or people related to someone with a PID to find out&#xD;
      what causes PIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 99 or younger who have a PID or have a relative with a PID&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history over the phone. They may need to give&#xD;
      permission for researchers talk to their doctors about their health. Their relatives may be&#xD;
      contacted to see if they want to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give samples. These could be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood: Participants blood will be taken from a vein in an arm, or with a prick on the finger&#xD;
      or heel for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva, urine, or stool: Participants will provide each sample in a special cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nose or cheek swab: Participants will rub the skin inside their nose or cheek using a cotton&#xD;
      swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cord blood: If participants have a baby during the study, blood will be collected from the&#xD;
      baby s umbilical cord after it is born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from medical procedures: If, during the study, the participants have a medical&#xD;
      procedure that collects samples, the samples may be used for the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a sample collection protocol to receive send-in samples (blood, tissue, and other&#xD;
      bodily fluids) from patients with known or suspected primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID)&#xD;
      and their relatives. Under this protocol, genetic and molecular tests will be performed on&#xD;
      samples to improve understanding of PIDs and immune system abnormalities. Findings relevant&#xD;
      to participants health and medical care will be returned to them and their referring&#xD;
      healthcare providers.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants enrolled onto this protocol must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 0-99 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meets 1 of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patient with a clinical diagnosis of a form of PID (either known or suspected).&#xD;
                  PID may be defined by laboratory and/or clinical findings on 2 or more occasions&#xD;
                  that are consistent with a defect in innate or adaptive immunity. Specific PIDs&#xD;
                  are defined by the guidelines of the International Union of Immunological&#xD;
                  Societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Biological relative of an individual meeting criterion 2a, with no clinical&#xD;
                  evidence of having a PID. Relatives may be mother, father, siblings, children,&#xD;
                  grandparents, aunts, uncles, or first cousins to an individual with a known or&#xD;
                  suspected PID.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing to allow genetic testing and allow biospecimens to be modified into induced&#xD;
             pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to allow storage of samples and data for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from study&#xD;
        participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of secondary causes of immunodeficiency (eg, HIV infection, immunodeficiency&#xD;
             from chronic use of immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents), at the discretion&#xD;
             of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION/EXCLUSION OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children: Children are eligible to participate in this study because PIDs may present in&#xD;
        early childhood and results of some research tests may inform participants future medical&#xD;
        care. Additionally, the study poses no more than minimal risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women and neonates: Pregnant women can participate in this study. Research testing&#xD;
        on samples from pregnant women may help us learn about changes in the immune systems of&#xD;
        immunodeficient patients during pregnancy, which is important knowledge that could not be&#xD;
        obtained from nonpregnant individuals. Research testing of pregnant women with known or&#xD;
        suspected PIDs could provide insight into the fetus s health risks, which may help guide&#xD;
        clinical management during and after pregnancy. We may request cord blood samples at&#xD;
        delivery to process right away or freeze. Cord blood is a unique source of stromal cells&#xD;
        that may be characterized or modified for research purposes. Additionally, this study poses&#xD;
        no more than minimal risk, including to participants who are pregnant and their fetuses.&#xD;
        Similarly, neonates (including nonviable neonates or those of uncertain viability) may be&#xD;
        enrolled in this study as it does not involve more than minimal risk and blood volumes will&#xD;
        be limited based on the clinical status of each participant. Each individual providing&#xD;
        consent will be fully informed regarding the reasonably foreseeable impact of the research&#xD;
        on the neonate, and individuals engaged in the research will have no part in determining&#xD;
        the viability of a neonate. Further, neonates of uncertain viability are eligible because&#xD;
        all the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Many PIDs are rare and present early in life, and it is possible that the&#xD;
             manifestations of a known or suspected PID may impact the viability of the neonate.&#xD;
             Research testing of neonates with known or suspected PIDs could provide insight into&#xD;
             current and future health risks, which may provide guidance for medical management and&#xD;
             thus benefit the neonate and possibly enhance the probability of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The only risks of study participation are the risks of blood draw. When possible,&#xD;
             blood for this study will be collected at the time of clinically indicated blood draws&#xD;
             so that there is no additional needlestick, and blood volumes will be limited based on&#xD;
             the clinical status of each participant. Collection of blood is the only possible&#xD;
             method to conduct the research testing under this protocol that may directly benefit&#xD;
             the neonate by revealing insights about health risks and medical management. Thus, the&#xD;
             risk is the least possible for achieving that objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The legally effective informed consent of either parent of the neonate or, if neither&#xD;
             parent is able to consent because of unavailability, incompetence, or temporary&#xD;
             incapacity, the legally effective informed consent of either parent's legally&#xD;
             authorized representative is obtained, except that the consent of the father or his&#xD;
             legally authorized representative need not be obtained if the pregnancy resulted from&#xD;
             rape or incest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nonviable neonates are also eligible because all the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vital functions of the neonate will not be artificially maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The research will not terminate the heartbeat or respiration of the neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood will only be collected from nonviable neonates at the time of clinically&#xD;
             indicated blood draws so that there is no additional needlestick, and blood volumes&#xD;
             will be limited based on the clinical status of each participant. Therefore, there&#xD;
             will be no added risk to the neonate resulting from the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As described above, many known or suspected PIDs are rare and can present early during&#xD;
             life, and it is possible that their manifestations may impact the viability of the&#xD;
             neonate. This protocol aims to achieve characterization of such disorders, and this&#xD;
             aim could not be achieved for certain disorders if nonviable neonates are excluded.&#xD;
             Thus, the purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge&#xD;
             that cannot be obtained by other means.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The legally effective informed consent of both parents of the neonate will be&#xD;
             obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Decisionally impaired adults: Adults who are unable to consent are excluded from study&#xD;
        participation. Enrolled participants who temporarily lose the ability to consent during&#xD;
        study participation may continue in the study in accordance with NIH Human Research&#xD;
        Protections Program (HRPP) Policy 403 Research with Subjects Lacking Capacity to Consent;&#xD;
        the study poses no more than minimal risk and may hold a prospect of direct benefit as&#xD;
        results of some research tests may inform participants future medical care. However,&#xD;
        enrolled participants who permanently lose the ability to consent during study&#xD;
        participation will be withdrawn.&#xD;
