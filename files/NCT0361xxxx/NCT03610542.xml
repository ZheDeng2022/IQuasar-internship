    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical and cost effectiveness of test anxiety as a form of&#xD;
      selective prevention for clinical anxiety. Participants will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy without booster sessions, cognitive behavioural therapy with&#xD;
      two booster sessions, or a no intervention control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Test anxiety affects a substantial proportion of adolescents, who show an increased risk of&#xD;
      suicide, and of developing clinical anxiety and poor mental health. Externally resourced&#xD;
      school-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in treating test anxiety. Intervening in test anxiety, a sub-clinical anxiety, may&#xD;
      prevent anxieties from developing into a clinical disorder. The primary outcomes are test&#xD;
      anxiety, clinical anxiety, and wellbeing, measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up. In addition, to identify treatment mechanisms additional measures are&#xD;
      taken of uncertain control, metacognition, and emotional regulation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Test Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Change assessed over a 12 month period</time_frame>
    <description>The Test Anxiety Inventory is a 20 item measure measured on a 4-point scale (1 = Almost Never, 4 = Almost Always). Three scores are provided: Total (20 items), worry subscale (8 items) and emotionality (8 items). The total score range is 20-80 and the worry and emotionality subscale scores are 8-32. A higher score represents higher anxiety. This will administered 4 times over a 12 month period to assess change: Baseline, 6 weeks (immediate-post intervention), 6-month follow-up and 12 month follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Metacognition Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change assessed over a 12 month period</time_frame>
    <description>The Metacognition Questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire that consists of six subscales: Cognitive confidence, positive beliefs, cognitive self-consciousness, uncontrollability and danger, and need to control thoughts. Each subscale comprises of 5 items and uses a 4-point scale (1 = do not agree, 4 = agree very much) and the range of scores for each subscale is 5-20. A higher score represents negative beliefs about worry. These subscales will administered 4 times over a 12 month period to assess change: Baseline, 6 weeks (immediate-post intervention), 6-month follow-up and 12 month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (short version)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change assessed over a 12 month period</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire has 18 items and consists of nine subscales: Self-blame, other-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, positive refocusing, planning, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective and acceptance. Each subscale comprises of 2 items and uses a 5-point scale (1 = almost never, 5 = almost always) and the range of scores for each subscale is 2-10. A higher score represents greater use of cognitive coping strategies. These subscales will administered 4 times over a 12 month period to assess change: Baseline, 6 weeks (immediate-post intervention), 6-month follow-up and 12 month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation and Engagement Scale (uncertain control subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change assessed over a 12 month period</time_frame>
    <description>4 items measure measured on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) resulting in a score from 7-28. A higher score represents greater uncertain control. This subscale will administered 4 times over a 12 month period to assess change: Baseline, 6 weeks (immediate-post intervention), 6-month follow-up and 12 month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (panic, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety subscales)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change assessed over a 12 month period</time_frame>
    <description>The generalised anxiety subscale (6 items), panic subscale (9 items), and social anxiety subscale (9 items) of the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, are all measured on a 4-point scale (0 = Never, 3 = Always). The range of scores for the generalised anxiety subscale is 0-18, the panic subscale is 0-27, and the social anxiety subscale is 0-27. A higher score represents higher anxiety. These subscales will administered 4 times over a 12 month period to assess change: Baseline, 6 weeks (immediate-post intervention), 6-month follow-up and 12 month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>School-related Wellbeing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change assessed over a 12 month period</time_frame>
    <description>6 items measured on a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) resulting in a score from 6-30. A higher score represents higher school-related wellbeing. These subscales will administered 4 times over a 12 month period to assess change: Baseline, 6 weeks (immediate-post intervention), 6-month follow-up and 12 month follow-up.</description>
