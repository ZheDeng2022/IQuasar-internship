    <textblock>
      The incidence of renal cancer in Denmark is approximately 900 new cases per year. Untreated,&#xD;
      the 5-year survival rate for metastatic renal cancer (mRCC) is 2%. Development of&#xD;
      angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) and check-point immunotherapy (CPI) has improved survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment efficacy is evaluated by CT scans, using RESIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors). However, progressin in patients with mRCC treated with AI or CPI is&#xD;
      difficult to characterize at the right time, using the RECIST 1.1. Therefore approximately 50&#xD;
      % of the patients are 'lost' to further treatment at the time of progression and die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate if functional imaging parameters using spectral&#xD;
      CT-techniques can detect treatment failure earlier, or more accurate, than routine CT. This&#xD;
      could help us develop a new set of response evaluation criteria for functional imaging,&#xD;
      giving a more precise assessment of treatment effect in patients with mRCC treated with AI&#xD;
      and CPI.&#xD;

      Response evaluation criteria in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: Improved assessment of&#xD;
      response and progression by Spectral CT?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal cancer accounts for 2-3% of all cancers. The incidence of renal cancer in Denmark is&#xD;
      approximately 900 new cases per year. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises from the renal&#xD;
      parenchyma and is by far the most common type. In 20-30% of all new cases, metastases exist&#xD;
      at the time of diagnosis. Up to 25-50 % of patients treated with nephrectomy for localized&#xD;
      RCC will eventually develop metastases. Untreated, the 5-year survival rate for metastatic&#xD;
      RCC (mRCC) is 2%, and the median survival is 3 months. Within the last 10 years, an increased&#xD;
      understanding of kidney cancer biology, and the immune system, has resulted in the&#xD;
      development and approval of more than 12 new biological drugs. These are characterized by&#xD;
      inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis inhibitors) or by activating the&#xD;
      patient's own immune system to attack the cancer disease (check-point inhibitors). Survival&#xD;
      has significantly improved for the patient group with these drugs. The treatment results in&#xD;
      control of tumor growth in the majority of patients, for a certain length of time, but should&#xD;
      be given continuously, has side effects, and is expensive. In case of disease progression,&#xD;
      treatment is changed to another drug. Thus, treatment for mRCC comprises sequential&#xD;
      alternating drugs for as long as possible. However, progression is difficult to characterize&#xD;
      at the right time and approximately 50 % of the patients are 'lost' to further treatment at&#xD;
      the time of progression and die. The investigators therefore need improved diagnostic tools&#xD;
      for early or more accurate detection of treatment failure, resulting in appropriate change of&#xD;
      therapy at the right time. Routinely, treatment efficacy is evaluated by CT scans at baseline&#xD;
      and every 3 months, using the criteria laid out in RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      In Solid Tumors). When interpreting the CT scan, the sizes of target lesions are measured,&#xD;
      and an increase in the sum of target lesions by 30%, or the appearance of a new lesion, are&#xD;
      interpreted as disease progression. However, the size of the tumor does not necessarily&#xD;
      represent biological and physiological changes within the tumor; Tumors treated with&#xD;
      angiogenesis inhibitors may show little or no change in tumor size, or may enlarge slowly&#xD;
      during therapy, in spite of clinical benefit to the patient and extended time-to-progression.&#xD;
      New lesions or tumor enlargement may be seen as part of pseudo-progression in patients&#xD;
      treated with check-point inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the criteria from RECIST 1.1, despite being the best available at the moment, are&#xD;
      far from an optimal tool for evaluating response and progression in patients with mRCC&#xD;
      treated with biological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies from the research group behind the current pH.D. project have shown that&#xD;
      functional imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Computer Tomography (DCE-CT) was able to&#xD;
      measure changes in blood flow over time in a single metastasis. Using DCE-CT, the best&#xD;
      clinical effect of angiogenesis inhibitor therapy was seen in patients with the greatest&#xD;
      decline in blood volume and blood flow, measured after 1 month of treatment compared with&#xD;
      baseline. In contrast, patients with low blood volume and low blood flow at baseline had the&#xD;
      worst survival, with almost no benefit from treatment, regardless of whether they were&#xD;
      treated with angiogenesis inhibitors or immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these results, functional imaging using DCE-CT has the potential to serve as a&#xD;
      predictive and prognostic tool in patients with mRCC. However, the DCE-CT technique can only&#xD;
      measure functional parameters in one single metastasis and requires use of extra intravenous&#xD;
      contrast, and increases radiation dose to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new technique, Spectral CT, can visualize and measure functional parameters in all&#xD;
      metastases in the body, with use of no extra intravenous contrast, and with no extra&#xD;
      radiation dose compared to conventional CT. Spectral CT can quantify parameters such as&#xD;
      iodine density and iodine concentration - parameters that could be associated with blood flow&#xD;
      and blood volume - and also the relative atomic number can be measured. Response evaluation&#xD;
      criteria in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: Improved assessment of response and progression&#xD;
      by advanced CT-techniques?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectral-CT adds spectral resolution to traditional CT scans through a new dual-layer&#xD;
      spectral detector. With an Yttrium-based scintillator, the NanoPanel prism detector&#xD;
      identifies high-energy and low-energy photons simultaneously, allowing not only anatomy, but&#xD;
      also color to characterize the material's content of structures. This new technique allows&#xD;
      the characterization of the metastases with parameters such as: iodine density, iodine&#xD;
      concentration and the relative atomic number. Spectral CT uses iodinated contrast media -in&#xD;
      the same dose as conventional CT. The amount of radiation in a Spectral CT is the same as in&#xD;
      a conventional CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypothesis The present study aims to evaluate functional imaging Spectral-CT as&#xD;
      means to improve evaluation of response and progression in patients with mRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to examine the correlation between Spectral-CT parameters and outcome in patients&#xD;
      with mRCC treated with angiogenesis inhibitors and check-point inhibitor immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Spectral-CT parameters at baseline have predictive and prognostic value, and spectral CT&#xD;
      parameters during treatment are more accurate than RECIST 1.1 in determining response and&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods The project is an explorative prospective study, in which the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the correlation between Spectral-CT functional imaging parameters&#xD;
      and outcome in patients with mRCC treated with angiogenesis inhibitors and immunotherapy. CT&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline, after 1 and 3 months and then every 3 months until progression&#xD;
      or death. CT will be performed using the Spectral IQON scanner from Philips, from which the&#xD;
      investigators will receive routine CT images, but also Spectral CT-images. In this way the&#xD;
      patients can be their own control. The investigators plan to include 60 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints and data processing In order to evaluate the accuracy of Spectral-CT imaging, the&#xD;
      clinical endpoints best response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following patient information will be collected from the patients medical record og&#xD;
      registered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (date of birth, height, weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about surgical and non-surgical treatment of renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients list of medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Localisation of primary tumor and metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histological parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Findings on radiological examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: hemoglobin, white blood cell count, leucocytes, thrombocytes, creatinin,&#xD;
           natrium, potassium, bilirubin, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate&#xD;
           dehydrogenase,calcium, albumine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about oncologic treatment after the patient progresses in actual study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations The &quot;Spectral-CT&quot; study is approved by The Central Denmark Region&#xD;
      Committees on Health Research Ethics (journal no. 1-10-72-242-17) and is approved the Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency (journal no. 1-16-02-791-17). No procedure in the study will be performed&#xD;
      before written informed consent has been obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Perspectives Functional imaging using DCE and Spectral CT is considered a potential, new,&#xD;
      non-invasive biomarker with the potential to serve as a predictive and prognostic tool.&#xD;
      Biomarkers have traditionally been developed by analyzing blood or biopsy material.&#xD;
      Core-needle tumor biopsies are, however, invasive procedures with associated discomfort and&#xD;
      complications. The development of a non-invasive biomarker, obtained at the same time as&#xD;
      routine CT assessment, which has potential for treatment selection (predictive tool) and&#xD;
      improved prognostication, would therefore be a significant advance for patient with mRCC. To&#xD;
      our knowledge no previous studies have investigated he correlation between DCE-CT parameters&#xD;
      and the amount of blood vessels in tumor biopsies. Nor have Spectral CT been used as&#xD;
      evaluation of response and progression in mRCC patients. The present study has the potential&#xD;
      to develop an updated RECIST - integrating tumor size with functional information. This could&#xD;
      give a more precise assessment of oncological treatment, thereby improving patient care.&#xD;
