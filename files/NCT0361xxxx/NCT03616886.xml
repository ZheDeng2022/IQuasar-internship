  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of chemotherapy with PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade agents demonstrated&#xD;
      promising results especially in the neo-adjuvant and early metastatic setting in TNBC.&#xD;
      However, a substantial proportion of patients do not derive benefit from this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD73 is an adenosine-generating enzyme overexpressed in several cancers and associated with&#xD;
      poor prognosis and reduced anti-tumor immunity in TNBC. Monoclonal antibodies directed&#xD;
      against CD73 could help to reprogram the tumor microenvironement by decreasing the adenosine&#xD;
      mediated immunosuppression, particularly as a synergistic immunotherapeutic combination with&#xD;
      immune checkpoint blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SYNERGY trial investigates the role of an anti-CD73 (MEDI9447) in a randomized phase II&#xD;
      trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of chemotherapy (paclitaxel +&#xD;
      carboplatin) with immunotherapy (durvalumab [anti-PD-L1] +/- MEDI9447 [anti-CD73]) in&#xD;
      previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large translational research program is planned including baseline and dynamic biomarkers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I Part 1 is a phase I trial examining the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin,&#xD;
      durvalumab and oleclumab in order to define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of oleclumab&#xD;
      in this treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period for DLT evaluation is defined as the time from receiving the first dose of&#xD;
      oleclumab until the planned administration of the third dose; this corresponds to 28 days&#xD;
      after receiving the first dose of oleclumab in case no treatment interruption occured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop a DLT will stop study treatment permanently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial investigating the role of an&#xD;
      anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody (oleclumab) in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      (durvalumab) plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) as first-line treatment for locally&#xD;
      recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized between chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) with&#xD;
      immunotherapy including durvalumab with or without oleclumab (1:1 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I and PHASE II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel and carboplatin will be given weekly for a total of 12 injections. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      (durvalumab with or without oleclumab) will be given as long as the patient benefits.&#xD;
      Premature discontinuation of paclitaxel/carboplatin or discontinuation of&#xD;
      durvalumab/oleclumab is indicated in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progressive disease (PD) using RECIST v1.1 criteria or iRECIST assessed locally&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercurrent illness that necessitates discontinuation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject noncompliance with the study treatment or procedure requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of consent to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administrative reasons requiring cessation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial disease status will be evaluated by imaging studies (contrast-enhanced CT scan of the&#xD;
      chest, the abdomen and the pelvis or MRI of the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis) during the&#xD;
      screening phase. Disease status will be followed by imaging studies at weeks 8 (± 3 days), 16&#xD;
      (± 3 days) and 24 (± 3 days) post start of treatment (allowing efficacy data to be captured&#xD;
      as close to 24 weeks post start of study treatment as possible for a more accurate evaluation&#xD;
      of DCR). Thereafter imaging will continue every 12 weeks (± 3 days; contrast-enhanced CT scan&#xD;
      or MRI) independent of any treatment delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who stopped all study treatments for reasons other than PD will continue&#xD;
      post-treatment imaging studies for disease status follow-up as described in the schedule of&#xD;
      assessment until verified PD, start of a new anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent to&#xD;
      study participation, death, or end of the study whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Pseudo-progression related to immunotherapy: Patients experiencing PD as defined by&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 can continue the study treatment in case of good clinical condition assessed by a&#xD;
      stable or even improved ECOG performance status. If the next assessment of tumour burden (8&#xD;
      weeks later) confirms PD (as defined by iRECIST) study treatment must be discontinued.&#xD;
      Unconfirmed PD as defined by iRECIST (iUPD) can only be assigned for the first 2 imaging&#xD;
      assessments (week 8 and week 16) and several times as long as confirmed progression (iCPD) is&#xD;
      not confirmed at the next assessment. If PD is not confirmed, reassessments continue as&#xD;
      originally planned.&#xD;

             premedications (acetaminophen/paracetamol, diphenhydramine or equivalent antihistamine&#xD;
             and methylprednisolone or equivalent glucocorticoid) and to other platinum containing&#xD;
             compounds&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects with previously treated brain metastases with local treatment (stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery or whole brain radiation therapy) may participate provided they have&#xD;
             stable brain metastases on a recent brain MRI (performed during the 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             inclusion) and have measurable disease outside the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Known brain metastases are considered active (and not eligible for trial), if&#xD;
             any of the following criteria are applicable:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Recent brain imaging demonstrates progression of existing and/or appearance of&#xD;
                  new lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Neurological symptoms attributed to brain metastases have not returned to&#xD;
                  baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Steroids were used for management of symptoms related to brain metastases within&#xD;
                  14 days of enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the principal investigator) within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to enrolment. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is&#xD;

                  pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia. Patients previously treated with anthracyclines are&#xD;
                  eligible if a recent cardiac work up (&lt; 6 months) demonstrated a normal left&#xD;
                  ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF≥50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Interstitial lung disease&#xD;
