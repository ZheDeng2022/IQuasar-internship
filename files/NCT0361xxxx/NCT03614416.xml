  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the performance and safety of the Bioserenity pulse&#xD;
      oxymeter EOXY. For that, and in agreement with ISO60601-2-61 norm and FDA regulation,&#xD;
      measures of heart rate, with a gold-standard, and SaO2 measures generated by blood samples&#xD;
      will be compared with Sp02 and heart rate measures that are generated by our EOXY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirteen healthy subjects will participate in the study in total. Three subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled during a primary phase .They will participate at a secondary phase as well as ten&#xD;
      others subjects. The purpose of the primary phase is to test the body area where the&#xD;
      measurement can be done. The purpose of the secondary phase is to measure SpO2 and HR in&#xD;
      desaturation conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate and document the SpO2 accuracy of the pulse oximeter&#xD;
      equipment, evaluating the performance of the device compared to invasive method blood&#xD;
      sampling (SaO2) by CO-Oximeter in healthy subjects during invasive controlled desaturation&#xD;
      study at different ranges (100 % to 70% SaO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject safety during desaturation and saturation period, will be evaluated by reviewing&#xD;
      vital sign: heart rate (HR) continuously and blood pressure/temperature between each&#xD;
      desaturation plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two secondaries objectives, the measurement of the variation of the fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen (FiO2), and the validation of the algorithm for data review and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study primary phase, the purpose of this phase is to test the body area where the&#xD;
      SpO2 is better detected and define 3 measurement areas. For this, three healthy volunteers&#xD;
      will be placed in normal O2 saturation, the SpO2 will be measured using the Bioserenity&#xD;
      oximeter (noninvasive method) and will be compared to a gold-standard oximeter CE-marked. The&#xD;
      investigator will determine the best area in the body where the SpO2 could be taken for the&#xD;
      following subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a second phase, the measurement of Sp02 and HR with EOXY, will be performed in O2&#xD;
      saturation conditions up to 100% and then in desaturation by plateau from 100 % to 70%. 3&#xD;
      EOXY pulse oximeter recorded the SpO2 at the same time in 3 different areas of the body. As&#xD;
      required by the standard, Sp02 measures will be simultaneously compared to SaO2 values&#xD;
      measured by blood sampling taken from an indwelling arterial catheter. The HR obtained with&#xD;
      EOXY will be compared simultaneously to a gold standard oximeter CE-marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the example in the standard, it was choosen to do the test on the 70-100% range, with 5&#xD;
      plateaus (100%-97%, 97%-92%, 92%-85%, 84%-78%, 77%-70%) and to collect five Sp02 and Sa02&#xD;
      values (blood samples) and five HR measures, per plateau, for each of 13 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The desaturation will be controlled thanks' the FiO2 measures, that should allow to bring&#xD;
      subjects near target levels of desaturation plateau.&#xD;
