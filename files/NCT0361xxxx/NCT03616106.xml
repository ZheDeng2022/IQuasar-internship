      To complete the study aims, a mixed methods study that includes a single group&#xD;
      pretest-posttest study design will be used to pilot test the infographic intervention.&#xD;
      In-depth interviews will be completed with a selection of participants to explore participant&#xD;
      perceptions of HIV-related communication using infographics. Data will be collected from&#xD;
      participants through baseline (at enrollment) and follow up assessments (at 3-, 6-, and&#xD;
      9-month follow up visits). Follow up interviews will be conducted with the providers involved&#xD;
      in the intervention to ascertain their perspectives on the clinical utility of infographics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Caribbean has among the highest HIV prevalence in the world. Regionally, the majority of&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS cases are located on the island of Hispaniola, comprised of the Dominican Republic&#xD;
      (DR) and Haiti. Due to a large international response and widespread availability of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), in recent years the incidence of HIV in the DR has declined and&#xD;
      prevalence hovers around 1% in the general population. The effective and long-term management&#xD;
      of this condition depends on infected individuals being able to acquire ART and apply the&#xD;
      learned information and self-management skills that lead to optimal adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-related disparities exist in developing countries, such as the DR, where minority groups&#xD;
      and/or those with low socioeconomic status experience higher disease burdens and worse health&#xD;
      outcomes than those with higher socioeconomic status. These disparities may be exacerbated&#xD;
      when individuals are unable to understand the health information, as low health literacy has&#xD;
      been associated with worse health outcomes, less use of healthcare services, poorer knowledge&#xD;
      of illness, and worse self-management. The effective management of HIV requires patients to&#xD;
      acquire, comprehend, and use large amounts of complex information, including how to manage&#xD;
      variations in health status, medications and their side effects, nutrition and exercise&#xD;
      needs, and healthy coping. Health care providers can help patients understand pertinent&#xD;
      health information by offering it in targeted, culturally-, language-, and&#xD;
      literacy-appropriate ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such strategy is to use infographics to assist communication through visual&#xD;
      representations of information. Participatory design of infographics supports presentation of&#xD;
      information in a culturally appropriate and visually appealing format which can improve&#xD;
      information understanding, health behaviors, attention span, and ability to recall&#xD;
      information. It is critical to develop and test methods to improve the way health information&#xD;
      is delivered to patients in these clinical contexts so patients, including those with low&#xD;
      health literacy, can acquire and comprehend the information needed to improve self-management&#xD;
      behavior and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies showed many persons living with HIV (PLWH) attending Clínica de Familia&#xD;
      La Romana do not fully comprehend and use the health information they receive through current&#xD;
      modalities. In response, culturally relevant, evidence-based infographics to improve&#xD;
      information delivery during clinical visits were developed with a participatory design&#xD;
      methodology (manuscript under review). The next phase of this study is to rigorously assess&#xD;
      if using these infographics is a feasible, acceptable, and efficacious method to enhance&#xD;
      HIV-related clinician-patient communication and lead to improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
      Additionally, a thorough exploration into the cultural factors of patient-provider&#xD;
      communication in the Dominican Republic that can influence infographic use for&#xD;
      clinician-patient communication in a clinical setting is warranted.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-month visits</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured with the validated simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ)-6 scale, a 6-item questionnaire. A person is considered &quot;non-adherent&quot; if there is a &quot;yes&quot; answer for any of items 1,2,3, and 5. Additionally, if they answer that they have missed more than two doses in the past week (item 4) or if they have gone more than two days without taking their medication in the past 3 months (item 6). Therefore, participants are classified as either adherent or not adherent based on their answers to these questions. Any participant that didn't complete study visits or did not answer that question was considered &quot;missing.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Participant's Self-reported Health-related Quality of Life Score - Physical Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® (PROMIS)-29 measure, which measures 7 domains of health-related quality of life with 4 questions in each section pertaining to how that participant's health influences their life. In general, each question has five response options ranging in values from 1-5. To find the total raw score for this form with all the questions answered, the values from the responses of each question are summed. Raw scores are then translated into a T-score for each participant, which rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Consequently, a person with a T-score of 40 would be one SD below the mean.</description>

        <description>Adherence will be measured with the validated simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ)-6 scale, a 6-item questionnaire. A person is considered &quot;non-adherent&quot; if there is a &quot;yes&quot; answer for any of items 1,2,3, and 5. Additionally, if they answer that they have missed more than two doses in the past week (item 4) or if they have gone more than two days without taking their medication in the past 3 months (item 6). Therefore, participants are classified as either adherent or not adherent based on their answers to these questions.

        <title>Participant's Self-reported Health-related Quality of Life Score - Physical Functioning</title>
        <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® (PROMIS)-29 measure, which measures 7 domains of health-related quality of life with 4 questions in each section pertaining to how that participant's health influences their life. In general, each question has five response options ranging in values from 1-5. To find the total raw score for this form with all the questions answered, the values from the responses of each question are summed. Raw scores are then translated into a T-score for each participant, which rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Consequently, a person with a T-score of 40 would be one SD below the mean.</description>

        <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® (PROMIS)-29 measure, which measures 7 domains of health-related quality of life with 4 questions in each section pertaining to how that participant's health influences their life. In general, each question has five response options ranging in values from 1-5. To find the total raw score for this form with all the questions answered, the values from the responses of each question are summed. Raw scores are then translated into a T-score for each participant, which rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Consequently, a person with a T-score of 40 would be one SD below the mean.</description>

        <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® (PROMIS)-29 measure, which measures 7 domains of health-related quality of life with 4 questions in each section pertaining to how that participant's health influences their life. In general, each question has five response options ranging in values from 1-5. To find the total raw score for this form with all the questions answered, the values from the responses of each question are summed. Raw scores are then translated into a T-score for each participant, which rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Consequently, a person with a T-score of 40 would be one SD below the mean.</description>
