      The aim of this study is to determine if and how the &quot;Probiotic Product&quot; affects functional&#xD;
      brain responses in healthy subjects during an emotional- and arithmetic stress task,&#xD;
      respectively and in terms of microbe-brain-gut interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, n=22 healthy subjects will receive&#xD;
      the following interventions in a crossover fashion, separated by a 4-week wash-out period: 1)&#xD;
      Probiotic Formula, 2) placebo. After baseline assessments, study participants will start with&#xD;
      a 4-week intervention with the study product or the placebo, followed by a 4-week wash-out&#xD;
      period and a subsequent 4-week intervention period (placebo or study product, respectively).&#xD;
      fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scanning during two validated stress tasks will&#xD;
      be performed after each of the intervention periods (week 4 and week 12). At the same time&#xD;
      points and in addition on the days before the 1st and 2nd intervention (baseline 1 and 2),&#xD;
      saliva, blood and faecal samples will be collected. Questionnaire data will be collected and&#xD;
      psychological tests and instruments will be performed. For one week at baseline and during&#xD;
      the intervention periods (last week), subjects will wear actigraphs to record their physical&#xD;
      activity and help assess sleep quality. At baseline, subjects will undergo a carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (CO2) challenge test as well as a food diary to record dietary habits.&#xD;
