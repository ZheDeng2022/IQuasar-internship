    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well interim digital positron emission tomography (PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) works in predicting outcomes in participants with oropharyngeal cancer that&#xD;
      has spread from its original site of growth to nearby tissues or lymph nodes who are&#xD;
      undergoing chemoradiation therapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as PET/CT may help measure a&#xD;
      participant's response to treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the utility of early (i.e. during treatment) digital (d)PET as a diagnostic&#xD;
      tool to predict local control 6 months after definitive chemoradiation for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.&#xD;
      during treatment) and complete response (CR) on PET after definitive chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.&#xD;
      during) treatment and 2 year LC after definitive chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the ability of dynamic dPET compared to conventional PET or&#xD;
      conventional-equivalent dPET reconstruction to identify tumor volumes with greater&#xD;
      sensitivity at the time of before (dPET1), during (dPET2, dPET3) and after (dPET4, dPET5)&#xD;
      chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive radiotracer injection and undergo dPET/CT over 20-75 minutes at&#xD;
      baseline, during the 2nd and 4th week of radiotherapy, and 3 months after the completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;

    <description>For each of the promising dPET parameters identified in the primary analysis we will examine potential cut-points to be used to best predict 6-month response/non-response using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods. Here we will examine specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values for each promising parameter to allow for preliminary data to be generated to anticipate which parameters may warrant future study.</description>
