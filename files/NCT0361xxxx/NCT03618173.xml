  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous dexamethasone (IV) can be used alone in adults as an adjunct to peri-nerves&#xD;
      blocks, for diffusion blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatrics, dexamethasone is used daily according to the assessment of the anesthetist, by&#xD;
      extension of the recommendations of the adult, as adjuvant in perinervous blocks although no&#xD;
      study has been published yet concerning his interest. However, the physiology of the child is&#xD;
      not superimposable to that of the adult (renal function, volume of distribution, plasma&#xD;
      protein binding ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We thus wish to study the effectiveness of the administration of IV dexamethasone at the time&#xD;
      of anesthetic induction in the prolongation of the duration of the block of the lower limbs&#xD;
      in the child and its repercussion on the postoperative consumption of morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective : Evaluate the efficiency, compared to placebo, of IV dexamethasone at the&#xD;
      dose of 0.2 mg / kg administered as a bolus at the time of anesthetic induction, on the early&#xD;
      postoperative pain (first 24 hours) in the child of 6 to 15 years undergoing surgery that&#xD;
      requires the achievement of a peri-neural block of the lower limb after general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficiency of 0,2mg/kg IV dexamathasone administrated at anesthesia&#xD;
           induction compared to placebo, on the increase of the delay of first post operative&#xD;
           morphinic consumption in children from 6 to 15 who are qualified for a lower limb&#xD;
           surgery with a loco-regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate that 0,2mg/kg IV dexamathasone administrated at anesthesia induction compared&#xD;
           to placebo, doesn't increase the lower limb motor blokade duration in children from 6 to&#xD;
           15 who are qualified for a lower limb surgery with a loco-regional anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficiency of 0,2mg/kg IV dexamathasone administrated at anesthesia&#xD;
           induction compared to placebo, on the decrease of post operative nausea and vomiting in&#xD;
           children from 6 to 15 who are qualified for a lower limb surgery with a loco-regional&#xD;
           anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Morphinic consumption in the post operative 24H&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  delay between the realisation of the lower limb blockade ans the first - consumption of&#xD;
           morphinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration the the motor blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prevalence of post opérative nausea/vomiting&#xD;

      Time 1: Pre-anesthetic consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment is performed during the pre-anesthetic consultation, between D-90 and D-2 of the&#xD;
      date of operation. The eligibility criteria will be checked and if the child is eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the study, oral and written information about the study is given to the&#xD;
      child's parents (or, failing that, to their legal representatives) by the anesthetist doctor.&#xD;
      Minors will receive information adapted to their ability to understand. It can not be&#xD;
      overridden by the refusal of the child or the revocation of his acceptance. The investigator&#xD;
      will give the parents the consent form The parents then have a minimum of 48 hours to decide&#xD;
      whether to participate in the study of their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, an anesthesiologist doctor will be reachable (through the secretariat) at any&#xD;
      time in case of additional questions during the reflection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time n ° 2: Pre-anesthetic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the parents and the child agree to participate in this study and after a new eligibility&#xD;
      check, the consent signed by both parents will be collected the day before the intervention&#xD;
      during the pre-anesthetic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will then be carried out and two groups will be created:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A first group receiving 0.2 mg / kg of IV dexamethasone at the time of anesthetic&#xD;
           induction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second group receiving the same volume of placebo (physiological saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetist will send to the pharmacy, on a prescription, the results of the&#xD;
      randomization (assignment code) the day before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs in the study will be prepared by the pharmacy department of the University Hospital&#xD;
      of Nancy at most 21 days in advance of the intervention. Indeed, a syringe for each&#xD;
      randomization list (stratification on algebra level) will always be planned in advance and&#xD;
      ready to be used for inclusion early in the morning (between 7:30 and 9:30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The packaging will be identical to guarantee the double blind. The pharmacy will send the&#xD;
      drug to the operating room on the morning of the operation via a specific drug transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of the operation, all patients included will receive a premedication with&#xD;
      midazolam 0.3mg / kg per os 30 minutes max 10mg before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is then asleep (general anesthesia) according to the protocols in force (initial&#xD;
      induction by inhaled sevoflurane and then peripheral venous route (VVP) and injection of&#xD;
      sufentanil 0.1 gamma / kg and propofol 2-3mg / kg or VVP pose then IV anesthesia directly in&#xD;
      the larger ones).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then a block of the lower limb with 0.3mL / kg of ropivacaine at the concentration of 2mg /&#xD;
      mL, ultrasound guided with or without neurostimulation is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient then receives according to his group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  either 0.2 mg / kg of IV dexamethasone at the time of anesthetic induction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or the same volume of placebo (physiological saline) at the time of anesthetic&#xD;
           induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of general anesthesia is done by sevoflurane with sufentanil reinjection at the&#xD;
      discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intraoperative period, the patient will receive a systematic injection of paracetamol&#xD;
      15mg / kg IVL 30 minutes before the end of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the operation is complete, the patient is transferred to the post-interventional&#xD;
      surveillance room with awakening and evaluation of the pain (by EVA scale) and postoperative&#xD;
      nausea (by questioning the child), noting the hours of statement. The existence of a motor&#xD;
      block of the operated lower limb is also evaluated and recorded. Thereafter, the patient&#xD;
      returns to conventional service with regular evaluation (every 4 hours) of pain and nausea /&#xD;
      vomiting (every 4 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain intensity will be evaluated by a scale validated from the age of 6: evaluation by&#xD;
      analogue verbal scale (EVA) giving a painful intensity over 100: 100/100 being the maximum&#xD;
      intensity imaginable, 0/100 the absence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting will be assessed as follows: no nausea /&#xD;
      vomiting, nausea without vomiting, nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the EVA is greater than 30 in the 24 hours postoperative: an injection of Nalbuphine 0.2mg&#xD;
      / kg IVL or morphine 0.1mg / kg max 3mg every 4 to 6 hours will be performed; in the event of&#xD;
      failure (persistence of an EVA&gt; 30 to 30 mins), a new dose of paracetamol 15mg / kg may be&#xD;
      administered again 6 hours after the first dose injected intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of nausea and / or postoperative vomiting, ondansetron 0.1mg / kg every 8h will&#xD;
      be administered and then in case of failure at 30 minutes, droperidol 10 microgram / kg every&#xD;
      8h.&#xD;
