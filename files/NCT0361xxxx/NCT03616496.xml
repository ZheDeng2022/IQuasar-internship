  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although being classified as a rare disease, cardiac amyloidosis constitutes an increasing&#xD;
      cause of heart failure, which is often overlooked and thus poorly managed. Amyloidosis&#xD;
      involves deposits of light chain immunoglobulins in the immunoglobulin light chain&#xD;
      amyloidosis (AL) type, but it may also be of a hereditary type in mutated transthyretin&#xD;
      amyloidosis (ATTRm) or of a senile type in wildtype transthyretin forms (ATTRwt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial biopsy remains a gold standard for definitive diagnosis but it is a traumatic&#xD;
      technique which only provides information on a limited number of sampled sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Useful but not fully specific signs of cardiac amyloidosis may also be provided by Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging or MRI (delayed retention imaging) and echocardiography (longitudinal&#xD;
      strain pattern).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding the above, relatively specific markers of amyloid plaques are now available&#xD;
      in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). These markers are primarily fluorinated tracers which&#xD;
      have been developed for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Two of these have already been&#xD;
      the subject of feasibility studies in the setting of cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis, on a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 amyloidosis patients but with very favorable results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that one of these two tracers, Florbetaben labelled with&#xD;
      Fluorine-18-Florbetaben (18F-Florbetaben) used in the study, has sufficiently strong and&#xD;
      prolonged binding kinetics at the level of the amyloid plaques to allow: (i) achieving&#xD;
      whole-body PET recordings and thus, (ii) identifying not only cardiac amyloidosis but also&#xD;
      extracardiac binding sites, particularly those readily accessible to biopsy sampling. This&#xD;
      hypothesis has been strengthened by a recent case report illustrating the ability of&#xD;
      whole-body florbetaben-PET to image not only cardiac but also extra-cardiac sites of amyloid&#xD;
      deposits (Clin Nucl Med. 2017;42(1):50-3).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition, distinctive imaging patterns pointing to amyloidosis may also be documented by&#xD;
      other imaging techniques although insufficiently specific (e.g. decreased cardiac uptake of&#xD;
      metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), evocative pattern of delayed retention at Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (MRI) or at strain echocardiography. Specific markers of amyloid plaques have been&#xD;
      developed for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and were initially labeled with carbon-11&#xD;
      and more recently, with fluor-18. Most of these markers have already been the subject of&#xD;
      feasibility studies on limited numbers of amyloidosis patients (max 10) but with favorable&#xD;
      results. In a previous pilot study, one of these tracers, the 18F-Florbetaben used in the&#xD;
      present study-protocol, exhibited particularly slow kinetics, with differences in cardiac&#xD;
      uptake between patients and controls still being documented as late as 80-min following&#xD;
      injection. This uptake was also found to be somewhat lower in the 5 ATTR patients&#xD;
      comparatively to the 5 AL patients. It may be hypothesized that 18F-Florbetaben has&#xD;
      sufficiently slow and prolonged binding kinetics at the level of the amyloid plaques to&#xD;
      allow: (i) achieving whole-body PET recordings with current recording times of 20 to 30 min&#xD;
      and thus, (ii) identifying not only cardiac amyloidosis but also extracardiac binding sites,&#xD;
      particularly those readily accessible to biopsy sampling. This hypothesis has just been&#xD;
      strengthened by a recent case report, published by investigators involved in the present&#xD;
      project and illustrating the ability of whole-body 18F-Florbetaben-PET to image not only&#xD;
      cardiac but also various extracardiac sites of amyloid deposits.The proposed study would be&#xD;
      the first in which the sample size would be sufficient to provide a credible assessment of&#xD;
      the ability of PET, using an amyloid plaque tracer, to identify cardiac amyloidosis and with&#xD;
      a possible separate analysis of ATTR and AL forms. Moreover, it would also constitute the&#xD;
      first study involving an extensive use of whole-body PET imaging to assess the benefit of&#xD;
      amyloidosis detection, not only at the cardiac level, but also at peripheral sites,&#xD;
      especially those accessible for biopsy (tongue, rectum, salivary glands, carpal tunnel,&#xD;
      liver, subcutaneous tissue, thyroid,...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being able to confirm or invalidate the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in a non-invasive&#xD;
      manner and by guiding biopsy sampling to the most active extracardiac sites would be a major&#xD;
      step forward for these patients whose diagnosis is most often established too late, i.e. at&#xD;
      an advanced stage of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the longer term,18F-Florbetaben whole-body PET could be helpful for the non-invasive&#xD;
      monitoring of the evolution of cardiac as well as extracardiac sites of amyloid deposits&#xD;
      under dedicated specific treatments (chemotherapies in AL forms and specific treatments&#xD;
      currently under investigation for the AL forms). Such monitoring is still impossible today.&#xD;
