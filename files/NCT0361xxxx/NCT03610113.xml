      Reverse shoulder prosthesis has recently emerged as an acute treatment for complex proximal&#xD;
      humeral fractures. Promising functional results have been reported in observational papers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no clinical trials have yet been reported when comparing the conservative treatment&#xD;
      to surgical treatment through the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.&#xD;

      Introduction The proximal humeral fractures are frequent in the investigator's environment.&#xD;
      Among them, about 20% are considered as complex features. Conservative treatment has&#xD;
      traditionally offered an extensive range of results. The reverse shoulder prosthesis as a&#xD;
      treatment for acute fractures of the proximal humeral in the elderly population has changed&#xD;
      the therapeutic approach of this acute pathology. However, high-level evidence-based studies&#xD;
      are still not available, when comparing the conservative treatment with the treatment with&#xD;
      reverse shoulder prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To compare the functional results and complications of elderly patients presenting&#xD;
      acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus through two types of treatments; conservative&#xD;
      treatment and treatment with reverse shoulder prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology A prospective, multicentre and randomized study comparing conservative treatment&#xD;
      with the surgical treatment at two years followup by the use of functional shoulder&#xD;
      assessment (Constant scale), complications and re-interventions associated with each&#xD;
      treatment. The quality of life will also be analyzed through the SF-36 health questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The null hypothesis of the work is based on the appearance of&#xD;
      non-significant differences between the two groups of the study (conservative vs. surgical&#xD;
      treatment), concerning functional status, complications, and re-interventions&#xD;

    <description>Constant-Murley Score. The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient.The Constant-Murley score was introduced to determine the functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury and it ranges from 0 to 100 points. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (0 to 15 points), activities of daily living (0 to 20 points), strength (0 to 25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation (0 to 10 points), external rotation (o to 10 points), abduction (0 to 10 points) and internal rotation of the shoulder (0 to 10 points). Then, those range of motion items allocate from 0 to 40 points to the global score.&#xD;
The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function.</description>
