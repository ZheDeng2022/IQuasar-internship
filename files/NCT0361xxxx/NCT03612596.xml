    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility and acceptability of a physical activity intervention that&#xD;
      combines use of a wearable activity monitor with a scrapbook. Half of the participants will&#xD;
      receive this enhanced intervention, while the other half will receive a wearable activity&#xD;
      monitor with a standard step log.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women breast cancer survivors could benefit from increased physical activity but are in need&#xD;
      of greater motivation to be active. Interventions that use wearable activity monitors and&#xD;
      mobile apps have shown promise in the short-term, but use drops off over time. Reports have&#xD;
      suggested that users find the step data provided to be unclear and not very personally&#xD;
      meaningful. The ultimate purpose of this line of research is to test whether enhanced&#xD;
      motivational feedback, using scrapbooks, can increase motivation for activity. The scrapbooks&#xD;
      will target integrated regulation, which is a type of motivation related to personal identity&#xD;
      and values. Participants who receive this intervention will draw their step graph, add&#xD;
      photographs and stickers an explanations to the graph, and answer reflection questions daily.&#xD;
      Before testing the effects of this intervention on physical activity, the investigators must&#xD;
      first ensure that the materials and procedures are feasible and acceptable. This small pilot&#xD;
      study will allow the research team to iteratively test scrapbook materials and improve upon&#xD;
      them for use in future studies. The investigators will compare an intervention using the&#xD;
      enhanced materials to an intervention using only the wearable device, app, and a standard&#xD;
      step log without scrapbook or reflection components. In addition to the primary outcome of&#xD;
      feasibility (use of the scrapbook), the investigators will also explore the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on steps, motivational and values-related outcomes, and various aspects of&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;
