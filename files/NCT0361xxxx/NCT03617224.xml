      Hypothesis: Addition of low dose TSEBT to debulk MF/SS either before or during checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade with anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab monoclonal antibody therapy will be safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of total skin electron&#xD;
      beam therapy (TSEBT) and pembrolizumab regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the preliminary efficacy of the combination of TSEBT with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the impact on patient-reported health-related quality of life outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center phase I clinical trial assessing the safety of combination therapy of&#xD;
      TSEBT and pembrolizumab for treatment of Stage IB-IV relapsed/refractory MF and SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary endpoint will be maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy of the combination of TSEBT with pembrolizumab therapy is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTCAE v4.0 toxicity beyond the 30 day period following the second therapy in the&#xD;
           combination protocol treatment and up to 30 days following last dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skindex-29 patient-reported HRQOL survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Accrual: 18 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Time to event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach along&#xD;
      with the 95% confidence interval.&#xD;

    <description>Severity or Toxicity will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity. The consequences of toxicity should all be graded 1-5 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 occurring prior to 270 days from the start of protocol treatment. CTCAE V4.0 along with grades 1-5 is provided in the link for reference (https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06 14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf).</description>
