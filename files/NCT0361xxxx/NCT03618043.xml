  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study of SH-1028 with dose escalation cohorts in locally&#xD;
      advanced solid cancer patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent or standard treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of once-daily and orally (PO) administered SH-1028 tablets. The overall study design&#xD;
