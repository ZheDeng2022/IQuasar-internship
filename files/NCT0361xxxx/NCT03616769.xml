  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uric acid is the final breakdown product of purine degradation in humans. The association&#xD;
      between high serum uric acid levels and arterial stiffness as well as endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in humans and uric acid has been suggested to be an important modulator&#xD;
      of the inflammatory process. But debates still existed for hyperuricemia and hypouricemia as&#xD;
      an independent role,especially after controlling other traditional atherosclerotic risk.The&#xD;
      aim of this study was, firstly, to verify the association between hyperuricemia and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases,secondly,to assess whether hypouricemia was an independent risk&#xD;
      factor impact for cardiovascular disea.&#xD;

      The study is a longitudinal cohort study. The first cross-sectional survey was conducted in&#xD;
      2011. The eligible participants were followed up from November 2011 to June 2018 (mean&#xD;
      follow-up months 68.71±11.35). During the followed-up time, 67 patients had missing data and&#xD;
      56 had no compliance. Thus, the study sample actually comprised 3,047 valid participants&#xD;
      (1536 men, 1511 women) whose age older than or equal to 35 years (mean age 60.2±10.4 years)&#xD;
      were followed up. A total of hospitalized patients were consecutively enrolled from&#xD;
      cardiology department of Beijing and Shanghai. All subjects are under treatment because of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;

    <description>Cardiovascular events definitions: Hospitalized myocardial infarction was classified as definite or probable based on chest pain symptoms, cardiac enzyme levels, and electrocardiographic findings, or angioplasty28. Coronary heart disease was determined to be present if there was (1) electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of a prior myocardial infarction, (2) prior coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty, (3) Coronary angiography show coronary heart disease, (4) have symptoms of angina and ECG revealed myocardial ischemia performance or laboratory tests showed cardiac enzymes increased and exclude other types of disease, (5) a self-reported history of a physician-diagnosed heart attack 29. CHD death was classified &quot;definite&quot; based on chest pain symptoms, hospital records, and medical history.</description>

        There were 3,535 participants from multi-central departments with multiple classical&#xD;
