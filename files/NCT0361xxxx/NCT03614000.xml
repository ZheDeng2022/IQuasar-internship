  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant group of children with functional constipation (FC) continues to have symptoms&#xD;
      despite recommended standard therapy. Underlying psychiatric problems could explain therapy&#xD;
      resistance. However, a work-up for psychiatric problems is only recommended after&#xD;
      unsuccessful 6 months standard therapy. Earlier detection and check-up could lead to faster&#xD;
      start-up of a more adequate therapy. Therefore, we investigate the prevalence of emotional,&#xD;
      behavioural and social problems in the FC-population at the first contact with a paediatric&#xD;
      gastroenterologist in a tertiary care hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of functional constipation (FC) in children leads to several diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic challenges. Most children respond well to standard recommended treatment, but&#xD;
      there is a considerable group of patients that will continue to have symptoms. In this group,&#xD;
      paediatricians sometimes presume the presence of an underlying psychopathology such as a&#xD;
      developmental disorder, mood disorder, behavioural disorder. A longer treatment period has&#xD;
      shown strong association with behavioural problems, suggestive for treatment resistant&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that functional defecation disorders (FDD) can be associated with behavioural and&#xD;
      developmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit and&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), though these disorders are often initially unrecognized. Also,&#xD;
      there are no clear guidelines reported regarding the timing when to search for underlying&#xD;
      psychopathology in FC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research using Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Social Communication&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Lifetime (SCQ-L), screening tools for social difficulties, did not identify ASD&#xD;
      diagnosis, in children with functional constipation. At the other hand, they found a total&#xD;
      increase in emotional and behavioural problems in their research group. Prior studies found&#xD;
      that 28 % of children with FDD referred to a tertiary centre scored positive on ASD screening&#xD;
      questionnaires. A high prevalence of behavioural problems (37 %) in children with FC has been&#xD;
      described as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Guidelines for children with FC of the North American and European Societies&#xD;
      of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, the diagnosis of emotional,&#xD;
      behavioural and/or developmental disorders (ASD or ADHD) will be considered after an&#xD;
      unsuccessful six-month standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that it could be useful to incorporate an earlier screening for emotional,&#xD;
      behavioural and autism spectrum disorders into the diagnostic work-up of children with&#xD;
      functional constipation referred to a tertiary care hospital. FC may have an important impact&#xD;
      on the Quality of Life (QoL) in families of these children. Therefore we also measure&#xD;
      parental stress and negative life-events from the child's perspective using the&#xD;
      'Opvoedingsbelasting Vragenlijst' (OBVL) for measurement of parental stress and the&#xD;
      'Vragenlijst Meegemaakte Gebeurtenissen' (VMG) for possible stressful life events from the&#xD;
      child's perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes Dutch and French-speaking children, age 4-18 years, presenting for the&#xD;
      first time at KidZ Health Castle (KHC) Brussels with suspicion of functional constipation&#xD;
      complaints. Children could present ambulatory or could be hospitalized and were eligible&#xD;
      regardless of previously diagnosed behavioural and developmental problems and regardless of&#xD;
      any previous treatment for FDD. The diagnosis of FC was made based on the Rome IV criteria.&#xD;
      Given that the 2 month interval listed in the Rome IV criteria for older children may&#xD;
      unfairly delay treatment in some children with constipation, children who had difficulty with&#xD;
      defecation for at least 2 weeks were also included 3. Children with an underlying organic&#xD;
      cause that could have contributed to the development of constipation and children with&#xD;
      functional non-retentive faecal incontinence (FNRFI) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be given to the consenting parents and/or patients at the first visit&#xD;
      and after 6 months conventional treatment along with an explanation of the research by the&#xD;
      attending pediatrician, informed consent and a return envelope. Each questionnaire will be&#xD;
      anonymized and provided with a code that will be linked to the name and number of the&#xD;
      participant's file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group within the normal range at first visit for the two screening surveys: SRS-2 and&#xD;
      CBC-L will serve as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have to fill in the 2 questionnaires 6 months later, after initiation of&#xD;
      adequate treatment. If the control results are still abnormal, participants will be directed&#xD;
      to the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for further treatment of their&#xD;
      behavioral, emotional or developmental problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen every 2 - 3 months and outcome will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>The set of Aseba Questionnaires is a validated diagnostic tool that can be filled in by the parents, teachers or children to evaluate various behavioral and emotional problems. It assesses internalizing (i.e., anxious, depressive and over-controlled) and externalizing (i.e., aggressive, hyperactive, noncompliant and under-controlled) behaviors. It is the most widely used instrument for assessing child behavioral and emotional symptoms and can be converted into standardized scores (e.g., T scores Mean = 50, SD = 10) with higher scores indicating more emotional problems.</description>
