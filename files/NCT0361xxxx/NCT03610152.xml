  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Institute of Medicine (IOM) suggests that up to 30% of healthcare is considered&#xD;
      low-value, defined as 'a test or treatment for which there is no evidence of benefit to the&#xD;
      patient or where there is evidence of more harm than benefit'. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously found that more than 31% of Ontario patients, who go home the same day as their&#xD;
      surgery, receive unnecessary cardiac testing and/or chest x-rays. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators identified an almost 30-fold variability in how tests are ordered between&#xD;
      different hospitals. While identification of low-value care is an important first step,&#xD;
      additional efforts are required to reduce this waste. The investigators previously explored&#xD;
      the reasons behind low value test ordering through a qualitative study of surgeons and&#xD;
      anesthesiologists. This work has informed the development of a theory-based intervention to&#xD;
      reduce wasteful ordering. The proposed project will conduct a hospital level randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to determine if preoperative testing ordered by anesthesiologist and&#xD;
      supported by a focused implementation strategy can decrease the use of low-value&#xD;
      investigations before elective surgery where patients will go home the same day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) quality improvement framework includes the three pillars of&#xD;
      underuse, overuse and misuse, though misuse and underuse have largely been the historical&#xD;
      focus of quality improvement efforts (1). More recently, there is increasing recognition of&#xD;
      the problem of overuse relating to &quot;low-value care&quot;, defined as 'a test or treatment for&#xD;
      which there is no evidence of patient benefit or where there is evidence of more harm than&#xD;
      benefit'. The IOM suggests that as much as 30% of healthcare qualifies as low-value, which&#xD;
      can lead to: poor patient outcomes due to adverse events of treatments or secondary&#xD;
      unwarranted tests (with potential for over-treatment of incidental findings); and inefficient&#xD;
      use of scarce healthcare resources threatening the sustainability of healthcare systems. In&#xD;
      the context of Ontario, this would equate to over $15 billion wasted on low-value care in&#xD;
      2014 representing a major threat to the sustainability of the Ontario healthcare system.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, recent studies have demonstrated similar levels of low-value care in Ontario&#xD;
      currently, and suggest that there are considerable opportunities to reduce this waste within&#xD;
      the province. For example, the investigators found previously that approximately 30% of&#xD;
      patients received unnecessary cardiac testing and/or chest x-rays prior to ambulatory surgery&#xD;
      (with almost 30-fold variability in ordering between institutions) (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within Canada, provincial governments have made reducing low-value care a priority. Choosing&#xD;
      Wisely Canada (CWC) (4,5) is a professionally led campaign to rally the medical professional&#xD;
      to address this issue and make declarative statements about low-value care that physicians&#xD;
      and patients should avoid or question across a broad range of specialties. To date, 37&#xD;
      Canadian medical specialty societies have developed over 150 recommendations pertaining to&#xD;
      unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the identification of potential areas of low-value care is an important first step in&#xD;
      addressing this problem, additional efforts are required to ensure implementation of CWC&#xD;
      recommendations. Before now, internationally and in Canada, the issue of implementing&#xD;
      Choosing Wisely like recommendations has not received adequate attention. This project&#xD;
      directly addresses this key priority for healthcare systems bringing together Ontarian&#xD;
      experts from CWC, implementation science, relevant clinical content areas and knowledge users&#xD;
      to develop and evaluate programs to implement CWC recommendations. The investigators will use&#xD;
      state-of-the-art approaches from implementation science to develop and evaluate a major&#xD;
      initiative to reduce low-value care in Ontario. Knowledge users include Health Quality&#xD;
      Ontario, the Ontario Hospital Association and Choosing Wisely Canada.&#xD;
