      This is a multicentre dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD9833, alone (Parts A and B) or in combination with&#xD;
      palbociclib (Parts C and D) or in combination with everolimus (Parts E and F) or in&#xD;
      combination with abemaciclib (Parts G and H) or in combination with capivasertib (Parts I and&#xD;
      J), in women with endocrine-resistant ER+ HER2- breast cancer that is not amenable to&#xD;
      treatment with curative intent.&#xD;

Parts A, C, E, G and I of the study allow for dose escalation of AZD9833 alone or in combination with palbociclib, everolimus, abemaciclib or capivasertib. Based on the findings in Parts A, C, E, G and I in Parts B, D, F, H and J of the study (expansions), eligible subjects will be randomised to receive selected doses of AZD9833, alone or in combination with palbociclib, everolimus, abemaciclib or in combination with capivasertib.</intervention_model_description>
