    <textblock>
      An accepted &quot;gold standard&quot; for hemodynamic monitoring in women with both healthy and&#xD;
      diseased hearts is not currently available. Pregnancy is associated with significant&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes, both during and following delivery, which can be even more profound in&#xD;
      the structurally-abnormal heart. Clinical management of these women is based on surrogate&#xD;
      markers of cardiac indices such as peripheral blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, rather than the use of invasive testing due to its associated complications.&#xD;
      Echocardiography has largely replaced PAC in the obstetric population to measure cardiac&#xD;
      output due to its non-invasive nature and good correlation with PAC18. However, its use is&#xD;
      limited in the intrapartum period due to the need for clinical expertise in obtaining and&#xD;
      interpreting the images. The proposed study has the potential to validate bio-reactance&#xD;
      cardiac output monitoring using the NICOM against echocardiography for use in structurally&#xD;
      normal and abnormal pregnant hearts in order to better drive goal-directed (specifically&#xD;
      delivery mode) therapy through continuous hemodynamic monitoring during the second and third&#xD;
      stages of labor, and 24 hours postpartum.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major hormonal and hemodynamic changes occur in the cardiovascular system in pregnancy that&#xD;
      can unmask and impact underlying cardiac disease. Cardiac output can rise by up to 50%&#xD;
      throughout gestation, with an additional 30% rise intrapartum. This increase is&#xD;
      multifactorial, owing to an increase of 50% in maternal blood volume during pregnancy, a&#xD;
      decrease in afterload due to a decline in systemic vascular resistance and a rise in the&#xD;
      maternal heart rate of up to 20 beats per minute. Cardiac output has been the most&#xD;
      extensively studied physiologic parameter of cardiac performance during pregnancy, and is&#xD;
      dependent on both heart rate and stroke volume. Most of the changes in cardiac output on&#xD;
      pregnancy are a result of stroke volume. However, during the mid-second trimester, stroke&#xD;
      volume plateaus while heart rate continues to rise, becoming the major contributor to cardiac&#xD;
      output in the latter half of pregnancy. During labor, cardiac output is further increased by&#xD;
      the autotransfusion of blood from the uterus during a uterine contraction and maternal&#xD;
      expulsive efforts. This can lead to an increase of up to 500cc of blood within seconds into&#xD;
      the systemic circulation, which can significantly impact cardiac output and stroke volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following delivery, many of these cardiovascular changes reverse in the first 2 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum with further normalization toward preconception values 3-12 months later. Women&#xD;
      without heart disease adapt well and adverse events are generally rare. However, the stress&#xD;
      induced by these antenatal changes can cause a patient with underlying disease to&#xD;
      decompensate during the latter half of pregnancy and more specifically, intrapartum when&#xD;
      these changes peak. Studies on maternal morbidity attributable to cardiac disease in the&#xD;
      United States have shown the most likely time for an adverse cardiac event is intrapartum and&#xD;
      immediately postpartum, owing to the drastic and acute changes in hemodynamic status during&#xD;
      these time periods. Without an invasive monitor (PAC), hemodynamic monitoring during these&#xD;
      time relies on surrogate markers such as blood pressure or heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is relatively scarce data on continuous hemodynamic profiles in women with both&#xD;
      congenital and acquired heart disease in pregnancy, specifically during labor. Previous&#xD;
      literature on the use of invasive monitoring (PAC) during pregnancy have been performed only&#xD;
      intermittently during the labor and postpartum process. However, the hemodynamic status&#xD;
      during the second and third labor stages is not static and therefore the need for continuous&#xD;
      evaluation cannot be underscored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased morbidity associated with invasive monitoring limits the use of pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheters in the pregnant population and therefore a non-invasive way to obtain&#xD;
      hemodynamic profiles in women with heart disease is desirable. The non-invasive cardiac&#xD;
      output monitor (NICOM) is based on bio-reactance technology and is operator-independent,&#xD;
      allowing negligible inter-observer variability in data collection and ease of use.&#xD;
      Measurements of cardiac output and stroke volume are not dependent on the distance between&#xD;
      the electrodes, which can significantly increase the accuracy of the results. It involves the&#xD;
      application of four sensors on the thorax. Changes in aortic blood flow drive phase shifts of&#xD;
      propagating waves which are detected by the sensors as the frequency changes. These changes&#xD;
      correlate with instantaneous changes in blood volume and blood flow in the aorta.&#xD;
      Bio-reactance has been validated against pulmonary artery catheters in non-pregnant&#xD;
      populations which manifest various forms of hemodynamic instability and following cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic bio-reactance, or the non-invasive cardiac output measurement [NICOMTM, Cheetah&#xD;
      Medical Inc., Portland, OR] system, is a new technique that is able to measure multiple&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters with four transdermal electrodes placed on the patients' thorax. It is&#xD;
      based on frequency- and phase-modulation of the voltage signal measured in response to an&#xD;
      applied transthoracic current. Its readings have been shown in multiple studies to correlate&#xD;
      well with PAC in the non-pregnant population. It has shown acceptable accuracy, precision and&#xD;
      responsiveness for cardiac output monitoring in patients experiencing a wide-range of&#xD;
      hemodynamic situations. However, it has not been validated in the pregnant, structurally&#xD;
      abnormal heart i.e. congenital cardiac disease, as this was exclusion criteria in the&#xD;
      aforementioned studies. Establishing normative values during the second stage of labor&#xD;
      utilizing the NICOM in women with congenital cardiac disease has the potential to be&#xD;
      clinically useful in developing goal-directed management therapy for these women.&#xD;
