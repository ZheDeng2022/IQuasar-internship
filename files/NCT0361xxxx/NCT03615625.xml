  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a power training session&#xD;
      on office and 24h ambulatory blood pressure in older adults with hypertension. As secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, the investigators compared post-exercise hypotension, BP variability, and&#xD;
      endothelial function between older men and women with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypothesis was that a single bout of power exercise would decrease both office&#xD;
      and 24 h BP in comparison to a non-exercising control session and men and women would respond&#xD;
      differently after a power training session.&#xD;

      Participants randomly performed two experimental sessions: power exercise training (PT) and&#xD;
      non-exercising control at seated rest (Con). They maintained their current antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications throughout the trial. Each session was composed of 20 min of rest in the supine&#xD;
      position, 40 min of PT or Con protocols, and 60 min of rest in supine position after&#xD;
      protocols. The PT was composed of 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions of 5 exercises performed in the&#xD;
      following order: leg press, bench press, knee extension, upright row, and knee flexion, using&#xD;
      an intensity corresponding to 50 % of 1-RM and two-minute intervals between sets and&#xD;
      exercises. The concentric phase of exercises during each repetition was performed &quot;as fast as&#xD;
      possible&quot; while the eccentric phase lasted 1-2 seconds. During the Con, the participants&#xD;
      remained seated rest on the same exercise machines, but without any exercise. Standardized&#xD;
      office BP was performed before and during the first hour (in intervals of 15 min) after&#xD;
      exercise and control sessions. Together with the office BP evaluation in the pre and post&#xD;
      sessions, the endothelium-dependent brachial vascular function was evaluated using&#xD;
      Flow-mediated dilation. Afterwards, participants underwent 24h ambulatory BP monitoring..&#xD;
