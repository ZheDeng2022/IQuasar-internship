  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever is an illness that may cause mild effects in children, such as fever and&#xD;
      feeling tired, or it may cause serious effects-- even death. A new typhoid vaccine has&#xD;
      recently been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent typhoid in&#xD;
      children. But this new typhoid vaccine has not been tested with all of the vaccines given to&#xD;
      children in Burkina Faso. The investigators want to look at this new vaccine, and study how&#xD;
      safe it is in children in Burkina Faso and how their immune systems respond to the vaccine&#xD;
      when given with other vaccines, such as yellow fever and meningitis A vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to vaccinate 100 children between the ages of 9-11 months, and 150&#xD;
      children between the ages of 15 months and 2 years, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, with either&#xD;
      the typhoid vaccine or a vaccine against another illness called polio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will have follow-up visits on days 3, 7, 28 and 180. One teaspoon of blood will be&#xD;
      collected on days 0 and 28.&#xD;

      This study will be divided into two cohorts, by age, with separate study designs. The first&#xD;
      cohort will include children 9 through 11 months of age. The second cohort will comprise&#xD;
      children 15 through 23 months of age. The purpose of this detailed evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity is to assess the reactogenicity of the vaccine and the immune responses to&#xD;
      Vi-TCV. Serum specimens will be collected from all participants on study day 0 (before&#xD;
      vaccination) and on post-vaccination study day 28 to quantify anti-Vi and anti-tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      antibodies. All children will have an additional 0.5 mL of blood collected on study day 0&#xD;
      before study vaccination to test for the presence of malaria parasitemia at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children 9 through 11 months of age in the Ouagadougou study area will be eligible for the&#xD;
      first age cohort, which will be a double-blind, individually randomized, controlled trial. Up&#xD;
      to 100 children in this cohort will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Vi-TCV (Group 1)&#xD;
      or IPV (Group 2). Participants will be unaware of which study vaccine, Vi-TCV or IPV, is&#xD;
      received. Vi-TCV or IPV will be administered with measles-rubella vaccine (MR) and YFV, as&#xD;
      per Burkina Faso Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule. These 9 through&#xD;
      11-month-old children will have immunogenicity to Vi-TCV, YFV, and tetanus toxoid assessed on&#xD;
      study days 0 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children 15 through 23 months of age in the Ouagadougou study area will be eligible for the&#xD;
      second cohort, a randomized study of the safety and immunogenicity of Vi-TCV when&#xD;
      co-administered with routine Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) vaccines (MAV and MR)&#xD;
      or given alone, and MAV immunogenicity when co-adminstered or given alone. Participants in&#xD;
      this cohort (up to 150) will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups, as&#xD;
      follows. The first group of participants (Group A) will receive Vi-TCV and IPV at study day&#xD;
      0, with a subsequent dose of MAV at study day 28; the second group of participants (Group B)&#xD;
      will receive MAV and Vi-TCV at study day 0; the third group (Group C) will receive MAV and&#xD;
      IPV at study day 0. All children will receive MR at study day 0. Cohort 1 will be unblinded&#xD;
      on day 28 for safety and follow-up and to ensure MAV receipt in Group A. These 15 through&#xD;
      23-month-old children will have antibody to meningococcal A vaccine, anti-Vi antibody, and&#xD;
      tetanus toxoid antibody assessed on study days 0 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both cohorts will have home or clinic visits on days 3 and 7 following&#xD;
      vaccination for solicitation of local and systemic adverse events. Non-serious adverse events&#xD;
      will be assessed up until the study day 28 visit. Serious adverse events will be captured&#xD;
      throughout study follow-up and actively during the study day 180 visit.&#xD;

             disease, progressive neurological disorders, poorly controlled seizures, or terminal&#xD;
             illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe malnutrition as determined by a MUAC &lt; 12.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any other investigational intervention in the last 6 months or anticipated&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Temporary Exclusion Criteria: The following will be considered a temporary contraindication&#xD;
        to enrollment and vaccination. If this applies, the participant will be temporarily&#xD;
        excluded for vaccination until 48 hours has passed. A re-assessment will be needed to&#xD;
        ensure the temporary exclusion criteria no longer exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Reported fever within 24 hours before vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        An additional temporary exclusion criteria for cohort 2 will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Receipt of measles-rubella vaccine in the one month before enrollment, as determined by&#xD;
        parental history or vaccination card. A child may be reassessed after 30 days has passed&#xD;
        since receipt of MR vaccine.&#xD;
