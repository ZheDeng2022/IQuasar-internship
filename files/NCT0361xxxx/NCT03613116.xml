      This Phase II randomized clinical trial aims to test if supplementation with high dose oral&#xD;
      vitamin D will successfully correct vitamin D insufficiency, compared to treatment with&#xD;
      standard (RDA) dose vitamin D in a diverse community-based elderly cohort. The effect of&#xD;
      high-dose vs. standard-dose vitamin D on altering cognitive trajectories will also be&#xD;
      assessed and data will be expected to be used in designing a potential definitive Phase III&#xD;
      trial in elderly groups at risk for dementia. A total of 180 elderly persons with&#xD;
      longitudinal biomarkers, neuropsychological testing and brain MRI scans will be enrolled,&#xD;
      with 152 (~50 with MCI, 50 with mild AD and 50 with no cognitive impairment) expected to&#xD;
      complete the 3½-year study. One-half of each diagnostic group will be randomized to treatment&#xD;
      with high-dose vitamin D3 (4,000 IU daily) or to standard dose Vitamin D (600 IU capsule&#xD;
      daily + ~200 IU dietary = ~800 IU total/day). Longitudinal MRI analyses will provide an&#xD;
      estimate of the treatment effect size on brain atrophy rate. Vitamin D receptor genotype&#xD;
      polymorphisms and their impact on response to oral supplementation will also be examined. If&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation improves cognitive outcome, this could have a large impact on the&#xD;
      public health, since low vitamin D status is a common, readably treatable condition which may&#xD;
      provide a novel window to prevent dementia and AD. Furthermore, the higher prevalence of AD&#xD;
      and dementia in African Americans and Latinos could be partially attributable to vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficiency.&#xD;

      1. General Design This Phase 2 randomized clinical trial of high-dose vs. standard dose&#xD;
           Vitamin D (VitD) supplementation aims to prove feasibility of the intervention in a&#xD;
           diverse community-recruited cohort and to provide an estimate of the effect sizes of&#xD;
           treatment on cognitive change and brain MRI volumetric measures as the main outcomes. We&#xD;
           will study 180 elderly participants (approximately 60 with MCI, 60 with mild AD and 60&#xD;
           with No Cognitive Impairment) with longitudinal neuropsychological testing and brain MRI&#xD;
           scans over a 3½ year study period. One-half of each diagnostic group will be randomized&#xD;
           to treatment with high-dose (4,000 IU p.o. daily) vitamin D3 (n=90) or to standard dose&#xD;
           vitamin D3 treatment (n=90 who will receive 600 IU vitamin D3 daily). The choice of the&#xD;
           low-dose amount of vitamin D3 was determined by the goal to meet the Institute of&#xD;
           Medicine (IOM) RDA recommendation of 800 IU/day for older adults (age &gt;71y) from all&#xD;
           sources, including both diet and supplements. The estimated average dietary intake of&#xD;
           VitD by older adults is ~200 IU/day. Thus, the combined intake of VitD from diet and the&#xD;
           low-dose supplement in our study will be approximately the RDA (i.e. 800 IU/day). Blood&#xD;
           will be collected every 6 months (except month 30) for VitD levels along with other&#xD;
           clinical labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study aims to test if supplementation with high dose oral VitD (4,000 IU) will&#xD;
           successfully correct VitD insufficiency, compared to treatment with standard RDA dose&#xD;
           VitD (~800 IU total intake, as recommended by the IOM for those &gt;age 71) in a diverse&#xD;
           community-based cohort with serum VitD levels &lt;20 ng/ml at study entry. The primary aims&#xD;
           are to prove feasibility of the intervention, and the effectiveness of high-dose VitD in&#xD;
           correcting VitD insufficiency in this diverse old cohort. Our primary outcome will be&#xD;
           correction of VitD insufficiency in all subjects treated with 4,000 IU daily. Secondary&#xD;
           aims are to provide an estimate of the effect sizes of treatment on cognitive change&#xD;
           (executive function and global), and to gather preliminary data relevant to the evidence&#xD;
           for moving forward with a potential definitive Phase III study in elderly groups at risk&#xD;
           for dementia. Additional analyses will test if correction of VitD insufficiency&#xD;
           correlates with changes in key biomarkers measured in blood and urine. Longitudinal MRI&#xD;
           analyses will provide an estimate of the treatment effect size on brain atrophy rate. We&#xD;
           will also examine VitD receptor genotype polymorphisms and their impact on response to&#xD;
           oral supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Schedule of Visits Screening Visit (Visit 1). Elderly participants with a prior&#xD;
           diagnosis of either No Cognitive Impairment, MCI, or mild AD, will be screened for&#xD;
           potential study entry. Informed consent will be obtained before any study procedures are&#xD;
           conducted. The following assessments will be done at screen (before Visit 2): MOCA, GDS,&#xD;
           CDR, screening labs, then brain MRI for those who remain eligible. Blood and urine&#xD;
           screening lab results will be reviewed by the investigator or designee for assessment of&#xD;
           eligibility. Patients who do not meet all inclusion criteria or who meet any exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will be discontinued from the study. Up to 45 days are allowed for completion&#xD;
           of Visit 1 screening procedures, assessments, and evaluation of results from laboratory&#xD;
           tests and Brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline Visit (Visit 2). The treatment period is a double-blind phase beginning at&#xD;
           Visit 2, with treatment duration of 3½ years from baseline to the final 42 month visit.&#xD;
           Patients who meet entry criteria will be enrolled and randomized to high-dose VitD 4,000&#xD;
           IU p.o. daily or standard dose VitD (600 IU daily). Randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
           diagnosis and race, such that 50% of each diagnostic subgroup will be randomized to the&#xD;
           high-dose treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessments to be performed at the Baseline visits are: additional neuropsychological&#xD;
           tests including the SENAS and ADAS-Cog, the ECog which has sections completed by the&#xD;
           participant and the informant. Blood samples drawn at the Screening or Baseline visit&#xD;
           will be sent for measurements of parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and genotyping to&#xD;
           include polymorphisms of the VitD receptor for all enrolled subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Telephone Check-Ins at Months 1 and 30. Brief telephone calls will be made to all&#xD;
           enrolled participants at Month 1 &amp; Month 30 to check on compliance with the study&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Period Visits at Months 6 and 18 (Visits 3 &amp; 5). Brief visits will be&#xD;
           performed at Month 6 and Month 18, with venipuncture for blood VitD level and the&#xD;
           ADAS-Cog. In addition, pill counts and study drug compliance will be reviewed and&#xD;
           documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Period Visits at Months 12, 24, 36 and 42 (Visits 4, 6, 8 &amp; 9). These visits&#xD;
           will provide the main outcome measures for the trial. Assessments to be performed at&#xD;
           these visits are: Neuropsychological testing with the SENAS, MOCA and the ADAS-Cog.&#xD;
           Functional assessment instruments (collected from the participant and informant) are the&#xD;
           ECog and CDR. The GDS will also be collected. Blood samples will be drawn for&#xD;
           measurement of VitD level, and both plasma and serum will be stored for additional&#xD;
           studies. The final assessment visit at Month 42 (Visit 9) will take place on the day of&#xD;
           the patient's last VitD dose. A volumetric brain MRI study will also be obtained at this&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Early Termination (ET) Visit (if applicable). For participants who do not complete this&#xD;
           42 month study, an early termination visit will be done whenever possible. For the early&#xD;
           termination visits, we plan to obtain all the measures usually collected at Month 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Protocol Procedures. Medical History, Physical, and Neurological Exam: A complete&#xD;
           medical history with review of systems, and recent medication history will be performed&#xD;
           at screening. All study patients will receive a comprehensive physical examination at&#xD;
           screening and annually. A detailed neurological exam will be performed either at&#xD;
           screening or baseline. Any deficits identified will be documented using a standardized&#xD;
           form. The physician also takes a functional history, and a psychiatric/behavioral&#xD;
           history. Participants will be closely monitored during the treatment period (from month&#xD;
           1 through 42) to assess side effects or adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood draws and Laboratory Tests. Blood samples will be collected into serum separator&#xD;
           tubes (to collect serum) containing EDTA. One EDTA tube will be sent directly to the UC&#xD;
           Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) clinical lab for a complete blood count and measurement of&#xD;
           hemoglobin A1C. A second EDTA tube will be centrifuged at 40C to collect plasma. The&#xD;
           buffy coat of the second tube will be collected and frozen for subsequent isolation of&#xD;
           genomic DNA. Serum and plasma samples will be aliquoted in volumes specific for each&#xD;
           assay, and frozen at -800C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory Assays VitD (25-OHD) level will be performed at screen and every 6 months&#xD;
           after (serum/blood, except for the month 30 Telephone check-in visit). Clinical Labs&#xD;
           (screening): Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), CBC, UA, vitamin B12 at screen. PT/PTT&#xD;
           will be drawn for any participant with history of a coagulopathy or excessive bleeding.&#xD;
           If none of the above screening labs are exclusionary, we will add homocysteine, PTH,&#xD;
           high-sensitivity CRP, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, TNF-alpha, Monocyte chemoattractant&#xD;
           protein-1 (MCP-1), blood and urine Isoprostane F 2-α levels. Inflammatory markers:&#xD;
           annual CRP blood levels and cytokine panel (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1) will be&#xD;
           measured at Baseline and month 42 (or ET visit). Oxidative damage markers: Isoprostane F&#xD;
           2-α levels in blood and urine will be measured at Baseline and month 42 (or ET visit).&#xD;
           Genetic analysis of the VitD receptor will be carried out for SNPs previously associated&#xD;
           with cognitive decline or AD: Apa1, Taq1, CdX, and Bsml. For safety purposes, the&#xD;
           following Labs will be done as needed: Urine &amp; serum Calcium PRN renal stones, cultures&#xD;
           (e.g. urine, blood) and Microbiology tests if with high wbc count. We will repeat CMP&#xD;
           annually (months 12, 24, 36 &amp; 42), and PTH level at month 42 (or ET visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neuropsychological Testing. All subjects will undergo neuropsychological testing with&#xD;
           the MOCA at screening and at the 12, 24, 36 and 42 month visits. The Spanish English&#xD;
           Neuropsychological Assessment Scale (SENAS) will be administered at baseline and at the&#xD;
           12, 24, 36 and 42 month office visits. The ADAS-Cog will be administered at baseline and&#xD;
           every 6 months (except month 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Functional Assessments. All subjects will undergo functional assessments with the ECog&#xD;
           (informant based measure of daily function) and CDR at screen/baseline and at months 12,&#xD;
           24, 36, and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dietary Survey. Dietary data will be collected to assess overall intake of VitD from&#xD;
           food sources. Participants or their caregivers will be interviewed using a validated&#xD;
           VitD Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other Clinical Instruments/Assessments. All subjects will complete the Geriatric&#xD;
           Depression Scale (GDS) at screening and at the 12, 24 &amp; 42 month assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Brain MRI Procedure &amp; Analysis. Structural Brain MRI will be acquired at Screening and&#xD;
           at study end (42 months, or at time of ET visit) for all enrolled participants. Subjects&#xD;
           will be scanned at the UC Davis Imaging Research Center using a 3 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio&#xD;
           machine and ADNI-compatible pulse sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI acquisition and analysis. MRI acquisition will include T1-weighted, fast T2,&#xD;
           fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MRI&#xD;
           data will be analyzed for quantification of regional brain, gray, white and CSF volumes.&#xD;
           All subjects will have baseline and longitudinal quantification of regional WMH, DTI and&#xD;
           gray matter measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), Hypothesis Testing &amp; Statistical Considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A brief description of hypothesis testing strategies and power calculations are provided&#xD;
           separately by aim below. All power calculations assumed a two-sided test and alpha=0.05&#xD;
           unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of high-dose versus standard-dose oral VitD in&#xD;
           correcting low VitD status in a diverse community-based cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1.1: Rate of correction of VitD insufficiency is higher after high-dose&#xD;
           versus standard dose oral VitD supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analytic Plan. The primary analyses for this aim will involve two parts: 1) a&#xD;
           descriptive summary of the percentage of individuals randomized to each group whose VitD&#xD;
           levels reach and continue in the adequate range (&gt;20 ng/ml); and 2) a comparison of the&#xD;
           percentage of individuals whose levels reach the adequate range between the high-dose&#xD;
           and standard dose groups. We will compute the percentage of individuals who attain&#xD;
           adequate VitD levels by six months, the percentage who maintain these levels from months&#xD;
           6 through 42, and 95% confidence intervals. A stratified exact test of proportions will&#xD;
           be used to compare percentages between groups. Secondary analyses will characterize the&#xD;
           trajectory of VitD levels in the two groups over time using mixed effects models to&#xD;
           assess patterns of change, and in particular, whether levels plateau or continue to&#xD;
           increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Power calculations. With 76-90 individuals per group, we will have over 80% power to&#xD;
           detect a difference in percentage that reach or maintain adequate levels between groups&#xD;
           assuming the percentage in the high-dose group is at least 90% and the percentage in the&#xD;
           standard-dose group is no more than 72%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2: To assess the effect of high-dose vs. standard-dose VitD on altering cognitive&#xD;
           trajectories, and gather preliminary data relevant to the design of a potential Phase&#xD;
           III trial in elderly at-risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2.1: High dose VitD supplementation is associated with less cognitive decline&#xD;
           (better cognitive trajectory) in executive function over 3 ½ years than in those&#xD;
           receiving the standard dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale. Published data from our observational study showed a significant difference&#xD;
           in rates of decline between those with insufficient or deficient serum VitD levels and&#xD;
           those whose levels are in the adequate range. If high-dose VitD supplementation results&#xD;
           in a slowing of cognitive decline, similar to that seen between the decline in the&#xD;
           inadequate or deficient group and the adequate group, in addition to evidence of&#xD;
           effectiveness (Aim 1) and biological mechanism (Aim 3), such a result would support&#xD;
           moving on to a Phase III clinical trial for a definitive demonstration of clinical&#xD;
           efficacy of high-dose VitD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analytic Plan. The primary outcome for this aim is the SENAS executive function score,&#xD;
           assessed annually over the course of the trial. A secondary outcome is the ADAS-Cog&#xD;
           (global cognition). The analytic strategy is the same for each outcome and will utilize&#xD;
           an intent-to-treat approach in which everyone randomized to the high dose group will be&#xD;
           compared to those randomized to the standard dose regardless of adherence to treatment;&#xD;
           secondary as-treated analyses will utilize continuous serum VitD levels as a measure of&#xD;
           exposure to VitD to assess a &quot;dose-response&quot; relationship. Mixed effects regression&#xD;
           models, similar to those described above for the secondary analyses for VitD&#xD;
           trajectories will be used to assess differences in rates of decline. Models will further&#xD;
           include age, education, ethnicity, ApoE4 status, BMI, and season of blood draw as&#xD;
           covariates. Secondary analyses will compare those with adequate serum VitD levels by six&#xD;
           months (who sustain levels throughout the treatment period) to those with continued VitD&#xD;
           insufficiency. Further secondary analyses will utilize the continuous serum VitD levels&#xD;
           as time-varying variables in the models to assess how levels over time are associated&#xD;
           with level and change in cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Power calculations. Because this Phase II trial will assess preliminary evidence of&#xD;
           efficacy, the type I error rate (alpha) will be set at 0.05 and power will be based on a&#xD;
           one-tailed test as is standard for Phase II trials to assess whether rates of decline&#xD;
           are slower in the high-dose group than in the standard-dose group. Using estimates of&#xD;
           between and within-person variability in change in executive function from preliminary&#xD;
           data, with 76 individuals (completers) per group, we will have 80% power to detect a&#xD;
           difference in the rate of executive function decline, based on the effects seen in our&#xD;
           observational study. We allow for up to a 15.5% drop out rate with dropout uncorrelated&#xD;
           to missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 3 (exploratory): To compare the effects of high-dose VitD versus standard-dose VitD&#xD;
           on key brain, blood and urine biomarkers relevant to healthy brain aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 3.1: High dose VitD supplementation is associated with less brain atrophy&#xD;
           (total gray + white matter volume) and less loss of hippocampal volume over 3 ½ years&#xD;
           than in those on standard dose VitD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 3.2: Blood inflammatory markers are lower in persons on high-dose VitD&#xD;
           supplementation compared to persons on standard dose VitD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 3.3: Blood and urine markers of oxidative stress are lower in persons on&#xD;
           high-dose VitD supplementation compared to persons on standard dose VitD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale. MRI, blood and urine markers provide information on the potential biological&#xD;
           mechanisms of VitD supplementation, and in particular, correction of VitD insufficiency.&#xD;
           These exploratory hypotheses will provide further evidence of the benefit of VitD&#xD;
           supplementation in at risk elderly individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analytic Plan The analysis strategy will be similar for each of these hypotheses. MRI&#xD;
           and measures from blood (e.g. CRP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha), and urine (e.g. isoprostane)&#xD;
           will be acquired at baseline and at month 42 (or the ET). The primary outcome will be&#xD;
           the value from the final visit. Because this is a randomized trial, it is expected that&#xD;
           the baseline means will be similar in the two groups, so that a primary comparison of&#xD;
           the measure at the final visit provides an assessment of the impact of high- vs standard&#xD;
           dose VitD supplementation. Linear regression, using the baseline measure as a covariate&#xD;
           will be used. Other covariates, including age, and ApoE4 status will be included in the&#xD;
           models. To account for differences in the timing of the final visit (since some may be&#xD;
           terminal visits prior to the end of the trial), time since baseline will be included.&#xD;
           Model assumptions of normality of the residuals, constant variance, and linearity will&#xD;
           be checked and transformations or nonlinear models will be used if needed. Secondary&#xD;
           analyses will compare those individuals who have sustained corrected VitD levels versus&#xD;
           those who remain insufficient. Hypotheses will be supported if the average levels at the&#xD;
           terminal visit are improved in the high-dose group relative to the standard dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Power calculations. With 152 individuals, we will have 80% power to detect a difference&#xD;
           between groups as small as 0.46 standard deviations (SD). Using data from the&#xD;
           Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, brain atrophy and hippocampal atrophy over&#xD;
           3 ½ years between Normal and MCI individuals ranged from 0.53-0.69 SD. Therefore, we&#xD;
           will have sufficient power to detect a slowing in atrophy rates comparable to an&#xD;
           improvement of the MCI subjects to the rate of cognitively normal individuals through&#xD;
           VitD supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additional exploratory analyses. Additional analyses will examine the effects of&#xD;
           high-dose VitD on measures of mood (GDS), using the GDS as the outcome in mixed effects&#xD;
           regression models. Because response to VitD supplementation may differ by VitD receptor&#xD;
           genotype, the association between genotype and cognitive decline and brain atrophy will&#xD;
           be explored by adding genotype to the models used for Aim 2 and Hypothesis 3.1. For&#xD;
           planning of the Phase III clinical trial, differences in effects by diagnosis will be&#xD;
           explored. We will biobank serum and plasma making these materials available for further&#xD;
           analyses which could include metabolomics and further genetic characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety analyses. The Data Safety Monitoring Board for this study will review Adverse&#xD;
           Events and all safety data collected every six months, commencing with the first patient&#xD;
           enrolled. The DSMB will be particularly concerned with falls and fractures, renal&#xD;
           stones, hepatic/renal insufficiency, and achieving extremely high levels of VitD.&#xD;
           Frequencies of these events will be recorded and compared between the high- and standard&#xD;
           dose groups. Overall, we expect the tolerability of VitD supplementation to be excellent&#xD;
           in this population, but will test if safety and aspects of health are superior/inferior&#xD;
           in either of the treatment arms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion criteria for this study are: 1) Age 65-90; 2) Low Vitamin D status, defined&#xD;
             by a serum 25-OHD &lt;20 ng/ml, as measured by competitive immunoassay at the Screening&#xD;
             visit; 3) Fluent in either English or Spanish; 4) Willingness to be randomized to&#xD;
             high-dose vs. standard dose vitamin D; 5) Education adjusted scores between 12-30 on&#xD;
             the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) at baseline; 6) A consensus clinical&#xD;
             diagnosis of No Cognitive Impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or mild AD dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to be included in the No Cognitive Impairment (NC) subgroup, an individual&#xD;
             must show no significant cognitive impairment on the baseline neuropsychological&#xD;
             tests. Diagnoses are made by a comprehensive case conference review, including&#xD;
             investigators from both sites, resulting in a consensus diagnosis made according to&#xD;
             current research criteria. We will also require a minimum MOCA score of 23 or above&#xD;
             for those with education &gt;12 y, or MOCA &gt;20 (uncorrected score) for those with&#xD;
             education &lt;12 years. These subjects are expected to mostly have CDR global scores of&#xD;
             0, but we will not exclude CDR=0.5, as long as Peterson criteria (Petersen, Journal of&#xD;
             Internal Medicine 2004) for MCI (amnestic or non-amnestic) are not met and the CDR-Sum&#xD;
             of Boxes is &lt;1.0. Similarly, we will not exclude elderly with subjective memory&#xD;
             complaints from the NC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to be included in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subgroup, a participant&#xD;
             will need to meet research criteria for amnestic MCI, either single-domain or&#xD;
             multiple-domain (McKhann et al, Neurology 1984). Thus, participants with amnestic MCI&#xD;
             will have standardized memory scores &gt;1.5 SDs below average, and if cognitive scores&#xD;
             in other cognitive domains are also &gt;1.5 SDs below average they will be classified as&#xD;
             multiple-domain amnestic MCI. All MCI participants will be required to have a global&#xD;
             CDR=0.5. In addition, we will require a minimum MOCA score of &gt;20 for those with&#xD;
             education &gt;12 y, or MOCA &gt;17 (uncorrected score) for those with education &lt;12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to be included in the Mild AD dementia subgroup, a participant will need to&#xD;
             meet research criteria for probable or possible AD (McKhann et al, Neurology 1984). A&#xD;
             global CDR score of 1 will be required (mild dementia). In addition, we will require a&#xD;
             minimum MOCA score of &gt;15 at entry for those with education &gt;12 y, or MOCA &gt;12&#xD;
             (uncorrected score) for those with education &lt;12 y. AD therapies will be allowed (e.g.&#xD;
             donepezil, memantine) as long as doses have been stable for &gt;6 weeks, and no changes&#xD;
             in doses or CNS active medications are planned while participating in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria (for all participants) are: 1) Lacks adequate vision, hearing, or&#xD;
             literacy to complete the required psychometric tests (e.g. severe bilateral deafness&#xD;
             despite use of hearing aids, or visual acuity poorer than 20/100 in both eyes); 2)&#xD;
             Hepatic insufficiency, defined by either albumin &lt;3.3 g/dL or by a value &gt;2X the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN) in either alanine aminotransaminase (ALT/SGPT) or bilirubin, or&#xD;
             &gt;3X the ULN for aspartate aminotransaminase (AST/SGOT); 3) Renal insufficiency,&#xD;
             defined by either serum creatinine &gt;1.7 mg/dL or glomerular filtration rate &lt;40&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m2; (calculated per CKD-EPI formula). 4) Hypercalcemia, defined by serum&#xD;
             calcium level &gt;2 standard deviations above the mean. Corrected Calcium mg/dL =&#xD;
             [0.8*(4.0g/dL - Patients Albumin g/dL)] + Serum Calcium mg/dL (X of 8.6-10.5 is in&#xD;
             normal range; formula accurate only if Albumin is in 3.2-4.6 range). 5) Current&#xD;
             serious or unstable medical illnesses including cardiovascular (e.g. unstable ischemic&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease), hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory,&#xD;
             endocrinologic, neurologic, psychiatric, immunologic, or hematologic disease and other&#xD;
             conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could interfere with the participant&#xD;
             being able to safely take high-dose vitamin D for the 3.5 year study duration; or has&#xD;
             a life expectancy of &lt;4 years; 6) History of recurrent renal stones; 7) Unable to&#xD;
             undergo MRI scanning (e.g. pacemaker, metallic implants, severe claustrophobia); 8)&#xD;
             Subjects with a history of osteoporosis will be excluded if the Screening serum 25-OHD&#xD;
             level is &lt; 12 ng/ml. 9) History of chronic psychiatric illness (e.g. schizophrenia,&#xD;
             bipolar disorder), any episode of major depression within last 2 years, or current GDS&#xD;
             &gt; 6, any recent suicide attempts or suicidal ideation; 10) history within the last 5&#xD;
             years of a serious infectious disease affecting the brain (including neurosyphilis,&#xD;
             meningitis, or encephalitis), or head trauma resulting in protracted loss of&#xD;
             consciousness (&gt;10 minutes) or any persistent cognitive deficit; 11) History of&#xD;
             chronic alcohol or drug abuse/dependence as defined by DSM-IV, within the past 5&#xD;
             years; 12) History within the last 5 years of a primary or recurrent malignant disease&#xD;
             with the exceptions of resected cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in situ, basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ, or non-metastatic prostate cancer with a normal&#xD;
             prostate-specific antigen post-treatment; 13) Does not have good venous access, such&#xD;
             that multiple blood draws would be precluded; 14) Regular use of any of these CNS&#xD;
             active medications: benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, narcotics, cholinesterase&#xD;
             inhibitors, memantine or anti-epileptic drugs. Stable doses of SSRIs or SNRI&#xD;
             anti-depressants will be allowed, and included persons will be discouraged to change&#xD;
             the doses of any potentially CNS active medication throughout the 3.5-year study. 15)&#xD;
             Those who plan to change their dosage of any vitamin supplement during the duration of&#xD;
             the study may be discontinued from the clinical trial. Changes in vitamin supplement&#xD;
             dosing (e.g. vitamin B12) will only be allowed if a specific deficiency has been&#xD;
             found. If participants are taking vitamin D supplementation (e.g. in a daily&#xD;
             multi-vitamin) at the time of screening, they should continue on this same dose of&#xD;
             vitamin supplementation throughout the duration of the randomized clinical trial. 16)&#xD;
             Current participation in any clinical trial involving experimental AD therapies&#xD;
             (anti-amyloid, anti-tau, etc.). 17) Female subjects who are pregnant or plan to become&#xD;
             pregnant during participation in this trial. 18) Inability to swallow oral capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will not exclude subjects with stable coronary artery disease or vascular risk&#xD;
             factors such as diabetes or hypertension, who otherwise meet our inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
             criteria. We will allow inclusion of participants with prior TIA or prior history of&#xD;
             one stroke, but will exclude those with past history of multiple strokes. We will&#xD;
             allow participants with up to two incidental infarcts on structural MRI, because the&#xD;
             presence of cerebrovascular disease is very common in any representative sample of&#xD;
             U.S. elderly persons, and may be an important contributor to dementia and&#xD;
             age-associated cognitive decline. We will not exclude those with severe white matter&#xD;
             (WM) hyperintensities, for similar reasons.&#xD;
