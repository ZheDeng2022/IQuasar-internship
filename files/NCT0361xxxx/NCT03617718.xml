    <textblock>
      This study is testing a non invasive way to measure airway pH in individuals with Asthma and&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis using a new inhaled drug. The airway pH will help health care providers in&#xD;
      creating tailored treatment plans for individuals suffering from these specific conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma can affect patients in different ways. Some of the differences in how severe asthma is&#xD;
      or how well patients respond to asthma medicines are due to differences in the biology of the&#xD;
      airways or breathing tubes. The pH of the airway, which is a measure of the balance between&#xD;
      acids and bases in our airways, is one example of how differences in biology can affect&#xD;
      asthma and other lung diseases. Airway pH can be measured during a procedure called a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, in which a camera is inserted into the airways or breathing tubes. The lower&#xD;
      the pH, the more acid is present. People with lower airway pHs, or more acid present in their&#xD;
      airways/breathing tubes, tend to have more trouble with their asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pH value or acid level in the airway plays a role in respiratory function (breathing) and&#xD;
      preventing inflammation (swelling) in the respiratory tract (throat, airways, and lungs).&#xD;
      Studies have found that in individuals with asthma, Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and other pulmonary&#xD;
      disorders, a lower pH value is present in the airway when compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;
      Studies have also found that patients with asthma have a lower airway pH during asthma&#xD;
      flares, and may affect how well some breathing medicines work. If we can better identify the&#xD;
      changes in the airways or breathing pipes in patients with asthma and CF, we may be able to&#xD;
      help patients make better choices about the medicines or treatments that are most likely to&#xD;
      work best for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right now the only way to measure airway pH is with a bronchoscopy procedure. During a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, a scope with a camera is inserted into the breathing tubes, often under&#xD;
      sedation in a special procedure area. This research study is being done to test if we can&#xD;
      measure how acidic the airway is in a simple and non-invasive test that can be done in a&#xD;
      doctor's office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-invasive diagnostic test, called a Glycine Buffer Challenge test, may be able to&#xD;
      identify which asthma and CF patients have low airway pH levels. We are also studying the&#xD;
      phenotypes (observable traits) in asthma and CF patients with decreased airway pH values. If&#xD;
      this research study is successful, in the future (after this research study is done) we may&#xD;
      be able to offer better ways to treat patients with low airway pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Glycine Buffer Challenge test includes giving an investigational drug to breathe in&#xD;
      (inhale). The investigational drug is the Glycine Buffer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means the drug is&#xD;
      not approved by any regulatory agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and&#xD;
      is still being tested for safety and effectiveness. The research is registered with the FDA,&#xD;
      but again the Glycine Buffer treatment in this study administered (during the Glycine Buffer&#xD;
      challenge testing) is not an approved treatment or diagnostic test for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll a total of 75 volunteers; 50 volunteers with severe asthma, 15&#xD;
      volunteers with cystic fibrosis, and 10 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
