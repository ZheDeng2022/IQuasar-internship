  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that problem gambling and tobacco smoking are highly comorbid. Problem&#xD;
      gamblers who smoke tend to: have more severe gambling problems, experience stronger gambling&#xD;
      urges, have other mental disorders, bet larger sums of money, spend more time in gambling&#xD;
      activities, and have greater financial problems. Accordingly, it might be helpful to reduce&#xD;
      your smoking as well, while you are trying to get a grip on your gambling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have treated gambling on its own or tobacco smoking on its own. To date,&#xD;
      there has not been a treatment that has targeted treating both at the same time. Considering&#xD;
      how often these conditions occur together, it is important to see if combining their&#xD;
      treatment results in beneficial outcomes. In the current research, the researchers aim to&#xD;
      design and test an online, self-help intervention for co-occurring problem gambling and&#xD;
      tobacco smoking. It will draw on strategies from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) - both which have been shown to be successful in treating&#xD;
      problem gambling and tobacco smoking. These outcomes will be compared to a group that&#xD;
      receives treatment for problem gambling only. This research will provide insight into a&#xD;
      potential new intervention for treating two highly co-occurring conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are hoping to recruit 300 participants for this study. Half (150) of these&#xD;
      individuals will receive the integrated treatment, where both gambling and smoking behaviours&#xD;
      will be addressed. Those in the integrated group will be encouraged to use nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of nicotine patches. These patches will be provided to&#xD;
      participants at the beginning of the intervention and will be encouraged to use for the&#xD;
      duration of the 8-weeks. The the other half of the participants (150) will receive the&#xD;
      problem gambling treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants provided informed consent and are registered on the treatment website, they&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a baseline assessment in order to determine eligibility. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be those that: are aged 19 years old+, have at least moderate levels of&#xD;
      gambling, report current daily smoking, are fluent in English, have weekly internet access,&#xD;
      and report at least moderate motivation to change gambling and/or smoking behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the link is available, participants will complete the online, self-help 8-week&#xD;
      treatment. At the end of the program, they will complete the same brief questionnaires. Six&#xD;
      months following the completion of the online program, they will complete the same series of&#xD;
      brief questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment condition will have access to 7 treatment modules on content surrounding both gambling and smoking behaviours. Participants will have 8-weeks to complete them. The content of all modules is derived from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Motivational Interviewing. Through module engagement, participants will identify goals related to gambling and smoking behaviours, learn strategies to cope with cravings and triggers, and learn how to prevent relapse. Participants will have immediate access to all modules, and it will be recommended that they work through the modules sequentially. Participants in this condition will also be provided with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of nicotine patches to use for the duration of the study.</description>
