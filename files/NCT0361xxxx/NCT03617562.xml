  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little evidence exists to guide treatment in patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff&#xD;
      tears (MRCTS). Arthroscopic partial rotator cuff repair (PRCR) has the longest record of use.&#xD;
      The new technique of superior capsular reconstruction (SCR) has more recently been described.&#xD;
      Despite high enthusiasm for this technique, its effectiveness, cost and safety profile have&#xD;
      not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to perform a multicenter randomized control trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of SCR compared to PRCR in patients with MRCTS. The current study&#xD;
      is a pilot required to support the development of an expanded formal clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to improve the management of patients suffering from massive&#xD;
      irreparable rotator cuff tears. Despite several available surgical options, no level 1&#xD;
      evidence or randomized clinical trials have been performed in this patient population to&#xD;
      date. Arthroscopic partial rotator cuff repair (PRCR) is arguably the gold-standard surgical&#xD;
      option with the longest record of use. The new technique of superior capsular reconstruction&#xD;
      (SCR) has also emerged with early biomechanical and case series showing promising results.&#xD;
      SCR has quickly made its way into clinical practice in North America. Despite this, the&#xD;
      effectiveness, cost, and safety profile has not been established for this procedure. As such,&#xD;
      patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears are in need of high level evidence to&#xD;
      support surgical decision making, particular with regards to the proliferation of SCR&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial comparing superior&#xD;
      capsular reconstruction using dermal allograft with arthroscopic partial repair in patients&#xD;
      with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears. In this study, &quot;double-blind&quot; includes study&#xD;
      patients and outcome assessors. Randomization will occur intra-operatively once a tear is&#xD;
      determined to be irreparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted at 7 sites and involve 7 surgeons. Surgeons must meet&#xD;
      eligibility requirements to participate (shoulder or sports fellowship-trained, minimum of 3&#xD;
      SCR procedures, and 25 arthroscopic rotator cuff repair procedures in the past year). A&#xD;
      member of the local research team will pre-screen consults of eligible patients. Full&#xD;
      eligibility will be determined during the primary appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon.&#xD;
      Baseline data will be recorded following informed consent. Postoperative outcomes will be&#xD;
      measured during regularly scheduled clinic visits (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1-year and&#xD;
      2-year post-surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, patients will have informed consent for both procedures, with randomization&#xD;
      to be performed intraoperatively. Based on initial arthroscopic assessment of the shoulder,&#xD;
      patients that have a confirmed irreparable tear will be randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
      arthroscopic partial repair or superior capsular reconstruction. Surgical techniques will be&#xD;
      standardized. Allocation will be concealed using a centralized 24-hour computerized&#xD;
      randomization system that will allow Internet-based allocation. A random number generator&#xD;
      will be used to create a 1:1 allocation scheme for randomization of the patient into one of&#xD;
      the two treatment groups. The post-operative therapy regimen will be the same for each group.&#xD;
