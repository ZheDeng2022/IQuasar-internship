    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well manual therapy works in treating fibrosis-related late effect&#xD;
      dysphagia in head and neck cancer survivors. Manual therapy is the use of massage and&#xD;
      stretching exercises to increase blood flow and muscle movement in the neck, throat, jaw, and&#xD;
      mouth, which may help to improve swallowing ability and range of motion in participants who&#xD;
      have had treatment for head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of manual therapy for treatment of&#xD;
      fibrosis-related dysphagia in head and neck cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.To estimate effect size, dose-response (number of treatment sessions to normalized cervical&#xD;
      range of motion), and durability of manual therapy for improving cervical range of motion in&#xD;
      head and neck cancer survivors with fibrosis-related late dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine functional outcomes after manual therapy in head and neck cancer survivors&#xD;
      with fibrosis-related late effects and their association with change in dysphagia grade,&#xD;
      cervical extension, and other cofactors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive 10 manual therapy sessions performed by a speech pathologist during&#xD;
      weeks 1-6. After completion of 6 weeks of therapy, participants perform manual therapy at&#xD;
      home daily for 6 weeks.&#xD;

Session attendance will be monitored separately to assess adherence and fidelity.
