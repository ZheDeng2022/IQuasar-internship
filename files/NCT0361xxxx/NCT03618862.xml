  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that controls the transcription of many&#xD;
      genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. A recent study opens the hypothesis that&#xD;
      Farnesoid X receptor also participates in deoxyribonucleic acid repair mechanisms and&#xD;
      possibly in the fight against cell invasion by foreign genomes. This hypothesis implied that&#xD;
      modulation of Farnesoid X receptor by ligands could modify Human Immunodeficiency Virus&#xD;
      replication. The results of in vitro studies with Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected cell&#xD;
      lines indicate that indeed the modulation of Farnesoid X receptor activity by its ligands&#xD;
      induces stimulation of virus production rapidly followed by cell death; the overall effect is&#xD;
      therefore antiviral. Farnesoid X receptor ligands have also shown an effect on the&#xD;
      reactivation of proviruses in cellular models of viral latency studies. This last data raises&#xD;
      the hope of being able to intervene on the reservoir of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore crucial to confirm on quiescent CD4 + T lymphocytes of patients whose viral&#xD;
      load is controlled by antiretroviral treatment combining several antiretrovirals the results&#xD;
      obtained with the in vitro models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing proof of concept that Farnesoid X receptor agonists can reactivate latent&#xD;
      proviruses will open new therapeutic perspectives for attacking the Human Immunodeficiency&#xD;
      Virus reservoir with a view to achieving a functional cure for Acquired Immune Deficiency&#xD;
      Syndrome. The objective of the study is to confirm ex vivo the data obtained in vitro with&#xD;
      cellular models and laboratory viral strains. It is therefore necessary to show that&#xD;
      Farnesoid X receptor agonists can reactivate latent viruses or proviruses present in&#xD;
      quiescent CD4 + T circulating lymphocytes prepared from venous blood of HIV-positive patients&#xD;
      under cART. Human Immunodeficiency Virus-positive patients will be any patients, irrespective&#xD;
      of the viral genotype, who initiated antiretroviral therapy, regardless of the combination of&#xD;
      antiretrovirals, away from primary infection, when they already had a complete western blot,&#xD;
      indicating an evolution of the infection without treatment and constitution of an already&#xD;
      evolved reservoir. Patients will have had an undetectable viral load since initiation of&#xD;
      treatment with a follow-up of at least one year and will have at least 500 CD4 + T&#xD;
      lymphocytes / mm3.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the presence or absence of reactivation of latent proviruses present in quiescent CD4 + T cells purified from peripheral venous blood following treatment of these cells with Farnesoid X receptor agonists.&#xD;
This is a composite endpoint because the reactivation will be determined qualitatively, virus production or not after treatment, and quantitatively, level of production of infectious and / or defective viruses.</description>
