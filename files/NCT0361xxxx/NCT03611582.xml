  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the change in participant's body weight from the start to the end of&#xD;
      the study. This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a new&#xD;
      medicine) and people taking &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. Together with the medicine, the participant&#xD;
      will also be part of an intensive lifestyle program where the participant will have talks&#xD;
      with study staff about healthy food choices, what the participant can do to lose weight and&#xD;
      be more physically active. The participant will either get semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine -&#xD;
      which treatment the participant gets is decided by chance. The participant will need to take&#xD;
      1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in&#xD;
      the stomach, thigh or upper arm. For the first 2 months the participant will be on a low&#xD;
      calorie diet. The diet is made up of bars, shakes and 1 low calorie pre-prepared meal for&#xD;
      each day. The study will last for about 1.5 years. The participant will have 32 clinic visits&#xD;
      with the study doctor.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Physical Functioning Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to week 68</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). The 0-100 scale scores from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively. Change from week 0 in the domain scores and component summary scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. These endpoints were evaluated based on the data from in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from start of randomisation (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted in 41 sites in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial has a 68-week treatment period (16 weeks of dose escalation and 52 weeks of maintenance dose). Participants were randomised in 2:1 ratio either to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Semaglutide 2.4 mg</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c) injection of semaglutide using a PDS290 pre-filled pen-injector with a 3 mL cartridge containing semaglutide 1.0 mg/mL or 3.0 mg/mL or 3.2 mg/mL in 16 week dose escalation period with dose escalation (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg) every fourth week until maintenance dose of 2.4 mg of semaglutide was reached. Treatment was continued on the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly for an additional 52 weeks until week 68. The treatment was an adjunct to Intensive Behavioural Therapy (IBT), which involves physical activity and dietary intervention with the first 8 weeks of a low-calorie diet (LCD) followed by a strict hypo-caloric diet till the end of treatment.</description>

        <description>Number of participants who achieved greater than or equal to (≥) 5% weight loss after 68 weeks is presented. In the reported data, 'Yes' infers the number of participants who have achieved ≥ 5% weight loss, whereas 'No' infers the number of participants who have not achieved ≥ 5% weight loss. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from both in-trial and on-treatment observation periods. In-trial observation period: the uninterrupted time interval from start of randomization (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75). On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68), including 2 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Physical Functioning Score</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). The 0-100 scale scores from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively. Change from week 0 in the domain scores and component summary scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. These endpoints were evaluated based on the data from in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from start of randomisation (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

        <title>Participants Who Achieve (Yes/no): Responder Definition Value for SF-36 Physical Functioning Score</title>
        <description>The observed number of participants experiencing a meaningful within participant improvement in SF-36 Physical function after 68 weeks was determined based on two thresholds. The threshold of 4.3 is the default generic responder threshold defined in SF-36 manual for a general population. The threshold of 3.7 is specific for overweight or obese population included in the study and calculated using patient global rating anchor questionnaires to reflect participants' own perspective based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations. In the reported data, &quot;Yes&quot; infers number of participants who have achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold and &quot;No&quot; infers number of participants who have not achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold. The endpoint was evaluated based on the in-trial observation period which is uninterrupted time interval from randomization (week 0) to last trial related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. All AEs mentioned here are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to treatment. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68), including 7 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 7 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. All AEs mentioned here are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to treatment. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68), including 7 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 7 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>

          <description>Change in calcitonin (measured as ng/L) is presented as ratio to baseline. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68) including 2 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 2 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>
          <population>SAS included all participants who received at least one dose of trial product. Overall number of participants analyzed = number of participants with available data.</population>

          <description>Participants were to receive once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c) injection of semaglutide using a PDS290 pre-filled pen-injector with a 3 mL cartridge containing semaglutide 1.0 mg/mL or 3.0 mg/mL or 3.2 mg/mL in 16 week dose escalation period with dose escalation (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg) every fourth week until maintenance dose of 2.4 mg of semaglutide was reached. Treatment was continued on the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly for an additional 52 weeks until week 68. The treatment was an adjunct to Intensive Behavioural Therapy (IBT), which involves physical activity and dietary intervention with the first 8 weeks of a low-calorie diet (LCD) followed by a strict hypo-caloric diet till the end of treatment.</description>
