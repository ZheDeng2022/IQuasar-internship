      The purpose of this study is to examine changes in serum butyrate levels with the prebiotic:&#xD;
      Prebiotin (12g/day), an oligofructose-enriched inulin (OEI); the effect of OEI on the&#xD;
      composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in people with schizophrenia; and the&#xD;
      relationship of the composition of the gut microbiota to various clinical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      neuroimaging variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 10 years, considerable evidence has emerged from animal studies to suggest that&#xD;
      the gut microbiome has significant effects on brain development and behavior, with&#xD;
      bidirectional communication between the enteric nervous system, gut and the central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) (Diaz Heijtz et al, 2011; Douglas-Escobar et al, 2013; Dinan et al, 2014). The&#xD;
      gut microbiota have been shown to: a) produce multiple neurotransmitters, including&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, norepinepherine, and serotonin, and may regulate&#xD;
      CNS levels of these neurotransmitters; b) modulate brain development through the regulation&#xD;
      of synaptogenesis; and c) modulate the levels of stress hormones during brain development,&#xD;
      which may affect stress response and anxiety behavior (Diaz Heijtz et al, 2011; Dinan et al,&#xD;
      2014; Sudo et al, 2004; O'Mahony et al, 2015). Moreover, the gut microbiota effects the&#xD;
      production of neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays&#xD;
      a significant role in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Sudo et al, 2004; Nemani et al,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiome may also affect brain development and function through its regulation of&#xD;
      immune system function, which is mediated, in part, through the production of short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acids (SCFA). There are three major SCFAs: butyrate, propionate, and acetate. Butyrate&#xD;
      is of particular interest, since it plays a key role in maintaining gut homeostasis and&#xD;
      epithelial integrity: butyrate is the primary energy source for intestinal colonocytes; and,&#xD;
      of the three SCFAs, butyrate appears to have the most pronounced effects on immune system&#xD;
      function and may exert its effects directly through immune pathways and indirectly through&#xD;
      the maintenance of the integrity of the intestinal-blood barrier (Hamer et al, 2008; Louis et&#xD;
      al, 2010; Brahe et al, 2013; Vital et al, 2014). The intestinal-blood barrier restricts the&#xD;
      entrance of toxins, pathogens and antigens into the blood circulation; thus, increased&#xD;
      permeability could lead to the entrance of substances and subsequent immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multiple effects of the gut microbiome on brain development and behavior, suggest that&#xD;
      alterations in the gut microbiome may occur in schizophrenia and play a part in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of the disorder. The increased prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in&#xD;
      schizophrenia; the association of infections, including infections with Toxoplasma gondii,&#xD;
      which can induce intestinal inflammation, with the risk for the development of schizophrenia;&#xD;
      and evidence of increased gut permeability provide further indirect evidence for disruption&#xD;
      of the gut microbiome in this disorder (Dinan et al, 2014; Nemani et al, 2015; Severance et&#xD;
      al, 2012; Severance et al, 2014). Although a number of studies have been conducted in other&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism (Parracho et al, 2005; Tomova et al, 2015),&#xD;
      which demonstrate altered bacterial composition of the gut microbiome, there is only one&#xD;
      published study of the microbiome in schizophrenia. Yolken and colleagues examined the&#xD;
      oropharyngeal microbiome in people with schizophrenia, and found that there were increased&#xD;
      levels of the bacteriophage, Lactobacillus phage phiadh, genome in the schizophrenia group,&#xD;
      which were correlated with co-occurring immunological disorders (Yolken et al, 2015). There&#xD;
      is one published study of gut microbiota in schizophrenia. Shen and colleagues found a&#xD;
      significant reduction in butyrate producers in people with schizophrenia compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls (Shen et al. Schiz Res, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2018.01.002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine changes in serum butyrate levels with the prebiotic:&#xD;
      Prebiotin (12g/day), an oligofructose-enriched inulin (OEI); the effect of OEI on the&#xD;
      composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in people with schizophrenia; and the&#xD;
      relationship of the composition of the gut microbiota to various clinical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      neuroimaging variables.&#xD;

    <description>We will use the following procedure to assess the effect of Prebiotin (OEI) on serum butyrate levels: there will be two test days: a) baseline (Day 0), prior to randomization to OEI or placebo; and b) Day 11, following the 10 day course of OEI/placebo treatment. We will use OEI for the inulin challenge. On the night prior to each test day, participants will receive a digestable and non-fermentable meal, e.g. lasagna. They will then fast from midnight until the morning, when they will receive their standard breakfast and OEI, 12g. We will collect fasting and 6-hour blood samples from each participant. The Day 11 change in serum butyrate levels following the OEI challenge dose (6-hour minus fasting serum butyrate level) will be compared to the Day 0 change in serum butyrate levels to determine whether the 10-day OEI treatment regimen modified the hypothesized biological signature through increased activity of butyrate-producing bacteria. Serum butyrate will be quantified by LC-MS/MS.</description>
