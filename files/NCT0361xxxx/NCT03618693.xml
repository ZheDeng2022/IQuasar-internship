  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind this RCT is to assess within 24 hours after surgery the quality of&#xD;
      recovery of prostatectomy patients treated with 3 different analgesia concepts&#xD;
      (intraoperative spinal analgesia, transversus abdominis plane block, intravenous lidocaine&#xD;
      administration) using the quality of recovery (QoR) 15 questionnaire.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostatectomy (open or robotic assisted) is a major urological surgery, which is associated&#xD;
      with relevant acute postoperative pain. Perioperative analgesic techniques aiming at&#xD;
      optimizing postoperative analgesia have to be investigated. Optimal postoperative pain&#xD;
      management is one of the key factors leading to enhanced recovery after surgery. Optimal&#xD;
      analgesia should aim for optimized patient comfort, fast functional recovery with the fewest&#xD;
      side effects thus encouraging the DREAMS concept (DRinking, EAting, Mobilizing and Sleeping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perioperative additional use of a spinal single shot analgesia, or a transversus&#xD;
      abdominis plane block to general anaesthesia are validated options to enhance pain therapy&#xD;
      compared to systemic analgesia alone. However, if the impact on pain scores has been&#xD;
      described previously, the impact on the quality of recovery (QoR) is still unclear. Using the&#xD;
      assessment of QoR allows for a much more objective and broader assessment of the quality of&#xD;
      the postoperative treatment. Indeed, patient's perioperative experience cannot be only&#xD;
      focused on pain scores but should involve items like physical independence, patient support,&#xD;
      comfort, emotion. All these items are included in already validated QoR questionnaires like&#xD;
      the QoR 15 or QoR 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale behind this randomized, parallel group, single centre, interventional, active&#xD;
      controlled trial is to assess with the QoR 15questionnaire within 24 hours after surgery the&#xD;
      quality of recovery of prostatectomy patients treated with 3 different analgesia concepts.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in Quality of Recovery using the validated 15 items quality of recovery (QoR-15) score : QoR is a patient reported outcome short questionnaire that measure the quality of recovery after surgery and anaesthesia. It incorporates 5 dimensions of health (patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, pain). This is a shortened validated version of the QoR 40 including 15 items. QoR-15, with a score range from 0 to 150, is easy to perform. Recently a meta-analysis showed that QoR 15 fulfils requirements for outcome measurement instruments.</description>
