    <textblock>
      Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most malignant tumor in the world. In&#xD;
      2015, 466,000 people had been diagnosed as HCC in China, accounting more than half of the&#xD;
      total incidence in the world; and 422,000 people died, making the HCC as the second reason&#xD;
      for cancer related deaths in this country. Although many advances have been made in recent&#xD;
      years in treatments such as Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (TACE), the prognosis of patients with HCC is still poor. As a result, the prevention and&#xD;
      treatments of HCC in China are still urgently needed to improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being one of the three major treatments of cancer, radiotherapy has been used for HCC in very&#xD;
      early times. In the pioneering days, however; whole-liver radiation was impossible to give&#xD;
      lethal dose for cancer tissue due to the high risk of radiation induced liver disease (RILD)&#xD;
      and even liver failure, which might lead to death of patients. Consequently, radiotherapy has&#xD;
      long failed to play a major role in the treatment of liver cancer. But things are likely to&#xD;
      be changed. In recent years, many research teams have applied precise external radiotherapy,&#xD;
      such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT), to the treatment of liver cancer, and has achieved good results. Despite of this,&#xD;
      many guidelines still do not recommend radiotherapy as a first-line treatment for early and&#xD;
      mid-term liver cancer due to the lack of high level of evidence from good clinical trials&#xD;
      proving the effectiveness of SBRT/IMRT and other new radiotherapy techniques in the treatment&#xD;
      of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigator's previous clinical work, the investigators found that precise external&#xD;
      radiotherapy such as SBRT and IMRT is effective in treating primary liver cancer. For&#xD;
      example, patients with early stage HCC could achieve complete response (CR) after SBRT, and&#xD;
      patients with local advanced HCC could be observed a significant reduction in the size of&#xD;
      lesions and obvious improvement in the symptoms. Considering the poor prognosis of HCC and&#xD;
      the shortcomings of surgery, RFA and TACE, the investigators then decided to carry out this&#xD;
      multi-centered clinical trial of radiotherapy in HCC with the purpose of obtaining true and&#xD;
      reliable clinical data and evidence, and focused on the following two questions: (1) whether&#xD;
      radiotherapy, combined or not combined with TACE, could be a radical and first-line treatment&#xD;
      for inoperable patients with early stage HCC; (2) what is the optimal sequence and timing of&#xD;
      the combination of radiotherapy and TACE for patients with lesions adjacent to organs at risk&#xD;
      and radical doses cannot be given. It is foreseeable that this clinical trial will change&#xD;
      clinicians' understanding of the value of radiotherapy in the treatment of liver cancer,&#xD;
      improve its status and even lead to revision of related guidelines/norms, and exert a&#xD;
      far-reaching impact on the prognosis of patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects who were pathologically or clinically diagnosed as primary liver cancer were&#xD;
      grouped according to physical status, size/location/number of tumor, vascular invasion,&#xD;
      extrahepatic metastasis, the relationship with organ at risk (OAR), and liver function. Then&#xD;
      the subjects received IMRT, SBRT, TACE or surgery, and were followed up until the completion&#xD;
      of treatment, the emergence of intolerance of toxicity, or the withdrawal of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Group A (surgery): surgical treatment (radical resection); 2. Group B (radiotherapy group&#xD;
      1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group B1 (SBRT): stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), 40-55Gy (Gray)/5-6F(Fractions), once&#xD;
           daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B2a (IMRT+TACE): the subject firstly received IMRT, 50Gy/25F/5W (Weeks), once&#xD;
           daily, and then TACE for 2-4 times at 4 weeks after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group B2b (TACE+IMRT): the subject firstly received TACE for 2-4 times, and then IMRT,&#xD;
           50Gy/25F/5W, once daily at 4 weeks after TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Group C (radiotherapy group 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group C1 (SBRT): stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), 40-55Gy/5-6F, once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group C2a (IMRT+TACE): the subject firstly received IMRT, 50Gy/25F/5W, once daily, and&#xD;
           then TACE for 2-4 times at 4 weeks after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group C2b(TACE+IMRT): the subject firstly received TACE for 2-4 times, and then IMRT,&#xD;
           50Gy/25F/5W, once daily at 4 weeks after TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each scheduled visit in the treatment period, physical examination/weight, vital&#xD;
      signs, hematology, coagulation, biochemistry, urine analysis, stool routine (occult blood)&#xD;
      and other adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. subjects withdrew the informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. treatment failure requiring additional emergency treatment (i.e. tumor progression or&#xD;
           severe side effects caused by tumor emergencies);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AEs, if researchers and / or subjects hope or think it necessary to terminate treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subject did not cooperate with the experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. solid evidence of progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evidence of ineffective treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Security discovery preventing the continuation of the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The applicant think that continuation of the trial is not in line with scientific or&#xD;
           ethical principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The difficulty in the enrollment of subjects that makes it impossible for the&#xD;
           completeness of the trial within an acceptable period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The health authorities and the independent ethics committee (IECs) /institutional review&#xD;
           board (IRBs) terminate the trial according to applicable regulations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The health authorities require the suspension or termination of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. permissible treatment during the period of treatment; 1) Best supportive treatment; 2)&#xD;
           Unconventional therapies including herbs or acupuncture and vitamins/ minerals; 3)&#xD;
           Bisphosphonates can be used to treat bone metastases during treatment; 4) Active&#xD;
           treatment for the combined diseases and all kinds of AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the prohibition of treatment during the treatment period 1) other local treatments for&#xD;
           liver tumors including but not limited to any local ablation therapy or radioactive seed&#xD;
           implantation; 2) systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
