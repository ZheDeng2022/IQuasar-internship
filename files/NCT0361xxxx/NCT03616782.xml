      1. Induction chemotherapy 1)&#xD;
           RCHOP(Rituximab+Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Vincristine+Prednisone) 2) VR-CAP&#xD;
           (Bortezomib+Rituximab+Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Prednisone)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who have received induction chemotherapy will be evaluated for responses and&#xD;
           those who achieved more than PR(Partial response) or PR will be eligible for this study&#xD;
           after receiving informed consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experimental step Maintenance ixazomib beginning at least 8 weeks after completion of&#xD;
           induction chemotherapy, patients receive ixazomib per oral 3 mg on day 1, 8, and 15 for&#xD;
           4 weeks. And the dose of ixazomib can be escalated to 4mg by response such as partial&#xD;
           response or MRD positive. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 24 months in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are screened and sign the informed consent after completion induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      (RCHOP or VR-CAP) with more than PR or PR confirmed. It is likely to take approximately 8&#xD;
      weeks in performing above procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients start maintenance therapy at least 8 weeks and also can be allowed for the extension&#xD;
      of 4 weeks because of delayed response evaluation, recovery toxicities of chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      official process including agree with informed consent. Recently, ongoing studies about&#xD;
      maintenance therapy in lymphoma have window periods of 8-12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ixazomib maintenance should continue for 2 years.&#xD;
