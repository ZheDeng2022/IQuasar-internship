    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, and/or laboratory or physiological observation that may or may not be related to the investigational medicinal product. A TEAE was defined as any AE with an onset date on or after the first dose date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of selgantolimod/placebo; or any AE leading to premature discontinuation of study drugs.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose date up to Week 24 plus 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increased at least 1 toxicity grade from baseline at any postbaseline time point, up to and including the date of the last dose of study drug plus 30 days for selgantolimod/placebo at Week 24. If the relevant baseline laboratory value was missing, any abnormality of at least Grade 1 observed within the time frame specified above was considered treatment emergent. Clinical laboratory results were graded according to Gilead Grading Scale for Severity of Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities.</description>

          <description>Participants with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or HBeAg-negative CHB currently not on oral antiviral (OAV) treatment, received selgantolimod 3 mg (2 x 1.5 mg tablet) orally on the same day once a week (every 7 days) for 24 doses along with the tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 25 mg orally once daily for 24 weeks. After the 24th dose, selgantolimod was discontinued, and participants continued to receive TAF until Week 48/early discontinuation (ED). At Week 48, per Principal Investigator's (PI's) discretion, participants can continue in the Treatment Free Follow-Up (TFFU) phase for up to an additional 48 weeks.</description>
