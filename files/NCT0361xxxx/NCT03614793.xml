      Chronic, non-neurogenic low back pain (CLBP) is a common condition that affects many&#xD;
      individuals across their lives. The lumbar facet joint has been implicated as an important&#xD;
      source of CLBP, with a prevalence of 15-45%. Elements of clinical history, physical&#xD;

      reference standard for the diagnosis of lumbar Z-joint pain is a positive response to dual&#xD;
      comparative MBN blocks, which requires pain reduction of great than or equal to 80% of&#xD;
      concordant duration to that expected of two different local anesthetics on independent&#xD;
      occasions. Further, dual comparative MBN blocks have a high positive predictive value for&#xD;
      determining the clinical outcome of lumbar MBN RFA for the treatment of lumbar Z-joint pain;&#xD;

      Chronic, non-neurogenic low back pain (CLBP) is a common condition that affects many&#xD;
      individuals across their lives. The lumbar facet joint has been implicated as an important&#xD;
      source of CLBP, with a prevalence of 15-45%. Elements of clinical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and imaging (radiographs, standard CT scan, standard MRI sequences) provide poor&#xD;
      diagnostic specificity for pain of lumbar zygapophysial joint (Z-joint) origin. Thus,&#xD;
      clinicians have traditionally relied upon MBN blocks to confirm or refute this diagnosis. The&#xD;
      reference standard for the diagnosis of lumbar Z-joint pain is a positive response to dual&#xD;
      comparative MBN blocks, which requires pain reduction of great than or equal to 80% of&#xD;
      concordant duration to that expected of two different local anesthetics on independent&#xD;
      occasions. Further, dual comparative MBN blocks have a high positive predictive value for&#xD;
      determining the clinical outcome of lumbar MBN RFA for the treatment of lumbar Z-joint pain;&#xD;
      when patients are appropriately selected using this reference standard and rigorous MBN RFA&#xD;
      technique is implemented according to practice guidelines, studies demonstrate excellent&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In additional to MBN RFA, lumbar facet joint injection of corticosteroid is another commonly&#xD;
      used treatment strategy for lumbar facet joint pain related to osteoarthritis. While clinical&#xD;
      outcome studies of facet joint injection with corticosteroid have generally shown only modest&#xD;
      outcome improvements, this literature is generally flawed by invalid selection protocols that&#xD;
      do not require dual comparative MBN blocks in order to confirm the diagnosis of pain specific&#xD;
      to the lumbar facet joint(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the widespread use of these two techniques (lumbar MBN RFA vs. facet joint&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection), the two techniques have never been compared in an&#xD;
      appropriately-designed head-to-head study. The sole outcome study comparing these two&#xD;
      treatment methods used an invalid selection protocol of one positive MBN block, requiring&#xD;
      only 50% relief in pain and not of concordant duration with that expected by the local&#xD;
      anesthetic used; in addition, a single RFA lesion was applied with a 20g conventional RFA&#xD;
      electrode and fluoroscopic images were not published, so it is unclear if parallel electrode&#xD;
      technique was used, as is necessary with conventional RFA. This invalid patient selection and&#xD;
      RFA technique protocol is similar to that used in the Mint Trials, which has led to a broad&#xD;
      call for improving such standards in research and clinical care by a multitude of experts&#xD;
      representing interventional pain, spine, and radiology specialty societies. As such, an&#xD;
      appropriately designed head-to-head trial in warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, while the conventional RFA modality has been studied extensively for MBN RFA,&#xD;
      minimal outcome literature on the effectiveness of C-RFA technology has been published. C-RFA&#xD;
      is similar in mechanism to conventional RFA: a thermal lesion is created by applying&#xD;
      radiofrequency energy through an electrode placed at a target structure. In C-RFA, a constant&#xD;
      flow of ambient water is circulated through the electrode via a peristaltic pump, maintaining&#xD;
      a lowered tissue temperature by creating a heat sink. By removing heat from tissues&#xD;
      immediately adjacent to the electrode tip, a lower lesioning temperature is maintained,&#xD;
      resulting in less tissue charring adjacent to the electrode, less tissue impedance and more&#xD;
      efficient heating of target tissue. The volume of tissue heated, and the resultant thermal&#xD;
      lesion size is substantially larger with C-RFA, conferring an advantage over conventional&#xD;
      RFA. Further, given the spherical geometry and forward projection the C-RFA lesions beyond&#xD;
      the distal end of the electrode, the RFA probe can be positioned at a range of possible&#xD;
      angles and still capture the target neural structure, whereas more fastidious, parallel&#xD;
      positioning is required with conventional RFA. These technical advantages increase the&#xD;
      probability of successful denervation of neural pain generators that have variability in&#xD;
      anatomic location, as is the case with facet syndromes in which significant osteoarthritis is&#xD;
      present, which is associated with joint hypertrophy and osteophyte formation. Additionally, a&#xD;
      longer lesion of the MBN may be more reliably achieved with C-RFA compared to conventional&#xD;
      RFA, potentially resulted in greater treatment durability, as the recurrent of facetogenic&#xD;
      pain after successful denervation is related to reinnervation by nerve re-growth to bridge&#xD;
      the gap created by the lesion. Consistent with this technical advantage, there is preliminary&#xD;
      evidence for superiority of C-RFA compared to both conventional RFA and other novel RFA&#xD;
      techniques in the treatment of sacroiliac joint-mediated pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar facet joint pain is a common and costly cause of chronic low back pain. Lumbar MBN RFA&#xD;
      and facet joint injection of steroid are two commonly used treatment strategies for lumbar&#xD;
      facet-mediated pain, yet the two techniques have never been compared in an&#xD;
      appropriately-designed head-to-head trial. Further there is minimal clinical outcome&#xD;
      literature describing the effectiveness of MBN C-RFA despite its technical advantages over&#xD;
      conventional MBN RFA. We will determine if individuals with lumbar facet syndrome who are&#xD;
      treated with MBN C-RFA compared to face joint injection of corticosteroid have a greater&#xD;
      likelihood of experiencing meaningful relief of low back pain symptoms, functional&#xD;
      improvement, and reduction of analgesic medication use at both short and long-term follow-up.&#xD;
      Answering this clinical question will help determine which standard of care technique is&#xD;
      superior, such that patients with lumbar facet syndrome can get be offered the best treatment&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the goal of the proposed study is to determine if individuals with lumbar facet&#xD;
      syndrome who are treated with C-RFA of the MBNs compared to face joint injection of&#xD;
      corticosteroid have a greater likelihood of experiencing meaningful relief of low back pain&#xD;
      symptoms, functional improvement, and reduction of analgesic medication use at both short and&#xD;
      long-term follow-up.&#xD;
