  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder among older people. Since the&#xD;
      prevalence of knee OA increases with age, it is anticipated that the prevalence and burden of&#xD;
      knee OA will increase significantly given the aging population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is used to treat patients with severe knee OA. While TKA has&#xD;
      been shown to improve knee pain, function and quality of life of patients with knee OA, up to&#xD;
      50% of patients with post-TKA may suffer from falls within in the first year after TKA. Given&#xD;
      that Tai Chi can significantly improve the balance and function of older people, a fall&#xD;
      prevention program may improve balance, pain, and function of post-TKA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the current 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a post-operative community-based fall prevention program in improving knee&#xD;
      pain, function and balance of patients with unilateral TKA against a group of TKA patients&#xD;
      receiving standard post-operative care, and age- and gender-matched asymptomatic controls&#xD;
      over 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the third most disabling musculoskeletal compliant in the world. Knee&#xD;
      OA is the most common type of OA. Since the prevalence of knee OA increases with age, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that the prevalence and burden of knee OA will increase significantly given the&#xD;
      aging population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical intervention for treating patients with severe&#xD;
      knee OA. Research has found that TKA reduces knee pain, and improves patient's function and&#xD;
      quality of life. However, studies have also found that patients with post-TKA may be more&#xD;
      likely to fall as compared to age- and gender-matched asymptomatic counterparts. It is&#xD;
      estimated that around 20% to 50% of patients fall within in the first year after TKA. As&#xD;
      such, it is essential to improve the balance of post-TKA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have found that Tai Chi can significantly improve the balance and function of older&#xD;
      people. Therefore, a fall prevention program aiming at strengthening, proprioception, balance&#xD;
      training, and behavioral modification may improve balance, pain, and function of post-TKA&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the current 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a post-operative community-based fall prevention program in improving knee&#xD;
      pain, function and balance of patients with unilateral TKA with a group of patients receiving&#xD;
      standard post-operative care, and age- and gender-matched asymptomatic controls over 1 year.&#xD;
