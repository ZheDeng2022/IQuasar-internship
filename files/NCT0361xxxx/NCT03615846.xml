      This is a multi-center convenience sample prospective study comparing the results of the&#xD;
      Verify Now® Aspirin Test and PRUTest® Platelet Reactivity Tests with the Japan&#xD;
      investigational reagents to reagents registered in Japan in the expected population receiving&#xD;
      aspirin (ASA) and the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel.&#xD;

      -  The Primary Objectives of this study are to compare the results of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VerifyNow Aspirin Test with AA, an investigational reagent as defined in Japan,&#xD;
           against LTA with AA investigational reagent as defined in Japan (study reference&#xD;
           reagent), in subjects receiving DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel or subjects taking no platelet&#xD;
           inhibitors including ASA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VerifyNow Aspirin Test with AA, an investigational reagent as defined in Japan,&#xD;
           against LTA with collagen (study reference reagent),&#xD;
&#xD;
           o In subjects receiving DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel) or in subjects taking no platelet&#xD;
           inhibitors including ASA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VerifyNow PRUTest with ADP, an investigational reagent as defined in Japan, and&#xD;
           PGE1, against LTA with ADP, an approved reagent in Japan (study reference reagent) and&#xD;
           PGE1, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VerifyNow PRUTest with ADP (an investigational reagent as defined in Japan) and PGE1&#xD;
           against LTA with ADP reagent approved in Japan (study reference reagent) with no PGE1, o&#xD;
           in up to 75 subjects receiving DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel) and in up to 55 subjects&#xD;
           taking no platelet inhibitors (total up to 130 subjects).&#xD;
