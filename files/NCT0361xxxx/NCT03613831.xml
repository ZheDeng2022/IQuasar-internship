      This study is an observational study without any hypothesis testing. It intended to observe&#xD;
      the clinical application of electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation of atrial&#xD;
      tachycardia post atrial fibrillation ablation or cardiac surgery guided with Rhythmia System.&#xD;

        An arbitrary sample size of 100 should be enough for this registry study which may cover&#xD;
        the focal, macro-reentry, micro-reentry and other types of atrial tachycardia. Assuming&#xD;
        that the one-year recurrence rate post complex atrial tachycardia ablation is 30%, the 95%&#xD;
        confidence interval of 100 samples shall be 21.2-40.0% (binomial distribution exact&#xD;
        method).&#xD;
&#xD;
        As per the current actual situation in China, it is predicted that 70-80 cases may be&#xD;
        included for the atrial tachycardia post atrial fibrillation ablation, while 20-30 cases&#xD;
        may be included for post cardiac surgery.&#xD;
