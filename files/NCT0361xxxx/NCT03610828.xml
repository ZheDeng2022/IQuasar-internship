  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vegetarian and vegan diets have been shown to reduce cardiometabolic risk factors for chronic&#xD;
      diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and have been associated with&#xD;
      decreased risk of these chronic diseases. The role of vegetarian and/or vegan dietary&#xD;
      patterns and incident cardiovascular outcomes still remains unclear. To address these&#xD;
      uncertainties, the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of&#xD;
      the totality of evidence from prospective cohort studies to distinguish the association of&#xD;
      vegetarian and/or vegan dietary patterns on the prevention and management of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. This proposed knowledge synthesis was commissioned by the Diabetes and Nutrition&#xD;
      Study Group (DNSG) of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and will be&#xD;
      used to inform clinical practice and dietary guidelines, help improve health outcomes, and&#xD;
      guide future research design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number 1 cause of death worldwide,&#xD;
      representing 31% of all deaths. Vegetarian and/or vegan dietary patterns have been shown in&#xD;
      prospective cohort and cross-sectional studies to be associated with lower coronary heart&#xD;
      disease and ischemic heart disease risk. Evidence from randomized controlled trials also&#xD;
      suggest that vegetarian and vegan diets may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk&#xD;
      factors, such as LDL cholesterol, weight, blood pressure and type 2 diabetes (glycemic&#xD;
      control). Moreover, evidence from meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies have shown that&#xD;
      diets high in red and processed meat consumption are associated with an increased incidence&#xD;
      of stroke and cardiovascular mortality. The evidence for a vegetarian dietary pattern is&#xD;
      promising for prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases, however, not all CVD&#xD;
      guidelines recommend following a vegetarian and/or vegan dietary pattern for the prevention&#xD;
      and management of these diseases, or the guidelines grade the evidence as low quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective&#xD;
      cohort studies represent evidence to support dietary guidelines and public health policy&#xD;
      development. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted toward food and&#xD;
      dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses comparing the role of vegetarian/vegan diets in the prevention and management&#xD;
      of cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators will conduct a systematic reviews and meta-analysis to assess&#xD;
      vegan/vegetarian diets with cardiovascular disease outcomes (cardiovascular disease (CVD),&#xD;
      coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke incidence and mortality) in prospective cohort&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Meta-analysis&#xD;
      Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      databases will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by hand searches of&#xD;
      references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies. Risk&#xD;
      ratios, odds ratios and hazard ratios for clinical outcomes will be extracted or derived from&#xD;
      clinical event data across exposure to either vegetarian or non-vegetarian diets. All&#xD;
      disagreements will be resolved by consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Six outcomes will be assessed: CVD incidence and mortality, coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD) incidence and mortality, stroke incidence and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: The natural log-transformed relative risks or hazard ratios of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes comparing the exposure to the reference group from each cohort will be pooled using&#xD;
      the generic inverse variance method with random effects models. Heterogeneity will be&#xD;
      assessed by Cochrane's Q and quantified by I2. Sensitivity analyses and a priori subgroup&#xD;
      analyses will be undertaken to explore sources of heterogeneity including the effect of the&#xD;
      cohorts, sex, type of vegetarian diet, underlying disease status, follow-up (&lt;10-years,&#xD;
      &gt;=10-years), level of adjustment of models, quality of the studies (NOS), and validation of&#xD;
      the dietary assessment instruments. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be&#xD;
      investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses. Meta-regression analyses will assess&#xD;
      the significance of subgroups analyses. Publication bias will be assessed by the inspection&#xD;
      of funnel plots and using Begg's and Egger's tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The certainty of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Feedback will&#xD;
      be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for future&#xD;
      research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among opinion&#xD;
      leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      vegetarian/vegan diets in the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating&#xD;
      healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future&#xD;
      research design.&#xD;
