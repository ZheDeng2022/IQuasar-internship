  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active controlled Phase III&#xD;
      clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LXI-15028 50 mg comparing with&#xD;
      esomeprazole 40 mg after the treatment of erosive esophagitis in Chinese patients for up to 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening-eligible subjects will be randomized into LXI-15028 50mg treatment group or&#xD;
      esomeprazole 40mg treatment group at Visit 2 (Day 0) stratified by LA grade (A or B/C/D) at&#xD;
      baseline according to the ratio of 1:1 and receive study treatment continuously for 4 or 8&#xD;
      weeks. They will start to take the investigational products from the following morning (Day&#xD;
      1) of Visit 2, and start to complete the subject's diary from the day of study treatment&#xD;
      initiation. After 4 weeks of study treatment (treatment period 1), subjects will return to&#xD;
      the study site and complete Visit 3. For the subjects who achieve endoscopic healing at Visit&#xD;
      3, the study treatment will be terminated. The subjects who fail to achieve endoscopic&#xD;
      healing at Visit 3 will receive newly dispensed investigational product after completing the&#xD;
      fasting examinations at Visit 3, and continue another 4 weeks of study treatment (treatment&#xD;
      period 2) and complete Visit 4. All the subjects will be followed up by phone (Visit 5) at&#xD;
      Day 28±3 after the last dose of investigational products.&#xD;
