      The major objective of this study is to evaluate a new conceptualized personalized concept of&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASPersonalized) in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with persistent depressive disorder (PDD), childhood maltreatment and a high rate of&#xD;
      comorbidity. Patients receive a two-phase-treatment-program (six-weeks inpatient-treatment&#xD;
      and six-to-twelve-weeks blended-online-aftercare) in combination with standardized&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy in a routine clinical inpatient setting. This study addresses the primary&#xD;
      research question: Is an intensive six-week inpatient CBASPersonalized treatment feasible and&#xD;
      effective in a clinical sample of PDD patients? In addition, moderator, process and long-term&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted for differential insights.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is a prevalent disabling disorder. Given its&#xD;
      high degree of treatment-resistance (TR), comorbidity, and suicidality, this patient group&#xD;
      constitutes a massive health problem. The Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (CBASP) was specifically developed for the outpatient treatment of PDD showing&#xD;
      superiority to active control groups in some studies. However, non-remission and relapse&#xD;
      rates of CBASP are relatively high, which might be caused by the fact that within the&#xD;
      original CBASP-concept the frequent comorbid disorders are not sufficiently addressed. Thus,&#xD;
      an optimized personalized short and intensive CBASP-concept (CBASPersonalized) was&#xD;
      established including the interpersonal CBASP-strategies while adding evidence-based&#xD;
      intrapersonal strategies being tailored to the specific comorbid problems. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of CBASPersonalized. Patients&#xD;
      will receive a six-week inpatient treatment followed by a six-to-twelve-week&#xD;
      blended-online-aftercare (CBASPersonalized@home) in combination with standardized&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy in a routine clinical inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In the proposed prospective, mono-site study, 100 PDD patients with childhood&#xD;
      maltreatment will be included. The study addresses the primary research question: Is an&#xD;
      intensive six-week inpatient CBASPersonalized treatment feasible and effective in a clinical&#xD;
      sample of PDD patients? It is hypothesized that six weeks after admission, CBASPersonalized&#xD;
      will evoke significant reduction in depressive symptomatology (according to the 24-item&#xD;
      version of the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression, HRSD). The feasibility (acceptance and&#xD;
      subjective experience) is assessed on the basis of the dropout rate and a self-assessed&#xD;
      questionnaire, which measures satisfaction with and subjective effectiveness of the specific&#xD;
      treatment components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, moderator, process and long-term analyses will be conducted for differential&#xD;
      insights. Primary and secondary outcome will be analyzed using analysis of covariance&#xD;
      (ANCOVA) controlling for pre-treatment scores. Moderator and process analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using multiple regression and linear mixed models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a specific secondary research question, we will examine the associations between childhood&#xD;
      maltreatment (CM), depression severity, and potential psychological mechanisms of this&#xD;
      associations (emotion regulation, self-compassion, empathic distress, interpersonal problems)&#xD;
      at the beginning of treatment. In addition, we will explore which changes in the potential&#xD;
      psychological mechanisms are particularly closely related to changes in depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As another additional research question, we will examine the associations between the&#xD;
      state-like therapeutic alliance, trait-like alliance, and depression severity. We want to&#xD;
      explore these associations as a possible effect mechanism and specify a possible transfer to&#xD;
      CBASP specific mechanisms of actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the analyses of the outcomes at the end of the six-to-twelve week blended&#xD;
      online-aftercare and the follow-up survey 6 months after end of treatment will provide&#xD;
      important results on the blended after-care program as well as longterm treatment outcome. Of&#xD;
      note, we will evaluate the online continuation treatment CBASPersonalized@home regarding&#xD;
      feasibility. Therefore, patients' expectations towards the intervention, their adherence&#xD;
      (completed modules and exercises), acceptance and satisfaction with the intervention as well&#xD;
      as the perceived fit and perceived effectiveness and usability of the intervention will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Depression severity at the beginning of CBASPersonalized@home, expectations,&#xD;
      satisfaction and therapeutic alliance will be analyzed as possible predictors of adherence. A&#xD;
      possible relationship between changes in depressive symptoms in the course of the&#xD;
      continuation treatment and adherence will be explored.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the proposed prospective, mono-site, evaluator-blinded study, 100 PDD patients will be included. The study addresses the primary research question: Is the six-week inpatient CBASPersonalized-treatment effective in PDD? It is hypothesized that six weeks after randomization, CBASPersonalized will evoke significant reduction in depressive symptomatology. In addition, feasibility will be examined and differential indication by moderator, process and long-term analyses will be investigated. A follow-up survey six months after end of treatment will provide important results on long-term treatment outcome.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The change in HDRS-24 item score (Hamilton, 1960; Williams, 1988) from baseline to 6 weeks after study start will be the primary endpoint. The HRSD-24 is a semi-structured interview which is used to measure the severity of all symptom domains of depression as described by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) over a period of the last 7 days. It shows good psychometric properties. The HRSD-24 will be conducted by blind study raters at every time point. Raters evaluate symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 2 or 0 - 3 or 0 - 4 for each item, with higher number indicating higher symptom severity. The total score ranges from 0 to 75 with higher values indicating higher depression severity.</description>

    <description>Within the psychotherapy CBASPersonalized, the original specific six interpersonal CBASP strategies are augmented with intrapersonal evidence-based strategies. According to the frequently diagnosed comorbid disorders of PDD the following modules have been added: a) treatment of anxiety disorders and treatment of traumatic experiences, b) regulating intensive emotions, c) coping with resistant problems like pain, and d) relapse prevention. In addition, therapists adjust their strategies and therapeutic relationship according to the impairment in personality functioning and maladaptive personality traits of the patient.</description>
