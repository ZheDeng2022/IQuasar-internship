  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is comparing the accuracy and speed of the Vivascope 2500 ex-vivo fluorescent&#xD;
      confocal microscope with frozen section Mohs histology in evaluating clear margins in basal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma in Mohs surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with basal cell carcinomas in the head and neck area, being considered for Mohs&#xD;
      surgery with frozen sections will be invited to participate in this trial by the&#xD;
      investigators when they attend for their pre-surgical consultation. They will be given&#xD;
      sufficient time to review the information sheet and ask questions. When they attend for their&#xD;
      Mohs surgery, they will be recruited if they wish to participate in this trial, at which&#xD;
      point, the investigator, or an authorized member of their team, will obtain written informed&#xD;
      consent for patients. The patient will then undergo Mohs surgery. The processing and&#xD;
      interpretation with frozen sections will be conducted in the same way, the only difference&#xD;
      being immediately after the BCC is excised with a Mohs bevelled edge (45o incision), the&#xD;
      tissue is immersed in acridine orange (nuclear DNA stain) and placed upside down with the&#xD;
      deep margin of the tissue face up. With a glass slide placed on top, we would place the FCM&#xD;
      (Vivascope 2500) over this, scan the tissue and obtain mosaic images of the tissue which&#xD;
      would be stitched together. The penetration of the FCM scan is approximately 0.25mm. This is&#xD;
      approximately the distance between 2-3 Mohs wafers. The investigators would usually consider&#xD;
      a margin of 3 Mohs wafers (300 microns) clear. When the scanning is completed (5 minutes),&#xD;
      the Mohs layer would be sent for frozen section (stained with haematoxylin and eosin) for&#xD;
      confirmation in the usual way. The Mohs surgeon can interpret the FCM mosaic images later.&#xD;
      Acridine orange does not interfere with frozen sections or paraffin histopathological&#xD;
      quality. No medicines will be used in this study. The information is collected on only 1&#xD;
      patient visit. There is no follow up period. The main objectives would (1) compare the&#xD;
      accuracy in detection of BCC margins with FCM compared with FSM and (2) evaluate the time&#xD;
      taken for processing and interpretation of FCM (acridine orange inking and rinsing, image&#xD;
      acquisition and mosaic stitching, and image interpretation) compared with the time taken for&#xD;
      processing and interpretation of FSM (sample flattening, freezing and cutting with the&#xD;
      cryostat, H&amp;E staining, slide cover slipping and slide interpretation).&#xD;
