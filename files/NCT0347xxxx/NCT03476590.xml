  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is characterized by high mortality, poor quality of life and frequent&#xD;
      hospitalizations. The effectiveness of out-patient care for HF patients is unsatisfactory.&#xD;
      Therefore the solutions that enable effective monitoring and assessment of HF patients'&#xD;
      clinical status become priority in treatment strategy. The applicant proposes to develop a&#xD;
      model of care for HF patients based on modern non-invasive diagnostic tools and telemedicine.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will be based on i.e. impedance cardiography, a simple non-invasive&#xD;
      method of hemodynamic monitoring, including assessment of heart rate, blood pressure, left&#xD;
      ventricular stroke volume, chest and total fluid status. The telemedicine system will enable&#xD;
      rapid, appropriate to the patient's clinical status, therapeutic decision undertaken remotely&#xD;
      by specialist. Implementation of the proposed model of care will contribute to a significant&#xD;
      improvement in prognosis of HF patients (through i.e. improved access to specialist&#xD;
      consultation, the early diagnosis of the deterioration of HF and the optimization of&#xD;
      treatment). The significant economic, social and scientific benefits related to the project&#xD;
      are also expected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with heart failure (HF) is a great challenge for contemporary medicine.&#xD;
      HF frequency in European population is assessed for 0.4-2%. This disease is characterized by&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality rate, poor quality of life and frequent hospitalizations. Along&#xD;
      with the medicine progress, in particular in the scope of acute coronary syndromes treatment,&#xD;
      the number of HF patients is constantly growing. The essential problem connected with HF is&#xD;
      its progress course and an increasing rate of subsequent hospitalizations (approximately 30%&#xD;
      of hospitalizations are the repeated ones). It is estimated that the costs of hospital stays&#xD;
      constitute nearly 2/3 of healthcare costs provided for HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been estimated that the prevalence of HF will increase by 25% and its direct costs by&#xD;
      215% in the next 20 years. The prognosis in HF is closely connected with the progression of&#xD;
      the disease defined in accordance with the NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional&#xD;
      classification. The yearly mortality rate among each NYHA class is: class 1 - up to 10%,&#xD;
      class 2 - 10-20%, class 3 - 20-40%, class 4 - mortality 40-60%. Over a half of the patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic HF die within 4 years of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the AMULET study we we will merging the interventions that so far turned out to be&#xD;
      effective (specialist counselling, phone counselling programmes and telemonitoring).&#xD;
      Therefore, we created of ambulatory care points for HF patients, which would be equipped with&#xD;
      diagnostic devices (impedance cardiography and body composition analyser (bioimpedance&#xD;
      scale)), assessing the most important clinical parameters. Ambulatory care point will be&#xD;
      operated by a trained nurse, under a telemetry supervision of a specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters were identified as the indicators of treatment effects: heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), thoracic fluid content (TFC) and&#xD;
      its change (delta TFC), change of body mass and total body water (delta TBW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telemedicine solutions will strongly support the proposed system. The clinical data will&#xD;
      be automatically entered into an interactive system (database), which will send information&#xD;
      to a supervising cardiologist, in accordance with the previously implemented recommendation&#xD;
      support module (RSM). Regarding RSM indications remote specialist recommendation will be&#xD;
      generated (e.g. maintenance or modification of treatment, referral to hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed approach will satisfy ESC recommendations on long-term management: plan&#xD;
      follow-up strategy (including plan to up-titrate/optimize dose of disease-modifying drugs);&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms, quality of life and survival; prevention of readmissions; management&#xD;
      programme; education and appropriate lifestyle adjustments.&#xD;

    <description>In intervention group patients will be referred to ambulatory care point (ACP) and the physicians will perform remote teleconsultations. The visits will be realized by nurses supported with vital sign assessment based on bioimpedance diagnostic methods (impedance cardiography, bioimpedance scale). The ambulatory visits will be performed according to the schedule: (1') recruitment visit (1st day of enrolment) performed by physician -&gt; 7 ambulatory visits: (1) 1st day of enrolment (performed by nurse and physician), (2) 7th-10th day (performed by nurse and physician), (3) 1st month, (4) 3th month, (5) 6th month, (6) 9th month, (7) 12th month after the enrolment (visits no 3-7 performed by nurse with tele-supervision by physician) and -&gt; (7') summary visit (12th month after the enrolment) performed by physician.&#xD;
The plan of visits may be modified if required by the clinical status change, i.e. deterioration of clinical parameters and interim hospitalizations for worsening heart failure.</description>

    <intervention_name>new model of ambulatory care with use of of non-invasive vital signs assessment and telemedicine</intervention_name>
    <description>The report of symptoms and physical examination will be obligatory performed by the ACP nurse. Self-condition and quality of life assessment at every visit will be based on EQ-5D questionnaire and VAS 10-points scale Hemodynamic assessment - the ACP nurse will perform impedance cardiography (cardiomonitor) and bioimpedance (scale). The parameters measured by ICG and bioimpedance will be assessed with respect to individually defined target values for: heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), thoracic fluid content (TFC) and its change (delta TFC), change of body mass and total body water (delta TBW).&#xD;
Supervising physician will confront ICG/bioimpedance results with the patient's clinical data and give final remote recommendations.</description>
