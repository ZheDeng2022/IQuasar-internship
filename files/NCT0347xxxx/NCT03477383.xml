  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, observational multi-center cohort study. The study will consist&#xD;
      of patients undergoing heart transplantation. The main purpose is to test a new biomarker for&#xD;
      rejection against the gold-standard, the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). 80 patients will be&#xD;
      included, both children and adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is a comparison of an the established, invasive diagnostic test, the&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) against a new, non-invasive test. The new test is the measurement&#xD;
      of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) circulating in the blood stream of the recipient,&#xD;
      quantified by droplet digital PCR (polymerase-chain reaction) after targeted multiplex&#xD;
      preamplification. Sensitivity is calculated with EMB as the gold standard. The patients will&#xD;
      be followed during one year post-transplantation with simultaneous blood samples and EMB. The&#xD;
      patients will further be followed clinically for 5 years. A suitable cut-off for the ratio of&#xD;
      dd-cfDNA will be calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are description of patient outcomes with respect to organ function,&#xD;
      quality of life and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the calculation of the costs related to the transplantation process&#xD;
      as well as to the follow-up with EMB. A simulation will be done with respect to possible&#xD;
      savings achieved if the new biomarker could be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two cohorts: all adult recipients of heart transplantation at&#xD;
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital (one of two center conducting heart transplantation in&#xD;
      Sweden): regional study. The other cohort consists of all children undergoing heart&#xD;
      transplantation in Sweden:national study. Patients will undergo transplantation at&#xD;
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg as well as at Sk√•ne University Hospital in&#xD;
      Lund. Follow-up with blood samples and EMB of these patients will be in Gothenburg, Lund and&#xD;
      at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.&#xD;
