      This study tests the hypothesis that the combination of radial extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      therapy performed with the Swiss DolorClast device (Electro Medical Systems, Nyon,&#xD;
      Switzerland) and a specific rehabilitation program (hereafter, &quot;rESWT + RP&quot;) is effective and&#xD;
      safe in treatment of acute hamstring muscle complex injury Type 3b, and is statistically&#xD;
      significantly more effective than the combination of sham-rESWT and RP (hereafter,&#xD;
      &quot;sham-rESWT + RP&quot;).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute injuries of the hamstring muscle complex (HMC) are frequently observed in various&#xD;
      sports disciplines both in elite and recreational sport, and are the most common injury in&#xD;
      soccer. Despite intensive research into prevention and management of acute HMC injury during&#xD;
      the last decade epidemiological data show no decline in injury and re-injury rates. In this&#xD;
      regard a recent study prospectively observed 374 Danish elite soccer players during a&#xD;
      12-month period and registered 46 first-time and eight recurrent HMC injuries (incidence&#xD;
      rates: 12.3% [first-time injuries] and 2% [recurrent injuries]). Statistically significantly&#xD;
      more players experienced a first-time acute HMC injury during a match than during training.&#xD;
      Moreover, among 32 players who suffered from acute HMC injury in a period of 12 months before&#xD;
      the study, eight players incurred an injury that fulfilled the criteria for a recurrent&#xD;
      injury (incidence: 25%). Approximately two thirds of the first-time injuries were categorized&#xD;
      as moderate, with time to return to play between 8 to 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical and functional aspects of the HMC predispose it to injury, including the fact that&#xD;
      the muscles cross two joints and undergo eccentric contraction during the gait and running&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute HMC injury typically occurs through an eccentric mechanism at the terminal stages of&#xD;
      the swing phase of running. The long head of the biceps femoris (LHBF) muscle is most&#xD;
      commonly affected, and within the LHBF muscle, the proximal myotendinous junction and&#xD;
      proximal locations are most commonly affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of acute HMC injury is based on the presence of acute-onset pain in the&#xD;
      posterior thigh, and presence of the triad of pain on contraction, stretching and palpation.&#xD;
      Imaging has a role in confirming the site of injury and characterizing its extent, providing&#xD;
      some prognostic information and helping plan treatment. In this regard both magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (US) have been shown to be effective for&#xD;
      identification of hamstring strains and tendinopathy. Both MRI and US provide detailed&#xD;
      information about the HMC with respect to localization and characterization of injury.&#xD;
      Several clinical, MRI and US determinants were established that are associated with a longer&#xD;
      recovery time in nonoperative management of acute HMC injury. However, it is important to&#xD;
      realize that for an individual HMC injury none of these MRI and US determinants show a direct&#xD;
      correlation with the time to return to play. Accordingly, the prognosis of HMC injuries&#xD;
      should not be guided by imaging findings alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precise classification of acute HMC injury has important implications for treatment and&#xD;
      prognosis (i.e., time to return to play), as outlined in detail below. There are anatomical&#xD;
      differences between a Type 3a injury (minor partial muscle tear ≤ 5 mm;&#xD;
      intrafascicle/bundle-tear) and a Type 3b injury (moderate partial muscle tear &gt; 5 mm;&#xD;
      interfascicle/bundle-tear).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute HMC injuries Type 4 (i.e., subtotal or complete muscle tear or tendinous avulsion)&#xD;
      require early surgical repair. However, acute HMC injuries Type IV are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of choice of acute HMC injuries Type 3a and 3b is a progressive&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic exercise programme. Besides this, there is currently only insufficient&#xD;
      scientific evidence to support other treatment methods, including local infiltrations. In&#xD;
      particular, injections of platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) showed no effect when compared to&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of note that another study that was published very recently in the The New England&#xD;
      Journal of Medicine demonstrated the negative clinical consequences of protracted&#xD;
      immobilization after an acute muscle injury Type 3b in recreational sports. Starting&#xD;
      rehabilitation two days after injury rather than waiting for nine days shortened the interval&#xD;
      from injury to pain-free recovery and the time to return to play by approximately three weeks&#xD;
      without any significant increase in the risk of reinjury. The authors of this study concluded&#xD;
      that the observed difference supports the importance of early loading of injured&#xD;
      musculotendinous tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute muscle injuries Type 3a and 3b have different time frames for recovery and return to&#xD;
      play, with optimal treatment between 10 and 14 days in case of Type 3a and on average&#xD;
      approximately six weeks in case of Type 3b. However, particularly in case of acute HMC injury&#xD;
      Type 3b there is considerable interindividual variability in the time frame for return to&#xD;
      play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most importantly, particularly the high reinjury rate of acute HMC injury suggests that&#xD;
      commonly utilized rehabilitation programs may be inadequate at resolving possible muscular&#xD;
      weakness, reduced tissue extensibility, and/or altered movement patterns associated with the&#xD;
      injury. Accordingly, there is need for developing innovative treatment options particularly&#xD;
      for acute HMC injury Type 3b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very recently it was demonstrated that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may&#xD;
      accelerate regeneration after acute skeletal muscle injury. The use of extracorporeal shock&#xD;
      waves in medicine was first reported over 30 years ago as a treatment for kidney stones, and&#xD;
      is commonly referred to as 'extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy', or 'ESWL'. Extracorporeal&#xD;
      shock waves are also used as a treatment for musculoskeletal conditions such as plantar heel&#xD;
      pain and boney non-union, and is commonly referred to as 'extracorporeal shock wave therapy'&#xD;
      (ESWT) to differentiate from ESWL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three different types of extracorporeal shock waves that could be used in ESWT for&#xD;
      acute HMC injury Type 3b, focused, defocused and radial, and several modes of operation of&#xD;
      focused, defocused and radial extracorporeal shock wave generators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing efficacy and safety of rESWT for&#xD;
      acute HMC injury Type 3b have not yet been published. In contrast, rESWT has become an&#xD;
      established treatment modality for various musculoskeletal conditions such as calcifying&#xD;
      tendonitis of the shoulder, tennis elbow and plantar fasciopathy, to mention only a few.&#xD;
      Among the 44 RCTs on rESWT currently listed in the PEDro database (status of September 09,&#xD;
      2017), 29 (66%) were performed with the rESWT device Swiss DolorClast (Electro Medical&#xD;
      Systems, Nyon, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of the present study have extensive practical experience with rESWT for&#xD;
      various musculoskeletal conditions using the Swiss DolorClast. Most importantly, all of us&#xD;
      have already gained practical experience with rESWT for acute HMC injury Type 3b in athletes.&#xD;
      One of our most prominent patients was a professional soccer player at a European top club&#xD;
      (regularly playing in the UEFA Champions League) who incurred a HMC injury Type 3b and&#xD;
      returned to play (full 90-min match with his national team) 35 days later. In the&#xD;
      aforementioned studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine the cumulative&#xD;
      probability of resumptions of sports activity on day 35 after acute HMC injury Type 3b in&#xD;
      professional soccer players or recreational athletes was only respectively 20% or 5% after&#xD;
      treatment with a rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the limited evidence of efficacy and safety of rESWT for acute HMC injury Type&#xD;
      3b, further research is needed to support the use of rESWT for this condition. Taking into&#xD;
      account the proven efficacy and safety of rESWT using the Swiss DolorClast for treating&#xD;
      musculoskeletal conditions, the widespread use of the Swiss DolorClast based on its proven&#xD;
      efficacy and safety, and our own very promising pilot data of rESWT using the Swiss&#xD;
      DolorClast for treating acute HMC injury Type 3b in athletes it is reasonable to hypothesize&#xD;
      that (i) the combination of rESWT and a specific rehabilitation program is effective and safe&#xD;
      in treatment of acute HMC injury Type 3b, (ii) this combination therapy is statistically&#xD;
      significantly more effective than the same specific rehabilitation program alone, and (iii)&#xD;
      this combination therapy will gain widespread acceptance as soon as effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      will be demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial. This is the main purpose of the&#xD;
      proposed study.&#xD;
