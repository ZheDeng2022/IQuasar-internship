  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective Treatment for&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA ). However, adherence to CPAP is often limited. There are&#xD;
      established and emerging treatment alternatives to CPAP available, however, they are usually&#xD;
      less effective than CPAP. To develop novel treatment methods and to predict who will respond&#xD;
      to which treatment, the mechanism underlying obstructive sleep apnoea and different patient&#xD;
      types should be described. Especially the contribution of the upper airway function and&#xD;
      central respiratory control should be studied for this purpose. In a prospective&#xD;
      interventional study, patients with OSA effectively treated with CPAP will undergo&#xD;
      physiologic measurements during a two week period off CPAP to define the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms associated with OSA recurrence. This knowledge could facilitate individually&#xD;
      tailored treatment and improve therapy adherence and patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder&#xD;
      characterised by a repetitive collapse of the pharynx during sleep, which results in apnoea&#xD;
      or hypopnoea associated with oxygen desaturations and arousal from sleep. Continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment. Treatment success depends on regular&#xD;
      CPAP usage. However, low adherence to CPAP is a frequent problem. It has recently been shown&#xD;
      that OSA does not re-occur immediately in all OSA patients upon CPAP therapy withdrawal and&#xD;
      that there are different patterns of recurrence of OSA as indicated by repeated sleep&#xD;
      studies. So far, the mechanisms of OSA recurrence upon CPAP therapy withdrawal are&#xD;
      incompletely understood. Upper airway collapsibility and neuromuscular tone, pharyngeal&#xD;
      oedema and inflammation, neural respiratory drive, sleep stage and position may play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective interventional study, patients with OSA effectively treated with CPAP will&#xD;
      undergo physiologic measurements during a two week period off CPAP to define the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms associated with OSA recurrence. In particular, we will&#xD;
      investigate the effects of CPAP withdrawal on neural respiratory drive and upper airway&#xD;
      function. Inpatient sleep studies and assessments will be performed at baseline (day 0) on&#xD;
      CPAP and at follow-up upon CPAP withdrawal (day 14). At the end of the trial patients will&#xD;
      return to their established CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that CPAP withdrawal results in different patterns of OSA recurrence defined&#xD;
      by neural respiratory drive and upper airway function. The aim of the proposed project is to&#xD;
      study the mechanisms of OSA recurrence by using a validated CPAP withdrawal model. Knowledge&#xD;
      on recurrence patterns and different phenotypes of OSA could facilitate individually tailored&#xD;
      treatment of OSA and improved therapy adherence and patient outcomes.&#xD;
