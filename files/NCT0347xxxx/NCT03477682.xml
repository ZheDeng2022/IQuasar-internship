  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial designed to analyze the impact of bedrest duration on&#xD;
      return to functional independence at discharge following sartorius flap for coverage of&#xD;
      vascular reconstruction in the groin.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot prospective study with the purpose of evaluating the impact of bedrest&#xD;
      duration on outcomes of groin muscle flaps used for groin coverage in patients undergoing&#xD;
      open, infrainguinal vascular surgery. The investigators plan to target all patients&#xD;
      undergoing groin muscle flaps for vascular groin coverage at UCSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing groin flaps will be block randomized into two cohorts: Cohort 1 - one&#xD;
      day of bedrest (mobilize on post-op day 2) versus Cohort 2 - 5 days of bedrest (mobilize on&#xD;
      post-op day 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators perform approximately 50 infrainguinal muscle flaps per year. They aim to&#xD;
      enroll 30 patients (15 per cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures include: surgical complication rates (including wound and lymphatic&#xD;
      complications, readmissions, and reoperations), physical function, hospital length of stay,&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (VTE), and rates of discharge to a skilled nursing facility. The&#xD;
      investigators will also examine the impact of bedrest on patient reported outcomes one month&#xD;
      following surgery. Patient outcomes will be followed for 3 months post-operatively.&#xD;
