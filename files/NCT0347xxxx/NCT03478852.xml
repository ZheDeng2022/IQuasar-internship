      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy affects about 1 percent of the U.S. population. Most people with epilepsy respond&#xD;
      well to medicine, but some do not. Researchers want people who have diagnosed or suspected&#xD;
      epilepsy to participate in ongoing studies. They want to learn more about clinical care for&#xD;
      epilepsy. They want fellows and residents to learn more about the care of people with&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about seizures and find ways to best treat people with drug-resistant epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults and children ages 8 years and older with diagnosed or suspected epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have many visits. They may be admitted to the hospital for several weeks.&#xD;
      Their medication might be stopped or changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have many tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG: Wires attached to the head with paste record brain waves. This may be videotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thinking and memory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of a tube. They perform simple tasks&#xD;
      in the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEG: Participants lie on a table and place their head in a helmet to record brain waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET scan: Participants lie on a table that slides into a machine. A small amount of&#xD;
      radioactive dye is injected into their arm with an IV. For the IV, a small tube is inserted&#xD;
      into the arm with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay enrolled in this study if they join other epilepsy-related studies.&#xD;
      They may be contacted at intervals for follow-up. Their participation will end if they have&#xD;
      not been seen clinically for their epilepsy for 3 years.&#xD;

      Objectives: The primary objective is to maintain a cohort of patients referred to the NIH&#xD;
      with a known or suspected diagnosis of epilepsy for eligibility to participate in ongoing&#xD;
      protocols. The secondary objectives are to: follow the natural history of subjects with&#xD;
      epilepsy and epilepsy-related disorders, and to use data obtained through clinical care for&#xD;
      descriptive and/or correlative research. Study Population: Adults and children age 8 years&#xD;
      and older referred with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy Design: Participants In this&#xD;
      protocol will be evaluated by study investigators with standard diagnostic clinical studies&#xD;
      as clinically indicated to fully characterize their uncontrolled or suspected seizures and&#xD;
      related clinical features. There are no study procedures other than data collection for this&#xD;
      protocol after screening. Patients will be followed clinically, as needed, to follow the&#xD;
      natural history of epilepsy. Follow up will be performed to allow for evaluation of the&#xD;
      natural history of drug-resistant epilepsy and its co-morbidities. Outcome Measures: Patients&#xD;
      will be screened for eligibility for epilepsy-related research protocols and clinically&#xD;
      characterized, including clinical features, imaging, and electrophysiological and&#xD;
      neuropsychological characteristics. In addition, standard of care evaluation and treatment&#xD;
      will be carried out under this protocol.&#xD;
