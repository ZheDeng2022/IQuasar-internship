  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RV 507 was a Phase I, open-label study to examine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of an investigational Marburg vaccine given by intramuscular (IM) injection to healthy&#xD;
      adults. The study was a dose escalation of VRC-MARADC087-00-VP, a chimpanzee adenovirus&#xD;
      serotype 3 (cAd3) vector vaccine, which encodes wild type (WT) glycoprotein (GP) from&#xD;
      Marburgvirus.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 participants were evenly split, with 20 in each of the two dosage groups, to&#xD;
      receive the investigational cAd3-Marburg vaccine at a dose of either 1x10^10 particle units&#xD;
      (PU) (Group 1) or 1x10^11 PU (Group 2). The dose escalation plan included daily review of any&#xD;
      new safety data by a study clinician, regular review of safety data by the protocol team and&#xD;
      a staged enrollment plan with required interim safety reviews. The study began with&#xD;
      enrollment of 3 participants into Group 1 (1x10^10 PU) at a rate of 1 participant per day.&#xD;
      After at least 7 days of follow-up for the first 3 vaccinated participants, an interim safety&#xD;
      review occurred before enrollment of additional participants into the group. No safety issues&#xD;
      were identified; therefore, an additional 17 participants were enrolled to complete Group 1.&#xD;
      When there was a minimum of seven days of follow-up safety data from the last enrolled&#xD;
      participant in Group 1, an interim safety review occurred. Once no safety issues were&#xD;
      identified, enrollment of participants into the next dose level began with the enrollment of&#xD;
      3 participants at a rate of 1 participant per day. After at least 7 days of follow-up for the&#xD;
      first 3 vaccinated participants in Group 2 (1x10^11 PU), an interim safety review occurred&#xD;
      before the enrollment of additional participants into Group 2. No safety issues were&#xD;
      identified and an additional 17 participants were enrolled to complete Group 2. Participants&#xD;
      were followed for approximately 48 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Participants recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after the study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>

    <description>Participants recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after the study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. The majority of the reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).The Division of AIDS AE Grading Table Corrected (Version 2.1-July 2017) was used to grade reported events of joint pain (arthralgia).</description>

    <description>Any abnormal laboratory results recorded as unsolicited AEs are summarized. Labs included hematology (hemoglobin, hemoglobin change from baseline, hematocrit percent, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, and white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and lymphocyte counts) and chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine). Complete blood count (CBC) with total lymphocyte count results were collected at screening (≤ 56 days before enrollment), Day 0 prior to study product administration (baseline), Day 3, and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 24. Creatinine and ALT results were collected at screening, Day 0, Day 3 and Weeks 2, 4 and 8. Institutional laboratory normal ranges as well as the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials FDA Guidance, September 2007 were used.</description>

    <description>Unsolicited AEs and attribution assessments were recorded in the study database from receipt of the study product administration through the visit scheduled for 28 days after study product administration. At other time periods greater than 28 days after the study product administration, only serious AEs (SAEs reported as a separate outcome and in the AE module), and new chronic medical conditions that required ongoing medical management were recorded through the last study visit. The relationship between an AE and the study product was assessed by the investigator based on clinical judgment and the definitions outlined in the protocol. A participant with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms for 7 Days After the cAd3-Marburg Vaccine Administration</title>

        <description>Any abnormal laboratory results recorded as unsolicited AEs are summarized.

      <time_frame>Solicited adverse events (AEs) were reported for 7 days after the study product administration. Unsolicited AEs were recorded from receipt of the study product administration through the visit scheduled for 28 days after study product administration. At other time periods greater than 28 days after the study product administration, only serious AEs (SAEs), and new chronic medical conditions that required ongoing medical management were recorded through the last study visit.</time_frame>
      <desc>All AEs recorded on the study were reported. Solicited AEs collected through systematic assessment and unsolicited AEs collected through non-systematic assessment are reported for participants who received study product and had safety data collected following the product administration. Data represent the number and percentage of participants experiencing the event. A participant with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity.</desc>
