  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For more than 60 years, succinylcholine is still being administered as the selective relaxant&#xD;
      for rapid sequence intubation by anesthesiologists in many countries. It has been shown to&#xD;
      possess unique features such as low cost, fast-acting, short half-life, safe metabolites, and&#xD;
      causing excellent muscle relaxation for intubation. However, it has many side effects as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative myalgia (POM), with an incidence rate of about 41%-92%, is one of the most&#xD;
      common side effects of this drug and can take several days to cause significant discomfort in&#xD;
      patients. However, its effect is felt more in the throat, neck, shoulder, and abdominal&#xD;
      muscles and is common among patients with outpatient surgery. Due to its unknown real context&#xD;
      of pathogenesis and in an effort to reduce the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      succinylcholine-induced myalgia, various medications including non-depolarizing muscle&#xD;
      relaxants, benzodiazepines, magnesium sulfate, opioids, gabapentin, pregabalin and&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been tested, with varying degrees of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free radicals are created as a consequence of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production by the&#xD;
      mitochondria. These by-products are generally reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as&#xD;
      reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that result from the cellular redox process. These species&#xD;
      play a dual role as both toxic and beneficial compounds. The delicate balance between their&#xD;
      two antagonistic effects is clearly an important aspect of life. At low or moderate levels,&#xD;
      ROS and RNS exert beneficial effects on cellular responses and immune function. At high&#xD;
      concentrations, they generate oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can damage all&#xD;
      cell structures. Muscle injuries might lead to the production of free radicals and further&#xD;
      cellular damage, triggered by lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. Peroxidation of&#xD;
      membrane lipids leads to loss of membrane fluidity and elasticity, impaired cellular&#xD;
      functioning, and even cell rupture. The various direct products of lipid peroxidation, such&#xD;
      as malondialdehyde (MDA), isoprostanes, and 4-hydroxynonenal are considered among the most&#xD;
      important biomarkers of oxidative stress in tissues. Malondialdehyde is a reactive carbonyl&#xD;
      compound and is both mutagenic and carcinogenic. It reacts with DNA to form DNA adducts that&#xD;
      are believed to contribute significantly to cancers linked to lifestyle and dietary factors.&#xD;
      Protein oxidation can cause fragmentation at amino acid residues, formation of&#xD;
      protein-protein cross-linkages, and oxidation of the protein backbone which ultimately leads&#xD;
      to loss of function. Damaged proteins affect intracellular pathways and are contributing&#xD;
      factors to different disorders and diseases. Protein carbonyl (CO) groups are produced on&#xD;
      protein side chains during oxidation. High levels of protein CO groups have been observed in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, sepsis and chronic renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selenium is a well-recognized antioxidant which act s as a cofactor of antioxidant enzymes.&#xD;
      This essential element helps protect the body against free radicals causing damage to the&#xD;
      cells. Substantial evidence suggests that free radical production leads to increased oxygen&#xD;
      uptake over time. The indirect though significant impact of selenium supplements is to&#xD;
      protect the cells against oxidative stress and free radical production. Nature-made selenium&#xD;
      contains 200 mg of this element with a natural origin, high absorption capacity, and&#xD;
      prolonged retention. Selenium exerts its antioxidant effects through glutathione peroxidase.&#xD;
      Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyze the&#xD;
      breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidase isozymes in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and&#xD;
      is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most&#xD;
      active with lipid hydroperoxides. The glutathione S-transferases show high activity with&#xD;
      lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and serve in&#xD;
      detoxification metabolism.&#xD;

      Eligibility and type of the study: This prospective randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      double-blind study will be conducted after approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee&#xD;
      and obtaining written informed consent from patients scheduled for elective adult sinuscopic&#xD;
      procedures under general anesthesia. This study will be conducted at Assiut University&#xD;
      Hospital from April 2018 until April 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Sample size calculation is based on the pilot study, where the incidence of POM&#xD;
      in outpatient cases is found to be more than 70% and intervention that can cause 25-50%&#xD;
      reduction in incidence of POM will be interesting. With a power of 90% and type I error of&#xD;
      5%, 37 patients will be required in each group (α=0.05 and β=90%). But to avoid possible loss&#xD;
      of samples (dropouts) during the study, the number of patients in each group will be&#xD;
      increased to 40 to be a total of 80 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs coding and Randomization: Patients will be randomly allocated to two equal groups with&#xD;
      the help of a computer-generated table of random numbers to receive the study drugs. All&#xD;
      capsules will be removed from their strips and will be stored in envelopes numbered from 1 to&#xD;
      80. The envelopes will be numbered and randomized according to the computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization tables to ensure an equal number of patients in each arm. Access to the&#xD;
      envelopes codes will be only available to one anesthesiologist who will pack the envelopes.&#xD;
      The anesthetic technique and outcome data will be collected by an anesthesiologist not&#xD;
      included in giving study drugs or envelops coding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Eighty patients will be enrolled in this study. They will be equally divided into&#xD;
      two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C (control group): 40 patients will receive starch capsules orally with sips of&#xD;
           water 2 hours before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group S (Selenium group): 40 patients will receive Selenium (selenium NATURE'S BOUNTY,&#xD;
           INC. Bohemia) 200 mcg orally with sips of water 2 hours before induction of general&#xD;
           anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Technique and Data Collection: Two days before surgery, patients will visit the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic for history taken, clinical assessment and explanation about the study&#xD;
      protocol. Laboratory investigations will be performed and patients will be informed that they&#xD;
      can stop participation in the study at any time without any loss of service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With no pre-medications and 2 hours before sinuscopies, the study drug will be given to all&#xD;
      patients by another anesthesiologist blinded to the envelops coding. No IM injections will be&#xD;
      administered during the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inside the operating room, standard monitoring (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation) will be attached and the preliminary&#xD;
      values will be recorded. An intravenous cannula 18G will be inserted and secured in the&#xD;
      dorsum of the non-dominant hand and intravenous fluids (NaCl 0.9%) was started at the&#xD;
      calculated volume and rate. After 3 minutes of 100% pre-oxygenation via facemask, anesthesia&#xD;
      will be induced with fentanyl 1 mcg/kg, propofol 2.0 mg/kg (diluted with normal saline 0.9%)&#xD;
      and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasciculations Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of fasciculations will be assessed by an anesthesiologist blinded to the&#xD;
      patient's group allotment based on a four-point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After end of fasciculations, the values of heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be intubated with an appropriate size cuffed endotracheal tube under direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy after complete muscular relaxation. The endotracheal tube then will be fixed at&#xD;
      the appropriate length, by adhesive tape at the angle of the mouth. After 5 minutes of&#xD;
      tracheal intubation, the previous values in addition to the EtCO2 will be recorded.&#xD;
      Subsequent values will be recorded every 5 minutes throughout the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained with oxygen 100% and sevoflurane (2-4% MAC). The respiratory&#xD;
      tidal volume will be adjusted to keep end-tidal CO2 at 35-40 mmHg. The same surgical team&#xD;
      will complete all surgical procedures. Atend of surgery and before extubation, all patients&#xD;
      will receive infraorbital block by bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, sevoflurane inhalation will be discontinued and all patients&#xD;
      will be ventilated by 100% oxygen until full consciousness regains and following verbal&#xD;
      commands. At that point, endotracheal tubes will be removed after gentle suction of&#xD;
      secretions through the tube and the oropharyngeal cavity. After the desired spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation, the patients will be transferred to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PACU, postoperative care will be standardized for all patients. Pain related to POM will&#xD;
      be treated with paracetamol 1g intravenously (Perfalgan; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, USA)&#xD;
      when NRS more than or equal 4. The total dose of analgesic requirement in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      will be recorded. After meeting the discharge criteria, the patients will be discharged to be&#xD;
      taken home and cared for, by a responsible adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myalgia Assessment:The incidence and severity of myalgia in all patients will be determined&#xD;
      24 hours after surgery by an anesthesiologist who is unaware of the grouping. Myalgia is&#xD;
      defined as &quot;a pain with no surgical interference&quot; and is graded based on a four-point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pain scores will be obtained during rest. To assess postoperative pain, Numeric rating&#xD;
      scale (NRS) will be used. The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the&#xD;
      intensity of their pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. An 11-point numeric&#xD;
      scale (NRS 11) with 0 representing one pain extreme (e.g., &quot;no pain&quot;) and 10 representing the&#xD;
      other pain extreme (e.g., &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;). NRS&#xD;
      will be used immediately at the recovery room, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutathione peroxidase measurement in plasma will be assessed in venous blood sample of all&#xD;
      included patients (4 ml) under complete aseptic conditions at two events; baseline before&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia (in the holding area after IV canula insertion) and 6, 24 hours after&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of possible complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any complications like postoperative nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, somnolence,&#xD;
      vertigo, confusion will be recorded and managed accordingly. Nausea will be treated by 10 mg&#xD;
      metoclopramide intravenously, vomiting will be treated by 4 mg ondansetron intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be performed using a standard SPSS software package version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinois, USA). Data will be expressed as mean ± SD, numbers (n), percentages (%) and median&#xD;
      (range). The demographic data will be analyzed by Student t-test. Patient data will be&#xD;
      analyzed with the Chi square test. The consumption of analgesia in groups will be analyzed by&#xD;
      using Student t-test. The incidence and severity of fasciculation and POM will be analyzed&#xD;
      using Fisher's exact test. Pearson's r correlation will be used to test the correlation&#xD;
      between fasciculations and postoperative myalgia. A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be informed about the nature and steps of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any patient can stop participation in the study at any time without any loss of service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no risk affecting the patients participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any data taken from all patient will be made confidential and available only to persons&#xD;
           conducting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written consent will be obtained from each patient after approval from our institutional&#xD;
           ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All of the regulations of the local ethics committee of Faculty of Medicine, Assiut&#xD;
           University will be followed.&#xD;
