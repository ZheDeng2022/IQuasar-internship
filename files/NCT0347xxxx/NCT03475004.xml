    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      combination of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal adenocarcinoma who have not responded to prior therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be done in two stages. In stage 1, ten patients will be treated with standard&#xD;
      doses of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab to ensure that the doses are safe and&#xD;
      tolerable. In stage 2, patients will be enrolled into either cohort A, where they will be&#xD;
      treated with a 7-day run-in of binimetinib, followed by pembrolizumab, bevacizumab, and&#xD;
      binimetinib combination treatment in 21 day cycles, or they will be enrolled to cohort B,&#xD;
      which does not include the 7-day run-in of binimetinib. Treatment in cohort B will include&#xD;
      combination therapy of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab from first day of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use of contraceptive methods that result in a failure&#xD;
             rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the&#xD;
             last study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is&#xD;
             post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone&#xD;

             abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and&#xD;
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;

             contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
             With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must&#xD;
             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 180 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study treatment. Men must refrain from donating sperm during&#xD;
             this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation&#xD;
             to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
