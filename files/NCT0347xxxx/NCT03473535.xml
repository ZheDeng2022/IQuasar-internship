  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of problem-solving therapy (PST),&#xD;
      supplemented by a smartphone application, in the treatment of men who present to the&#xD;
      Emergency Departments in Ontario. A total of 100 men in 5 Emergency Departments will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized to receive either face-to-face PST or face-to-face PST supplemented&#xD;
      by the BEACON Suicide Prevention smartphone application. Face-to-face therapy may be provided&#xD;
      via videoconference to accommodate patient preference and ongoing pandemic restrictions.&#xD;
      Participants will complete six sessions of PST and outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6&#xD;
      weeks, two post-therapy follow-up time points (3 and 6 months). Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete a qualitative interview about their participation in the study and their&#xD;
      experience with the smartphone application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-harm is defined as intentional self-poisoning or self-injury, whether or not there is&#xD;
      evidence that the act was intended to result in death. In the past, the term used was&#xD;
      'attempted suicide.' However, peoples' motives for harming themselves are highly variable, a&#xD;
      person may have more than one motive and motivation is hard to assess. In line with usual&#xD;
      public policy in health and social care, we use the term 'self-harm' to describe a behaviour&#xD;
      - avoiding the word 'deliberate' because many service users or consumers dislike its&#xD;
      connotations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Ontario, the number of people who present to hospital emergency departments (ED) with&#xD;
      self-harm is difficult to accurately assess and often underreported. Data from CIHI results&#xD;
      in an estimated 8,250 ED visits annually (as of 2014) in Ontario. However, using data from&#xD;
      Ottawa, Ontario EDs the rate of presentation appears to be more than double at 1,600&#xD;
      presentations annually. Therefore, it is possible that the provincial rate may exceed 16,000&#xD;
      unique presentations. The most common form of self-harm seen in emergency departments (around&#xD;
      80% of episodes) is the intentional consumption of an excess of a medicinal or toxic product,&#xD;
      whether or not there is evidence that the act was intended to result in death. Injuries, most&#xD;
      commonly self-cutting, form 15-20% of episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-thirds of people attending emergency departments because of self-harm are under 35 years&#xD;
      of age. They are high users of health and social care services. Self-harm also has a strong&#xD;
      association with suicide: 7 patients per 1000 (approximately 1.6%) die by suicide in the year&#xD;
      after attending emergency departments with a non-fatal episode, with the incidence rate&#xD;
      nearly double in men compared to women, representing a risk nearly 50 times greater than the&#xD;
      general population. All-cause mortality is also higher for individuals who self-harm, with&#xD;
      significantly more deaths from natural causes and accidents than in the general population.&#xD;
      As such, self-harm is associated with a 40-year reduction in average life expectancy. Whilst&#xD;
      only four of ten people who present with self-harm are men, they account for nearly&#xD;
      two-thirds of suicides after an episode and are far more likely than women to die a premature&#xD;
      death from other causes. The rates are even more pronounced in indigenous communities, with&#xD;
      suicide rates of 126 per 100,000 young men (15-24) compared to a rate of 24 per 100,000 in&#xD;
      non-Indigenous men of the same age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10% of those who present in an Emergency Department following self-harm will&#xD;
      engage in repeat self-harm in the following month and up to 27% after six months. Recurrent&#xD;
      self-harm is associated with significant distress and many unresolved interpersonal problems.&#xD;
      It is likely that any reduction in repetition of self-harm will be mirrored by a fall in&#xD;
      subsequent suicides. The Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention blueprint for a National&#xD;
      Suicide Prevention Strategy (CASP) has identified those who have presented to the hospital&#xD;
      with non-fatal self-harm as a high-risk target group to reduce suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People attending emergency departments after self-harm receive a variable standard of care in&#xD;
      Ontario, and there is no standard protocol for therapy. Many are not assessed for&#xD;
      psychological needs, and the little psychological therapy available is not usually covered by&#xD;
      Ontario Health Insurance (OHIP). Local data from hospitals in Ottawa show that only 4 out of&#xD;
      10 men who present with intentional self-harm are seen by a mental health professional. Few&#xD;
      are offered an evidence-based treatment aimed at reducing their risk of suicide or repeated&#xD;
      self-harm. Assessment of suicide risk is currently a Required Operating Practice for Canadian&#xD;
      Hospital accreditation; however, individuals identified as at-risk for suicide rarely receive&#xD;
      recommended care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specialist services, when offered, typically include intensive and lengthy treatments such as&#xD;
      dialectical behaviour therapy or mindfulness-based therapy. The evidence for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these specialist therapies comes almost entirely from studies in women.&#xD;
      Problem-solving therapy (PST) has been identified as a promising intervention in the&#xD;
      treatment of self-harm. PST seeks to improve an individual's ability to cope better with both&#xD;
      minor (e.g., chronic daily problems) and major (e.g., traumatic events) life stresses to&#xD;
      increase mental and physical health. The major goals of PST are to help individuals adopt a&#xD;
      positive worldview and way of approaching their problems and increase problem-solving skills&#xD;
      in order to better cope with life stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have received funding for a multi-site individual randomized control trial&#xD;
      (RCT) from the Ontario Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR), Support for People and&#xD;
      Patient Oriented Research and Trials (SUPPORT), Unit funded by Canadian Institutes for Health&#xD;
      Research, (CIHR) and the Ontario Ministries of Health and Research and Innovation (MRI)&#xD;
      studying the feasibility and effectiveness of PST with the use of the BEACON smartphone&#xD;
      application compared to PST alone in men who present to Emergency Departments with&#xD;
      intentional self-harm. The rationale for focusing on men is that they are less likely to seek&#xD;
      care but represent nearly two-thirds of those who die by suicide after an index episode of&#xD;
      self-harm, and previous trials have found that providing generic treatments to everyone does&#xD;
      not work. The intervention will build on previous work by trying to extend the range and&#xD;
      intensity of therapy. The investigators will do this by supplementing PST with a&#xD;
      sophisticated smartphone application (BEACON) that has already demonstrated its effectiveness&#xD;
      in men with substance abuse disorders. For the purpose of this study, the smartphone&#xD;
      application has been re-designed for the treatment of self-harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that consent to take part in this study will be assigned randomly to one of two&#xD;
      groups: a &quot;control&quot; group and a study intervention group. Both groups receive six free&#xD;
      one-on-one sessions of PST over a period of eight weeks. If placed in the control group, the&#xD;
      participant will only receive problem-solving therapy and treatment as usual. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive problem-solving therapy, delivered in the same manner, but&#xD;
      will be provided access to a smartphone application (BEACON) designed to support the therapy.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will consist of men 18 years of age or older who have presented via the&#xD;
      Emergency Department of a recruiting site for self-harm and agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be asked to complete a series of outcome measures assessing suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts and behaviour, problem-solving, mental health and substance use, quality of life and&#xD;
      health care service use. These outcomes will be completed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and&#xD;
      6 months. Participants will also be asked to participate in a qualitative interview at the&#xD;
      end of the study to gather information on their experience of being in the study, barriers or&#xD;
      facilitators to participation and the use of the smartphone application. PST sessions will be&#xD;
      delivered by a trained Research Therapist. PST Sessions and other study visits may take place&#xD;
      over videoconference, using an approved platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical participant characteristics, such as gender identity, marital status and&#xD;
      education level will be reported using frequencies and percentages. Continuous&#xD;
      characteristics, such as age, will be reported using mean ±SD for any continuous variables&#xD;
      that are normally distributed, and as a median score. For non-normally distributed variables&#xD;
      the 25th and 75th percentiles will be used. Non-normally distributed variables will also be&#xD;
      dichotomized and analyzed as categorical data. Changes in participants' scores from their&#xD;
      baseline visit to follow-up at six months will be analyzed by use of repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      with a generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) to account for missing variables.&#xD;
      Multivariate linear regression analyses will be performed to determine which participant&#xD;
      characteristics moderate primary and secondary treatment outcomes. Additional subgroup&#xD;
      analyses will be carried out to determine the impact of smartphone-assisted PST for the&#xD;
      following subgroups: first-time presentations of self-harm compared to repeaters; Francophone&#xD;
      versus Anglophone; men with substance abuse disorders versus no substance abuse disorder; and&#xD;
      rural versus urban residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization for this study will occur with 2:1 (67:33) allocation in favour of the blended&#xD;
      therapy model. Given the small sample size, there will be no stratification across sites to&#xD;
      ensure an equitable allocation to the conditions. A web randomization system hosted by the&#xD;
      Ottawa Methods Centre (OMC) will be used. Participants will be randomized by each site&#xD;
      coordinator using the web system as they are enrolled. There is no blinding in this study as&#xD;
      all patients who consent to participate in this study will receive at least PST therapy. It&#xD;
      would not be practical or possible to blind the receipt of the mobile application as both the&#xD;
      participant and therapist will be using the platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), a 24-item&#xD;
      self-report questionnaire for detecting and measuring the current intensity of a subject's&#xD;
      thoughts, feelings and suicidal behaviours. Secondary outcome measures include: the 9-Item&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7),&#xD;
      the Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PC-PTSD-5) screening tool, the EuroQol 5&#xD;
      Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, the Experienced Meaning in Life (EMIL) scale, the&#xD;
      Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Alcohol Use Disorder&#xD;
      Identification Test (AUDIT), the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), and two sub-scales from&#xD;
      the Conformity to Masculine Norms Scale (CMNI). In order to assess the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention on a participant's social problem-solving skills, the Social Problem Solving&#xD;
      Inventory-Revised Short Form (SPSI-R:S) will be used, and health service use will be captured&#xD;
      using the Questionnaire on Healthcare Consumption and Productivity losses for patients with a&#xD;
      Psychiatric Disorder (TiC-P). We will also use routinely collected administrative data&#xD;
      obtained from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). The ICES data collected&#xD;
      will characterize a participant's previous hospitalizations for self-harm, previous&#xD;
      presentations to hospital for self-harm, presentations to hospital for any reason other than&#xD;
      self-harm, admission to the hospital for any reason, outpatient appointments for any reason,&#xD;
      and primary care visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Measure of Suicidality - 24-Item Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported measurement of the current intensity of a participant's attitudes, behaviours, and plans to die by suicide during the past week. It consists of 5 screening items, and 19 follow-up items. Each item is scored from 0 (moderate to strong) to 2 (none), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of suicidality. Generally, scores above 24 are considered to be a clinical cutoff implying that the respondent is at significant risk for suicide.</description>

    <measure>Change in Severity of Depression Symptoms - 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported measurement of the severity of depression symptoms experienced within the last two weeks. The survey consists of 9 items. Participants are asked to rate each symptom of depression on a Likert scale, providing a score between 0 (not at all) and 3 (nearly every day). This yields a total score ranging from 0 (minimal depression) to 27 (severe depression). Higher scores thus indicate a greater severity of depressive symptoms, and are interpreted in the following manner: a score of 0-4 indicates minimal depression, a score of 5-9 indicates mild depression, a score of 10-14 indicates moderate depression, a score of 15-19 indicates moderately severe depression, and a score of 20-27 indicates severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Severity of Anxiety Symptoms - 7-Item General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported measurement of the severity of anxiety symptoms experienced within the last two weeks. It consists of 7 scored items and one follow-up question. Each of the 7 scored items generates a value from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms of anxiety. These scores are interpreted in the following manner: a score of 0-4 indicates little or no anxiety, a score of 5-9 indicates mild anxiety, a score of 10-14 indicates moderate anxiety, and a score of 15-21 indicates severe anxiety. Generally, a score of 10 or above is considered to be a clinical cutoff implying that the respondent may be suffering from a general anxiety disorder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms - 5-Item Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Screening Tool for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing the presence of PTSD-related symptoms. The questionnaire consists of five items requiring a 'yes' or 'no' response. The result of the questionnaire is either 'positive' or 'negative' based on the number of 'yes' responses indicated. The authors suggest that the results of the PC-PTSD-5 survey should be considered 'positive' if three or more yes responses are indicated. A 'positive' result on this questionnaire suggests that the respondent has probable PTSD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life - 5-Item EuroQol 5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing 5 health-related dimensions relevant to quality of life. These dimensions consist of mobility, self-care, ability to participate in one's usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension consists of 5 items, which are ranked by means of a Likert scale from 1 to 5. A score of 1 in a given dimension indicates no problems for that dimension of health, a score of 2 indicates slight problems for dimension, a score of 3 indicates moderate problems for that dimension, a score of 4 indicates severe problems for that dimension, and a score of 5 indicates extreme problems for that dimension. Respondent decisions result in a 1 digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for these five dimensions are combined, resulting in a five digit number, and indicating one of 3,125 possible health states. This five digit number has no arithmetic properties, and is not used as a cardinal score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life - 5-Item EuroQol 5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L): Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing health-related quality of life, including mobility, self-care, ability to participate in one's usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. It consists of 5 items, which are ranked by means of a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Respondents fall into one of 3,125 different health states depending on their responses to the questionnaire. The measure also includes a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which asks participants to evaluate their overall health on a scale from 0-100. Higher scores on the VAS scale indicate a better state of general health, with a score of 100 suggesting the &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and a score of 0 suggesting the &quot;worst imaginable health state.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Meaning in Life - 40-Item Experienced Meaning in Life Questionnaire (EMIL): Four sub-scales (Creative, Experiential, Attitudinal, Ultimate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing a participant's perceived meaning in life. The full EMIL survey consists of four 10-item sub-scales rated on a Likert scale, with each item generating a number between 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This produces a total score ranging from 40 to 200. Higher scores reflect greater perceived meaning in life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Social Supports - 12-Item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Supports (MSPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing a respondents perceived level of social supports available. It consists of 12 items rated on a seven-point Likert scale, generating scores between 1 (very strongly disagree) and 7 (very strongly agree). Items are arranged into three subscales (Significant Other, Family, and Friends) consisting of four items each. Mean scores are generated for each sub-scale by adding the values together and dividing by four. A total value is generated by adding together all values and dividing by 12, resulting in a mean scale score between 1 and 7, with higher scores indicating a higher level of perceived social support. These scores can be interpreted in the following manner: a score between 1 and 2.9 could be considered low support, a score between 3 and 5 can be considered moderate support, and a score from 5.1 to 7 can be considered high support.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alcohol Misuse - 3-Item Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing alcohol consumption, drinking behaviour, adverse reactions, and alcohol-related problems. Two versions of the AUDIT questionnaire will be used in this study. The 3 item version (AUDIT-C) will be employed as a screening questionnaire, and the full 10 item version employed as a follow-up questionnaire. Each of the 10 items generates a score between 0 (never) and 4 (daily or almost daily), with a total score generated by summing the values. The AUDIT-C survey generates a score between 0 and 12, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of alcoholism. Given that higher scores act as an indicator that respondents have problems with alcohol, participants with a score of above 4 on the AUDIT-C will be asked to complete the full questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Change in Alcohol Misuse - 10-Item Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing alcohol consumption, drinking behaviour, adverse reactions, and alcohol-related problems. Two versions of the AUDIT questionnaire will be used in this study. The 3 item version (AUDIT-C) will be employed as a screening questionnaire, and the full 10 item version employed as a follow-up questionnaire. Each of the 10 items generates a score between 0 (never) and 4 (daily or almost daily), with a total score generated by summing the values. Scoring on the full AUDIT questionnaire generates a total ranging between 0 and 40, with higher scores acting as an indicator that respondents have problems with alcohol. AUDIT scores of 8 or above are recommended as indicators of hazardous and harmful alcohol use. A score of between 8 and 15 represents a medium level of alcohol problems, and a score of 16 or above represents a high level of alcohol problems.</description>

    <measure>Change in Drug Misuse - 10-Item Drug-Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Session 6; 3 months; 6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing drug abuse within the last 12 months. It consists of 10 items requiring a 'yes' or 'no' response. Each response indicating a possible drug-use problem is awarded one point. Total scores range between 0 and 10, with higher scores acting as an indicator that the respondent has a substance abuse problem. A score of 0 suggests no problems, a score of 1-2 suggests a low level of drug abuse problems, a score of 3-5 suggests a moderate level of drug abuse problems, a score of 6-8 suggests a substantial level of drug abuse problems, and a score of 9-10 suggests a severe level of drug abuse problems.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to Masculine Gender Roles - 94-Item Conformity to Masculine Norms Scale (CMNI): Emotional Control Sub-Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire assessing a participant's personal conformity with masculine gender norms. The full CMNI questionnaire consists of 94 items rated on a four-point Likert scale, generating scores between 1 (strongly disagree) and 4 (strongly agree). This produces a total score ranging between 94 and 376. For the purposes of this study, the investigators will only be using the Emotional Control (CMNI-EC) and Self-Reliance (CMNI-SR) sub-scales in order to reduce the burden on participants and study staff. The emotional control sub-scale consists of 12 questions, and generates a score between 12 and 48, with higher scores indicating greater conformity to masculine norms as regards emotion.</description>

    <measure>Health Service Use - Data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES): Previous Hospitalizations for Self-Harm</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months Post-Enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Health service use will be captured using routinely collected administrative health data obtained from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Data to be collected includes: previous hospitalizations for self-harm, presentation to hospital for self-harm, presentations to hospital for any reason other than self-harm, admission to hospital for any reason, outpatient appointment for any reason, and primary care visits. This particular outcome item refers to &quot;previous hospitalizations for self-harm&quot;. The incidence of previous hospitalizations for self-harm will be measured using the ICD-10-CM codes T360-T50992, T510-T6592, T71112-T71232, and X71-X83.</description>
