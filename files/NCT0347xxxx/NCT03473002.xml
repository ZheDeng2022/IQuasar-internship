    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial in up to 25 males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, 18-45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. This trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a single intranasal dose of Sendai virus vectored Respiratory Syncytial&#xD;
      Virus (SeVRSV) vaccine. The subjects will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive SeVRSV&#xD;
      vaccine at a dose of 1 x 10^7 EID50 or placebo (saline) intranasally. Study duration is&#xD;
      approximately 11 months with subject participation duration approximately 6 months. The&#xD;
      primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and reactogenicity of SeVRSV vaccine&#xD;
      following receipt of one intranasal dose; 2) assess the ELISA antibody responses to SeV and&#xD;
      to the RSV F protein at 28 days post receipt of one intranasal dose of SeVRSV vaccine; 3)&#xD;
      assess the detection of vaccine virus from nasal washes at days 3, 5, 8 and 15 following&#xD;
      receipt of one intranasal dose of SeVRSV vaccine.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial in up to 25 males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, 18-45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. This trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a single intranasal dose of Sendai virus vectored Respiratory Syncytial&#xD;
      Virus (SeVRSV) vaccine. The subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      SeVRSV vaccine at a dose of 1 x 10^7 EID50 or placebo (saline) intranasally. Since this is a&#xD;
      first in human, phase I study, the first two subjects (sentinels) will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      SeVRSV treatment arm. Safety and laboratory data will be collected through 14 days post&#xD;
      vaccination. If none of the predefined halting criteria of sentinel subjects are met,&#xD;
      enrollment of the remaining subjects will proceed. If any of the pre-defined halting criteria&#xD;
      of sentinel subjects are met, an electronic review by the SMC will be required prior to&#xD;
      continuation of the study. While safety is evaluated for the sentinel subjects, no new&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled, but screening may continue. Study duration is approximately 11&#xD;
      months with subject participation duration approximately 6 months. The primary objectives are&#xD;
      to: 1) assess the safety and reactogenicity of SeVRSV vaccine following receipt of one&#xD;
      intranasal dose; 2) assess the ELISA antibody responses to SeV and to the RSV F protein at 28&#xD;
      days post receipt of one intranasal dose of SeVRSV vaccine; 3) assess the detection of&#xD;
      vaccine virus from nasal washes at days 3, 5, 8 and 15 following receipt of one intranasal&#xD;
      dose of SeVRSV vaccine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures. 2. Are able&#xD;
        to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study&#xD;
        visits/phone calls.&#xD;

        3. Males or non-pregnant females 18-45, inclusive. 4. Are in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or&#xD;
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have&#xD;
             been present for at least 90 days that would affect the assessment of the safety of&#xD;
             subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or&#xD;
             conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic&#xD;
             prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the&#xD;
             chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any&#xD;
             prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company,&#xD;
             etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of&#xD;
             medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change&#xD;
             in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by&#xD;
             the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be&#xD;
             considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as&#xD;
             needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or&#xD;
             appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or&#xD;
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of&#xD;
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment&#xD;
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the&#xD;
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there&#xD;
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses&#xD;
             to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the&#xD;
             exception of steroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria), herbals,&#xD;
