  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the change of total cholesterol content of&#xD;
      erythrocyte membranes (CEM) in patients with coronary artery disease treated with secondary&#xD;
      prevention drugs, and the correlation with the prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, plasma samples, the red cells and associated clinical data of&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease were collected from Department of Cardiology of Lu'an&#xD;
      Shili Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University. Blood samples collected&#xD;
      from all the participants at baseline (prior to the follow-up) and the time points of&#xD;
      follow-up were placed into ordinary test tubes and stored at 4°C for less than 4 hours. After&#xD;
      centrifuged, plasma and erythrocyte membranes was separated and stored at -80°C. The change&#xD;
      of total cholesterol content of erythrocyte membranes (CEM) was measured. A follow-up form&#xD;
      was designed according to the research purpose and discussed among the team members. The&#xD;
      follow-up was performed through telephone by the trained investigators with good&#xD;
      communication skills and knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      Patients were followed up every six months from the day of discharge. The results of the&#xD;
      follow-up were entered into the database, a process that was carried out by a designated&#xD;
      person and double-checked by an independent person. The primary clinical endpoints were&#xD;
      composite atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, defined as nonfatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality. Secondary clinical endpoints were&#xD;
      revascularization, including percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting, and Class IV heart failure requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
