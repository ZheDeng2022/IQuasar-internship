  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research program will investigate the changes in brain chemistry and circuitry&#xD;
      that 're-wire' the brain during chronic cocaine use, promote relapse, and complicate&#xD;
      treatment efforts. Currently-using and non-treatment-seeking individuals with a cocaine use&#xD;
      disorder will undergo a cocaine self-administration paradigm 2-5 days prior to completing&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine use disorder (CUD) remains a significant public health concern that is resistant to&#xD;
      current treatments. Challenges to treating CUD include an imbalance in neurobiological&#xD;
      systems that 're-wire' the brain such that appetitive and habitual processes influence&#xD;
      decision-making and behavior. This research project aims to provide insight into this&#xD;
      reorganized circuitry in CUD by investigating neurofunctional systems related to&#xD;
      glutamatergic plasticity and functional brain networks during initial (2-5 days) abstinence.&#xD;
      To target this potentially critical period of recovery, currently-using and&#xD;
      non-treatment-seeking individuals with CUD will undergo a cocaine self-administration&#xD;
      paradigm 2-5 days prior to completing [18F]FPEB positron emission tomography (PET) and&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Healthy comparison (HC) subjects that have&#xD;
      participated in [18F]FPEB PET as part of other Yale approved protocols will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in the fMRI portion of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the availability of mGluR5 using [18F]FPEB PET during initial abstinence&#xD;
      in individuals with CUD. The investigators hypothesize individuals with CUD, relative to HC,&#xD;
      will exhibit concurrently and regionally specific increases (e.g., in the striatum) and&#xD;
      decreases (e.g., in the prefrontal cortex) in mGluR5 availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine patterns of resting-state, response-inhibition, an automaticity related&#xD;
      connectivity within and between large-scale functional networks using fMRI during initial&#xD;
      abstinence in individuals with CUD. The investigators hypothesize network-based analyses of&#xD;
      fMRI will reveal lower frontoparietal and greater limbic network modulation in CUD as&#xD;
      compared to HC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To explore the relationships between mGluR5 availability and functional network&#xD;
      activity during initial abstinence in individuals with CUD. The investigators will perform&#xD;
      multi-modal analysis of PET and fMRI data to examine links between molecular and functional&#xD;
      systems in CUD using emerging 'fusion' approaches. While exploratory in nature, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to find links between alterations in mGluR5 systems and functional&#xD;
      reorganization in CUD (e.g., greater dorsostriatal mGluR5 may be linked to blunted&#xD;
      frontoparietal inhibition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To explore the relationships between mGluR5 availability, functional network activity&#xD;
      (and their linkages) with cocaine self-administration, disease severity and chronicity, and&#xD;
      psychometric assessments of impulsivity and compulsivity. While exploratory in nature, the&#xD;
      investigators expect more substantial neurofunctional alterations during initial abstinence&#xD;
      will be associated with greater cocaine self-administration, disease severity, impulsivity&#xD;
      and compulsivity in individuals with CUD.&#xD;
