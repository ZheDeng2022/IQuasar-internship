      The objective of this open-label pilot study is to evaluate the effect of the commercially&#xD;
      available GOLO for Life (GFL) weight management program on body weight in a type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patient population after approximately 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Golo For Life (GFL) is a weight management program that helps people who are overweight or&#xD;
      obese limit and portion their consumption of conventional foods and make healthier choices in&#xD;
      their diets. GFL includes a point-based system from the four macronutrient food groups that&#xD;
      is based on the individual's activity level and body mass. Additionally, GFL includes&#xD;
      common-sense instructions, motivation and tips supporting compliance and requires a minimum&#xD;
      of 15 minutes of exercise per day. GFL also includes a dietary supplement containing zinc and&#xD;
      chromium, essential nutrients that support regulation of blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case studies from clinician and wellness program use, GFL has shown the ability to reduce&#xD;
      body weight in both healthy and diabetic people who are overweight or obese. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints including measures of blood sugar have been observed to decrease as a result of the&#xD;
      GFL program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While GFL has been developed and used in private clinical practice in both healthy overweight&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetic people, more systematic research is needed to determine to what extent it&#xD;
      is able to support healthy weight loss. This open-label pilot study is intended to observe&#xD;
      the effects of the program in a representative group of subjects with stable type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      at one outpatient medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this open-label pilot study is to evaluate the effect of the commercially&#xD;
      available GOLO for Life (GFL) weight management program on body weight in a type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patient population after approximately 3 months.&#xD;
