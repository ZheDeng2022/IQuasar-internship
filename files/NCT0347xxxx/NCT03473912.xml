    <textblock>
      Serum, synovial fluid and skin biopsies from patients will be collected to the biobank with&#xD;
      rheumatoid diseases. These samples will later be used for clinical and basic research,&#xD;
      following approval of each specific study by the IRB. The investigators intend to extract&#xD;
      protein, DNA and RNA from each sample.&#xD;

      1. PURPOSE Rheumatic diseases, being part of the auto-immune diseases, are rare&#xD;
           inflammatory diseases which usually occur from an unknown reason. Various factors alone&#xD;
           or in combination can trigger the disease, including pathogens, medications and stress,&#xD;
           but the most prominent factor is the genetic background. These diseases are chronic,&#xD;
           characterized by periods of flares and regression, and patients are often treated by&#xD;
           various drugs. In routine check-up visits in the rheumatology clinic, patients are&#xD;
           giving blood regularly in order to monitor the levels of cytokines and antibodies.&#xD;
           However, the factors being assessed in the routine lab are limited, and the&#xD;
           investigators believe there are much more proteins that can be studied in our research&#xD;
           lab. Genomic studies of DNA and RNA isolated from blood of rheumatic patients are rarely&#xD;
           being performed, and if they are - only at diagnosis. Combining both protein and genetic&#xD;
           profiles of patients at diagnosis and follow up can be extremely useful both for basic&#xD;
           and clinical research in helping us to understand the tendency to develop a disease, as&#xD;
           well as disease progression and response to therapy. A rheumatoid bio-bank is the basis&#xD;
           of establishing many studies leading us a step forward towards personalized medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DNA/ RNA resource DNA and RNA will be isolated from blood, synovial fluid or from skin&#xD;
           tissue biopsies, related to the rheumatologic disease, derived from patients and normal&#xD;
           donors who consent to participate in the rheumatologic Bio-Bank program. The DNA/RNA&#xD;
           will be extracted, measured and stored in the bio-bank freezers. Blood samples will be&#xD;
           drawn by a physician or accredited nurse, synovial fluid samples and skin biopsies will&#xD;
           be collected by physicians only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient recruitment: Obtaining Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           General Principle:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tissues will only be taken from adult patients who gave consent by means of a signed&#xD;
           informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients above the age of 18, referred to the Rheumatology clinic or Internal&#xD;
           Medicine E Department at the Meir Medical Center, for investigation or treatment of&#xD;
           suspected rheumatic disease, will be candidates to participate in the repository.&#xD;
           Patients at their primary diagnosis or follow up will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
           Recruitment of patients and obtaining informed consent will be done by physicians only.&#xD;
           No tissue for DNA/RNA isolation will be taken from patients prior to obtaining their&#xD;
           written consent or from those who do not consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Number of sample in the bio-bank: 500 for each year&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identifying Patients Entitled for Sample Collection 4.1 - General responsibility: The&#xD;
           bio bank manager, Dr. Yair Levy, will hold responsibility for appropriate storage and&#xD;
           privacy protection of samples, and will be in charge of the bio bank staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2- Privacy protection and access to patient's information: To protect patient's&#xD;
           privacy identification, a serial code will be generated for each sample. The serial code&#xD;
           will replace patient's identifying stickers and along the bio bank processing, samples&#xD;
           will only be recognized by bio bank serial codes. The samples are stored in locked&#xD;
           freezers or in freezers located in locked rooms accessible to bio bank staff only. The&#xD;
           protocol for sample coding: Names and ID numbers of all consented patients will be saved&#xD;
           at the bio bank in a separate database that is not connected to the bio bank sample&#xD;
           tracking system. On sample reception to the bio bank, the serial code and the correlated&#xD;
           patient's identifying number will be recorded on a special secure computer file within&#xD;
           the bio bank records. Access to this file will be restricted only to the bio bank&#xD;
           coordinator or its manager. All paper documents containing data about patients or&#xD;
           samples (e.g. a copy of patients informed consent form) will be kept in locked cabinets.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 - Coordinating sample collection: The nurse will draw blood according to physician's&#xD;
           orders and the attached bio bank forms. Synovial fluid aspirates will be taken solely by&#xD;
           physicians and only if medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 - Skin biopsies - The bio bank coordinator will be informed on a weekly basis of all&#xD;
           planned skin biopsies at the Dermatology clinic at Meir Medical Center. The biopsy will&#xD;
           be performed as clinically needed and with no modification due to banking requirement.&#xD;
           All removed tissues will be sent to the pathology lab and processing for banking will&#xD;
           begin only after confirmation that adequate tissue is available for the pathology&#xD;
           processing. Tissues that eventually will be diagnosed other than rheumatic related&#xD;
           disease will be banked and may serve for studies of that specific process or as&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participant's rights 5.1 Benefits and risks to participants The impact of human genetics&#xD;
           research on human beings is vast. DNA samples taken from patients and volunteers may&#xD;
           carry information regarding genetic disorders, inheritance pattern and also about the&#xD;
           human nature. The focus of the rheumatologic Bio-bank is on rheumatoid diseases&#xD;
           pathogenesis, therapies and immune response during illness and recovery. Samples stored&#xD;
           at the Bio-Bank may be subject to any genetic study of rheumatoid diseases regarding the&#xD;
           biology, pathogenesis, prognosis, complications or patient's response to the disease or&#xD;
           therapy. The benefit outcome from genetic studies to the individual participant may be&#xD;
           detection of clinically significant genomic markers which may have implications for&#xD;
           patient's appropriate treatment, and follow-up. The risks might include bad mental&#xD;
           influence according to one's genetic aberration detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Withdrawal of participance Participants who want to withdraw their consent must&#xD;
           inform the Bio-bank their request in a written letter. Following the acceptance of&#xD;
           participant letter, the use of his samples will be immediately stopped and all available&#xD;
           DNA samples from this participant will be discarded. In case that a DNA sample from this&#xD;
           participant had already been utilized for a specific study, the Bio-bank manager will&#xD;
           inform participant request to that study PI which must stop using that sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Patents rights Participants won't have patent rights or spiritual asset derived from&#xD;
           studies that use their samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Participant's compensation Bio-bank donation will be voluntary only. No compensation&#xD;
           will be paid to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Timing for Sample Collection and Processing Preferably, the first sample collection&#xD;
           should be collected at diagnosis. From patients presented during weekends and holidays&#xD;
           the consent will be obtained at admission but samples will be taken early in morning on&#xD;
           the first regular working day. It is important that first samples be collected prior to&#xD;
           the first drug administration or at least as close to the beginning of therapy as it is&#xD;
           possible. By no means will the treatment be delayed for any reason related to this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-set regular follow-up time points and major clinical events (flare, relapse, and&#xD;
      remission) will serve as important milestones. Samples will be drawn simultaneously with the&#xD;
      routine clinical tests as ordered by the treating physician. By no means will sample be taken&#xD;
      if not otherwise indicated and ordered by the treating physician. All samples should be&#xD;
      transported to the laboratory immediately after they had been drawn. Processing should begin&#xD;
      as close to the time it was drawn as is possible. Sample Handling protocols 7.1 Sample&#xD;
      collection: Blood samples are taken only from participants who have previously consented and&#xD;
      authorized the use of their samples for research purposes. Blood will be drawn by any&#xD;
      employees certified in taking blood at the Meir Medical Center; synovial fluid will be drawn&#xD;
      by physicians only. Blood and synovial fluid will be drawn to lavender and gold top vials&#xD;
      with EDTA at a maximum of 20 ml for blood and 30 ml for synovial fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Blood Processing: Blood samples will be separated to serum and cellular fraction by&#xD;
      centrifugation, and kept at -80c until used. White blood cells (WBC) will be collected&#xD;
      following red blood cells hemolysis, and stored at -80c. Proteins will be assessed directly&#xD;
      from the sera fraction while DNA/RNA will be extracted from WBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Utilization of frozen sample A. Appreciation for usage of frozen sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      All researchers working at Meir or in any other recognized research institution are&#xD;
      potentially eligible for samples use from this protocol. No personal identifying data will be&#xD;
      given. A summary of relevant clinical data on the donor of each sample will be enclosed,&#xD;
      without any personal data such as name, ID number, hospital record number, address or&#xD;
      telephone number. A sample will be eligible for utilization only after the completion of all&#xD;
      the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A written confirmation from the Internal Review Board (IRB) and the head of researcher's&#xD;
           institute, approving the specific project / experiment, for which samples are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The PI of the suggest experiment will present a detailed protocol of the suggested&#xD;
           experiment. The protocol should include the rationale and the expected benefit from the&#xD;
           experiment, clear and detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria and detailed laboratory&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The PI of the suggest experiment will provide a written document listing all samples&#xD;
           received for his/her research, confirming his/her obligation and responsibility to&#xD;
           follow all ethical roles as detailed by Israeli law and Meir's IRB. The PI of the&#xD;
           suggest experiment will not transfer samples to a third party without permission from&#xD;
           the Bio-bank manager and the Meir's IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The transported samples must be unidentified. Only the Israeli Bio-bank manager will be&#xD;
           able to decode the samples information in case it will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Meir IRB will review all the above documentation and will approve utilizing samples&#xD;
           from the Bio Bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Protocol of tissue usage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of all required conditions as mentioned in paragraph A, the PI of&#xD;
      the project or experiment should fill out a tissue request form and submit it to the Bio&#xD;
      Bank. PI of the Bio Bank project is responsible to verify that all required conditions were&#xD;
      fulfilled. The following protocol is to follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The bio bank coordinator will confirm with the PI who applied for samples when his&#xD;
           laboratory team will be ready for picking up samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Samples will be always dispatched frozen in sealed boxed with dry ice. Samples will be&#xD;
           marked with a printed sticker of bio bank barcode of that sample. A detailed summary of&#xD;
           the clinical follow up of all patients who donated samples for this project will be&#xD;
           attached identified by bio bank barcode only. Names, ID numbers of any other identifying&#xD;
           details will not be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Utilizing samples priorities and the role for long term banking&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In case concomitant projects are interested in identical samples: Projects that runs by&#xD;
           investigators from Meir Medical Center will be prioritized over projects from other&#xD;
           institutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RNA and DNA will be preferably reserved for large scale studies. International&#xD;
           collaborations are welcomed to utilized samples for studies within the scope of this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Samples will be saved as identified samples (as described in 4.2) for 20 years from the&#xD;
           end of collection. After 20 years samples will be destroyed unless extending storage&#xD;
           duration will approved by Helsinki Committee.&#xD;
