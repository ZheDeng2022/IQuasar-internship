    <textblock>
      Skin flaps following mastectomy breast surgery that do not have enough oxygen are at risk for&#xD;
      necrosis which can increase wound healing problems, postoperative recovery time and be costly&#xD;
      to the hospital systems and affect the patient quality of life, poor esthetic results and&#xD;
      overall reconstructive success. Mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) has an incidence of&#xD;
      10-15% with higher rates (7% - 30%) in mastectomy procedures with immediate reconstruction.&#xD;
      Intraoperative assessment of the circulation in skin flaps is currently done with clinical&#xD;
      assessment tools utilizing somewhat subjective identifiers such as flap color, capillary&#xD;
      refill, temperature and dermal edge bleeding to determine the viability of the flap. Several&#xD;
      technologies have been developed to assist in the clinical judgement of skin flaps but these&#xD;
      technologies are not yet widely used because of the cost of the technology, the time required&#xD;
      to image the patient, the intravenous injection of indocyanine green (ICG) dye required for&#xD;
      contrast and the inability to image repeatedly and in different environments (pre-op,&#xD;
      intra-op and post-op). A new commercially available imaging technology uses NIR spectroscopy&#xD;
      to measure regional tissue hemoglobin oxygenation, using images that are taken 12 inches away&#xD;
      from the patient. Preclinical data shows that NIR can predict necrosis in flaps but clinical&#xD;
      data is needed to characterize and assess the value of the technology in plastic and&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery. The purpose of this research study is to explore the ability of NIR&#xD;
      imaging to predict skin flap tissue viability in the clinical setting of immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction procedures. Study Design: This is a prospective, non-interventional study that&#xD;
      will explore the ability of NIR imaging to predict of tissue viability in immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction procedures. Necrosis will be scored using the SKIN score. Participation in the&#xD;
      study will not impact patient care; all patients will receive standard care.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are commercial medical devices that measure the spectrum of near infrared light&#xD;
      reflected from at a single location of tissue. These non-imaging devices are also called&#xD;
      point NIR spectroscopy devices. Point NIR spectroscopy devices have been used to monitor&#xD;
      blood perfusion to free flaps and mastectomy flaps. The unit of measurement is StO2; StO2 is&#xD;
      a measure of hemoglobin oxygen saturation weighted towards the saturation in the&#xD;
      microvascular bed as opposed to SaO2 or SvO2 which correspond to the arterial and venous&#xD;
      hemoglobin saturation respectively. StO2 is mixed arterial - venous measure of hemoglobin&#xD;
      oxygen saturation. Point devices use a light delivery and collection probe that needs to be&#xD;
      in contact with tissue. They can measure on the order of ~10mm deep over an area of&#xD;
      approximately 1cm by 1cm depending on the configuration of the device. Some studies using&#xD;
      point devices have shown significant differences in StO2 values in flaps that became necrotic&#xD;
      versus flaps that remained viable. NIR point systems however are not widely used&#xD;
      intraoperatively because they need to be brought in contact with the tissue being measured.&#xD;
      They also measure small areas thereby necessitating measurements over many spatially distinct&#xD;
      points on the flap to get a comprehensive measurement of flap oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study A new commercially available imaging technology uses NIR&#xD;
      spectroscopy to measure regional tissue hemoglobin oxygenation, StO2. The device is based on&#xD;
      the same principles as point NIR spectroscopy devices but instead of contacting the skin a&#xD;
      set of images are taken 12 inches away from the patient. These images are processed to&#xD;
      produce a colour coded StO2 image of a large tissue area (~6&quot; by 4&quot;). Since the image device&#xD;
      doesn't contact the skin the depth of measurement is ~2mm instead of ~10mm with a point&#xD;
      system. Compared to dye based angiography methods, StO2 NIR imaging does not require the&#xD;
      injection of a dye. The advantage of the NIR imaging device over point NIR systems is a lack&#xD;
      of patient contact. Thus StO2 NIR imaging is completely non-invasive, non-contact. Images can&#xD;
      be captured and displayed in less than 5 seconds therefore imaging can be repeated as needed&#xD;
      with no risk to the patient and no cost for disposables. Preclinical data shows that NIR can&#xD;
      predict necrosis in flaps but clinical data is needed to characterize and assess the value of&#xD;
      the technology in plastic and reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses or research questions This study will explore the ability of NIR imaging to&#xD;
      predict of tissue viability in immediate breast reconstruction procedures. Necrosis will be&#xD;
      scored using the SKIN score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives and secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To establish the NIR parameters that are consistent with flap viability. Aim 1: To&#xD;
      develop parameters to predict flap viability intraoperatively. Aim 3: To determine if NIR&#xD;
      values correspond to SKIN scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study The Innovation is a non-contact, non-invasive means to map/image&#xD;
      the oxygen available to an area of tissue. It requires no setup time and there are no&#xD;
      consumables associated with its measurement method. As cellular respiration in tissue&#xD;
      requires an adequate supply of oxygen, the tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation image provided&#xD;
      by the Innovation can detect areas of tissue that are threatened by a poor oxygen supply. The&#xD;
      oxygenation measures provided by the device give surgeons insight into the healing potential&#xD;
      of skin flaps in procedures such as mastectomies. Skin flaps that are not sufficiently&#xD;
      oxygenated are at risk for necrosis which can be costly to the hospital systems and affect&#xD;
      the patient quality of life. The Innovation's oxygenation image assists surgeons in&#xD;
      identifying areas of flap ischemia intra-operatively and can be used to monitor flaps&#xD;
      post-operatively. With early identification of ischemic areas surgeons can intervene earlier&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of flap necrosis.&#xD;
