  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic amyloidoses are rare diseases affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 persons each&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In systemic amyloidoses abnormal proteins deposit in bodily organs and severely impair their&#xD;
      function, causing death if not treated effectively. Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is caused by&#xD;
      a usually small population of plasma cells (the cells that produce antibodies). These cells&#xD;
      produce part of antibodies, the light chains (LC) that form amyloid deposits. Almost every&#xD;
      organ, with the exception of the brain, can be affected by AL amyloidosis. The heart is&#xD;
      involved in three fourths of patients and is responsible for almost all the deaths occurring&#xD;
      in the first 6 months after diagnosis. Current therapy of AL amyloidosis is based on drugs&#xD;
      targeting the plasma cells producing the amyloid-forming LC. At present, most patients&#xD;
      receive a powerful anti-plasma cell drug, bortezomib, as part of their initial treatment.&#xD;
      However, bortezomib-based therapy, can improve heart involvement only in less than one third&#xD;
      of patients with AL amyloidosis, and many patients (approximately one third) still die within&#xD;
      12 months from diagnosis. Early cardiac deaths remain an acute unmet need and the major&#xD;
      determinant of overall outcome in this disease. Thus, there is the need of alternative means&#xD;
      to treat heart involvement in AL amyloidosis. Doxycycline is a widely used, well tolerated,&#xD;
      antibiotic that has been marketed for decades and used to treat a number of different&#xD;
      infectious diseases caused by bacteria. This molecule has been extensively studied in the&#xD;
      laboratory, in animal models and, more recently, in small studies involving patients, for its&#xD;
      potential of improving cardiac damage in amyloidosis. These studies showed that doxycycline&#xD;
      disrupts amyloid deposits, reduces the amyloid load in a mouse model, and counteracts the&#xD;
      toxicity exerted by amyloid-forming LCs on C. elegans, a worm whose pharynx is used as a&#xD;
      model resembling human heart. In a small clinical study, doxycycline was given to patients&#xD;
      with cardiac AL amyloidosis during treatment for their underlying plasma cell disease. This&#xD;
      resulted in a remarkable improvement of survival compared to &quot;matched historical controls&quot;&#xD;
      (i.e. similar patients who had received only anti-plasma cell therapy without doxycycline in&#xD;
      the past). Based on these promising preliminary results, we designed the present clinical&#xD;
      trial to assess whether the addition of doxycycline to anti-plasma cell therapy can improve&#xD;
      survival in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis who were not previously treated. The rate of&#xD;
      survival at 12 months will be compared in patients receiving doxycycline and in controls&#xD;
      receiving standard antibiotic therapy, together with anti-plasma cell therapy. Patients will&#xD;
      be assessed for parameters of plasma cell disease, heart involvement and possible involvement&#xD;
      of other organs, as well as for quality of life. To make sure that patients who will receive&#xD;
      doxycycline and those who will not have comparable severity of cardiac disease, patients will&#xD;
      be stratified according to the stage of cardiac involvement. Patients with very advanced&#xD;
      heart dysfunction will not be enrolled in the trial, because preliminary data indicate that&#xD;
      doxycycline is of little or no benefit in these subjects. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive doxycycline or standard antibiotics in combination with anti-plasma cell therapy.&#xD;
      Bortezomib-based treatment directed against plasma cells will be delivered according to each&#xD;
      participating institutions' guidelines. Doxycycline will be administered at a dosage of 100&#xD;
      mg two times a day, which is usual in the treatment of bacterial diseases. Standard&#xD;
      antibiotics will be delivered according to each participating institutions' guidelines&#xD;
      (provided that drugs of the same class as doxycycline are not administered) in the control&#xD;
      arm. Patients will be provided a diary to record possible adverse events and will be&#xD;
      instructed accordingly. Patients will be evaluated at trial centers every 2 months for&#xD;
      treatment efficacy and toxicity. In case of unsatisfactory response second-line therapy will&#xD;
      be initiated. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, doxycycline administration will be&#xD;
      continued for the entire duration of follow-up (12 months).&#xD;

&#xD;
             Highly-effective contraceptive methods with a Pearl Index lower than 1 are: Oral&#xD;
