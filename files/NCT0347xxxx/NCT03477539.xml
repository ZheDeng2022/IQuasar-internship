    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab works in treating transplant-eligible&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the percentage of patients achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      negativity by multiparameter flow cytometry (MPF) after autologous stem cell transplant (SCT)&#xD;
      (at day 100) using pre-SCT daratumumab consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine percentage of patients achieving MRD negativity by MPF after 1 year of&#xD;
      daratumumab+lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) for peri-SCT treatment with daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine percentage of MRD negativity by MPF after pre-SCT consolidation with&#xD;
      daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine safety profile of peri-SCT daratumumab with lenalidomide. V. To determine&#xD;
      the overall response rate (ORR) of patients receiving peri-SCT daratumumab for MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the overall survival (OS) for patients receiving peri-SCT daratumumab for&#xD;
      MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION I: Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of&#xD;
      cycles 1-2, and on days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION II: Beginning 8 weeks after completion of daratumumab cycle 2 or 4, patients&#xD;
      undergo autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Within 14 days after completion of day 100 visit post-SCT, patients receive&#xD;
      daratumumab IV on day 1 and lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients who are still maintaining response continue to receive daratumumab IV&#xD;
      every 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3-6 months&#xD;
      for up to 3 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative response after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 100 post ASCT</time_frame>
    <description>MRD negative response after ASCT is defined as achievement of MRD negative status in the bone marrow by flow cytometry (multiparameter flow cytometry [MPF]) at the day 100 post ASCT visit. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. 95 percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
