      This pilot study uses TESA-HB therapy for treatment of depressive symptoms associated with&#xD;
      mild and moderate depression episodes. Primary objectives of this pilot study are to&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety of TESA-HB Therapy, and to investigate the efficacy of TESA-HB Therapy&#xD;
      for depressive symptoms.&#xD;

      The primary indicator variable in this study is the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HAM-D21), and secondary efficacy outcomes will be measured using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major Depression Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck's Depression Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck's Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB-S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication Usage Log&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Event Log&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population includes men and women who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed with a mild to moderate depressive episode&#xD;
&#xD;
