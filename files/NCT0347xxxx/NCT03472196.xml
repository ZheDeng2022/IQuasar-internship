    <description>The Nitinotes EndoZip system is designed to allow for the creation of multiple internal gastric segmentation (4-8) in the stomach by using an endoscopic approach. The system allows the forming of wall-to-wall longitudinal attachments of the anterior and posterior stomach walls, creating multiple strictures within.&#xD;
Creation of this segmentation may significantly reduce gastric volume, may affect gastric motility and consequently, reduce weight.</description>
