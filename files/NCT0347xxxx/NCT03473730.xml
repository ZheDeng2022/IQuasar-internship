      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder Cancer Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by&#xD;
      vein 1 time each week for 4 weeks before your cystectomy. During Week 1, your dose of&#xD;
      daratumumab will be given over 8 hours. After that, each dose will be given over about 4&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion&#xD;
      related reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will get drugs, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before the&#xD;
      infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get drugs, including inhaled&#xD;
      steroids, after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction. You may stay overnight in&#xD;
      the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check your health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will&#xD;
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are&#xD;
      administered and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 4 doses of daratumumab before your surgery. You will no longer be able&#xD;
      to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if&#xD;
      you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 1-4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and&#xD;
      blood type testing. Daratumumab will interfere with blood type testing which is needed before&#xD;
      blood transfusions can be given. For this reason, a test to find out your blood type will be&#xD;
      performed before you receive daratumumab. You should carry the blood type card with you while&#xD;
      you are on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 6-8 (the week of your surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests&#xD;
      and part of this sample will also be used for blood type testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have surgery to remove your bladder. You will sign a separate consent form&#xD;
      explaining the procedure and its risks in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 12-14, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 18, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and you will be&#xD;
      asked about any side effects you are having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal Cancer Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by&#xD;
      vein 1 time each week for 8 weeks before your nephrectomy, metastasectomy, or biopsy. During&#xD;
      Week 1, your dose of daratumumab will be given over 8 hours. After that, each dose will be&#xD;
      given over about 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion&#xD;
      related reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will get drugs, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before the&#xD;
      infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get drugs, including inhaled&#xD;
      steroids, after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction. You may stay overnight in&#xD;
      the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check your health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will&#xD;
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are&#xD;
      administered and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 8 doses of daratumumab prior to your surgery or biopsy. You may receive&#xD;
      additional doses of daratumumab after the surgery/biopsy for up to one year after your first&#xD;
      dose. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 1-8:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam each week before you receive daratumumab. Blood (about 2&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing. Daratumumab treatment will&#xD;
      interfere with blood type testing which is needed before blood transfusions can be given. For&#xD;
      this reason, a test to find out your blood type will be performed before you receive&#xD;
      daratumumab. You should carry the blood type card with you while you are on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 10-12 (the week of your surgery/tissue collection):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests,&#xD;
      part of this sample will also be used for blood type testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have surgery to remove your kidney, a kidney cancer lesion, or repeat biopsy. You&#xD;
      will sign a separate consent form explaining the procedure and its risks in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 14-30:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam and return every 2 weeks to receive daratumumab. Blood (about 2&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 30-52:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam and return every month to receive daratumumab. Blood (about 2&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 52, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 65, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and you will be&#xD;
      asked about any side effects you are having.&#xD;

             as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis, or fungal infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RENAL &amp; BLADDER: History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease including,&#xD;
             but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction or unstable angina =&lt; 6 months prior to treatment&#xD;
                  initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke =&lt; 6 months prior to treatment&#xD;
                  initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Myocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RENAL &amp; BLADDER: Other prior malignancy (exceptions: adequately treated basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or any other cancer in situ&#xD;
             currently in complete remission) =&lt; 2 years prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RENAL &amp; BLADDER: Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude&#xD;
             participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RENAL &amp; BLADDER: Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]); subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects&#xD;
             who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen&#xD;
             [antiHBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [antiHBs]) must be screened&#xD;
             using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#xD;
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels; those who are PCR positive will be excluded;&#xD;
             EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs&#xD;
             positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination,&#xD;
             do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR; seropositive for hepatitis C (except in&#xD;
             the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12&#xD;
             weeks after completion of antiviral therapy)&#xD;
