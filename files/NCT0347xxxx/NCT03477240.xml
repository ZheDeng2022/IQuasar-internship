      Cross-sectional Feasibility study on all consecutive patients of locally advanced cancer of&#xD;
      the cervix or vault treated entirely at Tata Memorial Centre with curative intent radiation&#xD;
      or chemoradiation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our institution registers on an average 670 cases of cancer cervix in a year and almost 75%&#xD;
      are treated with curative intent, therefore around 500 patients a year would be treated with&#xD;
      curative intent. Assuming that 75% of patients registered in a year would be receiving&#xD;
      treatment at our institute, 375 patients a year would be completing treatment, of whom the&#xD;
      investigator expect 80-85% ,i.e 300 patients to have a complete response. The list of&#xD;
      patients who have completed radio(chemotherapy) in 2015 &amp;2016 can be obtained from the&#xD;
      Radiation Oncology Department records. Patients identified for a follow up visit will be&#xD;
      telephonically contacted between one and two weeks before the planned clinic visit and verbal&#xD;
      telephonic consent taken prior to the nurse-led interview. This study should be able to&#xD;
      accrue 300 patients in 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of locally advanced cervical cancer or vault cancer who have been treated with&#xD;
      radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy and have a clinical complete response at&#xD;
      3 months post treatment and are within the first 2 years post treatment completion will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Patients will be screened from the list of patients treated in the radiotherapy&#xD;
      department over the last 2 years (2015-2016), available from the Radiation Oncology&#xD;
      Information System (ROIS). All patients with a diagnosis of cervical cancer or vault cancer&#xD;
      will be screened using the hospital Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to check stage of&#xD;
      disease, schedule of treatment received, response at 3 months post treatment and expected&#xD;
      date of next follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient fulfils all inclusion criteria, she will be called by the research nurse,&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 weeks prior to her expected date of follow up, for a preliminary&#xD;
      conversation and invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verbal telephonic consent is obtained, she will be interviewed by the clinical research&#xD;
      nurse using the format of the prepared proforma (Form A) regarding symptoms suggestive of&#xD;
      disease recurrence as well as treatment induced toxicity. At the end of the interview, the&#xD;
      research nurse records her impression of whether the patient has worrisome symptoms of&#xD;
      disease or not and has symptoms of treatment toxicity or not for which she should visit the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient reports to the OPD the next week for scheduled physical follow up, the nurse&#xD;
      completes the consenting process by taking a short written informed consent. The examining&#xD;
      physician then takes a complete history and in addition, performs a physical examination and&#xD;
      any investigations he/she deems necessary. Following this he/she notes down final impression&#xD;
      of disease status and toxicity which are taken as the gold standard (Form B). Each patient&#xD;
      will be interviewed only once during their follow up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition at the physical visit, information regarding the acceptability of nurse-led&#xD;
      telephonic follow-up to the patient and the financial impact of physical follow- up will be&#xD;
      collected using a structured format (Form C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participant drop-out/ Lost-to-follow up: Patients may withdraw their consent at any&#xD;
      point during the telephonic interview or the subsequent follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A patient who does not attend the scheduled follow up visit within 1-2 weeks of the&#xD;
           telephonic interview will be called a second time to remind her of the follow up&#xD;
           appointment and enquire about reasons for non-attendance in the clinic, which will be&#xD;
           recorded. If patient does not report to the clinic within the next 2 weeks, she will be&#xD;
           considered to have dropped out from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those patients in whom the interval between telephonic interview and the physician's&#xD;
           assessment is more than 4 weeks, will be considered drop outs and follow up telephone&#xD;
           call will go out to enquire about reasons for non-attendance in the clinic, which will&#xD;
           be recorded.&#xD;
