      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease. It is the leading cause of vision&#xD;
      loss in people over 55 in the U.S. Changes in the eye can make it difficult for they eye to&#xD;
      adjust to low light. This is known as dark adaptation. This is particularly significant in&#xD;
      people with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). Identifying and watching the early to middle stages&#xD;
      of AMD and changes in dark adaptation might help researchers learn to stop the disease before&#xD;
      it becomes severe. Taking vitamin A might help improve vision in people with RPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if taking 16,000 IU of vitamin A per day improves vision in people with RPD. Also to&#xD;
      improve understanding of RPD and associated dark adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 50 and older with RPD and normal liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and eye disease history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam: The pupil will be dilated with eye drops. Pictures will be taken of the retina and&#xD;
      the inside of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Including the screening visit, participants will have at least 5 visits. They will be about&#xD;
      once a month over 6 months and last 4-6 hours. Visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about eye problems in certain light&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dark adaptation protocol: Participants will sit at a machine in a dark room. They will look&#xD;
      into the machine and push a button when they see a light. This lasts 20-40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a vitamin A supplement by mouth once a day for 2 months. They will&#xD;
      record when they take the pills in a diary.&#xD;

      Objective:The objective of this study is to investigate the potential efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      vitamin A palmitate dosing in improving dark adaptation in participants with reticular&#xD;
      pseudodrusen (RPD) and abnormal dark adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The first cohort consists of seven participants with RPD who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. The second cohort will consist of five participants with RPD who meet&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria. Up to five additional participants may be accrued in the second&#xD;
      cohort to account for participants who withdraw from the study prior to receiving two months&#xD;
      of study supplementation for a reason unrelated to an adverse reaction. Up to 18 participants&#xD;
      may be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a pilot, uncontrolled, prospective, single center study to investigate the&#xD;
      potential efficacy and safety of vitamin A palmitate dosing in improving dark adaptation in&#xD;
      participants with RPD and abnormal dark adaptation. Participants in the first cohort were&#xD;
      instructed to take 16,000 IU of vitamin A palmitate daily for two months. Participants in the&#xD;
      second cohort will be instructed&#xD;
&#xD;
      to take 48, 000 IU of vitamin A palmitate daily for one month. Enrollment for Cohort 1 ended&#xD;
      on January 10, 2019. Participants in both cohorts will continue in the study for one month&#xD;
      after ending Vitamin A supplementation. Participants in Cohort 1 may enroll into Cohort 2 as&#xD;
      long as their last intake of vitamin A palmitate was greater than two months prior to their&#xD;
      enrollment into Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: For each cohort, the primary outcome is the measurement of dark adaptation&#xD;
      parameters (thresholds and kinetics) by the following: dark adaptation times as measured by&#xD;
      the AdaptDx comparing before and after vitamin A palmitate and dark adaptation parameters as&#xD;
      measured by the Medmont comparing before and after vitamin A palmitate supplementation. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be assessed at Month 2 in the first cohort and Month 1 in the second&#xD;
      cohort. For both cohorts, the secondary outcomes include changes in low luminance visual&#xD;
      acuity (LLVA) and changes in patient reported outcomes as measured by the low luminance&#xD;
&#xD;
      questionnaire (LLQ). The secondary outcomes also include measurement of dark adaptation&#xD;
      parameters (thresholds and kinetics) comparing baseline and one month after completing&#xD;
      supplementation (Month 3 in Cohort 1 and Month 2 in Cohort 2).&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - PARTICIPANT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is in another investigational study and actively receiving study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant is already taking vitamin A palmitate supplements greater than or equal to&#xD;
             8,000 IU.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has a history of vitamin A deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude&#xD;
             participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and&#xD;
             glycemic control).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant has a history of hepatitis or liver failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant has chronic gastrointestinal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participant will be excluded if the participant has serologic evidence of an active&#xD;
             hepatitis infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participant was in Cohort 1 and took his/her last dose of vitamin A palmitate less&#xD;
             than two months prior to enrolling in Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The eye must have a best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score better than or equal to&#xD;
             20/80 (i.e., equal to or better than 54 letters).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant must have presence of reticular pseudodrusen on multi-modal imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Abnormal dark adaptation, which is defined as having an AdaptDx test with a RIT of 16&#xD;
             minutes or more at the screening visit. This is at least one standard deviation&#xD;
             greater than the average normal RIT and includes room to account for variability in&#xD;
             testing. If at any point during current testing or under a previous NEI protocol, a&#xD;
             participant has exceeded the 40 minute test ceiling, they will have satisfied the&#xD;
             inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of advanced macular degeneration with central geographic atrophy or choroidal&#xD;
             neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An ocular condition is present (other than AMD) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., vein&#xD;
             occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma,&#xD;
             Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be&#xD;
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing&#xD;
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of major ocular surgery (e.g., cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any&#xD;
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum Garnet) capsulotomy performed within two months prior&#xD;
             to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CHOICE OF STUDY EYE IN CASES OF BILATERAL DISEASE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        If both eyes meet the study eye eligibility criteria described above, the following&#xD;
        criteria will be used to select the study eye for the purposes of this investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The eye with the better visual acuity will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If both eyes are equal acuity, the right eye will be arbitrarily chosen as the study&#xD;
             eye&#xD;
