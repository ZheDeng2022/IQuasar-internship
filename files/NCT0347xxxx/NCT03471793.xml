      A prospective, multicentre, observational study of all patients referred for endoscopic&#xD;
      resection of sessile colorectal polyps sized ≥20 mm conducted with intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopic polypectomy is well established as an effective way of reducing colorectal&#xD;
      cancer mortality. The majority of polyps detected and removed at colonoscopy are adenomas&#xD;
      &lt;10mm in size without advanced histology. These lesions have a low risk of progression to&#xD;
      malignancy and are relatively easily removed by standard snare polypectomy with low&#xD;
      complication rates. Polyps that are sessile or flat and greater than 20mm in size are found&#xD;
      in approximately 1% of all colonoscopies and are more difficult to manage. These lesions,&#xD;
      known as large sessile lesions (LSL), have a high rate of advanced histology. Traditionally&#xD;
      they have been managed by referral for open or laparoscopic surgery, which is definitive, but&#xD;
      invasive, costly and associated with a significant mortality risk in patients with advanced&#xD;
      age or comorbidities5. Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) has emerged in recent years as an&#xD;
      alternative to surgery that is now becoming the standard of care. It is an outpatient&#xD;
      procedure which is effective, safe and less costly than surgery when delivered at a tertiary&#xD;
      referral centre6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Australian Colonic Endoscopic Mucosal Resection study (ACE), comprises two multicentre&#xD;
      prospective observational studies which examined EMR of colonic LSL (Ethics approval No.s&#xD;
      HREC JH/TG 2008/9/6.1(2858) and HREC/13/WMEAD/233 (3778)). The project now has an extensive&#xD;
      dataset from leading colonic endoscopic resection centres in Australia on more than 2000&#xD;
      lesions resected over 4 years since September 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies have been successful in addressing several aspects of the resection of LSL,&#xD;
      resulting in several high profile papers in internationally recognised journals. The&#xD;
      collection of this data has produced robust information on the efficacy of the procedure4,&#xD;
      recurrence rates, bleeding complications and mortality and costs when compared to surgery.&#xD;
      Single centre analysis of the ACE dataset at Westmead has also allowed insights into how to&#xD;
      refine the procedure to improve outcomes. The target sign is now a recognised indication for&#xD;
      the placement of clips to prevent perforation, CO2 insufflation for EMR has been shown to be&#xD;
      superior to air insufflation and succinylated gelatin (Gelofusine®) has been shown to be&#xD;
      superior to normal saline as a submucosal lifting agent. Assessment and management strategies&#xD;
      for bleeding and deep mural injury or perforation have been derived from analysis of the&#xD;
      data. Snare tip soft coagulation of the resection margin post-EMR has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      recurrence in a randomised controlled trial. Several ACE study papers have been incorporated&#xD;
      into review papers and international guidelines for the safe and effective performance of&#xD;
      EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There remain a number of unanswered questions regarding the endoscopic resection of large&#xD;
      sessile lesions and a new study incorporating a greater number of endoscopy units around&#xD;
      Australia will allow these to be addressed as well as answer questions on the clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness of the technique. Enhancing the prediction of submucosal invasive cancer,&#xD;
      advanced lesion classification, validation of the assessment of deep injury, treatment of&#xD;
      lesion margins post resection to reduce recurrence, prevention and prophylaxis of bleeding,&#xD;
      and subtype analyses of the different histological groups of colonic lesions will be&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
