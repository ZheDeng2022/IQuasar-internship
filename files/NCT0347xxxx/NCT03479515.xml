  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposal is to evaluate the ability of ultrasound to predict the&#xD;
      body composition of toddlers in the outpatient clinical setting and to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between body composition and neurodevelopment.&#xD;

      The investigators will address the hypothesis in the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Validate ultrasound as a method to measure whole body fat mass and fat-free&#xD;
      mass in toddlers. Body composition will be assessed using ultrasound measurements and the&#xD;
      validated method of air displacement plethysmography (ADP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of a handheld Force-Measuring Ultrasound Probe on intra-&#xD;
      and inter-observer variability in ultrasound measurements. A device which measures the force&#xD;
      applied to the ultrasound probe will be used to obtain measurements of muscle and adipose&#xD;
      tissue thickness (biceps, abdomen, and quadriceps) in toddlers.&#xD;

    <description>Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 3 and 4 years of age will be used to measure neurodevelopmental status for toddlers 3, 4, or 5 years of age. Quotient and Composite scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Subtest scaled scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3.</description>
