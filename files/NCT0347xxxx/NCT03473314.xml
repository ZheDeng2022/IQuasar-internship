  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open labeled Study (NCT03331445) is demonstrating encouraging safety and efficacy results&#xD;
      for most subjects receiving 160ppm nitric oxide gas (gNO) for treatment of non-tuberculous&#xD;
      mycobacteria (NTM) over a 15 day treatment regimen. In one subject, who had a reduction in&#xD;
      sputum culture concentration of Bacterium bolletii from plus 3 to plus 1 corresponding to a&#xD;
      2-3 log10 cfu/gm reduction during the treatment, the one-week post treatment follow-up sputum&#xD;
      culture had increased to plus 2. It is hypothesized that a longer treatment period may be&#xD;
      necessary to fully eradicate NTM from the sputum culture in chronic lung disease. This study&#xD;
      will extend the period of gNO exposure for a prolonged period of time (3 months) to attempt&#xD;
      to fully eradicate the NTM in this single subject. This study will transition from the&#xD;
      medical clinic to supervised delivery in the patient's home environment.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: Determine the efficacy of prolonged delivery of inhaled nitric oxide to&#xD;
      treat an adult patient with pulmonary NTM Primary Endpoint: Eradication of NTM growth in&#xD;
      sputum cultures. Efficacy will be assessed by the antimicrobial effect of inhaled NO on the&#xD;
      density of NTM species and other microorganisms in the sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • as confirmed by measurement of semi-quantitative culture sputum growth which has been&#xD;
      verified with serial dilution technique on Day 7, 14, 21 and every 21 days thereafter for 90&#xD;
      days as compared to pre-treatment baseline sputum culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s): Determine the safety &amp; efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
           • as evaluated by the number of unanticipated adverse events during home delivery in&#xD;
           clinical labs (hematology, coagulation, and serum chemistries); in vitals; in inspired&#xD;
           concentration of NO, O2 and NO2 delivered to subject and; in methemoglobin and oxygen&#xD;
           saturation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  as determined by improvement in lung function as measured by spirometry, endurance&#xD;
                as measured by six minute walk-test and quality of life as determined by&#xD;
                self-reporting quality of life questionnaire (CFQ-R) on Day 7, 14, 21 and every 21&#xD;
                days thereafter for 90 days as compared to pre-treatment baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  as assessed by recurrence of NTM in sputum as confirmed by measurement of&#xD;
                semi-quantitative culture sputum growth on Day 30 and 60 post treatment.&#xD;
