  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the analgesic benefit of a traditional landmark-guided GON block with&#xD;
      the ultrasound-guided approach over a four week period in patients with occipital neuralgia&#xD;
      or cervicogenic headache.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: A novel ultrasound-guided greater occipital nerve (GON) block at the level of C2&#xD;
      will result in significantly lower pain scores after 4 weeks when compared with a traditional&#xD;
      landmark-guided approach at the superior nuchal line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater occipital nerve (GON) has been implicated in several conditions that prompt&#xD;
      referral to pain medicine specialists, including occipital neuralgia and cervicogenic&#xD;
      headache. According to the International Headache Society, a local anesthetic block of the&#xD;
      GON can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of occipital neuralgia. Many practitioners perform&#xD;
      GON injections using a conventional approach, relying solely on superficial bone-based&#xD;
      anatomic landmarks to infiltrate local anesthetic and corticosteroid around the nerve at the&#xD;
      level of the superior nuchal line. The ambiguity of these injections poses a risk of&#xD;
      anesthetizing adjacent structures or injecting into vessels, such as the occipital artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to mitigate these risks and improve the efficacy of GON injections, ultrasound&#xD;
      has been increasingly utilized. Multiple studies have demonstrated successful&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided GON blockade at the superior nuchal line and improvement in pain scores&#xD;
      compared to non-guided injections. The investigators' preliminary data confirms the&#xD;
      feasibility, efficacy, and safety of an ultrasound-guided GON block technique at the level of&#xD;
      C2, but it is not yet known whether this technique provides greater pain relief and&#xD;
      functional outcomes compared to traditional injections.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in number of patients with medication overuse</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will be provided a headache journal to record the number of days they have been using each of their analgesic medications. Medication overuse will be defined as the use of acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs &gt; 14 days a month, triptan, ergotamine, or combination-analgesic medications (e.g.,caffeine containing) medications &gt;9 days a month, and opioid or butalbital containing medications &gt;5 days a month.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of headache days per month</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of headache days per month will be obtained at baseline prior to injection in the pain clinic and at 4 weeks post-injection via telephone.</description>

    <measure>Change in Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HIT-6 show the effect that headaches have on normal daily life and the subject's ability to function. It consists of 6 questions; possible responses being never (6 points each), rarely (8 points each), sometimes (10 points each), very often (11 points each), and always (13 points each). The total score ranges from 36 (little to no impact) to 78 (very severe impact).</description>
