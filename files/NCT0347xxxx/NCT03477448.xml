  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Warts are common viral infections on the skin and are prevalent worldwide. Warts are&#xD;
           caused by the human Papilloma virus (HPV), which has more than 100 strains; some of them&#xD;
           are known to be premalignant. Although warts can appear at any age, they are more common&#xD;
           in children and adolescents. The prognosis of warts cannot be predicted. In some&#xD;
           patients they may spontaneously disappear, whereas others show persistence and&#xD;
           progression with spreading to other body sites, leading to physical and emotional&#xD;
           distress to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors that increase the risk include use of public showers, working with meat, eczema,&#xD;
           and a low immune system . The virus is believed to enter the body through skin that has&#xD;
           been damaged slightly . A number of types exist including: common warts, plantar warts,&#xD;
           filiform warts, and genital warts . Genital warts are often sexually transmitted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Selection of the most appropriate means of treatment is usually difficult because of the&#xD;
           availability of various therapeutic lines and also due to the variability in the immune&#xD;
           status of the patients for treatment of warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are on two main therapeutic options: the first is the conventional destructive and&#xD;
           aggressive method, which includes treatment with chemical cautery, cryo- therapy,&#xD;
           electro cauterization, surgical excision, and laser ablation . This method depends on&#xD;
           destruction of the area of epidermis infected with the virus. The recurrence rates after&#xD;
           these therapy modalities maybe high. The second is the immunotherapy, which is based on&#xD;
           the activation of the immune system to deal with the virus and suppress its activity.&#xD;
           Such therapy may be applied either topically or through intra- lesional injection or&#xD;
           through systemic administration .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-lesional immunotherapy utilizes the ability of the immune system to mount a&#xD;
           delayed-type hypersensitivity response to various antigens and also the wart tissue.&#xD;
           This therapy has been found to be associated with the production of Th1 cytokines that&#xD;
           activate cytotoxic and natural killer cells to eradicate HPV infection. This clears not&#xD;
           only the local warts but also distant warts, unlike traditional wart therapies .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many authors have used different immunotherapeutic agents for intralesional injection.&#xD;
           These include Candida antigen, mumps antigen, trichophytin skin test antigen, BCG&#xD;
           vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, Mycobacterium w (Mw) vaccine, and&#xD;
           IFN-α and IFN-γ injectio).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleomycin, an antibiotic derived from Streptomyces verticillus, has an antitumor,&#xD;
           antibacterial, and antiviral activity that may be related to its ability to bind with&#xD;
           DNA, causing bleomycin strand scission and elimination of pyrimidine and purine bases.&#xD;
           The bleomycin hydrolase enzyme, which is known to inactivate bleomycin, is normally&#xD;
           found in all body tissues but is present in very small amounts in skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-lesional bleomycin injection (IBI) has been used for the treatment of warts.&#xD;
           Numerous reports have been published on the use of intra-lesional bleomycin for the&#xD;
           treatment of recalcitrant warts with cure rates ranging from 14 to 99%. It was found to&#xD;
           be very effective in treating warts particularly in periungual and palmoplantar areas .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No systemic side effects have been observed. However, local signs such as necrosis,&#xD;
           pain, scaring, pigment change, Raynaud's phenomenon, and nail dystrophy may occur in&#xD;
           some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purified protein derivative (PPD) is an extract of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is&#xD;
           used for testing exposure to tuberculin protein, either from a previous vaccination or&#xD;
           from the environment. It contains live, attenuated Mycobacterium bovis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using this protein derivative for immunotherapy of warts is important for two major&#xD;
           aspects. First, because the obligatory immunization program in many developing countries&#xD;
           - with high prevalence of wart in many of them - includes BCG vaccination. PPD has a&#xD;
           high prevalence of immunity in the general population. Second, although immunotherapy is&#xD;
           generally an inexpensive method of treatment in wart patients, PPD, among conventionally&#xD;
           used antigens, is the cheapest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL purified protein derivative (PPD) injection is an acceptable and safe modality in the&#xD;
           treatment of warts with complete response in 75% of patients.&#xD;
