      The proposed study will establish a newly-identified signaling pathway regulating both&#xD;
      autophagy and apoptosis in human satellite cells. These findings will allow for novel&#xD;
      pharmacological targets in satellite cells to return regenerative capacity to elderly&#xD;
      individuals. Up to 80 adults, 21 years of age and greater, will undergo a consent visit&#xD;
      followed by three blood draws and muscle biopsy visits- baseline (pre), after the first&#xD;
      exercise bout (post-acute), and after the 12 week training program (post-chronic). Blood will&#xD;
      be obtained and tested for inflammatory (IL-6/TNF/IL-1) and endocrine markers&#xD;
      (Testosterone/Estrogen/Thyroid hormone). As part of the intervention, participants will&#xD;
      undergo moderate intensity treadmill exercise three times per week for 10-12 weeks or serve&#xD;
      as sedentary controls. Muscle stem cell function will be compared across age groups at each&#xD;
      time point using a One Way ANOVA or t test for specific comparisons. An alternative analysis&#xD;
      will be a longitudinal design following muscle stem cell function from each individual before&#xD;
      and after exercise training. This analysis will be performed with repeated measure ANOVAs.&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 statistical software. Significance will be&#xD;
      accepted as p&lt;.05. Thigh Muscle biopsies may result in momentary pain and discomfort, burning&#xD;
      or bleeding, numbness, and rarely fainting or infection. The incision site may leave a scar&#xD;
      and muscle soreness may be present up to ten days after the biopsy. While the local numbing&#xD;
      medicine xylocaine is almost entirely free from allergic properties (such as causing hives),&#xD;
      an allergic reaction is possible, and the participant will not be given xylocaine if they&#xD;
      have a history of such a reaction. The xylocaine will be given by a small injection into the&#xD;
      skin at the site of the muscle biopsy. Risks associated with a standard blood draw include&#xD;
      momentary discomfort and/or bruising. In addition, there is a minimal risk of infection,&#xD;
      excess bleeding, clotting, and fainting. An exercise program may result in muscle, bone&#xD;
      and/or joint soreness, discomfort and/or injury. All collected data will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked file to be accessed only by Dr. White and his study staff. Study records that identify&#xD;
      subjects will be kept confidential as required by law.&#xD;
