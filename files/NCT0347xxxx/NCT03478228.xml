  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether individuals with fall-related wrist fractures&#xD;
      have impaired posterior control, reduced proprioception in their lower limbs and/or&#xD;
      vestibular asymmetry compared with those who have not fallen and sustained a fracture.&#xD;
      Secondly to investigate the effects of a new balance training method, directed at the sensory&#xD;
      systems and training of fall-preventive movements on postural control and how it impacts the&#xD;
      function of the sensory systems. Postural instability falls and fractures form one of the&#xD;
      major problems associated with ageing. An association of vestibular- asymmetry with falls and&#xD;
      fractures has been found and reduced vibration sensation in the lower limbs has been&#xD;
      connected with imbalance. Wrist fractures are often precursor to the more serious hip&#xD;
      fractures, which often result in decreased quality of life, even death and are costly for the&#xD;
      society. Subjects will be individuals 50-75 years of age having sustained a fall-related&#xD;
      wrist fracture. Measurements of sensory functions, postural control and functional ability&#xD;
      will be conducted before and after balance training. Confidence in daily activities and&#xD;
      self-perceived dizziness handicap will be obtained with questionnaires. The same evaluations&#xD;
      will be performed on age and gender matched individuals without previous history of&#xD;
      fall-related wrist fractures. This research might reveal the presence and frequency of&#xD;
      vestibular asymmetry or/and other age related degenerative changes in the sensory systems,&#xD;
      which decrease stability and increase the risk of falls and fractures. It could show&#xD;
      preventive effects of specific balance training on fall risk, and thus increase quality of&#xD;
      life of the individuals, improve healthcare services and decrease costs associated with falls&#xD;
      and fractures.&#xD;
